txt // to see ; Welsh llug and Gaelic lews , light . " But with the necessary vocable changes all these terms are the Etymon , as seen most closely in lumen and sews . We see the analogy with Dimmer , Alulim , Lugal , Ilu , Lakhme , especially=light : in Lux in Tenebris we have Lahame in Tiamat of the Babylonian Creation . Jahweh , Tiamat . Compare also the words gleam , glimmer , glamour , glare , glimpse , glow , gloom , dim ? so-called Teutonic words , and limpid ( whence lymph ) , shimmer , shine ( and polish as a reverse ) , Anglo Saxon scimrian , Icelandic skimi . Our word light is surely of our pre-historic ancestors . SoN , MOON , STARS . The Sumerian sun-god 's worship centred at Sippara , under the priest-king Enmeduranki ( Enoch ) . Sabitu the goddess was " guardian of the entrance to the sea , " and in the epic she says to Gilgamesh , the Babylonian Flood hero , " Shamash the mighty has crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hebrew word for sun is Shemesh , and the Hebrew psalm says : The heavens declare the glory of Jahweh : And the firmament sheweth his handiwork . Day unto day uttereth speech , And night unto night sheweth knowledge . ( There is no speech nor language Their voice is not heard . ) Their line ( voice ) is gone out through all the earth , And their words to the end of the world . in them ( the heavens ) hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ( Shemesh ) , Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , And rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race . His going forth is from the end of the heaven , And his circuit unto the ends of it : And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof . " This is seen to be the same concept as the Sumerian , and the same name for the sun . The third verse commentators describe as a gloss to guard aganst the idea that the heavenly bodies literally speak ( marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are chamrnah and cheres , denoting great heat , as shemesh denotes great brilliancy , and these are seen to be the Etymon ; compare shamayim , tehom , chabbah , etc . The above psalm I suggest is originally Sumerian or Babylonian , with the gloss as Hebrew . The Egyptian Harmachis " rising sun " is the same . Now , consider Shamash as the Etymon and our word sun as simply a contraction or decay of it , of Shamash , Dimmer or Tiamat , with s=t , un=m . The Anglo Saxon form of sun was sunne , Gothic sunna , and is compared with Latin Sol ( French Soleil ) , and Sanskrit su-rya , literally " that which begets , " with Aryan root su . Another Sanskrit sun term is ravi , which spews the Etymon . Greek helios also . Egyptian Ra and Horus ? they are all one . The ancients , Sumerians , Egyptians , Mexicans , Incas , did not necessarily worship the sun materially but the power behind it . From sun conies south , the dictionary says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haf , Zend hama , Sanskrit sama , a year . Thus the Etymon . MOON . This gentle but melancholy orb is regarded as the first time-measurer , the month . Anglo Saxon mona , Greek mene , Sanskrit ma , to measure . The dictionary does not associate the Latin luna , moon , from lumen , light , but here we have the etymon at once and our moon has either lost its initial t , or is a reverse of the Etymon , or part of the anagram . The Sanskrit ma-ti , " he measures , " and the word time , I compare in this connexion : ( in the Scandinavian Edda moon as male and sun as female were son and daughter of Mundilford ) ; also Greek nionas , monad , alone or unity . STAR . Given from root of English strew , Sanskrit stri to strew , or tara , sprinkler , in the sense of scattering light . But a star may seem to sprinkle light ( or twinkle ) , but surely the name E // would not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word is thus but a contraction of shamash and the etymon ; compare also planet . Anglo Saxon steorra , Latin stella and antrum , Welsh and Cornish scren and steren ; compare Siderus also . The Sumerian astrologers ' names for the stars will be seen to reflect the etymon . TIME . How did the Ancients derive their concept of time ? that awful and intangible abstraction ; as of movement , past , present , future , an " ever rolling stream " ? The motion of the planets and of shamash above and of the Great River at the feet of the soothsayers or astronomers , would have given it ; and Babylonian or Sumerian astrology was the father of science , and its practises and purpose were religious . The water , Tiam , was a moving Thing . There was a god Chronos , ( he who warned the Babylonian Noah Xisuthrus of the Deluge , Abubu ) : and the name is the etymon , if we adjust the vocables . In our word " time " we have a pure example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is tima. , given by philologists as akin to tide ( compare Tutu ) and these have been connected with the Aryan mythology of Aditi . The German word zeit is seen to be a harsh contraction of the etymon , like Gott . The Latin is teinpus , the Greek chronos ? showing the characteristic Greek dipthong-labial decay . The Aryan Aditi and Sarama were the names of the Dawn , progenitors of all , ( of the Rig-Veda ) , from which sky , earth , mother , father , gods , tribes and all else came ; the Dawn-mother being also Yamash or " Twin-mother , " bearing Yaman the bi-sexual twins , the first human pair , etc . All this , ( though ethnologists do not appear to have seen beyond the Aryan concept of origin ) I shew is simply the Tiamat origin and system . The Saros was the cycle of eighteen year eclipses , in Babylonian numeration the number 3,600 , or 1 // 60 x 60 . The tremendous periods assigned to the past by the cuneiform tablets has been noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is ancient Greek and perhaps still earlier . ( In the days of our youth some of us used to discuss this last matter , with the " Curvature of space , " and other mathematical Incongruities and the concept that things were relative : these things seem recently to have been absorbed as something new by a big Teutonic mare's-nest called Relativity ? to which some of our English thinkers whose " spiritual home " is near the German borderland have hastened to bow down ! ) The words past , present , future , hour , day , morning , evening , year , minute , second have all their interesting attributes in the Etymon connexion . Year , as Teutonic , or possibly from the Latin eo , ire , go , I shew is , with y=t or h the Etymon H(Ea) , Tiam and so a Shamash contraction , the sun cycle . Similarly with the other words . As to past , present , future , the first is given from Latin passus , a step ; the second from pre , before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " absent " ) , and the third from futurus , of sum , fui , to be . But what are these from originally ? It involves the Etymon concept , of the immanent deity spot or habitat on the Gu-aba , and it is seen that the words past , present , future embody ab and ed , so the idea of time is here relative to the spot or place , which furnishes the origin-concept of language . PLACE : the concept of time I shew is bound up with place or space , as with movement , which is change of place . Just as the concept of time naturally requires something beyond itself as a standard of reference in order that the concept may exist so does the concept of space require a reference to a " non-space . " The concept of Being requires for its existence a reference to " something // that always existed , " or eternal being . Material being involves space plus time . We speak of an event " taking place " or " coming to pass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and thus at once arises " behaviour . " This word embodies " be " and " have , " which embodies the etymon ; have=Hubur or Tiam . I have shown that the quality of things derives from their relation to a standard or deity-concept set up in the gu-aba , or first " man-habitat " of the river-bank with the deity-idea within it . It will be found that all " parts of speech " in grammar , nouns , verbs , adjectives , pronouns , prepositions , etc. , have their origin in this concept , and all words indicative of place , stand , move , run , walk , etc. ; also ground=gu-ab-ed . See temple , town , etc. , later . All prepositions , prefixes , suffixes , ? to , from , with , at , by , in , sub , ad , am , etc. , etc . That prepositions govern the accusative ( as deum , etc. ) results on this originconcept . Space , sphere , globe , etc. , all shew the origin . Compare Stem=stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphaira a sphere , but here is the Etymon in both terms ; as also . in thermos , heat . Our word heat , h=t , ea=m is ( H ) Ea and the etymon , but the dictionary does not derive it from thermos . Compare Sanskrit tapuz , fire ( whence topaz ) , and phaos , light , also meteor , and our English word weather , which the dictionary gives as Anglo Saxon , etc. ; also wind , air , ether . What is " heat " ? It is believed to be a certain motion or vibration of ultimate molecules . Our Paleolithic forefathers , if it be true that ' the glacial period overtook them in " Britain , " when tropical animals lived there along with them , certainly experienced " weather changes , " and to-day we might grumble less in this respect . The word CLIMATE is given from Greek clio , to lean , as the slope from the Equator to the Pole : but it is Tiam . As to WIND , this is // given with Anglo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sanskrit va , to blow . But I suggest the name of the blower would come first , and so to the Etymon . Pneumatic is from Greek pneumos , breath , spirit : see pneumos and its vital concept . It was Iblerodach 's winds that destroyed Tiamat . The Inca word for wind was guayra ( pro . gwyra , and one well remembers the force of the wind at La Guayra , one of the hottest seaports , on the Caribbean ) : also sirnoon , barmattan , sirocco , kauisin , Arabic and other words all spew the Etymon . Compare storm . AIR is simply a contraction . Then the RAIN : the Sumerians called their rainy months ( DecemberJanuary ) ab-ba-ud-du , or " coming from the sea . " This is interesting in the present connexion , for the term is seen to be a reduplicate reverse of ab and ed , forming Tiamat , as I have shewn elsewhere . Our word rain is simply a contraction of the etymon , r=t ( as in Rhine ) , compare ain , spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rain gods were important deities with the ancients , from " China to Peru . " THUNDER and LIanTPNING . Thunder is given from Teutonic , and Latin tonare , to sound , Persian tunder , and Greek stonos groaning , compare thor . But the word is clearly associated with Dimmud and Tiamat , as of a celestial voice , and the noise of thunder seems almost to embody the primary vocables : compare the thunder on Horeb , and the voice of Yahweh . MATTER : This is the elemental stuff or substance of which the universe is made . The philologist gives the word from and with French and Latin materia , with Aryan root Ma and Sanskrit ma " to measure . " But it is simply the primeval Sumerian etymon cosmic word as in " water " Mat-taw , Mat Tamtm , Tiamat , the land-water-element-deity concept . Loss of initial t from Dimmer . The word element is curious ; the philologist gives // it from Latin elementum , " a first or fundamental principle , " translating the Greek word stoexos , ( whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row " whose signification is unknown ; and alternately from Latin alimentum , nourishment ; and again as representing 1-rn-n , the first three letters of the second part of the alphabet . But the word is seen to be the etymon , with oe as the labial decay , just as " element " with l=d is the word Dimmer at once , the " first principle . " As to the idea of a " row " which has been Jere a philological puzzle , compare the concept later given here of a sacred enclosure or palisade on the Gu-aba or river bank habitat , which also gives the origin of the name and concept of Stoic ? which word is given from the Athenian porch . ( Compare stoke or stake , the generic town word ) . ATOM . This word takes us to the metaphysical beginning . it is given from the Latin and Greek atmos , that which is indivisible , from Greek a , not , and temno to cut . But this far-reaching temno or temsi word , which as shewn is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etymon and is practically the word itself , Dimmer and Tiamat , from which the Greeks must have taken it : the concept of cutting , severance or dividing which must have come originally , as remarked , from regarding the horizon line of sea and sky and the dome or vault of heaven at Eridu on the Persian Gulf , ( as also the cutting of the land by the River ) became expressed by the Babylonian concept of cutting the body of the chaos-dragon , Tiamat . But why have philologists not searched beyond the Greek philosophy for the origin of " Atom " ? The dictionary gives it as a derivation from tome , a volume , which word is given an Aryan root tan or tarn . The Greeks in 400 B.C. taught the concept of matter as infinitely divisible and continuous ; also that matter was not indefinitely divisible , but // formed of separate , eternal particles , which was a concept of Indian philosophy in the Twelfth Century B.C. To-day science has divided the atom : molecules ; an orbital electron system ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is infinite . EARTH , HEAVEN . The dictionary gives the word Earth as " Anglo Saxon eorthe , Gothic airtha , Icelandic jorth , German erds , perhaps allied to Greek ora and Sanskrit ira , earth . " But I offer it as the Etymon ; it is one of our English " ea " words and like the name Ea , which as aspirated was Hea forms the first syllable of our words Earth and Heaven . But this last is given by the philologist as merely " Old English heafon , with a possible connexion with ' heave ' but having no connexion with the German himnel and of unknown ultimate origin . " That is all the imagination they had ! Earth has thus lost the initial h or t , and the Hebrew erets or eres ( in the Genesis Creation account ) must be the same and in similar case , whilst the Latin terra has retained the t . The Hebrew Shamayim , of the Creation account has also retained the sh=t ( it is seen to be a reduplicate word ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tiamat , etc . The Hebrew erets is used for the earth structurally or as a planet , whilst the word adamah denotes its material ( as in Adam , etc. ) in Genesis . The Scandinavian word supplies the initial j . The Latin coelum is seen to be the same word heaven . ( The Hebrews thought of the earth as a vast circular disc , unsupported , with the firmament above and the sun revolving around , with Hell beneath , and , the Ancients generally conceived of the " encompassing ocean-stream . " ( Whether our own modern concept of the cosmic structure and planetary movements is final the future will shew ) . The root ar in many // languages , the Babylonian gu , ur , the Greek ge , earth , Sanskrit mahi land , ( which of course I give from Sumerian mat , ? as also Irish magh and maes , land and plain , our word meadow , the Sanskrit arya ? whence the famous word " Aryan , " ? the Russian zemlia , earth , ( and zemstov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground itself as gu-ab-ed , etc. , are all one ; as is the word world , given as Anglo Saxon wer a man , Latin vir . " Earth " and " mother " and " water " and " world " and " rnundo " and " heaven " are all one in the Etymon . So too the word " home " ? to which our English peasant adds the w , whoam . The Sumerian word for heaven was E-di-aba and so for temple . Paradise is given from Paradeisos , a garden or pleasure ground ( and " yard " is from the same ) a word from Old Persian . Consider our word garden , which the dictionary gives as from French and Teutonic , as gu-edin or Eden , so the Garden of Eden is the Eden of Eden : and Eden=Eridu , which anciently was also Paradise . Compare later tam , the sacred enclosure , as temple , town , etc . Finally I give the word " earth " =Eridu ; the earth was pictured as a round or elliptical island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word life , live , etymologists take only to Anglo Saxon , Teutonic , etc. , as lieber , with base lib . But it could not stop there . Compare the Latin vivans , Greek bios , Sanskrit jiva , the Aryan uban , the Egyptian yehia , all sheaving the etymon , 1=t v=m . Progenitor , begin , fabricate , make , create , and the Hebrew creation word bara or vara , to create , and Sumerian bani and other forms , and even the Maori ora . DEATH is given as only from Teutonic ; Gothic diwan , Anglo Saxon touwen , German tod . But the etymon is seen at once . Compare the Greek thanatus : Latin , mortis and tetum , names for the King of Terrors , also the Sumerian Ugga ; and in // the word death I shew Ea , as in Earth , Heaven , Water , etc. ; and so we have nu Dimmud again . Sou . The dictionary gives this as only a Teutonic word : Anglo Saxon , sawel ; Danish , sjael ; Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an age . But with s , 1 , =t ou=m we have the etymon . Compare Latin alma , and the Greek thymos , soul , which are the etymon at once also anima and coelum . SLEEP . It would have been thought that the philologist would sec the connexion between sleep , slumber and the Latin somnus , but the dictionary ' gives it merely as Anglo Saxon and Teutonic . DEVIL . Just as the concepts of good and of evil come from one Etymon source or word , so do those of deity and devil ; an inevitable condition , for good and evil are inextricably interwoven in all concepts of origin ? the world 's greatest mystery . The Devil , we are told , was once an inhabitant of heaven , whence he fell : and at length , vanquished and humbled , he may yet return . The dictionary gives Anglo Saxon deoful , Latin and Greek diabolus , the accuser , " throw across , " slander , traduce . Satan is Hebrew " adversary . " He is the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Babylonian Etymon , as is devil , by vocable adjustment . Beelzebub seems to have been a contemptuous designation of Satan ; its origin is given as uncertain , or from the Hebrew zebu ' , a dwelling , or " lord of flies " ; and this last must refer to the Babylonian concept , where at " Noah 's ' sacrifice it was : said the gods came around the incense " like flies . " Perhaps this term was originally a philological error , and " spirits " were meant . The Melek Taus of the Iranian devilworshipper tribe to-day with their sheitan seems to reflect Marduk-Tauthe , or Tiamat . Demon , etc . FIRE . The Anglo Saxon is fyr , German feuer , cognate with Greek pur , Sanskrit pu , to purify . // But the word would be the Etymon , compare Latin cremare , to burn . The Sumerian fire-god was Gib-il , which was also written as its own reverse , or Bil-gi . In Stone Age graves a piece of pyrites and flint was buried , used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanskrit jigharmi , to burn , gharmas , heat ; Gothic varmja , Latin ignis , Zendatharvan . Spanish lnmbre . How did man at first obtain fire ? It does not exist in nature , except in a volcano or lightening : possibly from the contact of pyrites and flint or quartz ? unless it was " provided " in some way from the cosmos for him originally . Prometheus stole it from heaven , in the epic myth , for man , and suffered for his beneficent act . Our word fire is seen to be part of the Etymon ; compare such words as pyre , pyramid , sapphire , etc . We now come to more directly human matters . Mother , Father : In considering these transcend-ant words we are taken back to the mysteries of sex creation , and to the asexual and bi-sexual attributes of deity as seen in all cosmogonies . The dictionary gives Mother as Anglo Saxon moder , with Teutonic and Scandinavian forms , German mutter ; also Irish and Gaelic mathair ; Greek and Latin , mater ; Sanskrit mata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffix - tar of the agent : Ma originally meaning " to measure , " origin uncertain , probably " manager of a household . " But why should this most fundamental word derive from " measure " or " household manager " ? The word ( and all its cognates ) is at once seen to be the etymon , the first " mother of the gods , " mummu Tiamati , the original progenitor , from Dimmer . The Egyptian is Mat ( and the great goddess Mut ) ; Persian Mader ; Chinese , Mu ; Peruvian ( Inca ) Mama ? which word is alike in all languages ; Sumerian Mummu and Hubur . Compare the Hebrew Chabbah or Eve . Mother and Father are // complexes of the Etymon . The Sumerian Aba and Hebrew Abba are seen to be of anagram form ? Abba , father . It may be that the th represents the labial and the words would be mubber , mummur , Faber , baber , which takes us to the Sumerian Mummu . Mother has lost the initial t , Dimmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch vader ; Icelandic fathir ; Gothic fadar ; German vater , etc . ; Latin and Greek pater , Persian padar , Sanskrit pitri ; probably from a root pa , to feed . " But why " feed . " when the word is clearly the generative etymon ? ( Of course ma-ma is to suckle ) . The Babylonian Abba , father , embodies the cuneiform sign for water and the generative principle ( semen ) in the inscriptions ; the Hebrew is Abba . We see the primary vocable or labial . Aryan pa , Coptic gpo , Egyptian pa , also tefen , atef , tefi , etc. ( compare Pharoah ) ; Hindu , bap ; Lravidian , appam ( the " water-shoot " ) ; Old Prussian taevs ; Sanskrit tata ; Latin and Gothic , atta ; Gaelic athair this is given by the philologist as the Celtic form of the Latin pater , with loss of initial t ) ; Armenian , hayr ; ( Chinese , fu ; Peruvian and Mexican , Taita ; Polynesian , etc . Consider our word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was also Dudu ) which I have given as a contraction of Tiamati Ti(ama) ti . Tat or Tad is Welsh for Dad or father ( compare David ) ; Irish , Daid ; Breton , Tat , etc. ; and if we go among the Inca Indians of Peru they will out of respect call us Taita , a familiar word for father or chief . Compare also Tutankhamen ; and we find many tutu names , all over the world , as of " tutelary " deities ; also what are termed Toot-hills . ( Compare Tooting Bee , Tothill , etc . ) . Lastly , compare Adam . MAN , WOMAN . The Sumerian and Babylonian names for Man were Adama , Adapa , Etana , Ea-bani , also Amelu , and these are seen to be one with the Genesis Adam ; also Babylonian mutu , // man ( mu , woman ) ; the Hebrew is gebor , man ; and for Eve Hever , Habbah , Chabbah , which are all seen to be forms of the Etymon , and anagrams  --  Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mother of all living " ( the same Hebrew root as Hawah , Eyeh , etc. ) , and also Isha , woman , the feminine form of Ish , man , which he called himself ? these in the two Genesis creation accounts . It is the Tiam-Apsu , TammuzIshtar complex . Etymologists derive " Adam " from the Hebrew Adamah , the ground : and apply the name as to a species , not a person . But in the Etymon it is all one . Adam 's first wife , in Rabbinical literature was Lillith . But this is the Ilu form of the Sumerian anagram name , it is here seen . Adam = I4 ; a ( A ) Dimmer . Eridu , the seat of Ea or Nu Dimmud and Sippar of Enoch , both claim in Sumerian theology to be the first birthplace of man , Adapa . The fall of Man was in this wise : Adapa , fishing at Eridu in the Persian Gulf had broken the wings of the South Wind and was therefore summoned before the god of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink while he was there ; unfortunately he followed the advice and refused food ? which would have made him and his descendants immortal . In the Book of Enoch it states that Man 's name was derived from the initials of the four quarters of the globe , North , South , East , West , ( in Greek ) and commentators have pointed out that this could not be so in Semitic . Perhaps it might be so through the Etymon . The dictionary gives " man " and its cognate Teutonic forms , Latin mas , a male ; Sanskrit manu , a thinker , from mantis , mind . It does not associate the Latin homo , which gives us the words human , homme , hombre , ( Spanish ) etc. , but all these are seen to be the Etymon , as also the Greek anthropos , also vir , whilst the Anglo Saxon word // guma shews it in full form , as the Hebrew gebor , the Sumerian gubur ( Hubur ) , gu-aba , etc . Compare also Persian gayomard , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , Chinese jin , gin , nyin , zang , nang , nying , zhen , all meaning man . The Hebrew gebor was also Nimrod and gibborian , giants . These words , together with the Biblical zamzummin whose origin is so far unknown , is seen to he the Etymon . The Etymon man-name we may follow in all lands ; thus Arab , Berber , Copt , Kaffir , Bantu , Bedawin , Hebrew , Gentile , gipsy ( origin unknown ) , Basque , Celt , Teuton , German , Goth , Vandal , Mongol , Maori , Giour , etc. , as also in folk , foreigner , Aborigenee , Dervish , gaffer , people , crofter , fellaheen , fellow , moujik , dwarf , gnome ( origin unknown ) , fairy , genii , sprite , pigmy , goblin , nymph , harpy , comrade , chum , friend , boor , neighbour , jin , horde , maurauder , army , band , community , etc. , with their renderings in all languages  --  they are simply the man-name , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is axiomatically true . And the genii names shew how man peopled his surround-ings with immaterial beings . The word neighbour the dictionary gives as from Anglo Saxon neah , near , and bur or gebor , a dweller or agriculturist , with no reference to Latin or other language , but this is seen at once to be the Etymon man name , always existent in Britain with our Paleolithic forefathers . " Neighbour " and our country term gaffer " are one ? and one with Arab , in this etymology . Cromlech , menhir , dolmen also . WOMAN : The dictionary gives the Old English wife-man or wimman from wife and man , in the primitive sense of human beings , and says it is " a curious corruption of the German werb , wife , of obscure origin . " But the word is clearly the Etymon , a British w complex word . Compare the // Spanish mujer , Persian zenand , Greek gyne ( and Jenny ) , American squaw or eskwuo , of unknown origin , harem , etc. , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of women also , as Sarah ( Ishar ) , Rebekah , Miriam , Tabitha , Deborah , Hannah , Mary , etc . As elsewhere remarked , woman among the Ancients was man 's equal , chum or comrade ; Eoanthropic and Palseolithic woman even helped in his hunting and making of weapons , as well as the household work ( Neolithic woman invented pottery ) ; with the Sumerians , Egyptians , " Aryans , " Hebrews she was in a high position and often a ruler ; suttee and the harem and purdah systems were late abominations ; the Ten Commandments ordained equal honour for both , father and mother ; the last words of Christ were for his mother . Woman 's equal status with her partner is a theocentric condition and necessity . Among all modern nations Britain is that which has most regarded this truth . HUSBAND AND WIFE . The origin of the word wife has been a puzzle to philologists ; it appears in all Teutonic forms except Gothic and has been connected with wean , tremble , etc . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the complement of gunia , man , compare the Greek gamos , marriage , and the word womb , also spouse , wed , bride , and Hymen , the god of marriage ( name used in physiology for the virginal membrane ) , also dame ( which the dictionary gives as domare , to tame , but why ? ) , damsel , missis , etc. ; and the words tom and tabby . HUSBAND 1S given as Anglo Saxon husbonda , from hus , house , and bonda , to dwell , master of the house . SoN is given from Greek vies and Sanskrit sunnu , su , to beget ; Semitic Ben , Aryan magh , Latin filius , Spanish hijo , Welsh mab , Gaelic mac and fitz : DAUGHTER , from Greek thygater , Persian doktara , Sanskrit // duhitri , from " milker of cows . " But do daughters necessarily milk cows ? We see the Etymon here . BROTHER follows the origin of FATHER ; Spanish hermano , Babylonian ibhri ; SISTER from Latin soror and Sanskrit svasri , origin unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , maiden , damsel , etc. , all your names come down in the same way and gal we have in nin-gal , etc. , also nina . Aunt suffers loss of initial t and is the Latin amita , as does uncle , avuncular . BABY ? you are said to go back to the Aryan magh , ( Welsh rnab ) , but I shall take you to the Etymon , along with your parents ! The Names Master , Mistress are seen to embody the Etymon , Dimmer Ishtar , etc. , at once , especially if we supply the initial d , which has been retained in Dame , Dominus ; and so with father , pater , mother , they were all Dimmer , ( God ) : the Egyptian has retained the t , Dominus , Adam , etc. , the d . LovE . This transcendent word is given as Anglo Saxon lufu , with Teutonic forms and Latin libido and Sanskrit lubh , " to desire . " But here we give it a nobler origin , for with vocable adjustment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether Dimmer or Yahweh ? and so " God is Love " literally . Surely our prehistoric ancestors had their word for love ! It is one of the many words , such as light , life , law , like , etc. , which have taken I for the dental ; and compare nu , Elohim , Alulim , Lugal , etc . The Sumerian word is ram , another Sanskrit is smar , Latin amor , Sanskrit kama , god of love , etc. ; they are all one . There are two kinds of love , human or sexual and spiritual , and in the Scripture ( Vulgate ) these are carefully distinguished , the first being rendered as amo , the last as diligo , meaning regard or choose , as in the " Great Law " exhorting love to God and neighbour . English suffers from having only one word for love . We can not " love " our neighbour , but we can esteem him as ourself . The // tremendous power of love , sexual and non-sexual , is seen everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they love , and even to save others . Love is a divine current impinging on the clay vessels of we poor mortals ? though science may not classify it . Is this compatible with descent from the Ape " ? The Messiah was the veritable embodiment of the love which the Deity had for His created creature ? man : an eternal vital " force . " Our everyday word " dear " which the dictionary gives as Teutonic deore , thewer , dyr , I give as d-Ea and Dimmer , the Deity name . SEx . Strong sexual love is a tremendous force ; and it often goes with the philosophical or intellectual individual with special strength , as if creative powers were allied . It has also been said that the truest type of man partakes in the nature of man and woman . This passion is , as remarked , the striving to return to unity of the separated entity . It has been asked : was the Deity of bi-sexual attribute , in the Genesis account . Also , were the two sexes once one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce their kind ) . The legend of Aristophanes ( Plato ) says that man and woman were first a composite being and separated by Zeus ; whilst Hermes and Aphrodite became united in one body with a nymph ? Hermaphroditus ( the name now meaning bi-sexual ) . The word nymph , like all fairy names I have given as the Etymon , which may affect the fable . Compare the Aryan bi-sexual deities , the Dawn , Arditi , etc . The dictionary gives the word sex as from Latin seco , to cut . It has not been realized that it is a contraction of the Etymon , and so is one with the Greek word temsis , to cut . Just as the cosmos was one ( and presumably will return to one ) and so the concept of severance ? and in the sea-horizon and the myth of the severance of Tiamat ? so sex // was one . The words sessile , scissors , razor , scimitar , sword , anatomy , axe , sky , etc. , shew their affinity with the cutting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss being from Anglo Saxon cyssan , Latin gusto , to taste , and osculum from Latin kiss , mouth , allied with oracle . ( In mathematics two curves just touching are said to " kiss " ) . To-day , at what is the close of an Age , we seem to have reached a stage of sex-worship or something akin ? not as phallic rites but love ? and the kissing of youth and maiden is depicted on every magazine cover ! Did our Stone Age ancestors kiss ? Surely ; it must have been an act of the first man and woman . The word womb was used in the sense of the cosmic abyss ? the womb of space or time , and the Deep , with generative significance . The word clearly embodies Hubur-Tiamat . ( There are three " slang " or " obscene " words in English corresponding to the name Tiamat or Tiawath , etc. , with almost the same pronunciation for the female principle , but they can not well be set down here and were doubtless the Palas3olithic words ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly or stomach , Gothic womba ( uterus ) is not taken by philologists beyond Gothic ; but " stomach " is clearly Tiamat , and " belly " seems a reverse of it ; with " uterus " compare temsis to cut ( and Thames , etc. ) , and the concept of cutting the chaos-body of Tiamat . Tutu=utu=beget . Two : an important word in the present connexion . The Anglo-Saxon forms shew the difference between " two " and " twain " to be one of gender ; twegen masculine , twa , tweon , feminine ? compare temsis as above ; and so our simple word two is the etymon at once . Other Teutonic and Scandinavian forms are twa , tu , twaddie , tveggia , zweio , tva , zwei , zween ; Irish da , Gaelic do , Welsh dau , Russian dva , Latin and Greek duo , F // Persian do , Hindu do ( Doab river ) , Sanskrit dvi , dvau , Aryan from dwa . The philologist does not associate with these the Latin bi , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other forms are demi , semi , half , double , twice , couple , mitad ( Spanish half ) bis , ( twice=dvis ) , both ( Anglo Saxon batwa , or " both-two " ) , team ? all of which are merely the Etymon : and we see their analogy with the Tiv , div , dwa , aba , etc. , deity vocables from Tiam . The word two is in fact a contraction Yahweh or Tiawath and is seen in " water , " and the emergence of Mat from Tam . The idea of temsis , cutting , two and one is a fundamental concept , giving us , I shew , the whole concept of structure , and all the words designating structure are the Etymon , as seen in the word atom , first regarded as the indivisible unit , domus a house , dome , cave , temple , etc . The word structure is given from Latin struo , structum , to build , but we see the Etymon at once , as in domus . The concept is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dome , a cover , a cell , a habitat , all of which words are the Etymon , for Life , as against chaos and non-habitation . ONE . The Old English form is oon , an , Welsh un , Irish and Gaelic oen , Latin unus , Greek oinos , Aryan aina . Our word is pronounced wun ( the French has a g-sound ) , I associate the Greek onoma , a name , showing that One and Name are the same thing , also Latin primero , etc . Our word one has lost the initial t , and with on=m=Tiara , the etymon . So in this etymology one is two ! ? both being contractions of the etymon ( so , too , white=black as regards name-origin ) . Consider oon , an egg , whence the word ooid composed of oon and cidos , form , meaning egg-shaped ( also having albumen , which word compare ) or oval . Spanish for egg , huevos , Latin ovum . Now the form of the firmament is oval or round ( compare round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seen by man , a dome , and the Tiamat-body represented such . In various cosmogonies was the concept of the cosmic egg from which the world derived . Compare also the Greek words for life , era , won , dawn , etc . As in this etymology two is one , it is seen how language emerges from a metaphysical or spiritual concept . In the Book of Enoch , it is said that man 's body was compounded of the " seven substances " : seven is a sacred number . Thus , One , Two=Dimmer . Compare Greek Deutero , two=Di , ti , Ea , etc. , the concept of Two in One : or even Three , for two in one gives a concept of three-neuter , too . Consider the concept of right hand or dexter and left hand or sinister : and the rib out of Adam 's side to form Ish ; the derivation of dexter is Sanskrit dakshina , on the right or south ; Welsh deheu right , southern ; and Gaelic and Irish dear ; the Sanskrit term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin , meaning left , unlucky , bad , is of unknown origin . These are clearly from the Etymon ; compare Ap-su , shamash , lshtar , etc. , also sin , the moon , and the right and left hand banks of the River ( Euphrates ) , in connexion with sex , and also the " woman 's language " of the Sumerians . Why do we call the right hand bank of a river so , that bank which is on our right hand when we are looking down stream towards its mouth ? This may have its creative significance . Eridu , man 's birthplace , was the right hand side of the Euphrates . With the word right compare Tutu , with left Tiamat . Right is defined as straight , true , just , Latin rectus , rectum to rule , proper , according to the will of God ; left , Anglo Saxon " worthless , " as sinister . Compare the idea of evil and Eve 's temptation by the devil , sin=sinister and the etymon ; good and evil are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the earliest anatomical treatise , ' I // an Egyptian papyrus of the sixteenth century B.C. , the vessels of the right ear are described as carrying " the breath of life , " and those of the left ear as " the breath of death . " However , as regards the River of Life , the Euphrates , the left-hand bank is that of the sunrise , the giver of life , so if you look up stream the simile is reversed ! So good and evil again are inextricably interwoven . Earliest man lived very simply , in reed huts , as shewn in the Babylonian Flood story , for in such Utnapishtim dwelt when warned by Ea to build his Ark and escape . The simple life was compatible with the theocentric outlook and social syste , n . And in this fertile Euphratean region alone does the wheat plant grow in an original wild state . ( The word wheat I offer as the Etymon , Hebrew hitta , though the dictionary gives Angle Saxon origin ) ; according to Herodotus and others it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade four fingers in breadth . In the following chapters I have given extracts from the Euphratean religious and civil concepts at some length because the mentality of these our primaeval ancestors is almost a closed book to the general reader ; the so-called " Humanities , " or classics of Ancient Greece and Rome have a host of exponents ? who indeed often seem to regard them as the final literary and historical horizon ! The name of Babylon is popularly associated with all that is wicked ; but we may now agree ( or not agree ) that the culture of the River of Life , disclosed by those old clay tablets ( which would not have been preserved had not the ziggurats fallen and buried them under apparently worthless mounds ) , is of more value to us than the wonders of ancient Greece and Rome ; and the consideration arising therefrom which I shall offer need not offend any , be he historian , theologist , Jew or Gentile . // THEOCENTRIC TRUTH , MYTH , AND LANGUAGE THE idea of a religious origin for all human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude resulting on the seggregation of the religious from the social and economic , strongly marked to-day , when religion is regarded as something apart or " pious " ; but for the Ancients all these matters were one , their religious , social and economic codes were one , and community life was theocentric . So it is that language had its theocentric origin or point of issuance . All knowledge and science and economic operations arose out of religious usages . Religion was " scientific " : it was inextricably interwoven with life because it was the basis of nature and life . To-day if we speak of an individual or locality as being " religious " we describe it as something " out of the common , " or abnormal , away from the normal , away from the " community . " But the words " normal " and " community " are seen to be the Etymon Nu Dimmud , even if the dictionary gives normal as from Latin , " norm , " a ( carpenter 's ) rule , from gnorima , gna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and a district was called a name or kome in Greece and in Egypt , Greek nomos , nomarchy ( compare also monarchy , a reverse ) ; whilst " community , " " common , " " country " are the same word . RELIGION The origin of the word has always been much discussed ; Latin relligio , " to gather together , to fasten or bind , " is given . According to Cicero , " men were called religious who considered carefully all that appertained to the gods . " But we may now see that the word at once reflects the Sumerian Ile , god ; Alulim , Elohim or nam-lugal or " divine " rulership " before quoted , also Illinos or Bel , El-Lil , and the names of Ea , // Nu , and Marduck , etc . We have it in Hallelujah , elegant , ill , illicit , etc. ; to be elegant was once to be religious , and to be ill was connected with divine ire ( Ea ) : we have it in the words locality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this hermeneutic etymology we shall see this word as the basis of terms descriptive of sacred edifice , all priestly words , all house , habitation , legal , government and town words , that is , centres of population , social life being theocentric and temple-directed , in " thought , word and deed . " Thus in all government words . The first ruler or king was a priest , or his office arose therefrom ( here is " divine right " originally ) . When other states separated off as families and tribes ( both these words reveal the Etymon ) each had its own temple ( and in some degree its own deity ) and was marked off ? as Babylonian history shews ? by sacred boundary stones or bethels ( bit-ilu , =house of god ) and canals . The philologist gives " temple " as from Greek and Latin temeno , from temno , to cut ; a piece of ground cut off for a sacred enclosure , with Aryan root tam , to cut or gnaw ; or from templum , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of birds , such as furnished matters of prognostication relating to the will of the gods , a Roman practice . But we must go beyond that , and I give temple as the Etymon , Dimmer ( t=d ) , Nu Dimmud or Ea , Ilu . It was the first abode of Dimmer , the God ; it stood on the edge of the Tiara or Deep , the Mat Tamtin or Holy Mountain , which emerged from the Deep , Eridu or Habur , Guber , the Gu-aba , the Gu-edini ( Eden ) , an island in the estuary of the Euphrates ( compare " estuary " as the Etymon geographical land-water name ) , which was also designated as Paradise , Sumerian E-de-aba , the name for " heaven " and " temple . " ( See " heaven " ) . The Sumerian priests were called // patesi or gunnamede , which names embody the Etymon vocables . We have seen that " Rulership descended from heaven upon Eridu when Alulim was king , " in the beginning of the Golden or Antediluvian Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1=d , etc . ) . From the " temple " Etymon word we see at once such words as theme ; religion was the theme , a word given from Greek tithemi , to place : but it would be the taro or sacred Sumerian place ; also the word themis , law , and the dread word anathema , a curse banishing or excommunicating from the heaven-directed rule of the " religious " community and its priest ( compare nuncio and Papal " Bull " as the Etymon ) ; and schism , given from Greek " cutting , " which however would be a cutting of the " theme " ; and timocracy , or " rule of the worthy ; and prophet , Greek phemi , to tell ; and thymos Greek , the soul ; and theomachy , from mache , combat , fighting against the gods ; and nomad , from Greek nomados , to feed on pasture , nemo to feed , would be the wanderer from the Nu Dinnnud , Tarn or ( iu aba ( compare fold , sheep , pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mesopotamia were called gu-aba ) and our word " wander , " given as Anglo Saxon is the same word , gu-ab-ed ; also the Land of Nod of Cain 's wandering or excommunication ; all this terminology ( " term " =tam , temple ) which the dictionary calls Greek is thus really Sumerian , from which in reality , as will here be shewn , the classical Greeks borrowed all their words and concepts , automatically ; compare also Nunc dimittis , Latin , " Now thou lettest depart , " which shews Nu Dimmer and tam . And all such words follow , as timid , Latin timeo , fear , and the word " fear " itself , fear of evil away from the Tam , beyond which were " the devil-haunted plains , " or fear even of deity itself ; idea , image , domain , method ? from Greek meta , and hodos , a // way , following the proper or religious way or path ; ramble , roam , range , heathen , pagan , damn ; and Imam , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pattern or guide , " compare guide as gu-ab-ed , on the sacred way ; bishop , eveque , vicar , minister , priest , parish , etc. , etc . The ancient and widespread rite of baptism ? the word would originally be ap-su , tam , the water-life concept from the beginning : to baptize was to have actual contact again with water , to be re-newed : new=Nu=Ea . BAPTISM : The word is given in the dictionary from Greek bapto , to dip . But , as above , we see the Etymon=Aba-aba-Dimmer . It must have been originally an " incantation " term accompanying the rite . Baptism was a ritual of Ea , the tablets shew , the washing or sprinkling the body of a victim of disease or a demon ( there were innumerable demons , some called Etimmu ) with water from the sacred Euphrates or Tigris , or a holy spring from the earth , in order to exorcise such , to the accompaniment of an incantation or formula , such as the cuneiform give , an example being : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and again seven times Sprinkle , purify , cleanse ! By the name of heaven be ye forsworn ! By the name of earth be ye forsworn ! By Ea , the lord of the universe Be ye forsworn ! " A lamb or bird was offered , as a vicarious sacrifice for the victim or patient , the demon spirit supposed to be transferred thereto ; offered to the gods to appease their anger against the sufferer : " The lamb as a substitute for man ; Take a white lamb of Tammuz , Place it near the sick man , Tear out its inside And pronounce the incantation of Eridu . " Tammuz here was the " spring-tide . " The lamb was to be burnt , not eaten . The idea was that what was good for the patient was bad for // the demon , and nasty medicines of bitter herbs were given , especially for stomach troubles . lists of which herbs appear in the Babylonian medical tablets ? and thus the science of medicine began , though of course there was also knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned and pleasant oils and unguents used to coax away the demons or appease the gods : " Pure oil , shining oil , Oil which makes the gods to shine , Oil which mollifies men 's muscles , The oil of Ea 's incantation , The oil of Marduk 's incantation I pour over thee ; the healing oil Granted by Ea for easing pain . Oil of life I give thee ; Through the incantation of Ea , Lord of Eridu I will drive out thy sickness ! " Thus the early doctor on the River of Life , the Euphrates . Amulets were also used . In these psalms and incantations it was often : " May thy liver be appeased " or quieted , ( whether of gods or men ) . A hymn to Marduk says : " I implore thee mighty , powerful lord , May thy angered heart be appeased ( May thy stirred-up liver be quieted ! " The reason of this was that the liver meant also the spirit ; it was thought to be the seat or centre of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ancients thought the spirit had some such special point of habitation in the body . The liver was examined in divination or augury : its special peculiarities or any abnormality of form were portentious . ( So in the question : Is life worth living ? and the answer : it depends upon the liver , would have been more than a mere " pun ! " ) There is an extensive cuneiform literature of " divination handbooks " of the Babylonian priests , largely in connexion with heptascopy or examination of the liver of sacrificial sheep , and other augurs and omens and matters propitiatory and // introspective . Our word " liver " philologists give as Anglo Saxon lifer , German leber , but of otherwise unknown origin . But it may here be seen to be one with the Etymon life , live , and with the Greek hepta , liver , h=1 , p=v : though the dictionary gives " life " as merely Teutonic : but life and liver at once reflect Dimmer , Tiam , the lord of Life . Again , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin I shew reflects , in fact contains the name Ea , as does " heal , " remedy , and other medical terms , for Ea was the god of healing : compare similarly oil , oleum , ointment , anoint , and , as given elsewhere , the parts of the body and all matters of somatology ; and as regard , , the use of the sheep 's or lamb 's liver compare " taming , " given as Anglo Salon a young lamb , ewe , and the words lamb , ram , sheep themselves , all as the Etymon . Images of demons were also burned or set afloat on the River of Life and then purposely overturned and " drowned , " all for the benefit of the patient or sufferer . As above remarked , the Babylonians and others thought there were innumerable demons always ready to enter into or attack us poor Mortals . ( Christ cast out the " legion " of demons into the swine ) . To-day though some " superstitions " remain we have got rid of the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are still formidable ? under other nomenclature ! And with the departure of the demons seems to go the departure of the Deity ! Obviously , the " remedy " for the future is to realize the Deity and the cosmos as a positively constructive or structural principle in life ? but neither Church , State nor individual yet understands this . They have not learned yet to diagnoze the social " liver " : it takes a " doctor " of a special kind to do it ! ( Logic of the Cosmos ) . AUGUR . You may have said in addressing a public meeting On this auspicious occasion i // . . . . which augurs well . . . . etc. " ; if so , you are using what were religious terms ; they are given as from auspex , which is said to be avi-spex , Latin 11 observer of birds , " a religious office and custom said to be of Italian origin ; and in ancient Rome the Augurs were members of a religious college whose duty it was to observe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the philologist does not know the derivation of the word Augur ; but it is seen to be the Etymon , aw , Ea , nu , water , and gu , land or edge of water , the edge and horizon of Exidu , where the first man observed the sea and sky . It is one with the word Origin and Orient , given as Latin origen , to rise , east , as the sun , but I skew that these words are Ea- Nu Dimmud , abbreviated . The Augurs " college " referred to , is of obscure history , and ethnologists have attributed it to Romulus or Numa . But these were both legendary kings or culture-heroes ; Romulus with his twin-brother Remus was son of Silvia or Ilia , daughter of . Numitor and of Marrs , set afloat on the ' fiber in a trough , stranded in the reeds ( Akkar and Moses again ) , suckled by a she-wolf , killed his brother ; and then disappeared in a storm after founding Rome ; Numa was his colleague ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries , and all religious institutions were ascribed to him . But all these names and activities I take back to the Sumerian=Numa=Nu Dimmud or Ea , Romulus= Dimmud or Tiamat . Our word mascot is a reverse . Auspicious=Ea , Ap-su , etc . Temper=Dimmer . The word holy is Greek kalig=beautiful=whole ; so , holy means entire or one , which words are the Etymon . If a thing is " whole " it is beautiful . The " Tam " word is seen in the Haram , h=t , the sacred enclosure and Temple platform at Jerusalem with the Golden Gate or Gate of the Eternal in its east wall , called Bab-al-Tabue ( compare // " taboo " ) , like the Ian of Ba-ba-lam or Baby-Ion C ' gate of god " ) , 1=t , and the Hebrew word Lan , to dwell or abide ; and in the Celtic Llan , a sacred enclosure now applied to a church , with over 1,000 examples in England and Wales ; and Celtic Coed and Gelli , sacred wood or grove , ( and in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batsworthy ( Devon ) and innumerable ancient i religious centres in Britain now occupied by churches and cathedrals ( for , as I shew , Britain was a marked Sumerian or Etymon religious region , for special reasons ) ? but also all over the world . The word " Land " is the same . The Latin Terminus , god of boundaries or landmarks does but reflect , I sbew , the sacred Tam land habitat ( the Hebrew law cursed the man who removed his neighbour 's landmarks ) ; all land , boundary , place , spatial and measurement terms are similarly derived : as also the terminating tan in Hindustan , Britain , Mauretania , etc . Llan=Celtic " riverside . " The words nave and apse are of peculiar , interest . Nave is supposed to be connected with a ship , from the appearance of an upturned vessel , but it is seen to be the same as dome , n=t , v=m , or Tam , so temple . But compare Ea 's ship . Apse is given by philologists as from Latin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wheel , but it is here shewn to be the =me Ap-su , the ocean-stream . The temples of Babylonia had a construction called apsu , which symbolized the abyss , ( the personified Dimmer Tiamat ) or the heavenly sea-vault above . In the temple of Solomon at Jerusalem stood a remarkable " brazen sea , " a large round bronze tank of enormous capacity ( 16,000 gallons ) resting on the back of twelve bulls in groups of three , facing the cardinal points ; it was the creation of Solomon 's Phoenician artist Huram-abi of Tyre ; it served no practical purpose and its meaning was unknown ? but I give the " Ap-su , " ( the Phaenecians // were originally Sumerians ; and the name Huramas also Hiram ? are seen to be the Etymon , as is also the name Tyre ) and the bulls were indicative of Alarduk . There were Cherubim as a decoration upon it ? the Etymon name again . Thus the apse of our Christian churches I offer as the primoovai concept of the ocean-stream and the Genesis " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin altus , high , but we see it to be Ilu-tiaw or tam . GOVERNMENT . The word government is given from Greek kybernao , to govern , but is seen to be the Etymon , compare home , kome , etc . Then follow the locality terins ; town , worth , ham or hamlet , thorpe ( and dorp ) , ton , dun , thwaite , stead , stoke , village , city ( civis , citizen ) and home ? most of which are given by philologists as Teutonic , but which I shew are the Sumerian Etymon ; ham=tam , etc. , by vocable adjustment . King is kengu , k=t , en = m = Tiamat or Dimmud and kin ( and ing ) follow : all king or ruler names also , from shar , czar , kaiser , emperor , rajah , jam , queen , in wide variety are seen to be a reflect of deity names ? " divine right of kings . " State , stet , stand are a contraction of the Etymon , ( as in Tutu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Hindu and Aryan govern is nazam , which shews Nu-Tam ; a Persian landowner is zamindar , and so forth . The concept name of house or home , I have shewn arose from the Etymon concept of the world as under a dome , tam or Huber , which last meant " bollow , " the firmament dome later rendered as Tiamat 's severed body , reflected in gu-aba , cave , etc . Edifice = edit y = ed-ab = Dimmer . Consider the following words as derivants of this temple and house etymon : ? tabernacle , taberna , tavern , tebah ( Hebrew ark ) , tent , tambo ( Peruvian house ) , tepee ( Mexican tent ) , wigwam , yamen ( Cliina , house , palace ) , pagoda , dagoba ( Persian and Hindu ) , gompa ( Tibet , monastery ) , khan // caravansary ( Persian ) inn , kraal , bungalow , home ; also house ; Greek oikos and church , ekkalao , kirk , from Kyrios , Lord ( compare circle ) , igloo , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally meaning " whole " q and chamber , Greek kamera ; nave origin said to be unknown , gable , room , dome , domicile , abode , vault , etc. ; also the words hell , Sheol , tophet , shell , hole , hollow , etc . All these reflect the same . To associate home , house , temple , with Hell or sheol may not seen attractive , but it is a structural concept ; we need not turn them into bells ! ? especially if we will build houses enough in modern times for the population . And our good TownPlanncrs ( who are proceeding altogether on wrong lines ) may be interested in the fact that TownPlanning was theoccntric . And the science and names of measurement , agronomy , or mensuration , arose from the Taira delimitation . Ea Nu Dimmud , we have seen , first taught man geometry and arithmetic along with law and writing , and the word " number , " given in the dictionary as from Latin and same root as nomad , Greek nemo , to distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the originator of enumeration , or Ea-nu-mud : also multiple , many . The word " mud , " given as Teutonic and allied to muddle and meaning slime is here seen as the Mat or Dimmud word , and doubtless a primal Palaeolithic Sumerian word for earth , which word is shewn to reflect Ea , Elsewhere I offer the letters of our alphabet , the so-called Phoenician , as probably derived from signs representing the Eridu delta or island . ( The Phoenicians were originally Sumerians ) . Again , our simple word mat , a ground covering , originally of woven reeds , is the same . ( In this connexion consider the slang British terms his name was mud , " and " Blimey , " Lummey , By Jabers ? are they mere slang or prehistoric echoes of Dimmud and Tiam 2 ) // Words such as numismatics , money ( moneo , I advise , Minerva 's temple ) , banker , etc. , are all at once referable to the Etymon . In the Golden Age money was used scientifically : to-day money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An important word in all language is " new . " The dictionary gives it as Anglo Saxon neowe ; cognates . Gothic niujis , Welsh newydd , Irish nuadh , Latin novus , Greek neos , Sanskrit navas , new ; or from now , which in these other languages is nu . But this can only be the nu of Dimmud . Compare also nowell , carol , Noel ? the name used at Christmas : natus , natal , native , nation . The important range of words in nu includes neuter , ( not either ) , nemesis , nerve , never , no , etc . We must recollect that nu would become ne , ni , no , etc. , and by reversal an , in , on , etc . The word old , the converse of new , is eald ( =Ea ) Gothic altheis , Latin alo , which means nourish ; and altus , lofty ; in which we see the vocables : and ancient , ancestor , nepenthe , nobula , may be compared . As for " no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m-gative and affirmative arise ? " No " and its kindred are seen in all languages to Sanskrit : in this etymology it would be originally an unfavourable deity gesture of Nu Dimmud : " Yes " is yea and si , " let it be , " Ea , Latin sim ; also ywis , " certainly , " and would be a favourable deity sign or gesture . In the Hebrew divination Uriui gave " Yes , " Thummim " No . " Compare , yea , oui , aye=Ea , nay=N-Ea : and the Hebrew " or " light=ur=Ea=yes . No , non , nay would be hunas , tenebris ( Sanskrit , Latin ) , dark , Thummim ; so light= " Yes , " darkness " No . " Affirm(ative)= Abba : negative=Nu-gu(tive) . The suffix " tive " = Dimmer . We must now enter still more closely into the ; 12 THE ETYMON attributes of theocentric origin , in their " scientific " . aspect . The word science is the Etymon . The pristine religion of the Sumerians , I have , endeavoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not originally polytheistic . But it became so under the Babylonians and Assyrians with their separate state gods ( it was not unnatural to have . a state or tribal deity ) , a system which was welldeveloped as far back as 5,000 B.C. , and remained to 400 A.D. There was in fact a monotheistic school of thought in Babylonia , as is known from the cuneiform . There was always great religious fervour in Babylonia , far exceeding that among modern communities . In the earliest recorded period of these separate states religious culture was derived from two principal centres , namely , Eridu in the south , the enlightened and beneficent culture of Ea , and Nippur in the north , under El-lil , lord . of the ghost-land , whose gifts to man were incantation and spells which the spirits of good and evil were obliged to obey , and his world was a mountain and the people he had created lived underground . But even when Marduk was the general patron deity there were shrines to Ea in the great cities . Long before the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eridu led . But what preceded this religion ? Was it merely Animism ? ( The word is from anima , the soul , the attribution of spirit or soul to inanimate things ) . It has been remarked by commentators that it is difficult to suppose so intelligent a people as the Sumerians with their deep knowledge of the powers of nature really believed that sticks , stones , raountains , etc. , were really deities having life and power , and it is doubtful if they ever worshipped them , even if the " Bit-ilu " or Bethel was a " house of god , " and although all rivers and streams were thought of as animated by the spirit of Ea , and // the great temples or ziggurats pervaded with the particular deity-spirit to which they were dedicated . This ancient religion had apparently nothing of barbarity or savagery in it : the gods and goddesses were very different from the often debased Greek and Roman deities , the Canaanite , Phoenician , Hindu , Mexican or others : the religion was spiritual and ethical : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guidance of man and his duty . Ea gave all benefits to mankind and sorrowed when man was deprived of immortality ; lvlarduk is pictured as full of mercy , self-sacrifice and kindness : shamash the sun god embodied justice as his principal attribute : the need for pureness of heart in man and for confessing sins are strong elements , ? such the cuneiform inscriptions skew . Following is a Babylonian hymn to the Moon god from the temple of Ur , which was incorporated into the sacred books of the state religion : " Father , long-suffering and full of forgiveness , Whose hand upholdeth the life of all mankind , First-born , omnipotent , whose heart is immensity , And there is none that may fathom it l In heaven who is supreme ? Thou alone art supreme ! As for thee , thy will is made known in heaven And the angels bow their faces , As for thee , thy will is made known upon earth , And the spirits below kiss the ground . " It is scarcely necessary to point out the analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? see comparison , later . The idea of sacrifice is borne out in the story of Tammuz and Ishtar , which is traced back to perhaps 6000 B.C. and must have come from far earlier sources , for the names are the universal Etymon . Tammuz shows his faithfulness by " dying to save the world " ; as a " nature myth " he is cut down when the corn is reaped and dies when fruit and flowers are plucked or wither or the trees are hewn , u // but his mourners say he will rise again from the dead , or hell , and they rejoice because of his resurrection : at times the king himself played a part and the god was symbolically sacrificed and a recently translated cuneiform tablet shews that such took place in Marduk 's temple . ( The same thing , in grosser form , existed in Mexico ) . The tablets give great prominence to the equal godhead of father and son , Ea and Marduk , and then again to Marduk and Nebo , father and son . Ea says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My son , what - dost thou not know that I could tell thee ? What I know thou also knowest . " Tremendous praise is bestowed upon Marduk by the assembly of the gods , in hymns which were evidently at first addressed to Ea : " Mighty lord of gods , strong Marduk , Uounsellor , beloved of l:a , Before his mighty command the gods bow . Lord of all below merciful one . . . King of heaven and earth , God without whom in the depth The fate of mankind is not determined . Thou lookest on the habitations of the wicked And destroyest their power . What god in heaven or earth is like to thee ? Supreme art thou over all gods ; Among the gods thy counsel prevails ; Thou girt superior to Ea. , The father who produced thee . " The name " Ford " is given to Marduk , because the giving of a " name . " in antiquity here carried with it the attributes of the name . The Creation account , it has been seen , states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been " named . Not only the god but the goddess was supplicated ; and this attitndc toward the feminine , as has been shewn in these pages , is an ennobling one : and we see that the Ancients held their women in full honour . Here is a psalm addrescd to a goddess : ? // " Look graciously on the prostration of living beings . I thy servant , full of sighs , cry to thee . The appeal of him who has sinned , do thou accept l If thou lookest on a man , that man lives , O almighty lady of mankind , Merciful one , accept my petition ! Except thee , there is no guide . Say ' Atonement is granted , ' How long yet , O my lady l Turn thy countenance to me ! As a dove I moan , satiated with sighs . " And this : May thy heart like the heart of a mother Return to its placol lake the heart of a mother who has given birth ; Like the heart of a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct : Thou shalt not slander ? speak what is pure l Thou shalt not speak evil ? speak kindly l If in anger ? do not speak out , For thou shalt regret it later . Approach thy god daily with sacrifice and prayer : Learn wisdom : fear of God begets favour ; Prayer brings forgiveness of sin . Speak not evil of thy friend . Do not speak meanly ? speak kindly l If thou promisestr give it . Do not oppress ; it is not ploasing to the god , He will requite thee with evil . Give food to eat , wine to drink , Treat the poor well . " And this : " " Prayer was my practice , Sacrificing my law ; The day of worship of the gods The joy of my heart ; The day of devotion to the goddess More to me than riches : Royal prayer ? that was my delight . I taught my country to guard the name of the god ; I accustomed my people To honour the name of the goddess . " But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long O Lord , how long ! " " Who is there that can grasp the will of the gods ? The plan of a god is full of mystery How can mortals grasp it ? He who was alive yesterday is dead to-day : // In an instant he is cast into grief ; For a moment he sings and plays , And in a twinkling is like a mourner . Hungry he is like a corpse W ith enough he considers himself equal to his god . If things go well he prates of mounting to heaven ; If in distress , of descending to help " There are matters with which Ecclesiastes is analogous , notably the suggestion to " Eat , drink and be merry , " to live happily with the wife of your bosom , etc. , for the day cometh . . . ; and again with the Psalms . In all these , throughout the Ages , is reflected the frequent questioning and despair of the poor Mortal , which surely the God ( or gods ) would commiserate , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come , or whither he goes : and " Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might : for there is no device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom in the grave , whither thou goest . " Our own Victorian Age expressed this , in the words of Tennyson ? the last of the poets : " Man , her last work who seemed so fair , Such splendid purpose in his eyes Who rolled the psalm to wintry lies And built him fanes of fruitless prayer ; Who loved , who suffered countless ills , Who battled for the true , the just , Be blown about the desert ? dust , Or sealed within the iron hills ! " But this Victorian poet sings of " Love , Creation 's final Law . " To-day the doctrine against this ageold pessimism has been summed up in this Etymon history as that " Origin and Destiny are One " ? which will give us a new outlook . Some of the Babylonian psalms rise to spiritual heights like the Hebrew Psalms , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or served them as models . The great king Nebuchadnezzar addresses his god on ascending the Throne as follows : " O eternal ruler lord of the universe , grant that the name of the king whom thou Invest , flourish as // may be pleasing to thee . Lead him in the right path . I am a prince subservient to thee , the creature of thy hand . Thou hast created me and hast entrusted the rule of mankind to me . According to thy mercy , U Lord , which thou bestowest upon all , may thy supreme rulership be merciful . The fear of thy divinity implant in my heart . Grant me what may seem good to thee , for thou art the one who has granted me life . " This might be the equal of Solomon 's prayer to Yahweh . Indeed in the Scripture itself we can not fail to be struck by the pious spirit of the Babylonian kings , as for example in their recognition of " the spirit of the holy gods ' in Daniel , etc . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their conquest and treatment of other peoples , and of their own subjects at times nevertheless upheld the canons of public justice and law  --  because they believed that Law came from God , or the gods . Another cuneiform text says " If the king does not hear the law his people will perish , his power will pass away . If he does not heed the law of his land , Ea , the King of destinies will alter his destiny and cast him aside . If he gives heed to the wicked , confusion will disturb the land . If he follows the counsels of Ea , the great gods will aid him in righteous decrees and decisions . " The existence of ancient ethical and social law is strikingly revealed in the famous Code of Hammurabi ( or Khammurabi ) who reigned in Babylonia to 2081 B.C. , the Susa monument . This was a compilation based on a far more ancient Sumerian code , at least in large part . Its statutes reveal an advanced stage of society with high ethical principles , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the basis of punishment . Law by the Ancients was regarded as oracular , God-given , and so was always handed on . The Babylonian word for oracle was tertu ; this is the Hebrew Torah ; and I skew that our word law is the same word , for tertu=taw-taw ; Torah=taw and taw=law ; // and we see Oracle is a corruption of the same , loss of initial t , or=Aw=Ea ; compare also the legal term tort , etc . Thus at least before 3000 B.C. as the Code shews law as regards Judicial procedure , Property , Land , Trade and Business , Family and Individual Rights and Labour were codified . Trial by Ordeal was a strong feature of the Code ; as was the lex talionis , " eye for eye , tooth for tooth , " as in the Pentateuch . It was a Civil not a Religious Code . But applied to dishonest commercial and other transactions the punishment fitting the crime was often salutary , and often without the option of fine . ( To-day big commercial dishonesty too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Among its " logical " 1mnislunents was one providing that if a house fell down through bad building and killed its inmates the architect was executed ; or if a doctor 's operation destroyed the eye of a patient the doctor must lose his own eye ! As to the land , the god of the city or centre , was its owner , the citizens his tenants . The pax Babylonica was so secure that a private individual did not hesitate to ride in his carriage from Babylon to the Mediterranean . Compare the desert motor service to Bagdad to-day ! . The Code is represented as having been given to Hammurabi by Shamash the sun-god , who was the god of law , light and justice ? succeeding Ea Nudimmud , whose name he embodies . And the Sumerian concept of the god preceded that of a sun god , or lay behind it , as with others of the Ancients . Our respect for the Ancients will be increased when all their ideas and acts are more widely considered , and we realize that our religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of as at present only of " Hebrew " origin . Hammurabi was probably a contemporary of Abraham and the Amraphael of Scripture , and I // Abraham was of course informed with the ancient religion . The title of the Code runs : " Laws of righteousness which Hammurabi the mighty and just King has established , for the benefit of the weak and oppressed , the widows and orphans . " These merciful attributes came down from Ea and Dimmer . In the Babylonian Marduk account Ea is represented as having shirked the fight with Tiamat , but was not this the principle of overcoming Evil with Good , rather than " resisting Evil " ? ' And Ea imprisoned two forces of Evil . It uuist undoubtedly be the case , and possibly further discovery of cuneiform records , etc. , perhaps when Eridu is excavated , may reveal it , that the culture of Dimmer , Ea or Dimn-iud was a pure natural one embodying the concept of a Deity such as that pictured for Elohim and Yahweh in the Hebrew Scriptures ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is already known , were taken from Ea who was described as the " creator of the world , of mankind , and the saviour of the world . " ft would seem as if the Elohim creation account of ( xenesis embodies Ea , with the names Elohim=Ea Nu Dimmud ; and the Yahweh account the later or Marduk account . ( In this connexion it is again to be remarked that the allusion embodies no irrerevent attributes ) . The pristine seaport of Eridu ? its site is five miles south of Ur ( of the Chaldees , a Semitic city , and of Abraham ) , now called Abu Shahrim or Nowaweis ; as already said it was also Habur in the cuneiform ; also Ur-dugga or " the good city " upon which Heavenly Rulership descended ; it was described as " on the shore of the sea " ( an island in the estuary ) ; calculation of the silt-deposit rate has given the seventh millenium B.C. as the time of its coastal position , but this of course is little more than guess-work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( compare // ziggurat= Ur-dugga ) still seventy feet high above its platform were found in 1854 ( Taylor 's exploration ) with marble slabs , copper bolts , gold and silverheaded nails and flint implements . The Euphrates and Tigris apparently reached the sea by separate mouths in its time . ( I compare the " four heads " of Genesis , perhaps estuary mouths ) . The island was the only fit habitation for man , clear and fruitful of soil , for the great valley behind it was probably a pestiferous marsh , the mud flats of the great river as it silted up ( hence the concept of land from sea and Mat Tamtin ) , and in later ages the science of drainage and irrigation arose , also the mound-cities , as they were essentially ? which I have called " Mat ' I'amtins , " as found all over the world , Asia , Europe , Britain , Egypt , Mississippi , Central America , Mexico , etc. , showing that migrating man copied this earth-water concept . Civilization was thus born of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and temples . The first tablets for writing at Eridu were of wood , not baked clay as in Babylonia , and the first writing was probably painted thereon , not incised like the clay-written cuneiform . The name Ea became in later Babylonia mythology Oannes , who was pictured ( Berossus ) as a man 's body covered with a fish , but ethnologists do not trace connexion between the two names . ( But it is seen that Oannes=Nu Dimmud and Ea , o=e=a , an=m , s=d , etc . ) . This creature is represented as rising daily from the sea to teach mankind . I suggest again the degenerated idea from the more chaste Sumerian : the endeavour to give material form to spiritual concept . ( Compare the word " teach " as T-Ea , etc . ) . The symbol of the " earth " seems to have been a circular or elliptical island ? this would be Eridu , compare the name as " Earth . " The name Eden I give as a reverse of Nu-ed , a contraction of Nu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a ship of Ea , described in a Sumerian text , ( with the woods of which it was built ) and in it , apparently , were Enki or Ea , Damgal-nunna or Damkina , his consort , Asari-luduga or Merodach , In-ab or Ines , the pilot of Eridu , Ea 's city , and Nin-igi-nagar-sir , " the great architect of heaven " . May the ship before thee bring fertility , May the ship after thee bring joy , In thy heart may it make joy of heart . . Ea was the god of fertility . With this may be compared the Welsh Flood story , which is given later . The further excavation of Eridu and indeed of all these ancient cities of Babylonia would be of the utmost interest and value to the world of knowledge , and of origin ; much has been done , and there are clever archaeologists prepared to do more ? but it is a question of money , and wealthy people in general are too stingy to support such work . Let them deny themselves some luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archmologists . Britain may not always control Babylonia , and indeed the taxpayer already clamours for her to retire from it . Sippar , the Sumerian Zimbir , is now Abu-habba , north of Babylon ; its temple of the sun-god was called E- Babara ; ( it was the sepharvaim of Scripture ; " Where are the gods of Sepharvaim and Tvah ? " According to Berossus , the Chaldean Noah buried the records of the antediluvian world here and the name was connected with Sipru , a " writing . " It was the culture centre of Shamash the sun-god , whose main attributes were light and justice , and his high priest , whose piety and devotion brought great renown to the place was En-me-dur-an-ki , the seventh pristine Sumerian king , identical with Enoch of Genesis , the seventh from Adam ; ( the one name I give as a contraction // of the other ; the Greek name is Evedorachus ) ; he was the sun-god 's favourite , and the 365 years of Enoch 's life are typical of the days in the solar year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as variants of the cuneiform lists of pristine kings ( nothing is known of Cain 's city of Enoch : I suggest Canaan ) . In Genesis " Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him . " The Book of Hebrews says God " translated " him ; later legends represent him as receiving the basis of all knowledge and wisdom , which he taught mankind , and as the originator of writing , and in the Babylonian account he receives instruction from the sun god and revelations in astronomy , the secrets of the universe , etc . The apocryphal Book of Enoch and Secrets of Enoch have been much debated as to time and authorship ; and the first is regarded by Bible commentators as the most important of the apocryphal writings in the history of religions thought , and as " foreshadowing the Son of Man " ; the Messiah 's pre-existent state before the creation of the world is asserted therein ; the Epistle of Jude quotes Enoch 's prophecy as from an authentic ( but lost ) book ; the Books are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries B.C. , and to have drawn upon very ancient writings . The cosmic concepts of Enoch embodied such as the following : ? The souls of humanity were created before the founda-tion of the world and their future places in heaven were assigned ? or in hell for the wicked : man 's name was derived from the four quarters of the world ; his body was compounded of the seven substances ; he was created originally good and free-will was given him with instruction in the two ways ? of light and of darkness , upon which he was left to direct his own development and destiny , and that following the way of evil , the bias of the flesh , death came as the wages of sin " : and he // represents the angels as interceding on behalf of man . He was , the first scientist and author . Were Enoch or En-me-dur-an-ki and Ea associated ? Ea was called En-ki , as if a contraction of En . . ki . The name sippar , Habur ( Eridu ) or Abu Shahrim is analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nu Dimmud , and Sippar is Birs Nimrud , which is but Nu Dimmud again ; the attributes of the two personages are the same ? gifts to mankind , divination , revelation of the secrets of the universe , writing . Sippar also claimed to be the first home of man . Commentators , too , suggest that Noah was really Enoch , the name altered by a scribe 's error ; in the Elohim Genesis account the Flood is given as of 365 days , the number of days in the solar year and of the years of Enoch . No doubt the future will yield clearer comment of these matters . ( The ancient wisdom comes down the ages ; origin and destiny are one : truth comes in cycles and when most needed ; the Antediluvian Enoch or Enmeduranki set forth axiomatic truth ; the British Enock to-day translates such through the Etymon ) . The great cities of Babylonia were sacred places , all had temple ziggruats , but some were small . The Babylon temple-tower was E- Sagila , " temple of the high head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eridu , ? with its shrine the " temple of the foundation of heaven and earth , " probably the Tower of Babel ( there was probably a Babel tradition in Sumer as well as Genesis ) though that at Borsippa , close to Babylon ( Birs Nimroud ) may have been it , the scene of the confusion of tongues and dispersal of mankind . E- Sagila was a massive temple ( Herodotus ) 400 yards on each side , the tower within being a step-pyramid of seven stages with a winding ascent . This reached the top chapel or shrine ? but there was no statue in this , for it // was regarded as the abode of God ( or " the God " ) , , but in the lower one was a great statue of BelMerodach . The lowest stage was 300 feet by 110 ( Smith ) , the others diminished , and the whole arose 300 feet above the plain ( 15 gar ) . Four gates gave entrance to the base-platform , facing the cardinal points . The object of the ziggurats was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is stated in Genesis x. ) , and it was thought that the god would come down into the top sanctuary , which was thus a stepping-stone between heaven and earth . Sacrifices ? of lambs to Marduk , etc. ? were offered in these temple towers , but it is not stated that such took place at the top ; probably not ; and this was said to be in imitation of Ut-Napistim , the Babylonian Noah who offered incense on coming out of the Babylonian ark ? ina zikkurat sade , " on the peak of the mountain " ( which seems to give mountain=ziggurat ) . The Patriarch says : " I sent forth to the four winds , I poured out a libation , I made an offering on the peak of the mountain . Seven and seven I set incense-vases there . I poured therein scented wood ( ? ) ... . The gods smelled a sweet savour . The offering of the Babylonian Noah was a bloodless one , of vegetable produce only . Attention is here drawn to this empty sanctuary on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbade the sacrifice of animals , as in Isaiah , etc. ) , as shewing a pure concept of the god as a spirit who could not be represented by an image ( as in the Christian and some other religions ; the Inca , for example , where the concept of Ea seems to have existed , at Tiahuanako on Lake Titicaca ) ; whilst below in the great temple were chapels , statues , and sacrifices to Marduk and other gods , with a golden image to Marduk and the " Temple of the Oracle . " The Sumerian name of // Marduk 's temple tower was E-temen-an-ki , the original Etymon . In the Sumerian " Genesis , " the priest-king Ziudsuddu , priest of Ea or Enki of Eridu , was an individual of perfect piety and devotion , and as a reward the god saved him from the Flood , saying , " Life like that of a god will I give him , and an eternal soul will I create for him , " and this , the Sumerian Noah , was given the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gilgamesh epic his name is changed to Ut-Napishtim or Pa-Napistim , and I3erossus calls him Xisuthrus , His grandson who " set out for heaven to find him " was Gu-su-du-bar . ( Here are the four primary vocablea of the Etymon , and the names seem to be all one ? . as perhaps the individuals were ) . Recently archiuologists have laid bare the temple of Bettis , consort of the older Bel , at Nippur , and the raised road for religious processions called a-ibur-sabu , which led from the gate of Ishtar . This road name embodies the Etymon vocables , as does the name e-de-a-ba , meaning temple and heaven : with a-ibur-sabu compare the Latin obiter , death , from ob , by and iter , road , etc. ; and the word Paradise seems to be a reverse of E-de-a-ba ( as if ba-ra-di-su ) : bara , to create , etc . I offer a reference to the habitat concept . Bel 's temple and ziggurat was called Im-khar-sag , and this is a complex of " ziggurat , " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and his consort Beltis or Belit was Nin-khar-sag , " lady of the storm mountains . " Her title went to Ishtar , the great mother goddess , also to Marduk 's consort . At Nippur the Deluge tablet was found ( 1910 ) . With the name Saggila may be compared such words as sagacious , sacred , saga , sage , sag , to droop , as if devotional sign : Saggila would seem to be ziggurat ; also Sakkara , see later , Egypt . Borsippa , now Birs-Nimrud , somewhat south of // Babylon , was " a second Babylon " ; its patron was the god Nebo , son of Marduk , and the image of the son was solemnly carried across the river to Babylon at appointed ? New Year ? festivals ( compare " festival " as the Etymon ) and the father's. image accompanied the son 's part of the way back again . Nebo was a water deity , also god of writing , with charge of the tablets of fate on which human destinies were decided , or he recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Marduk 's temple . This is but Ea again . The Birs ruin to-day is the most striking in Irak , rising 100 feet from the plain , its summit a mass of vitrified or fused brick  --  the destroyed Tower of Babel in Arabic and Jewish tradition ; the remains of the enormous ziggurat of E-Zida , temple of Nebo , in seven storeys , called the " house of the seven divisions of heaven and earth , " seven solid terraces diminishing in size upwards from the platform , the lowest being 272 feet on the square ( excavated by Rawlinson in 1854 ) . On the adjacent mound , according to the Hebrew legend , Nimrod strove to throw Abraham into a burning fiery furnace , but God saved him ; and a shrine marks the spot to-day . Zida would be sagila and ziggurat , a contraction . Lagash was a Sumerian city of great importance in the 4th millennium B.C. ; and its excavation shewed how a great temple of those times was a great industrial , commercial , agricultural and stockraising establishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its operations as an economic centre of life . Entema was king : E- Ninnu was the patron deity ; one quarter of the city had a name like that of Nineveh . The origin of the last name is uncertain ; the goddess was Nina ; the ideogram a fish enclosed in the sign for a house , and as nunu in Semitic means " fish " Assyriologists have suggested a pre-Semitic " pun , " or else a word meaning " lowland . " But // as nu-nu =fish I offer this as well as the lowland idea as pointing to the Eridu cult as having supplied it ; Nu Dimmud or Ea , whose ideogram was a fish , as god of the Deep . In Genesis , Nineveh was built by Nimroud ; compare Nu-Dimmud . Ashur became the supreme god , embodying his predecessors , of the warlike Assyrians . ( Compare his name as Ea-shar ) . The seven Creation tablets were found at Nineveh ( Smith , half a century ago ) ; the last , a hymn to Marduk , w-as completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was recited during the vernal equinox or New Year ; an elaborate ritual . " The hing entered the temple of Bel-Merodach , his insignia was stripped off , he was smitten on the cheek by the high priest , a symbol that he was for the moment not a king but a slave of the god ; a miracle play or sacrament was enacted ( it explains classical references to the " tomb of Bel " ) ; Bel was bound , wounded to death , consigned to the grave , descended into hell , a malefactor being executed with him ; the blood of the god was washed from his body and his garments taken to . Bettis ; the women made lamenta-tion , tumult fell on the city , the door of the tomb was forced and Bell rose again from the dead . This execution as a sin-offering is referred to the older Tammuz , who it was believed was so slain and rose again ; a creed which came down from earliest time on the River of Life . The name Tammuz in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Osiris ( who is seen to be the Egyptian Marduk ) , had a similar belief . Our word Easter is seen here to embody Fla-shar , Tammuz , Ishtar , Osiris , East ; though the dictionary gives Anglo Saxon Eostre , of Teutonic n i vt hology , goddess of Spring . Easter was not originally connected with Christianity . // THE ORIGIN OF RELIGION THESE considerations of Etymon history and places inevitably lead on to a comparison of religious concepts , for Origin and Destiny are one . Bible commentators have realized that certain expressions in the Wisdom Literature of the Old Testament have Babylonian affinities , but they have not realized the extent of this . There can be no doubt that much of the Psalms , Proverbs , Job , etc. , display concepts that are too old , too primitively wise to be Hebrew . For example , in the Book of Proverbs , Wisdom apostatized says : " Doti ' not wisdom cry And understanding put forth her voice ? In the top of high places , where the paths meet Beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming in at the doors , Unto you , 0 men , I call , my voice is to the sons of men .

I , wisdom , have made subtility my dwelling And find out knowledge of witty inventions . The fear of the Lord is to hate evil . I walk in the way of righteousness , In the midst of the paths of judgment . The Lord possessed me as the beginning of his way Before his works of old . I was set up from everlasting , from the beginning , Or ever the earth was ; When there were no depths 1 was brought forth ; When there were no fountains abounding with water , Before the mountains were settled Before the hills , was I brought fort ' , While as yet he had not made the earth , nor fields , Nor the beginning ( or sum ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or prepared ) the heavens , I was there ; When he set a circle ( vault ) upon the face of the deep ; When the fountains of the deep became strong ; When he gave to the sea its bounds , When he marked out the foundations of the earth ; Then I was by him as a master workman ; // And I was daily his delight , Rejoicing always before him , Rejoicing in his habitable earth ; And my delight was with the sons of men . Whoso findeth me findeth life . . . Wisdom hath builded her house , She hath hewn out her seven pillars . . . " This is surely the imagery of Ea-Marduk ; and the references to the top of high places must be to the ziggurat , the meeting place of heaven and earth , " " the lofty house " ; and " where the paths meet " to the religious and other roads converging upon it , arid the gates , entrances , doors , paths , righteous , not crooked , to the religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven stories of the ziggurat , and the whole system and archi-tecture of the Babylonian religious structures . Commentators remark that in Proverbs none of the features of Hebrew history is seen : Israel and the Law are not referred to , nor temple , prophet or idolatry , and except for mention of Yahweh the Book could not be assigned to any special Semitic people . Proverbs xxx . says " And I have not learned wisdom , neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One . Who hath ascended up into heaven , and descended ? Who hath gathered up the wind in his fists ? Who hath bound the waters in his garment . . . . . What is his name , and what is his son 's name , if thou knowest ? " These are " the words of Agur the son of Jakeh , the Oracle . " Compare Marduk and his miraculous garment and winds , and the Oracle Temple of the ziggurat . ( Agar would be augur and ; Taker oracle ? the same words ) . In Job an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrographic , meteorological , etc. ; the Earth is spoken of as " hanging on nothing " ( xxvi . ) : " And Abadon bath no covering . Ile stretcheth out the earth over empty space And hangeth the earth upon nothing . // He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds And the cloud is not rent under them . He bath described a boundary on the face of the waters Unto the confines of light and darkness ; He stirreth up the sea with his powers And by his understanding he snriteth through Rahab , His hand bath pierced the swift dragon . " Here is the Sumerian and then the Babylonian concept ; Rahab=Hubur or Tiamat , r , h=t , and the word dragon is also the Etymon , ( perhaps a reduplicate Tiaw-Tiaw ) . Again , in xli. , Leviathan " is identified by commentators with the chaos-monster Tiamat and " Behemoth " with her consort Kengu ; but it is here seen that they are the same names Tiamat and Hubur , for t=1 ; b , v=m ; Behemoth would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge beast " ( we see " huge " and " beast " as the same words ) . In Genesis I. the word cattle is behemah . In the above passage of Job God says , " Behold now behemoth which I made with thee . . . . he is the chief of the ways of God ( or the beginning of the ways of God , as also translated ) : He only that made him can make his sword to approach unto him . " Here surely is the Marduk sword and concept . Compare Psalm lxxxix. ( which the Talmud connects with Abraham ) as of Babylonian origin , revealing the Marduk Council , or , rather , with Jah = Ea : ( which itself of course represented an original Dimmer or deity concept ) : " And the heavens shall praise thy wonders , 0 Lord ; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones . For who in the skies can be compared unto the Lord ? Who among the , sons of the mighty is like unto the Lord ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones And to be feared of all them that are round about him . 0 Lord God of Hosts , Who ins a mighty one like unto thee , 0 Jah ?

The heavens are thine , and the earth also ; The world and its fulness , thou bast founded them . Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name . " // Here " the assembly of the holy ones , " the sons of the mighty , " ( sons of God , or gods , R.V. , margin ) , " the pride of the sea , " " broken Rahab ( Tiamat , Hubur ) in pieces , " etc. , can only have been taken from the Babylonian concept . And Tabor and Hermon not merely rejoice in thy name but , in the Etymon , are the Name . In the Boole of Enoch there is a curious statement that in the time of Jared wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rahab also= Egypt ) . The above passage may be compared with the Babylonian Ea-Marduk address , when the gods were in council : " Thou art mightiest among the great gods . . . We give thee kingship over the entire universe . . . Thou art the weightiest among the gods . . . Thy word be exalted . . . be established . . . Thy weapon be not overcome . . For destruction and creation speak , and it shall be done . The place of thy worship will be established . 0 lord , the life of him who trusts in thee will be spared . But pour out the life of the god who has planned evil ( Tiamat ) . " Here surely we see , addressed to the heathen Babylonian deity an echo of man 's earliest address to the original universal Deity . And Psalm viii. : " Of old thou hast laid the foundation of the earth And the heavens are the work of thy hands : They shall perish but thou shalt endure : Yea , all of them shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou change them : And they shall be changed . " Is the simile of a garment borrowed here from Marduk 's miracle of changing a garment , to shew his power ? The reference in Genesis to " giants in the earth in those days , " and the sons of God with the daughters of men and their offspring , the " mighty men of old , men of renown " has been much discussed . These are also translated // Nephilim . " Here is the Nu Dimmud Etymon , I suggest , ( as in the other Hebrew equivalents of Uibborim , Rephaim , Anakim , Emmim , Zuzimor Zamzummins ) . Commentators have drawn distinction between the perhaps degenerate descendants of Cain and those of Seth , from which last the patriarchs descended , as " Sons of God . " Perhaps these made their way over the earth , it has been suggested , as " Enochian priests " before the Flood . That men were the sons of deity is stated in the Psalms ( xxxxii. ) , which was quoted by Christ ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gods , " when on assertion of His Godhead the Jews thought to stone Him . Ecclesiastes , commentators point out , is altogether of Elohim not Yahweh character . The author 's designation Qoheleth signifies merely Lecturer or Professor . It chews a very ancient and pessimistic religion with life as an illusion , without Messianic hope , for good and wicked alike , a never-ending cycle and an impersonal God manifested in the process of nature , as if the Lecturer or Professor had reached the end of all things in religious thought ( not unlike the modern professor or material scientist ! ) ; history repeats itself and there is " nothing new under the son , " whilst the " tears of the oppressed " and man 's " oppression under the sun " as he says , shew him that human nature does not change ? as we of the Twentieth Century may also see , in our social and political life . He says that competition is as inhuman as tyranny , all labour and skilful work is but the cause of envy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no comforter . " He speaks of the panting steeds of the sun 's chariot . He makes " puns , " or what commentators describe as such , as in " a good name ( shem ) is better than ointment ( shemen ) . " ( But is this not an Etymon " pun " ? ) Perhaps he had pondered the fruitless Messiahship // of Marduk and the bygone Golden Age , giving him vanity ( =vapour ) as his key-word . But his language is poetical and beautiful , and in saying " one higher regardeth " perhaps he is not necessarily referring to an earthly king . * * * In comparing the Sumerian-Babylonian and the Hebrew creation accounts and the respective religions we are inevitably brought to consider their similarity ; and we can not escape the conclusion that much of the Ifebrew religion and the Wisdom Literature and Psalms , with the whole scheme of man 's relations with Deity and heaven are really of Sumerian or Euphratean origin , and not Hebrew . And why should we wish to escape it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of Deity and Life back to the utmost limit and origin of human knowledge and existence rather than considering it as a more or less isolated or sudden thing developed by the Hebrews , who were a people of a mere yesterday in comparison with the intelligent life of man on the globe ? This is one of the great truths that emerge from the axiom that Origin and Destiny are one . We are at the close of an Age . Truth rejuvenates itself . To repeat The Hebrews were a vehicle of knowledge of the One God ? despite their continual apostasy and dishonour , as Bible history impartially records ? but it must have been derived or carried on from the older source across the Syrian desert , Babylonia . Monotheism , the original and natural creed of Man , of Sumerian man , had hopelessly degenerated under the Babylonian and Assyrian , and had to be implanted in a new soil by the Babylonian Abraham of Ur , the monotheist , or servant of a One God , as Bible history records ; it was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentators shew that the Hebrew concept of Yahweh as a tribal , arbitrary , anthropomorphic Deity was developed by 11.4 THE ETYMON the prophets into the benevolent , all-pervading spirit ; but the religion under the Pharisees once more " lost its savour , " and became a thing of law and ceremony ; " the washing of pots and pans " : until in the Person of the expected Messiah a new access of Truth appeared ? rejected , however , by the Hebrews . ( Christ was Aramaic rather than Hebrew ) . The history of man as given in Genesis to the time of Abraham was of course mainly " Sumerian " history ? and in those few pages may be crowded perhaps hundreds of thousands of years , a history carried down orally until written down . Adam , Eve , Enoch , Noah , and all those Patriarchs were of course Sumerians , not Hebrews . The Hebrews sought t , o have Jehovah as their own exclusive Deity , but that pretension was overthrown by Isaiah and by the Messiah , a " light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , a truly " scientific " aspect of religion : for Jehovah was the universal God of all the world of mankind ; and this was surely an inevitable reversion to the original monotheistic truth . ( The Laws of Moses commentators have connected with the great code of Hammurabi , the Babylonian ) . The remarkable analogy which exists between the circumstances surrounding the advent and acts of the Messiah and those of the Sumerian or Babylonian deities Ea and Marduk can not be overlooked ; it is as if the earlier had " pre-reflected " the later ? and in a way far more striking than any Hebrew prophet did . The concepts of God as the Father and as the Son ; the Son as the Redeemer ; the sacrifice or Atonement , and all else have their counterpart in this " prophetic myth " as recorded in the cuneiform inscriptions , ages before the Christian era . The Magi or Wise Men of the East , Babylonia , came of set purpose and in mysterious fashion as taking part in an Event of which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Christ as a " clever philosopher " adapted His course to these matters of prophecy ( whether Babylonian or Hebrew ) and so claimed to be the Son of God and Redeemer and persuaded man so ; but all else apart , a common sense con-sideration of the whole circumstance would shew the impossibility of that . The theologist says " the question Who is Jesus Christ ' has been pushed to the very end " and describes the " modernist " as " pointing to this Central Person as surrounded by serious uncertainty and a mass of traditional and unreliable recollections , and unhesitatingly affirming that the Gospel Jesus is an Ideal Figure evolved out of the flotsam of other faiths and personified in the corporate imagination of the Early Church , the Christ Myth . ' The modernist is confronted by the Evangelist , who sometimes goes to the opposite extreme with an intensive Christ-worship , such as the Messiah did not ask for , and , regarding " Faith " as alone sufficient , tends to segregate religion from the economic machinery of life . Both Modernist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless the true principles of a theocentrie economic system are advanced , at this tremendous time of change , disbelief and economic discontent . The Modernist says , in effect , " Jesus Christ is not really God and Man ; He represents only a biological advance on man , just as man represents a biological advance on the ape . " The upholders of " Christ-myth " theories and " Nature-cult " origins endeavour to shew that there is nothing new in Christ or Christianity ( Krishna , Adonis , Tammuz , Osiris , etc. , are advanced ) . The Christian theologist regards Christ as gathering up in his Person all the ancient spiritual and cosmic concepts , applying the following among other descriptions : ? Son of God , Son of Man , all // things summed up in and subject to , Atoning Sacrifice , Mediator , Consummation of Prophecy , Blood Atonement , Creator of the Universe , Endless Life , Firstborn of the Dead , Heir of all things , Human destiny attained through , Image of God , New Covenant , Light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comforter , Advocate , Second Adam , Aeon , Fulness ( Pleroma ) of Time , Sun of Righteousness , I.H.S. , etc . The Church says that . God is always being revealed , and Christ is always pictured as having existed before the beginning of the world ; " In the beginning was the Word " which was with God and was God , and through which everything was made , was life , and the light was the life of men , " the light shined in the darkness but the darkness al , prehended ( overcame ) it not . " The Psalm x. says " Thou art my son ; this day have I begotten thee " and " Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek , " quoted in Acts and in Hebrews prefaced by " For unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art ' . . . " etc . Melchidezek is represented as a mysterious and solitary figure " having neither beginning of clays nor end of life , without father or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest of God Most High , " in Genesis ; and commentators are undecided " whether to term him a historical or an ancient legendary figure ; Philo treated him as an allegory of the Logos ; Salem might have been ( afterwards ) Jerusalem or a place on the eastern side of Jordan . " In the present etymology : the name Melchizedek seems to be the Etymon and to embody Marduk , and Salem is the Etymon or Tiam . The name Immanuel , " God is with us , " is the Etymon and expresses an eternal concept . The words anoint , chrisma , holy oil , the meaning and practice goes back to Sumerian times ; the name Messiah means anointed and is the Etymon . All sacred names // may be similarly traced . A word or name reveals u concept , and if the word exists the concept must always have existed . The word redeem is seen to embody Nu Dimmud . Why not regard the ancient " parallels " as pre-reflects or prophecies of the actual occurrence ; we are not bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and space ? And the acts and philosophy of Christ none can read impartially without saying : Here is the divine , the non-human . " We may well think that . the Sumerian creation story was based upon some true cosmic concept , now lost , but which became debased and over-personified , as this Etymon history shews in all mythologies in every part of the globe . Even in the Book of Revelation ( xiii. , etc. ) we find an extraordinary complex , which commentator &; can not explain , of imagery concerning " Rahab and the Dragon , " the " Beast , " the " River , " the Earth , the number seven , etc. , with matters pertaining to Christ . The author is unknown , it is not possible to believe him to be the same John of the Gospel , and his vision on Patmos Isle is an enigma . Michael and his Angels , the war in heaven , the fight with the dragon or serpent , who is overcome , the rejoicing in heaven at the event can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Etymon Michael would seem to be the same name Marduk . He appears in the Apocalyptic Books of Daniel and Enoch , and in the latter holds the secret of the mighty " word " by which God created heaven and earth ; he is the greatest of all the angels : the name Michael is given as meaning " Who is God ? " ; he is the antagonist of Sammael the enemy of God . This name for Satan would seem to be Tiamat , s=t . In Revelation the composite beasts from the abyss , etc. , may represent Tianiat 's brood . There is nothing offensive to the Christian religion in this consideration ; rather , as discussed below , it strengthens it . // BETHLEHEM . The origin of this name is given as meaning " House of Bread " ; Beth=house , the Babylonian word Bit I1u , house of a god , and common in Palestine ; but a more ancient origin gives " House of Lakhmu , " and the modern name is Beit-laham . With Lakhmu may be compared the Sumerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene of the Nativity is a limestone cave in the high ridge ( 2,500 feet above sea level ) which formed the stable of the Inn or caravanserai . This cave must have been a habitation for Palwolithic man , in earliest times , like all the Palestinian and other caves . ( In 1925 a Palmolithic fossil skull was found in a cave at Tabgha , Tiberias ) . Bethlehem was the " City of David , " he was born there : he is the only loan of his name ? David ? in the Bible : compare David=Diinrnud . Beth-Abara , where Christ was baptised was " beyond Jordan . " There seems to have been the idea in this sacred history of keeping the Hebrew or at least the Pharisee-Hebrew element , ( and the " generation of vipers " ) at arm 's length , and to approximate to Mesopotamian things . Abraham sent specially to Mesopotamia for Isaac 's wife : the Gentiles . John the Baptist was under no delusion about Pharisee or Jewish privilege of Abrahauiic lineage . " Why , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones around you ! " He meant it was not a question of race but of character . John was a desert-dweller , by choice , a " spiritual geographer " in his concepts ; and he detested the hypocrisy of his times , which he knew marked the close of an Age ( something like the present day which now tends to become one of religious and economic chaos ) . Christ went into the desert ; then into " Galilee of the Gentiles , " which region the Jews had despised ; Isaiah had said that there the " great light " to lighten the Gentiles would appear ; he // proclaimed that a son and a child is born , whom he calls " Mighty Counsellor , Everlasting Father " ( as the real translation is ) . Now this utterance is regarded by commentators as that of the later Isaiah ; and so it is logical to think that the prophet was influenced by the Babylonian prophetic imagery and that in his prediction of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redeemer and Counsellor . It is to be reflected once more that the referring of these sacred matters to their ultimate origin will add to their strength , and help to confute that growing school of modernist thought which speaks of the " Christ-myth . " They will most greatly support Christianity who seek to establish the ultimate truth thereon . As already remarked , the Apocalyptic Book of Enoch asserts the existence of the Messiah " before the Creation of the world " and this is the Christian theological view ? which will suffer nothing by associating Isaiah 's utterances with the Babylonian concept , itself drawn as here averred from an original , remote and purer universalist concept , which Isaiah realized had to be brought ere long to actual and material occurrence . Thus we have to consider a " new " aspect of Isaiah 's utterances . Commentators recognize two ( or three ) Isaiahs . The second or Deutero-Isaiah was the " unknown prophet " of the Exile in Babylonia , and he begins with Chapter xl . It can not be doubted that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or henotheism : and he broadens the whole basis of religion ? a God of the Earth . He constantly speaks of the " Ancient things , " and of the creation of the heavens and the earth in what are terms of Sumerian imagery . " Have ye not understood the foundations of the earth ? . . . Declare the former things . . . declare the things that may come hereafter , that we may know that // ye are gods " ; a taunt , and Isaiah continually upbraids the Israelites for their graven images , which were made even as late as his time , 740 B.C. He speaks of " Yahweh 's servant " who shall bring judgment to the earth and to the Gentiles , a light of the Gentiles . " This can not be Israel . " Behold the former things are come to pass . . . The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man of war I will make darkness light . . . Who as I shall declare it and set it in order for me , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's idol follow , and Cyrus is eulogised ) . " Bel boweth down , Nebo stoopeth . . . Remember the former things of old , for I am God and there is none else , declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things that are not yet done . . . I have declared the former things from of old ; yea , they went forth out of my mouth . . . suddenly I did them and they came to pass . . . I have sheaved the new things from this time , even hidden things , which thou hast not known . They are created now , and not from of old . . . lest thou shouldest say , Behold I knew them " ( that is declared now lest Israel should attribute them to the power of their idols ) . " The Lord bath made my mouth like a sharp sword ( Yahweh 's servant ) , Yea , he saith , it is too light a thing that thou shnuldst be my servant to raise up the tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles , that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth . " Then Isaiah says : " Awake , awake , put on strength , 0 arm of the Lord ; awake as in the days of old , the generations of ancient times . Art thou not it that cut Rahab in pieces , that pierced the dragon ? " This last reference is surely to the Marduk-Tiamat account , and shews that Isaiah associated it with Yahweh . Of course he identifies Yahweh as the // " Holy One of Israel " ? and of all the world , and the " Redeemer . " Past , present and future are all in his mind ; and the Hebrew language and verbs peculiarly lend themselves to this universalist time-concept . Jeremiah , Ezekiel and later prophets all seem to have been influenced from Babylon too . The Hebrew religion was mainly until late a henotheism ? a Chief God among other gods . Here , then , in this " Galilee of the Gentiles or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and here the Sermon on the Mount was preached and great miracles wrought . Could such a prophet come out of Galilee ? " the Jews asked slightingly . But why not ; it was most appropriate ; it lay between East and West ; a borderland between Euphratean and Hebrew cultures . Not some mighty king of a Jerusalem ? of whose wondrous temple soon after not one stone was to be left upon another , but the " Heir of all the Ages " born humbly in a cave ( which had sheltered even our Stone Age ancestors ) because there was " no room in the inn . " The Astrologers of Babylonia , Wise Men of the East , were looking at their sky ; a " new planet swam into their ken , " reflected perhaps in the waters of the River of Life , the Euphrates ; they were scientific star gazers ; they may have been astonished ? much as our Astronomer Royal who dwells on the Meridian of Greenwich would be at a big new star , ? but they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient cosmology : they hastened after it : " Sages leave your contemplations Brighter visions gleam afar ! Seek the great desire of nations " In Galilee of the Gentiles arises solitary Tabor , with its Etymon name ; and dolmens , etc. , chew the antiquity of this land , with its deep rift-valley sea . The Wise Men brought gold ? the gift for a king ; frankincense ? possibly such as the Babylonian s // Noah offered up ; myrhh ? the portent of burial . The whole circumstance is of the utmost " scientific " interest . The fact that Christ was rejected and destroyed by the Jews but accepted and perpetuated by the Gentiles is altogether in accordance with the eternal march of events ; and God was the God of the Euphrateans and of the Gentiles , not merely of the Jews ; though they inherited a special form of the Name . The " Gentiles " included our own ancient Britain , which in the time of Babylonian and Hebrew idolatry was living under a monotheism ? no idol has ever existed in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bronze Age ; and when Christianity came to this Island no country absorbed it more readily or in so pure a form . It has been well said that from the Bible something new is always appearing ; and the Christian Church has said of itself that it must expand or perish . Let it then take new truths to heartand in this year ? that has been called a Year of Destiny . " For Origin and Destiny are one . And let us reflect that in the untold ages of the world yet to come , every truth and untruth must be laid bare : the waves of time will wash clean the shore of circumstance . We now pass to the consideration of deities and creeds all over the globe , which I offer as reflects of the original Deity concept . Baalism ( Baal=Aba-ilu ) was the Canaanite worship of the powers of generation ; the creed that out of a self-existent chaos the heavenly planets and the earth sprang ; that from the procreative power of the sun , acting upon the fertile womb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen to be the degenerate concept ( and it became an " abomination " ) ? and it differs // little from the modern theory of Evolution , which in time may bring men back to a form of Baalworship ? perhaps the growing use of mascots on motor cars and aeroplanes shew the beginning of this cycle , as does the subserviance of almost all human activity to the god mammon or moneyworship . The name Canaan I give as the Kengo form of the Etymon . The gods of Egypt were also the powers of nature , Ehnemu , the moulder or creator of mankind ; Ptah the oldest of all : Tmu , the closer of day or night ; lihepera , the creator , and Bast associated with Ptah ; Mut , the universal mother ; Ra , sun god ; 1 I.armachis , rising sun ; Amen-Ra , " hidden god , " or Arisu ; Set , god of evil ; Thoth , scribe of the gods and inventor of numbers ; Seb , god of the sky , and Nut his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Osiris , who was the personification of all physical and moral good , and his wife Isis . Names and concepts are here seen to be merely forms of the Etymon : the Sumerian and Babylonian Dimmer , Ea , Tiamat , Apsu , Kengu ? a paler reflection of them shewing that Egypt took its concepts and nomenclature from Sumer . The Greeks , in the philosophy of Thales ( 644 13 . C. ) thought water was the vital principle in nature ; " all things are water , " water metamorphosed : he derived his wonderful knowledge from Assyria and Egypt , a reflect of Sumerian . Anaxiinander thought the principle was in air ; and another of the same philosophy that it was in the interpermeation of air and water . LOGOS . The concept of the Logos was a frequent one in the philosophy and theology of the Ancients , Persian , Egyptian , Indian , but mainly Hellenic or ( reek and Hebrew . The Greeks thought of the world as the product of and ruled by reason , a law of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of the spiritual Logos ; // this as Wisdom hypostatized or personified , the creative principle and power or spirit of God , and so to the Word and the Messiah-logos , and , as already discussed , the Word in the Targurns is Memra ( Ma'amar ) and Dibbura , as an anthropomorphic Name for God . PNEUMOS . For the Stoics there was a reason ( logos ) for everything in nature ; everything which exists is at once capable of acting and being acted upon ; so two principles ; a passive principle , under which a thing is susceptible of motion and modification , and an active principle , giving determinate quality ; force co-extensive with matter , pervading and occupying it and all space . A thing has quality ( as hard , bright , or soft , etc. ) by containing within its own substance the essence of these qualities ? qualities conceived as " air-currents " in various degrees of tension . Thus they conceived the animating principle of life not as immaterial but as material , a current of air or gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word in daily use in our pneumatic motor or bicycle tyres ) . Before there was heaven or earth there was Pneuma ? the primitive and eternal element . For the Stoics , Pneuma and God were thus identical . In the primitive Pneuma the state of utmost tension and heat resided . Heat is expansive ; the Pneuma could not ever withstand the internal force ; motion backwards and forwards once set up goes to cool the glowing mass of fiery vapour and to weaken the tension , and thereon follows the first separation of substance , of force and matter ; and so the emanation of the world from God ; and the germinal power , until then quiescent in the Pneuma-tension , proceeded to create the world . But the process is not eternal , but goes on only until the times of restoration of all things : the differentiation of force and matter is transitory and relative ; the created // world in time will decay , be absorbed in God , when , again , a new cycle will begin . The above Pneuma doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical schools , but it was a thought quite natural , whether to educated or uneducated minds of those times , that the air we breathe must be connected with life . When these old-time medicals first noted the difference between the arteries and the veins in a body , they also remarked that , in a corpse , the arteries were empty ; and so it was imagined they were passages for conveying Pneuma to the different parts of the body . ( The concept later had some influence in Jewish and Christian theology ) . So assuming that the properties of things and organisms were determined by the tension and quality of Pneuma therein , the different natures of higher or lower organisms were accounted for ? man , animal , plant , and mineral , etc . Even the spark from a flint was the last remnant of the Pneuma , not quite grown cold . The Logos was conceived as quick and powerful , sharper than a two-edged sword , dividing asunder the joints and the marrow . Tension produces dilation , or increase in distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . ( Indeed the Stoic doctrines and modern theories of matter approach each other ) . Finally , in their psychology , what God was for the world so was the soul for man . The cosmos was a single whole , its variety being varying stages of condensation in Pneama ; whilst the human soul was conditioned by the degrees of tension residing in it . From the centre of the body , that is , the heart , seven distinct air-currents are discharged to the various organs , which organs are the modes of the soul 's activity ; these Heven modes or derivative powers were ? the five senses ( sight , hearing , taste , touch , smell ) speech , and the reproductive faculty . Different grades of knowledge were different grades of tension of the // Pneuma ; virtue is its own good ; virtue is knowledge ; the wise man will live in conformity with nature ; he will have full self-control even in pain and misfortune . The concepts set forth in the Pneuma doctrine , its name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a reflect of the primeval chaosgoddess Tiamat or Mumur Hubur of Sumer , with its attributes attendant on her slaying by Merodach in the creation of the world , the cutting of her veins and the entrance therein of Me.rodach 's winds : but yet , whilst surely partaking in that allegory , there appear also the more spiritual elements of the Etymon , and the word Pneumos is seen to embody Nti lliii inu 1 . ( Compare the Kabbalah ) . Among the Greeks and Romans tho idea of Deity who had made all nature and its utilities and beauties ( such as they well appreciated ) diffused itself in myths and fables which were handed on as true . But they contained the concept of Personification . Ovid sang of chaos : " Ere earth and sea and covering heaven were known The face of nature , o'er the world was one ; And men have called it Chaos , formless , rude ; The mass ; dead matter 's weight , inert and crude ; Where in mixed heap of all-compounded mould , The jarring seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth did not exist : sea , land and air were mixed ; the sea was not fluid nor the earth solid , nor the air light-giving . " No sun yet beamed from you cerulean height , No orbing moon repaired her horns of light ; No earth , self-poised , on liquid ether hung ; No sea its world-enclasping waters flung ; Nor earth was fixed , nor fluid was the deep ; Dark was the void of air ; no form was traced ; Obstructing atoms struggled through the waste : Where cold and hot and moist and dry rebelled Heavy the light and hard the soft repelled . ' The appearance of the careless deity Chaos who presided over this formless mass of primaeval stuff could not be described because there was no light // by which he could be seen and his wife who shared his throne , called Nyx or Nox , the goddess of Night , was even still more obscure . But at length they wearied of this unsatisfactory condition and called to being a son , Erebus ? whose name also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , and then came the two beautiful offspring Ether or Light , and Hemera or Day , who destroyed Erebus and took all power to themselves . Their light now first illuminated space , with all its confusion , and the two rulers , conscious of its vast possibilities for the production of beauty and utility called to being Eros , that is , Amor or Love ( their own child ) and by their combined efforts the sea or Pontus and the Earth or Gaea , Ge , Tellus , Terra , was created . This Earth was bare and motionless , but Eros shot his life-giving arrows and pierced its cold bosom , when the flowers , trees , birds , animals , fishes , etc. , sprang to being , and life , motion and joy reigned ; whilst Gaea created Uranus or Heaven . The Earth was regarded as a disc , not a sphere and the Greeks imagined their country as occupying the centre , with Mount Olympus in the middle , abode of their gods ; the Earth was divided into two parts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all around the Earth flowed the vast Oceanus river of " steady equable current , " stormless , from which the Sea and the Rivers derived their waters . And in the north of the Earth was a happy land , of the Hyperboreans , a people in perpetual bliss , a land inaccessible by sea , a people so virtuous that the gods themselves visited them ; and to the south an equally happy land , also near Oceanus ? that of " Ethiopia " ; whilst on this same marvellous all-encompassing river were the Isles of the Blest , whereto sainted mortals of virtuous lives were translated by the gods without // suffering death and lived in bliss throughout eternity . It is seen according to the present Etymon-history , that these concepts are simply derived from the Sumerian and Babylonian concepts , and with the appropriate vocable changes we have the same names ; and Ovid is practically quoting therefrom , and as if from Genesis . Chaos , with c , s  --  t , ao=m is Tiamat ; Erebus , Hemera , Eros are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Paradise , etc . The Polygamy , incest and assassination among these deities must be exonerated on the ground that they were geographical and atmospheric , as with Tiamat , Apse , etc . Olympus=Dimmer , Idima . All the classic Creek and Roman myths and names may be compared . Demeter or Thesmophoros , or " Mother Earth , " daughter of Cronus and Phea and sister of Zeus ; during the woman 's festival which celebrated the descent to and return from the Underworld of Demeter and Persephone women abstained from intercourse with their husbands . These names and concepts are those of the Etymon , Tiamat-Apsu , Tammuz-Ishtar . Diana , Artemis , Janus , goddess of childbirth , light and the Moon , called Lucuria , the " bringer of Light " ( compare Lahame ) , Saturn or Cronus , god of ancient Italy ; children of Sky or Uranus and Earth or Gaea. with the Cyclopes ; Cronus mutilates Sky with a curved sickle and from the blood sprang Furies and Giants ; Cronus swallowed his children , except Zeus ; all others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marduk story . Hermes , Cadmus , Corybantes , and Thaumas , Prometheus , Venus , Apsrodite , and Themis . The Danaides were fifty girls who killed their husbands , the fifty sons of Egyptus , on their wedding night , and in punishment were condemned to carry water in broken urns to fill a bottomless vessel-given as referring to the inundating waters of Egypt , which again // born up in the clouds fall once more to the river and sea in a ceaseless cycle . The name is the Etymon , like the concept . Prometheus or " forethought " son of the Titan Iapetos ( compare Tutu-Ea ) brother of Epimetheus or " afterthought " was he who stole the celestial fire from Olympus to benefit mankind , the inventor of arts and creator of mankind out of clay ; Jupiter chained him to a rock , from which Hercules delivered him . Polyphemus , a son of Neptune ( neptune=NuDimmud ) one of the celebrated Cyclops of Sicily , crushed the lover of Galatea because she would not love him and imprisoned Ulysses in a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship when he escaped . Sicily was part of the Mediterranean Italy-Africa isthmus in Paleolithic times , and perhaps this refers to the geographical severance . Themis was the companion of Zeus : she was the personification of justice , whose ' duty it was to summon the assemblies of gods and men ; mother of the fates Horae and Moirae : her antithesis was Hybris , personification of the encroachment on the rights of others ; Themis and Nemesis followed on the " track " of the wrongdoers ? her name was also " track " ; she prescribed what was right in divine law ; she was a " doom , " " that which is laid down , " which as a thing was the body of rules and precedents laid down at the beginning of the world to guarantee harmony and order . The name and concept I offer as the Etymon , Dimmer , Tam , Tiam , with Themi , the goddess of Truth , and the concept of the Gu-aba religious road . Pandora , the " queen of all , " was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first woman on earth , designed to work the ruin of man in revenge for the stealing of fire by Prometheus , benefiting man against the will of Jupiter ; her wonderful box contained every human ill , from which , opening it out of curiosity , she let them out ? Hope alone // remaining . Compare the Genesis and Sumerian or Babylonian stories of Eve , and Adapa . The word hope is seen to be the Etymon , Latin cupio , desire . In the Iliad the streams of Oceanus were the source of all the gods , and Oceanus and Mother Tethys ( compare Tiamat , teats ) were the parents of the immortals ( compare Genesis , giants ) . Apollo , one of the most important and many-sided of the Greek Olympian gods : but etymologists have not been able to give any origin to his name . They have not gone far back enough . His name and attributes are seen in the Etymon , and the word " assembly " generally given falls to the ground . He was a god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued by the jealous - Hera , hare him under a palm tree ; a god of agriculture and forests , and called Erythibius ; Napaeus ; god of law , or Nomies ; ruler of time , or Horomedon ; god of healing , physician and seer , or Iatromantis ; and Aesculapius , and also " physician of the soul " ( see also Egypt ) : " god of the broad sea " or Euryalus ; " protector , " etc . But these names and attributes are seen to embody Ea , Aa , Nu Dimmud : Tatromanti , i=e , t=m=Ea Dimmud ; also Eridu is seen : whilst the name Apollo=ab-ilu , son of god , in the present etymology . If we knew the whole history of Ea , the anology would be closer ? the original story of the birth of a god of light . The creator of much of the Grecian mythology was Homer . Was he himself a myth ? Classicists tell us that no record , real or pretended , ever existed as to the time when he lived ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is simply the Etymon man name , or Gomer , the Cimmerian , son of Japheth ( thought to be progenitor of the Celts ) , and his fables merely echoes of the Sumerian , interwoven with geological and hydrographic cataclysms , such as those which separated the Mediterranean , // Black Sea and Euboea , etc . Such speculations , however ) are endless . The Sumerian , Babylonian , Greek and other concepts of eternal bliss , Elysium , Paradise , the Isles of the Blest , etc. , are beautifully set forth in modern Christian thought ; things which Eye hath not seen nor Ear heard , and in our popular hymns : ? " Waft , waft ye winds his story " ; " Angels sing on . . . sing us sweet fragments of the songs above " ; ' 0 home of fadeless splendour. " " ' ! ' liou bast no chore , fair ocean , Thou hast no time , bright day ! " And are not our concepts of space and time only finite ? HEAVEN and HELL . The concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hebrews ? from whom we are supposed to draw our religion ? had little or no idea of heaven , or it developed only towards the last : they had a gloomy Sheol , hell or underworld , where the spirit might live a joyless and feeble life ( and whence necromancers might summon the soul back at times ) , as had also the Babylonians and others . All this is in reality merely a degenerated idea . The Sumerian or primmval religion of man , of Dimmer , Elohim , Yahweh , as in the pre-Abraham Genesis and ( still obscure ) Euphratean cult of preBabylonia assuredly believed in a happy Heaven , where mortals would go ? if they deserved it . Even our Stone Age ancestors believed in the Spirit World , and all " savages " think of heaven , and simple natives of the " Isles of the Blest " all over the world . The idea of an absolute cutting-off of the human spirit , vitality or individuality the Sumerians regarded as illogical ? just as any sensible Christian to-day would regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the " laws of continuity " ? telelogical  --  alone would make for // a heaven . Nor is the mere absorption in a Nirvana like the Indian religion of any logical satisfaction , nor yet the sensuous heavens of other faiths . The belief in heaven and hell is logical and eternal . As for the latter place , we should be sorry for anyone to go there ! But it is a matter of cosmic justice : action and reaction are equal and opposite , in the ethereal or moral as in the physical world , and the remedy lies in the hand of the individual himself or herself , upon their own acts . ( At least . we hope in hell there will be another chance ! ) . Men complain of evil in the world : they are inclined to-day to " blame God " for it : how could a merciful God , they say for example , permit the horrors of the Great War , or other forms of cruelty and oppression ? But this is rattier childish . From the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rain necessarily " falls on the just and the unjust , " both ; for all these greater evils ( excepting natural catacylsms and at present incurable diseases ) are the work of man himself , due to his stupidity or greed , and lie can alter them when he will ; and that will be when . he learns to adjust the social-economic structure upon " scientific " lines , grasping the logic of the cosmos . A " Golden Age " is nothing more than this , and will be found to be a theocentric economic system , as elsewhere " prophesied " here : a system readily attainable moreover ? when man is intelligent enough to see the truth about life ! The fact is , that the more complicated and " modern " civilization becomes , the more wonderful its buildings , appliances and inventions , the more does the concept of Deity recede . It was so with Babylon , Jerusalem , Greece , Rome , Egypt . A ' simple civilization ? especially as against a grasping commercialistic and mechanically-propelled one , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth both of body and spirit . A man and // woman could live in a but or cave ? or cottage ? and yet represent the highest attributes of life . And in these pages it will be seen ( as far as space will permit ) that the concept of a Golden Age on earth and a heavenly home beyond exists and always existed among primitive peoples . Where did they obtain it ? The answer has already been given . It is the modern " ' civilization " which throws discord among us , individual against individual , individual against community . We must return to the " simple life " ( for , to repeat , Origin and Destiny are one ) ; the sociologist , the statesman , the economist , the theologist ( and the League of Nations ) are groping in the dark . However , as this is not a treatise on sociology , the " dismal science , " we must proceed , for a long ; journey still lies before us . Fortunately this Etymon-vehicle is a magic thing ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them ; or like a magic carpet or enchanted canoe takes us where we will . We turn to many parts of the globe and find the Etymon names and concepts in varying forms . The Iranian legends of the Avesta , Gathas , sacred hymns , picture a first Man called Caiomarth or Gayamaretan , meaning " living mortal , " or an original pair called Mashia and Mashiana , ( compare the Etymon , also Isba , Ish , Adam , Eve , Adapa ) ; in a first home called Airya Vareja , an abode of perpetual happiness wherein man lived under a pure religion in constant intercourse with his Creator ( a Golden Age ) . The Creator of the universe and lord of light and beneficence was Ahura Mazda or Ahuma , given as from Maz , great , and da , knowledge . ( The Etymon again ) . The ancient Persian and Aryan deity names and concepts include Asura , Mithras , the dragon-slayer Verethraghna ; Apam Napal , the " Water-shoot " ; the Mantra or // magical formula ; the druh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athravan or priesthood of fire-kindlers , holders of sacred traditions ( compare Arthurian legends and name , etc. ) and mediators with heaven ; the Thractona battle against a fearful serpent ( compare Tiamat ) ; Yama , the first man of Vivasant ; the Thamanaens people or Aryans ; Anahita Ardvisura of the Oxus ; the divine Haoma or Soma drink , or Ambrosia ( Nectar and Ambrosia both meant drink ) ; the belief in an unwavering " rta " or order ( this is our word " order , " contracted ) ; etc . All these names are seen to be merely contortions of the Sumerian , a harping on the original string . The Iranian Zarathustra , ( Greek rendering Zoroaster ) , founder of the national Perso-Iranian religion , one of the , great teachers of the East , founder of the renowned wisdom of the iAIa.gi , given in the Avesta . Sonic regard hint as a historical personage , others as a myth or culture-figure ; some place him at 6,000 years before the time of Plato ; the Ancients say he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deity and had supernatural powers ; at his appearance all nature rejoiced ; Satan tempted him ; he fights with demons ; he withdrew from the world to solitude in a lonely mountain , which was consumed by fire , but he escaped and spoke to the multitude . Be was born on the river Darejya . In his religion the Wise Lord , Ahuro Mazdao or Orrnuzd is the primaeval spiritual being , existent before the world arose , from whom it emanated , by whom it is governed or guided ? the Holy Spirit , yet not free but hampered by the Evil Spirit whom he had banished , etc . The origin and meaning of the name Zarathrusta is unknown , but said to contain " camel , " ushtra . But I give it as simply the Etymon , a reduplicate : Zarathrustra=Tiawa-tiawa , and so Dimmer of NuDimmud : and the concepts are those of the original Genesis and Sumer. // We turn to the Hindu cosmic concepts . " By Indra the lights of the sky have been established : he has settled the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the waters ; he has supported the earth , the universal nurse ; by his skill he has propped up the sky from falling . The breath of the gods , the germ of the world , " etc. , as we find in The Vedas , the first literature of these people . And in the Avesta of the early Persians or Iranians the same concepts exist . The deities Brama , Vishnu and Siva form the supreme trinity - or triad : Brama the creator , Vishnu the preserver , Siva the destroyer . Siva is wor-shipped in the form of the linga or phallic emblem . The destroyer is really a re-creator also , because death is here a transition to a new form of life . In the Shiv or Siva worship the primal god is held as universal and perfect . For that reason he could do nothing ; he could not " create , " because to act requires both an agent and a material . Thus , wishing to create , he divided himself into two beings , the one possessing the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Devi ; and the symbol of the two powers is that represent-ing the combined male and female generative organs , the yoni-lingam or lingam . These matters , in detail , may appear obscene to European thought , but they are or were not necessarily so originally , but represent the primitive ideas of origin . Siva is also called Rudra or god of the storm , also Eapardin , meaning " with hair spirally braided like a shell . " It would appear that the linga-worship existed in India before the advent of the Aryans , and so from earliest time . Consorts of the triad gods are Sri or Lakshmi ; Umva or Parvati , the daughter of Himavat ; Bali , Du Durga , etc. ; ( com-pare these as but forms of the Sumerian cosmogomy and the Etymon ) . In Hindu legend the mighty flanges river sprang front the hair of Siva and // Rowed beneficently over the earth , and to-day the river is the proudest object of Hindu worship . In the concept of the Brahmanas , of Prajapati ( early conception ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essential oneness , the abstract notion of the Brahma as the highest cosmic principle , of an all-pervading , self-existent spiritual substance , the primary source of the universe . " The universe , indiscernible before , was made visible in the beginning by the sole and self-existent lord Brama : who , desirous of producing beings of a different nature from himself , created the waters by his own thought , and placed them in a seed which developed into a golden egg , whence was born Brahma , the parent of all the worlds . " This male deity , by his own thought , splitting the egg in two , fashioned of the two halves the heaven awl the sky , the eight regions ( or points of the compass ) and the perpetual place of the waters . Another myth makes Brahma born of a lotus which grew out of the navel of the god Vishnu whilst floating on the pristine waters . The cosmic egg concept is world-wide . The names India , from Sindhu , meaning river , and Indra , I offer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse ; Siva as Tiamat with her triad ; Devi ; Lakahmi as Lakhame , Umva , Brahma as the Etymon , and the whole concept of creation as a reflect of the Babylonian , and of this there can be , ' doubt , in this Etymon history : and such terms as Nirvana ( =Nu-Dimmud ) the " final goal " of this religion ; Karma , " the Way or Path " would be the Tani and Ed-e-aba or religious road of Babylonia : Jiva , soul , compare the Etymon and Yahweh , also Avatar , the incarnation of a deity on earth ; Mahatina ; Mataras , mother of gods ' wives ; Brahman was " holy man , " also " Unknown god . " The Hindu and Brahma cultures offer only vague differences : it is a concept // of an absolute all-embracing spirit , Brama , of neutral sex , being the one and only reality , unconditioned , constituting both origin and goal of every soul or jiva ( =living thing , compare Hawah , Ehyeh , Ea , etc. ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the Etymon ) and their ultimate reunion with the Paramatman or Supreme Self ; and the doctrine of the triple manifestation of the ceaseless working of that absolute spirit as a creative , constructive , and destructive principle , the divine Trimurti ( Triad ) of Brahma , ( masculine ) , Vishnu and Siva . The lastnained is a dreadful personage , at times benign , at times with dreadful sacrificial orgies , many-armed ( Here is Tiamat ) . The Hindu prayer , which the devotee chants unceasingly , the Mantra of Aum Mani Padme Hum , or " Hail Jewel in the Lotus , Hail , " mystically refers to the creative force in the act of producing life , the Padme or Lotus floating on the water representing the female Sakti or sexual power , the jewel the male . Compare the Sumerian concept and that of Genesis , the Spirit brooding in the Deep , which brought forth life . From India now to China and Japan . The Chinese Taoism religion , whose name is from the ancient treatise known as Tao Teh King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly about 600 B.C. ) furnishes remarkable wisdom . The name Tao , has been translated with various meanings , all however approximating to original idealistic concepts ; as way , road , path , virtue , reason , logos , nature ; " way " being the most representative , as in the sense of passing from one concept to another ; a quality descriptive of character and action , to be acquired by individual and ruler ; it is both the way and the way-goer , an eternal road : it is Being in itself ; cause and effect ; all things originate from Tao , conform to it and return at last to it . Its author says " he // does not known whose son it is : it might appear to have been before Ti , that is , God : it is like the emptiness of a vessel . " It was thought by a French writer ( 1823 ) that the book contained the Hebrew name Yahweh , written phonetically in Chinese , but it is said by commentators that " this fancy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tao , though it may not be precisely Yahweh , is the Etymon , Ti , the ao being the Chinese labial decay , inherited from Sumer by the original migrants to China , which name itself is but a form of the Etymon , under the present reasoning . The " emptiness of a vessel " would refer to the void the prMueval chaos , before being acted upon by the deity . The precel ) ts of Taoism are . described as representing simplicity and spontaneity of action ; processes without pride or display of ownership ? qualities which alone can make for permanence in social and economic life . Under it men would become " as little children , " " returning good for evil . " The concept of being " before God " does not argue a supplanting of the deity , but rather means that the ultimate deity was before human concepts thereof . Lao Tsze described the " Golden Age , " the period when men loved one another without knowing it , were honest and loyal and good-hearted without knowing it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was the natural order of things , and so excited no comment and left no trace ; that to do otherwise was unknown . ( In the modern slang parlance one might say " it simply is n't clone ! " ) Virtue was in fact the natural cosmic regimen on earth , in those immeasurably remote times which he echoed . The " living sky " and supreme power Tien the firmament , the creating and destroying power the " ancestor of all things , " " supreme ruler , " Tien Ti of the ancient state religion , Fu // Mu , heaven and father and mother : the Light principle Yang . The Japanese creation myth forms a curious parallel to the Sumerian . Japanese annals represent the first man as of direct descent from the gods , in the " Divine Age " as recorded in the I ojiki or " Records of Ancient Matters , " and the Nihongi or " Chronicles of Japan , " from both Chinese and native traditions . A primordial trinity existed on " the plain of high heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared ; the earth is " young and floating about like oil or a jelly-fish , " when , a creator and his consort are born " to make , consolidate and give birth to the drifting land , " the islands of Japan resulting from the drops of brine ; and these as two beings , Isnami and . l znagi , have adventures similar to those of Tammuz and Ishtar ; evil deities and good deities follow , as in the story of Tiamat and the primordial ocean . Sosanoo is a god ; Amaterasu ( goddess of the sun ) or Ninigi , is the ancestor of the first Japanese king , 1iamu-Yamato-Iware-Biko , son of heaven , when , Japanese history begins . Japan place names bear out the analogy : the name is Nippon , Zumpango , Awaj : the Iiami : the Ame-tsuchi , " heaven and earth , " Chinese ten-chi . In the New Hebrides , a deity is Bokor , who inade men from clay . In the Kei Islands , N oo-hoo-roa , the creation-god was Dooadlera , and in Celebes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indara , god and goddess . Among the Dyaks of Borneo , Salampandai is the creation-god , and among the Kayans the first man and woman , Kaluban Gai and Kalubai Augai , were born from a tree fertilized by the swaying of a creeper by the wind on the trunk . In Sumatra there is a Luo Zaho god . In Papua a native spirit is Dema . The Kawakipais of Southern California speak of a primaeval ocean in the beginning , with
