One morning last week at New Rochelle , N.Y. , the students of the college of that name were entering chapel for seven o'clock mass when flames ( caused by a short circuit ) burst from the ceiling ; the students fled unhurt . <P> The same morning at Strasbourg , France , the gasoline tank of a motor bus exploded in a car barn , covered ten workmen with flaming gasoline ; three soon died ; others were expected to . <P> The same morning at Cornish , N. H. , there was a kerosene explosion in a one-room cabin : two young mothers , three infants and the cabin were incinerated ; an adolescent youth escaped , gravely burned . <P> That fatal morning was not yet over . At 11:35 in the basement of the Cleveland Clinic , at 93rd Street and Euclid Avenue , Cleveland , a stock of X-ray films exploded . At that hour there were 234 people in the building . Within 15 minutes about 100 of them were dead , with many more dying . <P> The first explosion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown from the windows . The force of the explosion blew out a skylight and the descending fragments fell through a shaft upon the people seated in the waiting room three floors below . Plaster showered from walls and ceilings . A heavy yellow gas poured through the building . Doctors , nurses and patients sniffed it and fled . Some seated in chairs took a long breath and died without moving . Some reached the windows , prepared to jump , but billows of gas enveloped them and they fell back dead . Others succeeded in leaping from the first and second story windows . Some limped away . Some lay writhing in agony and died upon the lawn , for the gas followed them even into the open . Passersby upon the street collapsed . <P> Meanwhile nurses and others , many partly clothed , fled from the two main exits of the building , screaming and clutching their throats . Firemen and policemen rushed to the scene . For 15 minutes they could not penetrate the fumes without gas masks . <P> Fire ladders were extended to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a stairway filled with a mass of struggling bodies , arms and legs twisted and intertangled . Screams and shrieks of agony arose . The rescuers broke their way in from the roof . More than 16 bodies blocked the stairway . Only one , that of a doctor , seemed alive . He was removed first but died in a hospital . <P> Pulmotors were carried into the building from the roof and applied to the victims as headway was made into the smoke-filled rooms . A few of those revived were able to walk to ladders and descend . The great majority were carried out . The lawns adjoining were littered with the bodies of the dead and dying , all yellow from the gas . Rescue squads worked over them with pulmotors . Only those who received immediate oxygen treatment survived . One man who had escaped said , " The gas did n't bother me . Help the others who are dying . " Five minutes later he collapsed and died on the way to a hospital . An X-ray salesman who had been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on helping the rescuers . He soon gave up , presented himself , laughing , at a hospital for treatment , was dead within ten minutes .
