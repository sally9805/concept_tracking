The rise of the curtain discloses a darkness complete except for an oblong of faintly luminous blue ; this is a large window ; and one or two stars are seen through the upper panes . After a moment a door up right is opened and a man enters carrying a lantern . He pushes a switch button near the door and two bulbs , shaded by green painted tin , come to life , right center , two other bulbs , left center , take on similar life simultaneously . These lights hang by wires from the ceiling . The interior revealed is that of a small railway station , a " way station " at an obscure junction in the country . The walls are wainscoted in wood to a height of four feet ; above that is plaster painted a tan brown . In the right wall ( half way up ) is the ticket window , with a little shelf ; the up-and-down sliding inner panel of the window closed . Up to this , in right wall , is a door . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has admitted the man with the lantern . Center in the rear wall is the window . There is a stove , left , with a pipe running to the left wall . The only decorations are some printed posters giving notice of changes in train schedules , a Navy Recruiting poster , a " warning " concerning forest fires , a penny-in-the-slot weighing machine against the rear wall , and " No Smoking . " There is a clock on right wall ; it has stopped at seventeen minutes after six . The furniture consists of four or five wooden benches , with iron legs , the feet screwed to the floor ; these benches are set in rigid rows , facing front ; one straight behind the other . Upon the front one is seen a knowing , small lunch basket , closed but not strapped , and a very small thermos bottle . Several traveling bags , a couple of guns in cases and a trout-fishing outfit are there also . The man with the lantern is the station-master , ticket-agent , telegraph operator , baggage-man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . He is elderly and smooth-shaven ; his clothes are elderly , too ; though not shabby . A dark old overcoat with the collar turned up ; his rubber boots are heavy with mudded clay , and his trousers are tucked into the bottoms of them . He goes casually near the clock ; looks at it ; grunts thoughtfully ; goes out right , returns with a plain , wooden-seated chair , once painted yellow ; places it under the clock . He moves the hands around to ten-twenty-four , consulting his watch as he does so . Then he winds the clock . As the winding begins , there is the sound of an annoyed yawn from the apparently empty benches . A man has been lying at full length on the bench second from front , and until now , as he slowly " sits up , " has been invisible . He is " somewhere in the early forties "  --  but not yet " well-preserved " looking . People of sixty would speak of him as " a young man " ; people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is urban , intelligent looking  --  a " man of the world " ; very " attractive . " His clothes are of an imported texture , pleasant for travel , and he has on a soft hat and a light-weight overcoat . The STATION-MASTER , having wound the clock , looks at him . STATION-MASTER casually . Been asleep , I expect . Gets down from chair. p. 3 AMES passing a gloved hand over his eyes . I have not . He looks at the STATION-MASTER drowsily . You are n't the same one , are you . He states this as an interesting discovery ; it is not a question . STATION-MASTER I 'm not the same one what ? AMES You are n't the same Station-Master that was here this afternoon . STATION-MASTER He ai n't no Station-Master ; he 's my brother-in-law . Starts with chair . AMES Oh ! STATION-MASTER He jes ' spelled me to-day ; I was teamin ' . AMES I thought he seemed to be an amateur . STATION-MASTER moving right with the chair to return it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say ? " AMES He seemed bashful . About giving any information , I mean . STATION-MASTER Information ? He ai n't got no infamation to give . Never did have . AMES He struck me in that light  --  particularly about trains . p. 4 STATION-MASTER Well , right to-night , I ai n't much better , myself . The wires are all down after them storms ; the bridge at Millersville washed out on one road and they was a big freight smash on the other one . My brother-in-law says he told you that much . AMES gloomily . Yes ; he did tell me that much . STATION-MASTER Well , the Lord A'Mighty could n't tell you no more till them wires start workin ' again . He moves to go off right with the chair , then turns back . Where 'd you say you was aimin ' to git to ? AMES Well , New York  --  eventually ! Plaintively . I have a place there with a bed in it  --  and food . STATION-MASTER reflectively . New York . You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change for Albany . AMES drearily . Yes , I know , I know . I made a mistake in coming round by this junction I ought to have walked . STATION-MASTER with a short laugh . I reckon ! You 'd a-got there pretty near as soon , mebbe . These here hurry-canes he means hurricanesgot train service in this whole section jest about disorganized . They say it 's sun-spots  --  I du n no if ' t is or not , though . Exits right with his chair . AMES rises and goes to the window , he looks out toward off left . After a moment he goes to the door up right , opens it . Steps just outside the door , but remains in view . Then speaks to someone invisible and apparently at a little distance off left. p. 5 AMES hesitating . Ah  --  do n't you think this is pretty foolish ? He waits a moment for an answer . None is heard ; he speaks louder . I say , I think this is  --  ah  --  do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure you can hear me , you know ! He waits again . Ah  --  He seems about to address further remarks to the invisible person ; but decides not to do so , and with a somewhat baffled and puzzled air , comes in , closes the door , sits on first bench , murmuring rather crossly : Well , all right ! Moves lunch basket a little center of bench . The STATION-MASTER returns from the room off right . He speaks as he enters . STATION-MASTER Nary a single click from my telegraph instament . He refers to room off right , then he comes over and looks at the luggage on the front bench . See you been gunnun . He means gunning . AMES What ? STATION-MASTER See you been fishun and gunnun up in the woods . AMES Yes , I have been up at a lodge in the woods , that 's how I happen to be here ;  --  getting out of the woods . p. 6 STATION-MASTER examining the guns . Have any luck ? AMES abysmal . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd a-done well by yourself to bring it along ; you c 'd a-built a fire and cooked it , anyways . AMES roused to earnestness . See here ; your brother-in-law told me there was absolutely no food in this neighborhood . STATION-MASTER He was right . They ai n't . AMES But , my Lord , the people in this neighborhood have to live on something ! STATION-MASTER Ai n't no people in this neighborhood ' cept me and my brother-in-law 's fam'lies . AMES Well , even you and your brother-in-law have to eat , do n't you ? STATION-MASTER My hens ai n't layin ' . Sits on front bench , center . We got jest three eggs in two days from seventeen hens . AMES pessimistically . I suppose you used all three eggs . STATION-MASTER with a dry laugh . I s'pose we did , among seven childern . We had nine potatoes left and about four slices o ' bacon . That 's all we had fer supper , and we wo n't have no breakfast at all unless the north-bound train gits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and I expected supplies to-day myself . You ai n't the only one them sun-spots 's been foolin ' with . p. 7 AMES I suppose that 's as good an explanation as any for a train over eleven hours late  --  sun-spots ! STATION-MASTER looking in the lunch basket . Why , you got food here , right now . Good food ! AMES One chicken sandwich and one hard-boiled egg ; left over from a light lunch  --  a very light lunch . STATION-MASTER Well , why do n't you eat it ? AMES shortly . It is n't mine . Pushes basket to STATION-MASTER . STATION-MASTER surprised . Oh ! He nods ; glances up off left , and nods again , as if understanding . Well , waitin ' fer trains does git people kind of pettish with each other . Rises and moves right . Glances off left . I noticed your wife 's still a-settin ' on that baggage-truck out yonder . AMES shortly . She is n't my wife ! STATION-MASTER Oh ! Your lady , I mean . She 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered , shakes his head , mutters . She is n't my lady . He gets up and goes to the window. p. 8 STATION-MASTER Well , excuse me . My brother-in-law , he took her and you fer married . AMES comes down left . He told me you and her had kind of a spat , jest before he left here , this evenin ' . But of course a man 's got a right to quarrel with other women 's well 's his wife . AMES slightly annoyed with himself for being annoyed by this report of the STATION-MASTER 's brother-in-law . The  --  ah  --  lady and I were hardly  --  ah  --  quarreling . STATION-MASTER placatively . To tell the truth . Crosses left . My brother-in-law ai n't hardly got sense enough to tell the difference between a couple that 's quarrelin ' and a couple that 's jest kind of startin ' to make up to each other like . Sits left end of front bench . AMES more annoyed . This lady and I were n't doing either . I never saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that often happens . I 've knowed plenty of perfeckly respectable people to do it , too . You might say it 's nature . AMES What is ? STATION-MASTER Why , fer strange couples to git to talkin ' to each other  --  and all so on  --  on a train . p. 9 AMES rather crossly . I did n't speak to this lady on the train . He goes up left and comes right down again . In fact , we did n't speak to each other till we 'd been moping about this God-forsaken station for an hour . Then , as there was n't anything else in the world in sight but mud  --  and your brother-in-law  --  and she did n't need to guess very hard to guess I was hungry  --  she offered to share her lunch basket with me , and we naturally got to talking . STATION-MASTER Well , sir , a person can git mighty well acquainted with anybody in about ten hours ' talkin ' . AMES crossly . We have n't been talking for the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' already ! Rises . Chuckles . AMES Oh , no . She still speaks  --  at least she nodded to show that she heard me , the last time I spoke to her . He is grimly humorous here , but does not smile . STATION-MASTER Well , sir ; it 's funny , some people do n't more'n say-howdy-do , they ca n't neither of ' em hardly stand a word the other one says . Crosses right . I sh 'd think she 'd be chilly out there , by this time , though . p. 10 AMES looks at the STATION-MASTER earnestly . You seem to be a man of unusual experience . Crosses center . STATION-MASTER Unusual ? I guess if you think that , you ai n't married . AMES muttering . No , and not likely to be . STATION-MASTER Look out , mister ! No man in a spat with a lady ai n't safe ! Where 's she bound fer ? AMES I think she said a station about thirty or forty miles from here  --  Amity . STATION-MASTER Amity ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's impossible ! STATION-MASTER Amity 's on the branch line . Everything 's blowed to hell down that way ; creeks over the rails and all . AMES Is n't there any way of getting a motor car ? Rises . STATION-MASTER Not with the telephone lines down like they are . I do n't reckon no car could git through these roads , neither . AMES gloomily . Yes ; so your brother-in-law said . A clicking is heard off right . Is n't that your telegraph instrument ? Indicating right. p. 11 STATION-MASTER jumping up . So ' t is . Going right . That means they got the wire up again at Logan 's station . Well , now we 'll see what 's what , mebbe ! Exits right , leaving the door open . The telegraph instrument can be heard clicking . AMES listens at the open door , right , a moment ; then he goes to the door up right , opens it , and speaks off ; as before . AMES I think you 'd better come in now , Miss Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the words are not necessarily discernible . However , what MISS STUART says is , " I 'm quite comfortable here , thank you . " I really think you 'd better come in . There may be some news of your train  --  or mine ! This seems to mean more to MISS STUART than have his previous appeals . Her voice is heard again , " Oh ! " She is evidently approaching . AMES , seriously . That 's better . Do come in and be sensible . Her voice is heard once more before she appears . A faint amusement and protest are audible in it : " Sensible ? My dear sir ! " He holds the door open for her as she appears and comes down . Then he follows . She is of a lovely and charming presence ; one is aware of that instantly though she is pretty thoroughly muffled in furs and veils ; and one becomes even more aware of it as she pushes up the veil from her face as she comes in . A muff is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think maybe I could be more sensible if the news turns out to be of my train . Could you stand its being about my train instead of yours , Mr. Ames ? Comes down right . She has gone toward the lunch basket . AMES a little stiffly . If mine came first you 'd be relieved of me . At upper end of benches , left . ISABEL Yes ; so I should . She lifts the lid of the lunch basket , closed by the STATION-MASTER . Oh , you have n't eaten the sandwich  --  nor the egg either ! As if in reproachful surprise . AMES stiffly . Certainly not . Comes down left . ISABEL lifting a hard-boiled egg from the basket daintily , in a gloved hand . Did n't you even nibble at it ? She looks at him , not at the egg . AMES stiffly . I did not . ISABEL Are you sure ? AMES indignantly . I 'm not in the habit of " nibbling " things . p. 13 ISABEL with a hint of suspicion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once who used to steal little bits of icing off of icing cakes . He 'd slip out in the kitchen on baking days when no one was looking  --  and then he 'd deny it ! AMES coldly , interrupting her . I 'm not a Bishop , please . ISABEL reasonably . How could I tell ? I 've only known you  --  She glances at the clockTen hours and thirty-some minutes , and this is the first time you 've mentioned that you 're not a Bishop . With an increase of severity . Why did n't you eat this egg ? AMES coldly . You know perfectly well why I did n't . ISABEL But I thought you would , if I left you alone with it . I 've left you alone with it on purpose  --  two hours . I 'm afraid you 're stubborn . AMES More personalities ? ISABEL Well , does n't a question of what one eats have to be rather personal ? AMES I think you made it personal when you lost your temper . p. 14 ISABEL interrupting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMES But you did ! Coming towards her . You lost your temper and declined to sit in the same room with me . Rather than do that you went out in the night air and sat two hours on a baggage truck ! Turns away to left . ISABEL hurriedly . Please listen , Mr. Ames  --  your name is Ames , is n't it ? There is a stronger hint of humor in her voice . AMES You seemed to have no doubt of it before you lost your  --  ISABEL interrupting . Mr. Ames , let 's put it this way : I lost  --  your temper ; as for me , it seems at least you ought to distinguish between a loss of temper and a sense of injury . AMES quickly . Yes , I had the sense of injury . ISABEL When we found there was only one egg and one sandwich left for dinner , and no other food in reach , I said  --  AMES interrupting . You distinctly said it would n't be enough for two . p. 15 ISABEL Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is n't enough for one , is it ? AMES Need I explain again , I had no intention of asking to share it with you ? ISABEL No . Do n't explain again . When I said there was n't enough for two I meant  --  AMES interrupting . It was yours , and you meant you wanted it all , naturally . ISABEL indignantly . Oh ! AMES What I minded was your thinking I expected any of it . ISABEL When I said there was n't enough for two I meant I expected to eat all of it , did I ? AMES Why , of course . ISABEL after drawing an indignant breath . Puts egg in basket . Now , before I go out for two hours more on the baggage-truck , will you please ask that man if there is any news of my train ? AMES stiffly . Certainly . ISABEL Thank you . AMES Do n't mention it . Goes to door , right , and speaks off . What do they wire you about p. 16 STATION-MASTER voice off right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward MISS STUART . He says there 's nothing yet . ISABEL sinking upon the front bench . Oh ! She sighs with exasperation , sits on front bench . You said there was news . AMES There will be in a few minutes , now the wire 's working . ISABEL Well , do you still pretend not to understand ? AMES Understand what ? Comes down right . ISABEL That of course I meant men need more sustenance than women , and of course when I said there was n't enough food for two I meant I did n't want any  --  that is , I did want it , certainly , but I would n't touch it because  --  because you 're a man and ought  --  to have it all . AMES in an earnestly interested voice . Do you honestly mean that ? He sits on the bench , right of MISS STUART , looking at her with great earnestness . ISABEL Why , of course . p. 17 AMES Are you serious ? ISABEL Why , of course I 'm serious . AMES You really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMES remorsefully . I thought you were warning me your hospitality was over when it came to one egg and one sandwich . ISABEL glancing at the clock . Ten hours and thirty-seven minutes . You certainly ought to know me well enough to understand better than that ! AMES You honestly mean I ought to eat it all because I 'm a man . ISABEL Of course . It hurts a man a great deal more not to indulge himself than it does a woman . When there 's only a little of anything , it ought always to be given to the man . AMES Because he 's the more selfish ? ISABEL No . Because he has to have his strength . A woman can live " on her nerves . " AMES So you think the woman ought to give up the food to the man . This is serious on his part , and appears to be serious on hers ; though one can not always be sure when she is serious . There is a mysteriousness about her ; we wo n't really know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better . If she did n't she might be mistreated ! AMES frowning . So ! Her unselfishness is only self-preservation , is it ? ISABEL with a twinkle . No . She wants to preserve them both . If the Indians come the man will have to do most of the fighting ; if the waters rise he 'll have to build a raft . If it gets very chilly she glances at the stovehe 'll have to build a fire . AMES following her glance . It is very chilly . I wonder  --  He rises and goes to the door right , calls off . How about a fire in that stove ? STATION-MASTER off right . It 's fixed , if you want to light it . AMES All right . He crosses to the stove , producing a match which he lights and places within the door of the stove . In a moment a rosy glow comes from the door of the stove , which opens toward right . He watches it and the lady inscrutably watches him . ISABEL It is a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger from the stove. p. 19 AMES My lighting a fire for you ? ISABEL indicating the lunch basket . No . To see a man making such a fuss about eating when he 's starving . AMES returning to her , he smiles . Suppose we divide it . ISABEL You might have thought of that before . AMES I might ? Why , it was you that said  --  ISABEL Have you a pocket-knife  --  with a very clean blade ? He hands his knife to her with a blade open . Yes , I thought you looked like a man who would have . I 'll do the dividing , and you 'll do the choosing  --  He sits end of bench . She cuts the egg so that the two parts are anything but equal ; the smaller part is about a fifth of the egg . She cuts the sandwich in the same uneven way . There . Choose . AMES Thanks . He takes the small bit of egg and the tiny fragment of the sandwich . ISABEL Well , eat them . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pass . Meanwhile she is cutting the egg and the sandwich again . AMES as he swallows the two small bits together . Thanks . Are n't you  --  p. 20 ISABEL Oh , yes , I 'm only  --  She offers the newly divided portions . Here . AMES Oh , no . I 've had my share . ISABEL laughing a little . That was a test , to see how you 'd choose . Now it 's a fair division . AMES No . I really  --  He takes off his overcoat and sits on the bench , near her . ISABEL Do n't let 's be ridiculous any more . I imagine neither of us has much right to behave like a child of ten  --  or nineteen for that matter . Here ! She insists upon his taking what she offers . AMES It does n't seem fair . He accepts what is offered and eats . Murder , but I am hungry ! ISABEL And there 's still some coffee in the thermos . Did n't you know it ? She pours it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle upside down to get the last . AMES No ! Is there some coffee left ? My , my ! She puts the cup in his hand . Coffee ! ISABEL Yes , that is lucky . She puts the remaining bit of egg upon the remaining bit of sandwich . Here , this is yours , too , to go with the coffee . Eat it ! He does so before he thinks . That 's it ! p. 21 AMES Oh , lovely ! A whole mouthful at once ! He finishes the coffee in a gulp ; then starts . That was yours ! Rises . ISABEL No , no , it was n't . AMES Why , it was ! He goes back of bench to center . Have you given me all the coffee , too ? He shakes the thermos bottle and turns it upside down . Well , by George ! Did you do that to escape mistreatment ? ISABEL No . It was just the way I was brought up . Goes left and throws paper napkins , etc. , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man be selfish ? ISABEL About food and when he thinks he 's sick , yes . That was the old-fashioned way of bringing girls up , was n't it ? AMES I thought that went out a long time ago . ISABEL It prevailed in my girlhood , you see . AMES seriously , quickly . Well , that could n't have been very long ago . ISABEL putting the thermos bottle in the basket and closing the lid , she smiles faintly . No ? Has n't the Station-Master any news for us yet ? The STATION-MASTER answers for himself . Enters right as she speaks , carrying his lantern and a bucket of coal . Goes left back of benches and down to stove. p. 22 STATION-MASTER Not very good , I reckon . Least not as you 'd think . You wo n't git no train fer Amity to-night . ISABEL disturbed , but she has usually somewhere a little humor left for her own misfortune . Not to-night ! STATION-MASTER No 'm ; an ' so fur as I know , not before noon , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . ISABEL weakly . Will there be any food in this part of America to-morrow ? STATION-MASTER pouring some coal into the stove . Not as I know of now . ISABEL Good gracious ! AMES huskily . How about my train ? STATION-MASTER Number Twenty-one ? If she do n't git no later she 'll be due by eight or nine in the morning . AMES quickly . Is there a diner on her ? STATION-MASTER On Number Twenty-one ? A diner ? My gosh ! He sets the coal bucket down by the stove with a bang , and puts shovel full of coal in stove. p. 23 AMES Is n't there a buffet ? STATION-MASTER Mister , they 's a caboose ; that 's all . AMES Oh , my ! STATION-MASTER buttoning his overcoat and moving toward right . They 's more coal in yonder , if you need it . ISABEL looking at him incredulously . Where are you going ? She jumps up , continuing instantly . Mr. Ames , you 'd better ask him where he 's going . STATION-MASTER easily . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm goin ' ? I 'm goin ' home to bed . ISABEL gravely , quickly . You are ? Rises . STATION-MASTER Yes 'm . I got to sleep same as anybody . AMES What ? Why , you ca n't ! STATION-MASTER Why , I ai n't got anything more to do around here till jest before Twenty-one 's due . Then , reassturingly . I 'll be back by seven-thirty in the morning , though . AMES But this lady  --  where 's she going to sleep ? p. 24 STATION-MASTER disclaiming responsibility . I could n't tell you . AMES What about your house ? Ca n't she STATION-MASTER looking at MISS STUART . In the first place , how would she git through the mud ? Shows his boots , dried mud to the knee . AMES Why  --  why , we could take her on the baggage-truck . This , he thinks , is a real idea . ISABEL graciously . No , thank you . STATION-MASTER No room for her if she got there . No way to make none , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bout same as me . Him and his wife and two childern 's in one room and the other five children 's in the other . ISABEL No , thank you . AMES Well , but , good heavens ISABEL soothingly . Never mind . It 's all right . AMES turning back to the STATION-MASTER . Well , but look here  --  p. 25 STATION-MASTER Mister , you can make yourself comfatble enough ; it 's nice and warm here now ; and night-duty when they ai n't no trains runnin ' , why that ai n't part o ' my job . I got a heavy day to-morrow , and I need sleep . Good night , lady ! He goes out briskly up right . MISS STUART goes to stove , left . AMES Well , good heavens  --  He goes up nervously , opens the door , steps out and calls after the STATION-MASTER . Listen  --  you ! See here ! STATION-MASTER outside . Good night ! AMES But see here  --  There is no response , and after a few moments AMES closes the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observes him ; then laughs faintly . ISABEL Do n't worry about me ; I 'm an old traveler . We can be comfortable enough ; it is warm now ! AMES I 'll  --  I 'll go take a nap  --  later  --  on the baggage-truck . Jerks his head toward up left . ISABEL How absurd ! I nearly froze out there , even in these . Her furs . AMES almost pathetically . But what 's to be done ? p. 26 ISABEL Nothing . When railroads break down passengers ca n't travel , can they ? AMES I ought to be able to think of something to do . Comes down right . ISABEL Well , for one thing , now that all the officials have gone , I do n't think you need to bother about that sign any longer . She points to " No Smoking . " Do n't you usually smoke  --  after dinner ? She laughs on the word " dinner " with a glance at the lunch basket , and then sits again , throwing back her fur coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down right . He brings forth a cigarette-case . But that wo n't be of much use , will it ? ISABEL Well , what else useful can you think of ? AMES I ca n't think of a thing . ISABEL Neither can I. So  --  she laughs faintly , crosses to left center , and sits on front bench  --  so where are your matches ? AMES produces a box of matches , then makes a gesture as if to offer her his cigarette-case . Ah  --  do you  --  ? p. 27 ISABEL shaking her head . No ; I still stick to the way I was brought up . She takes off her heavy coat . Not rising . AMES seriously . No ! Is there still an old-fashioned woman left in America ? ISABEL Yes . " Left " is the word . Left over ! AMES How " left over " ? ISABEL Old maids are , are n't they ? AMES Old bachelors are ! That 's what I am . Lights his cigarette , adding grimly : An old bachelor , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , that is . ISABEL wistfully . What 's it matter how many times you 've seen the earth go round the sun ? That 's all we mean when we say " a year . " is n't it ? Our ages ought to be reckoned another way ; not in these foolish " years . " AMES What other way do you suggest ? ISABEL Well , let 's call a man as old as he behaves  --  toward a woman ! AMES Then how old will you call a woman ? ISABEL As old as she makes men behave toward her . p. 28 AMES with a little laugh . Well , if I 'm as old as I behave now-a-days toward women , I 'm dead . ISABEL smiling . But what 's the matter with the women you know ? AMES laughs ruefully , and walks about as he speaks . Well , most of those I did know are so married and raising children I hardly ever see ' em at all . And I just ca n't stand the new generation . ISABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got one myself . AMES staring . You have ? ISABEL I 'm bringing up an orphan niece  --  or she 's bringing me up ; it 's hard to say which . In fact , I 'm bringing up two orphan nieces . She smiles at a thought . Only one of ' em belongs to the new generation , though . You do n't like these new young things then ? AMES Great Lord , no ! They smoke and drink and wear men 's clothes and short hair  --  ISABEL Well , boys ' clothes are better for the outdoor things they do nowadays , are n't they ? AMES That may be , but they 've given up a great thing to get this new liberty I hear they talk about . p. 29 ISABEL What great thing did they give up ? AMES emphatically . Charm ! ISABEL You have n't met a charming one ? AMES There are n't any . How can a brazen little hussy in breeches with a flask of home-made gin in her hip pocket have any charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has youth , and youth is charm . Do n't you care for the youth you see in a young girl ? AMES sitting down by her . I 'll tell you what I care for . I care for the graces I used to see in the girls I grew up with . ISABEL You 're sure it was n't really their youth that gave them the graces ? AMES I can show you what I care for ! Very earnestly and decisively . To-morrow we 'll be moving miles and miles apart . ISABEL Will we ? I 'm afraid you think more of this railroad system than I do . AMES I 'm serious . Probably after to-morrow morning we 'll never see each other again . ISABEL Why , I feel as if you were my most intimate friend ! Life-long ! After we finished Italy , was n't it two hours you talked about religion ? p. 30 AMES What I 'm trying to show you  --  ISABEL Yes ; I forgot . AMES I had a temptation to tell you something that would show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . I could n't stop you . Her gesture indicates the surrounding isolation . AMES Then I will . I 'll tell you what I thought about you when I got on that little junk-line train this morning . I had n't expected to see anybody looking like you getting on at one of these way stations  --  ISABEL I 'm a farmer , you know . I have a farm down near Amity . I 've been away to see about a new tenant for part of the land ! Then abruptly . Oh , I do n't mean to stop you ! Go on ! AMES When you got on the train I thought : " There ! There 's a lady ! " When these new-generation girls get on a train I usually think : " There ! There 's a rowdy ! " ISABEL You must have met some strange ones ! AMES I have n't met any . Just hearing and looking at ' em 's enough for me ! But when I looked at you  --  well , I 'm going to talk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  when I looked at you I caught a  --  a perfume of sweeter days  --  yes , better days than this ! And I 'll go ahead , now I 'm started ; I 'm hungry as a bear , in spite of your giving me all your lunch , and I did feel really cross , during our quarrel , but I 'm glad the sun-spots  --  he thought it was the sun-spots  --  I 'm glad they 've given me this chance to know you . p. 31 ISABEL My dear man , you do n't know an earthly thing about me ! AMES Oh , yes , I do . There are some people you know all about in a little while . ISABEL " All about ? " Good gracious ! AMES No ; not all . You do n't know all the lovely things about ' em , but you do know there are n't any things that are n't lovely ; you 're one of those transparently perfect things , Miss Stuart . ISABEL What ? AMES rises and goes a little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is to it ! ISABEL And only to think of it ! AMES turning to her , rather sharply . To think of what ? ISABEL So much praise  --  bought by one hard-boiled egg and a sandwich ! AMES rather brusquely . Well , some of it is for that , if you want to know it ! It seemed a little thing ; but it showed that when you were hungry yourself you 'd force your last bit of food on a stranger . ISABEL A " stranger " ? Why , by this time I know you better than I do my most intimate friend , Mr. Ames ! p. 32 AMES sits . Then pacing up and down and going on with his thought . I kept looking at you on the train , though you did n't know it  --  ISABEL I was brought up always not to know it . AMES continuing . I kept looking at you , and I  --  ISABEL quoting him . " I said to myself , There 's a woman I 'd hate to be cast away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , " There 's the first woman I 've seen in a long time I 'd like to know ! " ISABEL How long a time ? AMES Well , since this new type came in . ISABEL thoughtfully . I 'm afraid you would n't approve of my niece ! AMES If you 're bringing her up I do n't believe she 'd be the new type . ISABEL Oh , yes , she is ! It does n't matter who brings ' em up ; they get it from one another . AMES Well , let 's forget the new type just now . ISABEL smiling . All right . p. 33 AMES I 'd rather keep to what I feel about you . ISABEL nodding smilingly . Well , keep to it  --  it began promisingly . AMES coming toward her a little way . I will . I 'll speak out ! As a man gets older most of his friends marry off  --  or they die off  --  it 's the same thing so far as he 's concerned ! ISABEL gravely . Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets pretty lonely . ISABEL Men always seem to think that 's so singular ! AMES quietly . All I meant to say is she yawnsit 's been a great thing for me to have a woman 's companionship for a day . ISABEL Well , it still seems to be going on . AMES I wish ISABEL Yes ? She conceals a yawn by turning away quickly . She does n't wish to yawn , she is interested ; but she is beginning to be really threatened by drowsiness . He does not perceive this , and the symptoms are , so far , very slight . AMES thoughtfully . Of course you do n't know anything about me  --  except to-day  --  p. 34 ISABEL I do , a little . AMES surprised . How ? ISABEL Why , you said your name was William Ames : I supposed you were the William Berry Ames that the papers say is so remarkable . " Remarkable 's " the word they always use . AMES frowning . I 'm not much in newspapers  --  and is n't it obvious I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen it any number of times : " Mr. William Berry Ames , still playing remarkable polo . " AMES sharply . That 's my uncle ! Rises . It 's " still remarkable that he plays polo at sixty-six ! " " Remarkable " because he 's sixty-six ! They always use the word remarkable about elderly people . And you thought ISABEL a little disturbed , hastily . I 'm so sorry ! AMES somewhat upset . You thought I was that old man ! ISABEL quickly . Oh , I never heard he was quite sixty-six . AMES So ! You did n't see how I could be quite sixty-six ! p. 35 ISABEL hastily , with apparent seriousness in placating him . But would n't it be wonderful if you were ! To be sixty-six and look only  --  AMES interrupting . What age do I look ? ISABEL Ah , let 's not go into that . It might become mutual ! AMES I ca n't get over it : you thought I was my uncle ! ISABEL You must tell him about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AMES mollified ; his tone changes . " Sometime . " You think we might see each other again after to-morrow ? ISABEL Why not , if you think it would be pleasant ? I should be  --  She is caught by a yawn and conceals it imperfectly . I should be  --  very glad  --  AMES sadly . Oh , you 're sleepy . ISABEL I 'm not . I 'm interested . I 'm interested in everything you 've been saying . I was never more interested in my life . AMES Honestly ? Sits . ISABEL At least , it 's been quite a time since I 've had as cheering things said to me as you 've been saying . I like it . p. 36 AMES Could you stand some more ? ISABEL I  --  think so . AMES Then , do let me see you again after to-morrow , will you ? ISABEL after a moment . Yes . AMES Could I come to Amity to see you  --  sometime ? ISABEL Why , I think so . AMES Could I come  --  before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gravely , quickly . I think I should like it more than I 've ever liked anything in my life . ISABEL rather startled . Why , that 's  --  that 's saying quite a great deal  --  is n't it ? AMES I ca n't help it . It 's the way I feel . ISABEL Yes , but at these pleasant quieter years , you say you have arrived at  --  have n't you learned more caution ? AMES More caution than what ? ISABEL Than to say quite so much as you just did  --  and to an unknown woman ! AMES quickly , with feeling that increases . I tell you you 're not unknown . You 've shown me  --  yes , just in the way you fed me , if you like  --  yes , and in the dear , pretty way you took this being " cast away " with me here , you 've shown me you are the old-fashioned , perfect kind of woman  --  I thought had disappeared . Well , I 've found you  --  I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so confoundedly lonely  --  I  --  well , why not ? p. 37 ISABEL gently . I do n't know  --  you 're a little indefinite , perhaps ? AMES It 's a long time since I felt like this  --  and the reason I 'm lonely 's because fifteen or so years ago I did n't speak when something like this came over me . Instead , I went away to think it over , and another man spoke first . ISABEL with a humor that fights with drowsiness and an inclination to take him seriously . You need n't be afraid of that now . Farming means a very retired life , with me . No one else will " speak " while you retire to think it over . She closes her eyes for a moment . AMES I do n't want to think it over at all ! Listen . Do I seem to you the sort of man you could like pretty well ? ISABEL looking up quickly . Oh , I think so . She closes her eyes for a moment again . AMES so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll let me hope something might come of it , I 'll be any kind of man you want me to be ! ISABEL opening her eyes quickly . Are n't you a little susceptible , Mr. Ames ? p. 38 AMES Does it look like it ; to still be a bachelor at my age ? ISABEL But it struck me you were  --  almost  --  proposing to me just then . AMES with great feeling . Well , I was . I am ! ISABEL Almost . AMES Almost or quite  --  just as you like , Miss Stuart . ISABEL smiling a little . Perhaps it had better be " almost . " AMES with feeling . If it 's to be that way  --  almost a proposal  --  is there any chance of your  --  almost  --  thinking of it ? ISABEL gently and smiling . Why  --  I might almost  --  think of it  --  sometime . Again the symptoms of drowsiness overtake her . AMES remorsefully . You are sleepy ! ISABEL with feeble insistence . I 'm not ! AMES ruefully humorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you awake with a proposal of marriage ! As he speaks he places a satchel on the end of bench and rolls his overcoat over it for a pillow. p. 39 ISABEL Was that all you made it for  --  to keep me awake ? AMES You know better . Here ; lie down . I 'll cover you over . ISABEL I wo n't take your overcoat . You 'll need it . The satchel 's a good enough pillow . AMES No . It is n't . Lie down . ISABEL Take your overcoat away or I 'll sit up all night . I will . Take it away . AMES submitting . All right . ISABEL When you lie down yourself , put your overcoat over you . Will you ? AMES If I need it . ISABEL in a matter-of-fact voice . No . Promise me . AMES I will . ISABEL lying down with her cheek against the satchel . Ah , that 's  --  ah ! She sighs with satisfaction . AMES gently covers her over with her fur coat and stole . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . He places it under her head . ISABEL Thank you . You 're very kind . She is silent ; then says sleepily : I knew you were . p. 40 AMES Knew I was what ? ISABEL contentedly . Kind . AMES muttering . Who would n't be ? He goes to the stove . ISABEL with her eyes shut . I had to be up at four o'clock and drive seventeen miles to get my train . I 'd rather stay awake and listen to you  --  you 'll forgive me for being  --  so sleepy  --  wo n't you ? AMES turns the damper on stove . AMES smiling , as he looks round . Yes . I 'll forgive you ! He takes his overcoat and spreads it on the second bench ; puts a " suit-case " for a pillow . ISABEL in a sweet drowsy voice , with her eyes closed . It certainly did n't seem  --  appreciative  --  going almost to sleep  --  when you were almost proposing  --  but I do appreciate it  --  very much  --  AMES with feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing  --  " I was all proposing and you know it . ISABEL Well , it 's very nice of you . I think I 'm glad  --  you were . But  --  p. 41 AMES But what ? ISABEL We do n't need the light , do we ? If you leave the stove door open  --  AMES goes up and snaps off the switch . There ! A rosy glow from the stove door crosses the benches , falling upon the recumbent lady . ISABEL cosily . There . That 's better . AMES goes to the second bench . You 'll put your overcoat over you ? AMES Yes . ISABEL What have you got for a pillow ? AMES It 's all right . ISABEL A suit-case ? AMES It 's plenty . MISS STUART , without opening her eyes or lifting her head , pulls the muff from beneath her cheek and lets her cheek rest on the satchel . Then , not otherwise moving , she swings the muff behind her to him . AMES What 's that for ? ISABEL Your pillow . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AMES Of course I won't. p. 42 ISABEL gently and confidently . You will . AMES You do make me selfish ! He takes the pillow , places it , and sits on the second bench , preparing to lie down and pull his overcoat over him . ISABEL in a very sleepy murmur . I 'm sorry I thought you were your uncle . She is lying on her right side , and she lifts her left hand over the back of the bench to him , the rest of her not moving . He takes it reverently , kisses it lightly ; she brings the hand back and puts it under her cheek . She speaks disjointedly and very drowsily . I only thought so because the papers said he was so remarkable . AMES gently . I do n't mind that now . Lies down on second bench . ISABEL It would be too bad if you met some pretty , very young thing after  --  after it was too late . Most men care more for early youth than they do for  --  A little yawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? ISABEL Than they do for anything . Is the muff all right for a pillow ? p. 43 AMES gently . I never had such a pillow before . ISABEL Are n't you sleepy , too ? AMES Yes ; the truth is , I am . It seems strange , when I feel so much that 's new to me  --  to be sleepy  --  ISABEL Oh , no . We are n't a young couple at a college dance  --  getting engaged . AMES No  --  of course not  --  but are n't we  --  almost  --  Rises and looks at her over the back of bench . ISABEL I think  --  you must go to sleep now . AMES Yes , I will . He stretches himself on the bench . ISABEL Are you at all  --  sure ? AMES Yes , I am . ISABEL I know what I say sounds very sleepy , and I am almost asleep , but my mind , you know  --  AMES Yes ? ISABEL more sleepily than ever . My mind 's working just as clearly as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so suddenly  --  perhaps you are a little susceptible  --  perhaps when you see some pretty young thing  --  you 'll  --  you 'll  --  p. 44 AMES decisively . No , I wo n't . ISABEL dreamily , in a soft , almost contented voice , and smiling a little . Perhaps not . AMES May I say just one last thing to you ? It seems foolish  --  but it would be pretty lovely to me if you 'd let me say it . ISABEL Say what ? AMES May I say to you , " Good night , dear " ? ISABEL I believe you might . Say it . AMES gently . Good night , dear . Her left hand goes up again , his own hand is seen above the back of the bench , clasping it ; then she returns it to her cheek . ISABEL Good night , dear . There is quiet . The Act Drop descends for a few seconds , and rises . Everything is as it was , except that the rosy glow from the stove has paled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock marks 5:45 . The light outside the window grows a little stronger ; distant trees just coming into new leaf on muddy hills are revealed there  --  an April landscape . The light continually grows stronger throughout the whole scene . A GIRL 'S voice is barely heard , shouting in the distance , " Hello there ! " " Hell-ooo there ! " Then after a pause , a stamping is heard on the platform outside , as though someone stamped mud from his shoes . A quick , sharp tread is heard ; the knob of the door up right is fumbled  --  then the door is opened and a GIRL of nineteen enters . She is distractingly pretty , in spite of  --  or it may be partly because of  --  her general style and costume . She wears a soft " sport " hat , beneath which her thick " bobbed " hair is additionally coquettish . She has on a short overcoat , knicker-bockers , green stockings and high-laced shoes ; the latter covered with mud which has also splashed her stockings . She comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a breathed exclamation as she sees the two sleepers , " Well , for the love o ' Mike ! " This is in a husky whisper . She stares . A light snoring comes from the second bench . She looks long at the first bench , smiles ; then controls a tendency to laughter . Then she moves back to the second bench and looks at AMES . ' After this contemplation she speaks again in the husky whisper : " Pretty good-lookin ' ole bird , if you do snore ! " The snoring stops with a little snort . AMES coughs , waking himself . Suddenly he sits up , dazed , and stares at the girl . She chokes down an increasing tendency to mirth during their scene. p. 45 AMES confused . Oh  --  ah , how d' ya do . FLORENCE ( Florence ) Sh ! Do n't wake Aunt Isabel . After this they both speak in husky whispers . AMES Who ? FLORENCE My aunt . She gestures widely to MISS STUART . My Aunt Isabel ! Do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , indeed ! FLORENCE Well , I should think so ! I 'm her niece , Florence . AMES conventionally but in a whisper . I 'm glad to uh  --  Shakes hands . FLORENCE A man and I 've been all night tryin ' to get here in a car . He 's back in the woods with it now , tryin ' to get it out of a mud-hole . We 've had a hell of a night ! AMES I beg your pardon ? FLORENCE It really was . Are you an old friend of hers ? AMES I  --  hope to be . Rubbing his face and eyes with his hands . FLORENCE We 'll take you with us when he gets the car out the mud . No use to wake her up till it comes . p. 46 AMES No . It 's cold , is n't it ? FLORENCE pointing to the stove . You might make the fire up if you can do it without waking her . AMES I only need to turn the draft . I got up about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves toward the stove . Cigarette ? AMES What ? FLORENCE Got a cigarette ? AMES Oh ! He hands her his case ; she takes one . FLORENCE Light ? He lights a match and holds it for her . She smiles at him with brazen coquetry , her hand on his as she lights the cigarette from the match . She makes a fuss about my smoking . Do n't tell her , will you ? She smiles again , her face not far from his ; he looks thoughtful . AMES No . The fire begins to pick up . FLORENCE turns to AMES suddenly . FLORENCE How long you known her ? AMES What ? FLORENCE emphasizing her whisper . How long have you known my Aunt Isabel ? p. 47 AMES Yesterday ! FLORENCE she is suddenly overcome with mirth . She lifts both hands in a gesture of " Oh , go ' way ! " and choking with laughter , slaps him with her two palms upon the shoulders . She is unable to control herself ; she convulses , leaning against him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to up right . At the door she checks herself , speaks back to him huskily . I 'll see if he 's got the car out the mud ! Laughter breaks from her as she runs out of the door , up right . AMES is bothered and a little fascinated . He glances at ISABEL , then goes slowly to the door up right ; looks out . He comes down ; goes near the stove and stands , frowning thoughtfully . ISABEL murmurs , she opens her eyes ; they fall upon AMES without expression . Then she smiles slowly and speaks . ISABEL I 'm awake . AMES starts . Good morning ! ISABEL Good morning . What time is it ? AMES It 's daylight . Did you  --  ah  --  sleep well ? ISABEL Yes . Did you ? AMES Yes . I did . ISABEL I was trying to stay asleep , but I thought  --  Was the Station-Master here just now ? p. 48 AMES No ; it was your niece . ISABEL What ? She stretches her hand to him ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't mean it ! AMES Somehow she found you were here . She 's been all night trying to get a car here , she said . ISABEL Why , the dear thing ! Where 'd she go ? AMES moving toward the door up right with her . She went to see if  --  The door is flung open by FLORENCE , returning . FLORENCE It 's coming ! Comes down right . ISABEL Florence ! How 'd you find me ? They go to each other and embrace . FLORENCE We telephoned all over the world , where the wires were n't down , and this was the only place you could be ! ISABEL Florence , this is Mr. Ames . FLORENCE gaily . Right-o ! We 've had quite a chat ! We 'd better take him home with us , had n't we ? Goes back of first bench to center . ISABEL turning to AMES with a little tremulous self-consciousness at which she smiles herself . Will you ? p. 49 AMES embarrassed . Ah  --  you 're very kind  --  I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to leave you here ! It 's only a forty mile drive and we wo n't get stuck by daylight . You 'll never see breakfast in this hole ! AMES Well , as you 're so kind  --  FLORENCE Of course you 're coming ! We 'll make him , wo n't we , Aunt Isabel ? ISABEL a little coldly . I hope so . AMES awkwardly , to FLORENCE . Well , since you 're so hospitable  --  FLORENCE she slaps him on shoulder . Hospitable nothing ; we do n't see a new man-person twice a year in our neck o ' the woods , except Johnnie White , and we 're used to him ! I made the poor kid drive me , Aunt Isabel . She runs to the door and calls out , " Yay , Johnnie ! " ISABEL " Brazen hussies in boys ' breeches "  --  was n't that what you called them ? AMES nervously . Oh , but she 's different  --  she 's your niece . p. 50 ISABEL Yes , my great-niece . AMES What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you , she is n't my niece precisely  --  she 's my great-niece . Florence 's father was n't  --  AMES rather dazed , but trying to conceal it . Your  --  she 's your great-niece Oh , yes  --  A young man appears in the doorway with FLORENCE . FLORENCE enters first and goes back of first bench to center , looking at AMES . ISABEL Come in , Johnnie ! He does so . He is a boy of about twenty , dressed for motoring and heavily stained with mud and grease ; he carries a woman 's fur coat It was lovely of you to drive all night through the mud to find me . JOHNNY WHITE grinning vaguely . Well , Florence wanted me to  --  ISABEL And we all do what Florence wants ; yes . This is Mr. Ames , Mr. White . JOHNNIE goes to center behind first bench , tosses coat to FLORENCE , and shakes hands as she goes on . If you 'll help us get our bags in the car  --  p. 51 JOHNNY WHITE Yes , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . FLORENCE , with a sweet smile , gives the coat to AMES to hold for her . ISABEL continuing smilingly . We ought to be home by seven ; and there 'll be food , Mr. Ames ! Wo n't that be  --  She checks herself as she sees the care with which he is putting FLORENCE into her coat , and goes to JOHNNIE , left center . She hands him her own coat , still smiling . Johnnie , dear , if you 'll  --  JOHNNIE drops bags and holds coat for ISABEL . JOHNNY WHITE politely . Yes , indeed , Miss Stuart . FLORENCE to AMES , right center . I think you 're a rogue ! AMES laughing consciously and rather uncomfortable . What nonsense ! ISABEL Now if we can get the things into the car  --  JOHNNIE and AMES pick up the bags and lunch basket ; AMES gets into his overcoat . ISABEL goes on . I think you 'll have to let me sit by you , Johnnie , going home . I think you 'll drive better . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glad to have you . ISABEL Are we all ready ? JOHNNY WHITE going out up right with bags . Yes 'm . FLORENCE to AMES . D' you think you can entertain me for forty miles ? I do ! She runs out . AMES right center . This is very kind of you to take me in , this way  --  I  --  ah , are you coming ? ISABEL left center , starts as if to go out , then stops and looks about her wistfully , yet smiling a little . I just wanted to remember what this room looks like  --  by daylight . Things change so then . She takes his arm and starts up left . I 'll take your arm just till we get to the car ; then you 'll have Florence . As they go slowly up she continues cheerfully : Yes  --  I forgot to mention it last night ; yes , she 's my great-niece . It was n't her father who was my brother , you see  --  AMES feebly . It was n't ? ISABEL cheerfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . It was her grandfather . ISABEL takes a last rather wistfully smiling look about the room as she speaks  --  a little absently. p. 53 AMES trying not to speak feebly . Her grandfather was ? FLORENCE enters door . Takes AMES ' arm with both of her hands . Are n't you coming ? You 're going to sit with me , you know . AMES Well , I  --  He is rather bewildered and FLORENCE pulls him out through door . JOHNNIE enters door and offers his arm to ISABEL . ISABEL Thank you , Johnnie . Both exit. @x An interior  --  a " living room " and " sun-room " combined  --  of the house at MISS STUART 'S farm . It is a cheerful apartment in imaginative but quiet taste . The sun-room does not so much open out of the living-room as form a part of it  --  the upper part  --  as an ample sort of alcove . Very simple pilasters against the living-room wall , up right and up left , mark the lower corners of the sun-room , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or entrance . From each of these , the sun-room walls ( which consist principally of French windows ) extend a little distance up ; and the living-room walls extend to right and to left , thence down to front . Two of the French windows of the sun-room are practicable doors , one up right and one up left . The back of the sun-room consists mainly of three French windows , through which there is a glimpse of trees just coming into young April leaf . This is only a glimpse , however , as the windows ( which are all oblong , and without " half-moons " or arches at the top ) are prettily curtained with figured or embroidered linen . The woodwork of the sun-room is apple green . The living-room walls are done in a rather warm shade of tan ; there is a fire-place with a Todhunter type of simple mantel , right center ; and over it on the wall , a large old-fashioned mirror with gilt frame . Opposite the fire-place , left , are double doors . There is a phonograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is obscured by plants and there is a " baby-grand " piano in the corner of the living-room up left , a closed cabinet stands against the up right wall of the living-room , opposite the piano . The furniture is all comfortable , pleasant to the eye and not new ; blue-figured chintzes and easy upholstery . There is a short blue velvet " davenport " or sofa , right center , near the fireplace , and at its right elbow a very dark green console table . There is a wire flower stand with potted flowers up center in the sun-room , two old-fashioned chairs , and a rag carpet medallion on the floor . There are side-lights , in both living-room and sun-room , with shaded bulbs . There are some sprays of apple-blossoms in a jar on the piano . The morning sunshine is bright outside the sun-room windows , and the place is cheerful , but not eye-murdering , with light . The fire is burning , left , and facing it is an " old lady , " for she is undeniably both ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests Whistler 's portrait of his mother . She is dainty , but rather fretful . A youngish middle-aged man , on his knees , is rubbing the hearth and brass fender with a rag . He is a house-servant in working-clothes ; wearing a great old blue apron , his dark trousers and waistcoat ; his shirt-sleeves are rolled up and he has omitted a collar and tie . The old lady is FLORENCE 'S aunt , ELLEN . AUNT ELLEN in armchair by fireplace . Wishing him to continue a narration . Well , and then , after they had their breakfast  --  p. 55 HENRY Well , he went to sleep leanin ' on the mantelpiece , and then she had me take him up to bed in the big room . AUNT ELLEN Our having a gentleman visitor , it 's quite exciting . HENRY Yes 'm . AUNT ELLEN Is he going to stay over to-night with us ? HENRY No 'm . He said he had to get the noon train at Clinton on the main line . I got to drive him over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nice looking gentleman , Henry ? HENRY judicially . Well , to me he looks more like a man that 's kind o ' got somep 'm layin ' heavy on his mind  --  like . AUNT ELLEN I should think she 'd have been dead . HENRY No 'm ; she went over to the empty tenant 's house in the buckboard . AUNT ELLEN She 's a very remarkable woman , Henry . She says this slowly and with a kind of placid emphasis , as if she has said it , to the same listener , many times before . HENRY placidly . Yes , Miss Ellen . FLORENCE is heard outside , off up right. p. 56 FLORENCE off . Henry ! Hen-er-y ! Whoa , there ! HENRY crosses to center . It 's Miss Florence ; she went off horseback for her sleep . FLORENCE enters up right . She is dressed in riding-clothes : breeches , boots , waist , a short coat , and a dark straw hat ; she has a riding crop in her hand . Yet there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you want to ride Tim down to the barn for me ? HENRY going up obediently . Yes 'm . FLORENCE coming down . H'lo , Aunt Ellen ! HENRY exits up right . Had your breakfast ? Where 's Mr. Ames ? She flings herself in a chair right of table left with one knee over its arm . AUNT ELLEN frowning at the posture . I have n't met him . Henry tells me he 's resting . FLORENCE Poor thing ! He 's a right natty ole berry , though , Aunt Ellen . AUNT ELLEN shuddering slightly . Wo n't you sometime speak English , Florence ? p. 57 FLORENCE lightly . None o ' my friends ' d understand me if I did . FLORENCE is always lighter than she is rough ; and her tone of voice is prettier than the words she says . An electric bell rings faintly off left . That 's Johnnie ; I told him to clean up and come over and shoot some tennis . AUNT ELLEN frowning . When were you last in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , night before last . She giggles . Same as Aunt Isabel ! AUNT ELLEN coldly . We wo n't discuss  --  FLORENCE with a suppressed chuckle . No ; I guess we better not ! AUNT ELLEN But you , after being out in an automobile all night with this young Mr. White  --  FLORENCE severely . Hunting Aunt Isabel ! She goes on at once with amused slyness . What do you think of Aunt Isabel 's conduct , Aunt Ellen ? AUNT ELLEN primly . I 've told you I never discuss Aunt Isabel . One of the double doors , left , opens and a middleaged woman steps in . She is neat and responsible looking ; but more of the housekeeper type than a " maid " ; her name is MATTIE . She speaks immediately. p. 58 MATTIE It 's Mr. White . FLORENCE not rising , turns her head and calls loudly toward the door . Come on in , Johnnie ! AUNT ELLEN annoyed . Florence , please ! FLORENCE If Aunt Isabel ca n't reform me , you ca n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! JOHNNIE enters left , passing MATTIE , who goes out left at once , closing the door . JOHNNIE wears an old Norfolk jacket , a flannel shirt , white flannel trousers , and tennis shoes . He carries a racket in a shabby case under his arm and has a cap in his hand . He speaks in a grieved tone as he enters . JOHNNY WHITE You said you 'd be ready for  --  Howdy do , Miss Ellen  --  This is a brief parenthesis to AUNT ELLEN , and he goes on immediately to FLORENCE . You expect to shoot tennis in boots ? FLORENCE rising . Oh , I 'll change . You pretty near dead for sleep ? JOHNNY WHITE incredulously . Me ? Bet you are ! FLORENCE carelessly . I 'll bet you ten dollars I can go till day after to-morrow ! p. 59 JOHNNY WHITE Never close your eyes ? FLORENCE Yes , nor my mouth , either ! Goes up center . JOHNNY WHITE grimly . I lose ! FLORENCE I 'll show you how sleepy I am ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she speaks she releases a lively dance record , and turns down , extending her arms . AUNT ELLEN crossly . Florence ! Do you have to dance all the time ? FLORENCE seizing upon JOHNNIE . Absolutely ! Come on ! They begin to dance a very modern dance . AUNT ELLEN And that poor gentleman trying to get some rest upstairs ! FLORENCE It 's time for the ole kid to come down . I want to talk some more to him ! JOHNNY WHITE as they go on dancing . Done up , was he ? Well , take men that age , they ca n't do as much as if  --  FLORENCE No ! Think he 's some three-year-old ? That was a pretty rough trip we brought him . JOHNNY WHITE Hark ! I believe you 'd flirt with George Washington if you got a chance ! p. 60 FLORENCE Hush up and get off my foot ! AUNT ELLEN shudders . JOHNNY WHITE plaintive . Your Aunt Isabel was listenin ' to you the whole way too ! She did n't look to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLORENCE Ca n't you dance without talkin ' ? What you think this is : a Chautauqua ? AUNT ELLEN she has put on a pince-nez and looks at them sourly over her shoulder . It certainly is n't dancing , is it ? She is plaintively severe . FLORENCE I never could remember , Aunt Ellen : Was it you or grandma that walked a minuet with Alexander Hamilton ? AUNT ELLEN angrily . It was my great-grandmother ! FLORENCE I guess she 'd have been shocked enough if she 'd ever seen you dancing when you were young ? AUNT ELLEN rising angrily . Shocked at my dancing ? At the waltz ? The polka ! The schottische ? FLORENCE Oh , do n't get so upset ! She is a little irritated and speaks flippantly , but she keeps on dancing. p. 61 AUNT ELLEN sharply . Shame on you ! FLORENCE hotly . What for ? AUNT ELLEN rapidly . To dance , yourself , in that manner and say anyone would be shocked at my dancing , and for saying I might have danced with Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice ? AUNT ELLEN Shame ! FLORENCE Oh , do sit down ! It is a tiff , and they speak sharply and quickly . AUNT ELLEN trembling . Indeed , I shall not ! FLORENCE Stand up , then ! Gosh ! AUNT ELLEN I will retire from the room ! Going left . FLORENCE Oh , I apologize . Golly ! HENRY enters up right , leaving the door open . HENRY as he enters . She 's back . FLORENCE with gloomy scorn , to AUNT ELLEN . Now I s'pose you 'll tell her all about it ! p. 62 AUNT ELLEN quickly , but with over-dignity . I shall not . Excuse me ! Exits left . FLORENCE Oh , my ! She flings herself in a chair right of table left . I wish  --  JOHNNY WHITE looking off up right and gloomily nodding in that direction to check FLORENCE , who is about to continue speaking . Hark ! You better hush up ' f you do n't want her to  --  He means : if FLORENCE does n't want ISABEL to perceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNIE goes to left of table . ISABEL outside , up right . Henry ? HENRY right center . I 'm waitin ' . ISABEL enters cheerfully up right in the sun-room . She wears a driving-coat over her dress , driving-gloves , and a " pretty little hat . " As she comes in , her air is brisk , as of one fresh from driving on a cool morning , and she speaks as she comes down . ISABEL center . Beginning to HENRY , interrupting herself to greet JOHNNIE , and then reverting to HENRY . Henry  --  howdy do , Johnnie White  --  Henry , I want you to drive Mr. Ames to the train . p. 63 HENRY Yes 'm , you awready told me . ISABEL Let him know in plenty of time to start  --  but  --  well , not too much time . Not so that he 'll have to wait a long while at the station . With a significance in her own thought that AMES has had a great deal of station waiting lately . HENRY No 'm . Exit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out up right . FLORENCE 'S attitude and look are of a brooding sort . ISABEL 'S glance rests momentarily upon her , but she speaks to JOHNNIE . Johnnie White , why is this lady so gloomy ? JOHNNIE shakes his head briefly . What 's the matter ? To FLORENCE . Where 's your Aunt Ellen ? Has n't she come down yet ? FLORENCE with rueful sulkiness . Oh , yes ; she was here ! ISABEL comprehending cheerfully . Oh , I see . What was it about ? FLORENCE She did n't like it because  --  Why , I was only makin ' fun of old-fashioned dancing . Everything old-fashioned is so funny . ISABEL center . Is n't it ! I used to say that to my grand-mother . Did you apologize ? p. 64 FLORENCE Yes . I did . ISABEL Did you say , " I apologize golly " ? JOHNNY WHITE surprised . Why , Miss Stuart ! How 'd you guess Florence said that ? ISABEL back of FLORENCE . When you live with ' em , Johnnie , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thinking now ? She puts her hand on FLORENCE 'S shoulder , FLORENCE still being seated . JOHNNY WHITE shaking his head . No 'm ; I certainly do n't . ISABEL She 's wondering why people are always so queer when they get older . JOHNNY WHITE with slightly sour significance . Well , she might ask Mr. Ames about that . He must be anyway pretty near something way long over thirty or something , is n't he , Miss Stuart ? ISABEL Yes , I 'm afraid he must be almost that near the end ! But still I rather doubt if she will ask Mr. Ames about it , Johnnie . No ; hardly . Crosses center . Smiling to him as he grins in rueful comprehension . FLORENCE Oh , I like old men . She comes out of her brooding fit as she rises . Do n't you think Mr. Ames is terribly intriguing ? Seriously and quickly. p. 65 ISABEL " Intriguing " ? No , I think he seems honest  --  well , quite honest , at least ! FLORENCE But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has an uncle who 's distinguished ; that is , he 's always spoken of as remarkable because he plays polo at sixty-six . The uncle , I mean , Florence , of course . FLORENCE This man 's a man that really interests me . I think from his looks he has the power to think . Severely . Very few people have the power to think in this world , you know , Aunt Isabel . ISABEL back of table . Oh , yes ; fewer and fewer every day ! It 's quite natural for  --  Turning unexpectedly to JOHNNIE . Have you the power to think , Johnnie White ? JOHNNY WHITE No 'm . You know what she means , do n't you ? FLORENCE coldly , absently . Never mind . ISABEL in an impressed whisper , to JOHNNIE . She 's thinking . Crosses center . FLORENCE Aunt Isabel , I really would like him to stay over a day or so . p. 66 ISABEL He said he had to go on to New York at noon . I 'm afraid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses center . Oh , well , you know man always can stay if they want to . ISABEL That 's why it 's better not to urge them ; they may only make it clearer they do n't want to . FLORENCE at the door . Oh , Mr. Ames might change his mind  --  later . Crosses to door , left . ISABEL Before you begin with that , dear , could you please first go and apologize to your Aunt Ellen ? FLORENCE Oh , all right . Moodily . ISABEL by the fireplace . Try it without a golly ! FLORENCE All right , I 'll go and kid her to death . Exit left . ISABEL turns to JOHNNIE , sitting on sofa , right . Do n't you seem to " intrigue " Florence at all , Johnnie ? JOHNNY WHITE No 'm . She just takes a notion . Crosses to center . ISABEL You mean she just gets this way . p. 67 JOHNNY WHITE Yes 'm ; when there 's somebody around she 's fixin ' to make ' em get mush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Miss Stuart ? ISABEL I fancy I may have , just possibly ! JOHNNY WHITE Then she rubs that power-to-think business all over me , because the faculty found out I was n't intellectual or something , so I had to abandon my college career . He is very serious . ISABEL sitting on the sofa and concealing a tendency to laugh . Come on . I see you want to say something more to me . JOHNNY WHITE swallowing . Sits on sofa left of MISS STUART . Yes 'm . Miss Stuart , you 're a woman that 's had a good many men go mush over you ; so with your experience , why , the truth is , I may not have all the brains in the world , but she has n't , either , but she gets these fits when she thinks she has ; and what I want to say is simply : why , you know how it is , when there 's some new man around , she treats me more like some door-mat than a person . ISABEL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHITE I just wanted to say so because you 've had prob'ly more experience of life than I 've had , no doubt . p. 68 ISABEL How long do you expect to feel this way about her , Johnnie ? JOHNNY WHITE swallowing . Well , if everything turns out all right  --  though it do n't look so much like it right now , but if it does , and she finds out I 'm her  --  her  --  well , her real mate , as it were , why , I expect to go on and on with her  --  and on and on  --  and on and  --  He seems to be going on , though slowing down . ISABEL " On and on and on "  --  until you 're just any age  --  oh , twenty-eight or even twenty-nine , maybe ? JOHNNY WHITE Yes 'm . Indefinitely . ISABEL Suppose you were  --  past thirty , Johnnie . Suppose , like Mr. Ames , you were even  --  well , whatever age we 'll say Mr. Ames is . JOHNNY WHITE slightly amused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be sittin ' around somewhere , if I was alive . ISABEL But you 'd still like Florence to be about nineteen , would n't you ? JOHNNY WHITE Well , about the way she looks now , yes 'm . That 's a good deal why I like her : the way she looks . ISABEL smiling . It is n't fair , is it ? p. 69 JOHNNY WHITE Ma'am ? ISABEL You see , when you 're twenty you like us to be nineteen , and when you 're fifty you 're apt to like us to be nineteen ! Well , we ca n't manage it , you see ! We ca n't stay nineteen , much as we want to please you ! JOHNNY WHITE smiles . Oh , well , I guess I 'd feel just the same about Florence if she was a thousand . ISABEL looking at him quickly . Would you ? If she were a thousand ? JOHNNY WHITE laughing a little ruefully . I guess I would ! As if he 'd prob'ly have to . ISABEL You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did , I guess then she 'd know what sort of a man I am . ISABEL thoughtfully and rather slowly . Yes ; she ought to ! JOHNNY WHITE going on . And she 'd see how I really feel about her . ISABEL smiling quickly . Yes ; so she would ! It 's quite an idea ! Rises. p. 70 JOHNNY WHITE rises . ' Course I do n't think anything 'll come o ' the way she acts over this Mr. Ames . For one thing , I b'lieve he 'd have too much sense . ISABEL Do you ? You can never be sure of that , Johnnie ! JOHNNY WHITE Well , she begged him a lot to stay over till tomorrow and he said he could n't ; just like he did when you asked him , Miss Stuart . ISABEL Yes , that looks intelligent of him , if he sticks to it and goes . JOHNNY WHITE And , anyhow , he only said one personal thing to her all the time , and it was kind of a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ? JOHNNY WHITE It was when you went to hurry the cook with breakfast . Mr. Ames asked Florence  --  oh , well , it was n't so frightful " personal . " ISABEL What was it , Johnnie ? JOHNNY WHITE Well , she said she s'posed she 'd be as old as her grandfather before she got any breakfast and he asked her if she knew how old her grandfather was . ISABEL He did ? He asked her that ? What did she tell him ? p. 71 JOHNNY WHITE She did n't know . Anxiously . Do you think that was pretty personal ? I do n't see  --  ISABEL crosses center . Why , yes ; I believe I do . I believe I think it was quite " personal " indeed  --  asking her how old her grandfather was ! MATTIE enters , left . ISABEL quickly on her entrance . What is it ? MATTIE The gentleman . I heard him stirrin ' round ; you said to let you know . ISABEL rather eagerly . Yes ? MATTIE I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mattle , it seems to me you told me once you did n't think this was a becoming hat . MATTIE No 'm . You ast me , and I says I never could like it on you , ma'am . ISABEL Good gracious ! You might be right ! She hurries away up through the sun-room and off up left . JOHNNY WHITE Did n't hear Miss Florence stirrin ' around or anything , did you ? MATTIE with a glance toward where ISABEL departed . Yes , sir . She 's changin ' her things  --  again  --  too ! Going to exit left. p. 72 JOHNNY WHITE rather sharply as she opens the door . Will you ask her how long she thinks I  --  He is checked by an approach seen through the open door ; muttersoh ! and turns right . AMES enters right , passing MATTIE , who waits for him to pass ; then exit right . AMES has changed his clothes for tweeds ; he looks freshened but preoccupied . AMES in greeting . Ah  --  Mr. White ? Have n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . J'you get rested up some ? They shake hands . AMES crossing to the fire , right . Oh , yes ; quite a little . I suppose our two  --  ah  --  comrades  --  are n't down yet . Miss Stuart must be pretty much exhausted , I 'm afraid . JOHNNY WHITE She does n't act like it . Right after you went up to bed she drove off to one of her farms on business . Sits right of table left . AMES She did ? JOHNNY WHITE casually ; not boasting for her . Drivin ' herself in a buckboard. p. 73 AMES Why , I declare ! JOHNNY WHITE Oh , Miss Stuart 's considered a pretty remarkable woman , you know . AMES struck by this , frowns somewhat thoughtfully . She is . She 's considered  --  remarkable ? JOHNNY WHITE shaking his head , seriously . Yes , indeed ! She 's the most remarkable of her family . AMES thoughtful . I feel myself rather at a loss ; I seem to be here so  --  so unexpectedly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm rather  --  ah  --  confused about the family . Miss Stuart 's father and mother , I take it , are n't living ? JOHNNY WHITE Golly , no ! I du n no when they died ! AMES set back a little . A considerable time ago , I suppose . JOHNNY WHITE Well , yes ! Must ' a ' been ! AMES rather wistfully , yet trying to sound careless and casual . You do n't remember them , I take it . JOHNNY WHITE carelessly . Me ? Golly , no ! AMES Ah  --  the present family , then  --  p. 74 JOHNNY WHITE It 's just Miss Stuart and Miss Ellen Stuart and Florence . AMES Miss Ellen Stuart I have n't met . Sits on sofa . JOHNNY WHITE She 's Florence 's aunt . AMES Her aunt ? JOHNNY WHITE Yes , I always get mixed up on relations , too . He sits on the small of his back , crossing his legs ; and decides to try a wicked shot . I do n't know how old my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! AMES unconscious of the effort just made . It seems to me that last night Miss Stuart spoke of two orphan nieces she was bringing up . JOHNNY WHITE Bringin ' up ? Florence is one , but Miss Stuart could n't ' a ' meant she was bringin ' Miss Ellen up . She 's about a hundred  --  or a hundred and ten , maybe ! Anyhow , she must be around sixty . AMES I must have been mistaken . Then there are just these three ladies in the family . JOHNNY WHITE Three 's all . They do need a man around . AMES Uh  --  yes . It would  --  ah  --  seem so . They look at each other with some coldness . FLORENCE is heard singing off left. p. 75 JOHNNY WHITE This un comin ' needs more'n one the way she acts  --  lately ! FLORENCE enters , left , singing till she gets into the room , then she stops suddenly . She wears a most becoming tennis costume , but accompanies it with white high-heeled slippers . She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a racquet and a net bag of tennis balls in the other . There are five or six balls , not all new . AMES rises and goes a little to right . FLORENCE crosses to center , back of table . To AMES . Oh ! You 're here , too ! JOHNNY WHITE muttering ironically , not moving . So 'm I here , too ! AMES gallantly . I 'm glad you did n't know it , if that 's why you kept on singing . FLORENCE going over to him . I told you in the car you were a quick worker ! She does n't smile . I 've taken a frightful fancy to you ! JOHNNY WHITE before AMES can speak . One of the mail service aviators had to land in their back meadow here , last month . She pulled that on him before his wheels touched ground . FLORENCE I did n't ! p. 76 JOHNNY WHITE placidly stubborn . You did . You had to holler to make him hear it ! FLORENCE turning seriously to AMES for sympathy . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz . In this life people meet a girl , but so often they do n't see she prob'ly has thoughts other people could n't think ! I have to lead two lives : one outdoors with mere adolescents , but the other : that 's a life apart . You understand what I mean , do n't you ? AMES smiling . I think so . FLORENCE I thought you would . That 's why you intrigue me so . Softly . You 're a great kid ! She slaps him on arm . JOHNNY WHITE Oh , listen ! FLORENCE glances at him . FLORENCE Mr. Ames , do n't you believe that very few people in this life have the power to really think ? JOHNNY WHITE sliding to the floor from his chair . Oo-ooh , Mike ! FLORENCE annoyed , turning . Cut the rough stuff , you caterpillar . Her tone is severe but quiet. p. 77 JOHNNY WHITE rising to his knees and seeming to paddle with his racquet at the tennis shoes in her hand . You goin ' to wear four shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never can bear to put flat shoes on till the last minute . And then  --  She removes one slipper . It 's so troublesome gettin ' ' em on  --  AMES May I help you ? FLORENCE Oh , if you would  --  JOHNNY WHITE embittered , up center . Oh ! That 's why you brought ' em ! I see ! FLORENCE giving him a cold quick glance , but speaking to AMES . He kneels before her . It 's outrageous of me to let you take so much trouble ! Then leaning toward him , she speaks softly . JOHNNY WHITE Oh , my ! He goes out of the picture , stepping out up right . FLORENCE softly . Mr. Ames , please stay over till tomorrow . I ask you to . AMES You 're very kind . I could n't let your aunt think I 'm so vacillating . You see , I told her I had to be in New York this evening . p. 78 FLORENCE But you just said you had to go , did n't you ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit ? AMES laughing . Yes ; something like that . But after telling your aunt that I could n't stay  --  FLORENCE But are n't there any reasons you 'd like to stay ? AMES thoughtfully . Yes , there are . FLORENCE Then I 'll fix it for you . I 'll say you sent a wire to New York letting ' em know you reached here , and I 'll write a message on one of our telegraph blanks to you . It 'll be the answer from New York telling you there is n't any reason for you to leave . She is pleased with her idea . AMES laughing , but a little nervous over her idea . Oh , no ! FLORENCE I will ! I 'll have a man bring it in . Do n't you spoil it . AMES I could n't  --  FLORENCE Yes , you could ! And when my telegram comes , if you give me away  --  She is interrupted by JOHNNIE 'S return . JOHNNIE has been just beyond the threshold up right , looking off out doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 79 JOHNNY WHITE I got it ! FLORENCE she checks AMES , who is about to expound his protest . Hush ! To JOHNNIE . You got what ? JOHNNY WHITE Got a wish I just made . He points to door up left , then claps his hand over his mouth as if undesirous the lady entering should hear him ; he is facing that way . ISABEL enters up left in the sun-room . She has taken off her hat and coat ; is in a very pretty morning dress , and carries some " work " in her hand ; a " work bag . " She comes in looking at JOHNNIE , who has his hand over his mouth . ISABEL What 's the matter , Johnnie White ? He jerks his head toward AMES and FLORENCE , who are down right center . For an instant ISABEL lets it be seen that she is the least bit taken aback . Oh ! She immediately smiles , as if pleased . Oh ! She comes down as she speaks . Your shoes are too  --  large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " AMES looking up at ISABEL with a little embarrassment . Ah  --  she  --  I was helping her to  --  ah  --  change . p. 80 ISABEL smiling . You were ? AMES That is , I am . She mentioned some difficulty in  --  ah  --  doing it herself , and I  --  ISABEL sunnily . I should think you would ! Who would n't ? And who would n't make it as long as possible , too ! She turns to a chair , left center . AMES rising . It 's  --  ah  --  done . As he has taken off FLORENCE 'S second slipper he has unconsciously put it under his arm , where it still is . ISABEL Is it ? Already ? JOHNNY WHITE sharply , to FLORENCE . C 'm on , here ! FLORENCE All right , I 'm coming ; what 's the hurry ? JOHNNY WHITE FLORENCE goes up as he speaks . JOHNNIE has gone down to the sofa she has occupied , and has picked up the bag of tennis balls . He immediately goes up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in a breath . Betcha dollar I beat you t ' the tennis court ! Both rush for the door up right . He swings her back up right . FLORENCE strikes at him with her racket. p. 81 FLORENCE giggling as she runs after him . No fair , you got a start . ISABEL is looking at AMES , who is standing , still in some embarrassment , near the fireplace , unconscious of the slipper under his arm ; he is looking up at the departing couple . The other slipper is on the seat of FLORENCE 'S chair . ISABEL Are n't they extraordinary , Mr. Ames ? AMES turns . Are n't they extraordinary , these young things ! Not tidy , though . She 's left her slippers on the sofa . Glancing at the slipper , then again at him ; she begins to sew some lace into cambric . AMES still embarrassed and not catching this . It seems to me you 're rather extraordinary yourself , my dear  --  he pauses an instant , then hastily adds  --  lady . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISABEL as if a little suspiciously . I ? Do you think so ? In what way ? AMES Sleeping a few hours on a wooden bench , motoring forty miles of mud hills , then driving off in a buckboard instead of collapsing ! ISABEL looking at him . Oh , a country life keeps people quite robust . It 's  --  " remarkable ! " Then looking at her work . As I said , though . I 'm afraid Florence is untidy , sometimes . With a little gesture toward the slipper . You see where she 's left that pair of slippers. p. 82 AMES glancing at it absently . Pair ? Ah  --  there 's only one . ISABEL bending her head over her work . So ? Could you find the other ? Sits right of table left . AMES Oh , certainly . He glances absently about , then realizes , with a start , that the slipper is under his arm ; she seems oblivious of everything except her lace-making . He hastily puts the slipper under the chair ; straightens up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stoops , looking about . Ah  --  I think it 's under the  --  Oh , yes . Here it is . He puts it with the other one and comes to center . ISABEL Will you set them on the hearth , please ? AMES Certainly . ISABEL with a matter-of-fact amiability . Then it 'll be easy to find them if she comes back soon to have them put on again . AMES Oh , ye  --  He begins to say " Oh , yes , " but checks himself uncomfortably . He places shoes at fireplace , then goes to right center  --  and is conscious of them as rather damnatory ; and a pause follows in which he glances back and down at them twice. p. 83 ISABEL I 'm sorry you felt you could n't stay over till tomorrow , but since you insisted you could n't  --  Inquiringly , as if giving him a chance to alter his mind . AMES I  --  I 'm afraid I ought to get back . ISABEL with a submissive nod , regretting . Very well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . Moving toward her . Ah  --  Is that lace you are making ? ISABEL Do you like it ? AMES putting on a pair of glasses , rather hastily looking at the lace and , as hastily , slipping the glasses back into his waistcoat pocket again as he speaks . It 's very lovely  --  yes . You must have remarkable eyes to do that . ISABEL after a look at him . Yes , my eyes are quite good . Using " quite " to mean " rather " as elderly people speak of pleasant faculties still remaining . AMES Is it a  --  what they call a doyley ? ISABEL glancing at him thoughtfully . I wonder if I ought n't to make a little  --  cap  --  of it . p. 84 AMES perplexed . A cap ? ISABEL Do n't you think it 's a pretty fashion  --  a lace cap on the head ? AMES You mean like the Breton peasant women ? ISABEL No ; I was thinking of our grandmothers AMES But  --  ah  --  ISABEL letting it touch her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Her tone is entirely " natural , " as if she considered the possibility seriously . AMES trying not to be at all flustered . Of course I should  --  like you  --  in anything . ISABEL Are you sure you would ? AMES Why , how can you ask me ? ISABEL working . As sure as you were last night ? AMES Yes , indeed . ISABEL And you would like me in a cap ? AMES Well , would n't it seem a little  --  ISABEL Do you mean you think it would seem a little  --  premature ? p. 85 AMES Decidedly , I  --  Breathlessly correcting himself . Of course it would . I meant  --  Goes back of table to left . ISABEL You must n't flatter me too much . AMES with almost plaintive inquiry . " Flatter " you ? ISABEL smiling . I 'll keep off the cap as long as I can . Really , there 's no excuse for caps now . I suppose women used to wear ' em because in those days there were so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like imports from Paris . And , besides , they did n't approve of ' em , poor things ! AMES Pardon me . Who did n't approve of what ? ISABEL Our grandmothers did n't approve of accomplishing marvels with cosmetics . You know the miracles they do to faces nowadays . AMES Miracles ? Sits left of table . ISABEL It 's  --  remarkable ! No ; there 's no excuse for a woman to wear a cap these days  --  not till she has to just absolutely give up ! Then at her work . Do n't you think so ? p. 86 AMES Oh  --  oh , yes ! ISABEL Oh , it 's just struck me  --  Rises . I ought to be entertaining you , ought n't I ? But we have n't any family photograph album . AMES What a lucky family ! ISABEL I could show you some daguerreotypes , though . Yes  --  rising suddenly upon a thought  --  you ought to see some of our heirlooms . She gives him a fleeting faint smile , and leaving her work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall up right ; opens the doors , and brings forth an old mahogany case . She brings this down to the table , left center , opens it , takes out a folding daguerreotype . AMES rather surprised . Daguerreotypes ? ISABEL stands back of table . Yes . We do n't show them to every visitor , of course . Sit down . She hands him the daguerreotype . There . You like my father ? AMES rather touched , yet rather apprehensive . Is that your father ? He must have been a very fine-looking man . Is that a  --  a stock he 's wearing ? p. 87 ISABEL Yes . I did think stocks were so becoming , did n't you ? Handing him another daguerreotype . That 's my Aunt Margaret , father 's sister , at ninety-one . We all live very long on my father 's side . AMES Ah  --  very intelligent face . ISABEL Daguerreotypes have a charm , have n't they ? I wonder people stopped taking them . AMES becoming more preoccupied . I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . ISABEL No ; I do n't think I have , either . Handing him another . That 's my Uncle Charles , in his uniform . He was a colonel . AMES In the  --  Civil War ? ISABEL Oh , no , in the Mexican War . AMES more disturbed , but concealing it fairly well . Ah  --  he must have been a very fine-looking man . ISABEL Yes , indeed ! She smiles as she hands him another . Here 's one of a little girl  --  that is , a young girl . Does anything about her strike you as  --  familiar ? AMES looking at her , not at the daguerreotype , and trying to conceal a foreboding . Familiar ? p. 88 ISABEL Yes . See if you do n't guess who it is . AMES vaguely . " Who is it ? " He looks at it ; then suddenly looks closer ; starts slightly , draws his head back from it , staring incredulously . ISABEL Ca n't you guess who it is ? AMES huskily . Why , it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with painfully growing conviction . ISABEL Why ca n't it ? AMES Is n't it your  --  mother ? ISABEL in a tone that smilingly chides him for being so slow . No-o  --  AMES with some plaintiveness . Why , there were n't any taken after  --  why , it could n't be  --  ISABEL with a little archness . Oh , but this girl  --  you see , she was only a child , really . AMES feebly trying to be hearty . Oh , yes ; that 's all she was . I see . She was n't  --  ISABEL sunnily . No . Not over sixteen or seventeen , no . Do n't you see any resemblance ? p. 89 AMES with a slight struggle . Well , it 's charming enough to  --  ISABEL It 's a sister of mine . AMES It is ? Your sister ? ISABEL musingly . Yes , she was quite a lot older than I am and married a missionary and they were lost in a typhoon . AMES Oh  --  I 'm sorry . ISABEL reassuringly . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the pictures back in the box . There ! I just wanted to see if you 'd see the resemblance : I wo n't put you through all the others . She takes up her work and sits again as she speaks . AMES huskily . Thank you ! Then hurriedly . Thank you for showing ' em to me ! He rises , wipes his forehead hastily , and moves toward the fireplace , taking out his cigarette case . Thank you . May I smoke here ? She nods . I  --  ah  --  I  --  ah  --  Crosses to console table , right center . Lights cigarette . ISABEL cheerfully and working . Daguerreotypes and things like that bring back such dear old times to us , do n't they ? p. 90 AMES unguardedly . I suppose they  --  Hastily . They do , of course ! He takes out two cigarettes . Yes , they do bring them back . She gives him a glance , and bends over her work . Seated right of table left . ISABEL " Where are the snows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ? " The wind has blown them all away ! " Do you remember when all the young men made " New Year 's Calls " and all the girls and their mothers kept " Open House "  --  those dear jolly old times ? AMES Oh , yes , indeed . I 've heard they  --  ISABEL Even politics seemed simpler then . It was easier when we let men do all that for us , though they did get so many things wrong , poor things ! AMES Oh , I do n't know ; we elected Roosevelt , and  --  ISABEL with a spiritedness , as of patriotic indignation . Yes , but if women had voted when Mr. Tilden ran against Hayes  --  and  --  Wheeler , you surely do n't believe there 'd have been all that excitement over the election , do you ? AMES I  --  I  --  do n't  --  p. 91 ISABEL earnestly . You know that was a terrible thing . AMES About Tilden and Hayes  --  and  --  Wheeler ? ISABEL Do n't you think it was ? AMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hastily substitutes : Oh , yes ; it was , of course . ISABEL My poor father used to get excited over that to the day of his death ! AMES relieved . Oh , your father did ! Crosses right . ISABEL Well , I thought it was wrong , too . He stares at her , again perplexed ; she sews . AMES You ah  --  ISABEL casually . What ? AMES apologetically . Nothing . That is , I had nothing in mind to say . Goes up right . ISABEL musing , smiling . I suppose my father felt it so much because he knew Mr. Tilden . I never met him . As if she had met others like him . But I should like to see Mr. Cleveland 's expression if he could see women voting ! Or General Harrison 's ! p. 92 AMES General Harrison 's expression ? Do you mean Harrison who was President  --  in  --  ah  --  eighteen  --  ah  --  Goes to right center back of sofa . ISABEL Yes ; President Benjamin Harrison . Good gracious ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison , who was President in eighteen-forty or something ! AMES hastily , laughing feebly . No , no . I knew you did n't mean him ! ISABEL Well , no ! She sews , and takes up the theme as if musing absently . Most of them used to be Generals before they ran for President , did n't they ? AMES You mean like General Harrison ? ISABEL Yes . General Harrison , General Garfield  --  AMES Oh  --  yes . ISABEL And most of all , General Grant . AMES feebly . Yes , General Grant . ISABEL laughing absently as she sews . We 'd hardly remember him  --  of course . She looks up at him as if disquieted by a thought , though she smiles nervously . You  --  you never did see him , did you ? As if diplomatically getting at his age. p. 93 AMES General Grant ? No . ISABEL as if relieved , smiling a little , as if at an absurdity as she looks back at her work . Of course I supposed not . AMES No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carelessly , then seems to become aware of something unusual in his look at her . ISABEL What is it ? AMES I  --  ah  --  nothing ! ISABEL Oh , yes ; I can tell : You 're thinking about something that bothers you . At least you looked as if you were puzzling about something . Were n't you ? AMES hurriedly . Indeed , I was n't ; not at all ! ISABEL I 'm sure you are wondering about something . AMES No . I 'm not . Not about anything at all . Crosses right to front of sofa . ISABEL Yes , but you are . I wonder if I know what you 're wondering about . AMES too quickly . Sits on sofa . No , you do n't . That is , I meant to say you do n't , because I 'm not , so you could n't . ISABEL But I think I do . p. 94 AMES Indeed , you 're mistaken . I 'm not wondering about anything . Not about anything ! ISABEL Are n't you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; certainly not . Rises . Nothing at all . That is , I 'm not wondering . Of course I 'm thinking about you  --  ISABEL quickly . What are you thinking about me ? AMES Nothing . Nothing at all . ISABEL nodding . I see . You 're thinking about me but you are n't thinking anything in particular about me . AMES Yes . No ! ISABEL I understand perfectly . AMES No , but you do n't . ISABEL Yes . You meant Yes and no . Did n't you ? AMES Well , I  --  Crosses back of table to left . ISABEL Of course you did . That clears it all up , you see ; " yes and no . " Smiling . I 'm glad you made it so plain . AMES thoroughly confused and rather dismayed . But what ? What was it I made plain ? p. 95 ISABEL What you were thinking about me . It 's perfectly natural you would wonder a little about that , too . AMES But I did n't . I assure you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help wondering about what you 're wondering about ? AMES But I 'm not ! Indeed I 'm not ! ISABEL laughing . Why , of course you are ! You 're wondering just how romantic I am . That 's what you 're wondering ! AMES much relieved . Sits . Oh ! Oh , well , perhaps I was wondering a little about that ! Yes , I  --  I admit it . You are romantic , you say ? ISABEL I was when I was a child . AMES with some eagerness . What were you romantic about then ? ISABEL When I was a child ? AMES Yes . What did you find to be romantic about ? What  --  uh  --  in a general way , I mean . ISABEL lightly thoughtful . Oh  --  well , I suppose the same things you were being romantic about at the same time  --  that is , about the same time  --  I suppose . She does not smile and speaks without stress. p. 96 AMES smiling nervously , trying to be easy . Oh , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole country about that time , do n't you ? AMES Just about  --  then ? Slight stress on " then . " ISABEL Yes . I think what did it was the World 's Fair . AMES You do ? Well , there was the San Francisco Fair and the St. Louis one and the  --  the one at Buffalo and  --  and , yes , was n't there one once in Chicago in  --  ah , in  --  ISABEL Yes , and one in Philadelphia in 1876 . AMES But I meant : which one was the one you meant made everybody so romantic ? ISABEL easily as she sews again . I was speaking of the one when I was a child . AMES Oh , yes , that one . He is uncomfortably going on , if he can think what to say . ISABEL looking up innocently . I know what you 're trying to do . AMES Why , we were just talking along . I was n't trying to  --  to  --  to  --  p. 97 ISABEL Why , yes , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You keep on trying to find out how romantic I still am ! AMES Oh ! Oh , well  --  ISABEL Oh , I do n't mean that I 'm as romantic as you are , Mr. Ames ! The most romantic woman is n't so romantic as the least romantic man . AMES What ? ISABEL It 's very simple . You see , men do n't get older . AMES Men do n't ? ISABEL No , they do n't . They do n't get older and they stay young and romantic . FLORENCE outside . Mr. Ames ! Mr. Ames ! ISABEL Do n't they ? Stay romantic ? AMES Well , I  --  I  --  ISABEL For instance , when you 're interested in anyone , do n't you prefer to be alone with them ? AMES Yes , I do  --  I am  --  we are  --  FLORENCE outside . Mr. Ames ! Mr. Ames ! ISABEL Does n't she mean you ? p. 98 AMES Oh , yes , your charming little niece . ISABEL Charming ! Yes ! AMES Oh , that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I mentioned last night . ISABEL Yes , I believe you did . AMES But there is something about this one that  --  ISABEL Yes ! AMES Yes , indeed ! She 's your  --  FLORENCE outside . Mr. Ames ! Mr. Ames ! ISABEL She 's calling you , is n't she ? AMES So it seems . ISABEL Had n't you better  --  AMES Yes . I 'll just tell her  --  perhaps I 'd better . ISABEL Yes , do . AMES Yes , yes , I  --  Goes up center , looking off right . FLORENCE outside . Mr. Ames ! ISABEL rises and goes to left center , listens for a second , and then crosses to door , left . AMES Just a moment ! Your aunt and I  --  oh , have you finished your game ? ISABEL exits door , left. p. 99 FLORENCE outside . I 'm coming . AMES She 's coming . Turns and stares at ISABEL 'S vacant chair . Goes up center , looks off left . Goes to door down left and looks off . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her racquet but not the net of balls . I knocked all the balls as far as I could in the shrubbery . He has to hunt till he finds ' em . Comes down left center . Then I ran and fixed about that telegram . AMES apprehensively . Oh , no . I really ca n't  --  FLORENCE lightly . Do n't worry ! If you do n't like it when it comes , you can just say it is n't important and tear it up , ca n't you ? AMES I suppose so . Disturbed . FLORENCE Attaboy ! Crosses right . AMES nervously , pacing up and down left . But I  --  FLORENCE seriously . Is anything bothering you ? She sits on sofa , right . AMES with a rather hurried laugh . Why , of course not ! p. 100 FLORENCE Did Aunt Isabel say  --  AMES She said  --  she said  --  I understood her to say that she was n't your aunt exactly  --  FLORENCE carelessly . No , she 's my great-aunt . AMES Yes ; so she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many young great-aunts . FLORENCE carelessly . Young great-aunts ? I do n't see how they could be . AMES looking at her plaintively . Oh , I meant comparatively , like your Aunt Isabel . FLORENCE Oh , I s'pose Aunt Ellen knows how old Aunt Isabel is , but you know how some women are . AMES hurriedly . You mean these miracles ? FLORENCE No ; I mean they do n't usually tell . I do n't see why people get so sensitive about things like that ; I 'll tell anybody that wants to know , what I am ; I 'm nineteen ; I do n't care ! Golly ! AMES right . Well , it 's a subject I 'm interested in ; always been interested in , I mean . I mean in a general way , of course . p. 101 FLORENCE What you gettin ' at ? Do you always do this when you 're alone with people ; talk about other women and their ages ? AMES hastily . No ! No , indeed , I do n't ! FLORENCE coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm on right confidential terms with Aunt Isabel and I could ask her right out how  --  AMES vehemently . No ! You must n't think of such a thing . You really must n't ! FLORENCE I wo n't . That is , I wo n't if you 're nice to me . Do n't I intrigue you any ? AMES You do ! Do n't you see how much you do ? FLORENCE I never have had a chance at a man of experience . You would n't ever think that I suffer terribly , would you ? AMES You do ? Sits on sofa left of FLORENCE . FLORENCE I suffer fearfully ! AMES What from ? FLORENCE Well , from thoughts . I suffer because nobody understands ' em and so I ca n't tell ' em . I do n't know what makes me tell you all these things , like this  --  smiles at him trustingly  --  but it 's nice , our getting intimate this way , is n't it ? Going almost straight on . Do you remember where you left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your slippers ? FLORENCE Will you see , please ? I thought maybe you 'd be so awfully kind as to  --  She sweetly lets the inference be made as she projects a foot . AMES uneasily . I rather think your aunt said she was coming back . FLORENCE Do n't you remember what you did with ' em ? A sweet , slight reproach . AMES I think I put them  --  FLORENCE looking about . They have n't been taken out , have they ? AMES right centerI do n't think so . I did n't see anyone  --  FLORENCE Why , there they are on the hearth ! AMES Oh , yes , so they are ! FLORENCE Would it be too outrageous of me to  --  AMES Oh , no , indeed ! Rises and starts left . FLORENCE No , over there . AMES crosses to fireplace . Gets slippers. p. 103 AMES glancing apprehensively left . I 'll be only too delighted ! He kneels . FLORENCE as he helps her to exchange the tennis shoes for the slippers . My , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper side of life a few minutes now and then ! None of FLORENCE 'S speeches should be exaggerated in manner or " pointed . " AMES nervously . I 'm glad you like it . FLORENCE Is that all ? Could n't you make it any stronger ? Do n't you think I 'm a grand little thing ? She bends toward him , apparently earnest . AMES smiling wanly but speaking with warmth . I do . FLORENCE You do  --  what ? AMES I do  --  indeed ! JOHNNIE enters up right with the net of tennis balls . FLORENCE earnestly . Attaboy ! You 're sure you " do indeed " ? JOHNNY WHITE up right center , speaking all in a breath . Why do n't you try the lady with a pair o ' nines , Mr. Ames ; we got a good stock o ' nine-B 's on the top shelf in the store-room ! AUNT ELLEN enters left . She comes in rather quickly ; her expression is gracious ; but she is astonished to find AMES on his knees before FLORENCE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to go out indignantly by the way she has come. p. 104 AUNT ELLEN Excuse me ! Turns back left . AMES Oh  --  He would rise , but FLORENCE checks him . FLORENCE My other slipper ! AMES hastily . But I  --  He sees ISABEL through open door left . Oh , gracious ! Rising . ISABEL enters , left . ISABEL smilingly and smoothly  --  as she enters . Ellen , dear , I 've been looking for you ; to meet Mr. Ames . Laughing commiseratingly , she comes to them . Poor Florence , is she having trouble with her new slippers again ? ISABEL points to tennis shoe AMES has under his arm ; he immediately throws it on sofa . I 'm afraid you 'll think we 're terrible people to make use of our visitors , Mr. Ames . AMES who has risen . Oh , no , not at all , not at all , indeed ! ISABEL has crossed to right of him , ELLEN is left center . I 'm afraid we do , though . You 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture indicating ELLEN . I think I told you I wanted you to meet my other  --  ah  --  She is speaking with inconsequent cheerfulness  --  and tapers the sound off as he turns toward ELLEN . ISABEL , smilingly nodding toward ELLEN . Ellen , dear , this is Mr. Ames . p. 105 AMES Ah , ah  --  He bows . AUNT ELLEN non-committal . How do you do ? ISABEL Mr. Ames , Ellen is my other niece . AMES Your other  --  how do you do ! With a blank expression . He makes an inarticulate sound and stands in an instantaneously arrested attitude . ISABEL easily . Now you know my whole family ; my niece and my great-niece . They 're both the greatest comfort to me . AMES hastily . Oh , yes . Thank you ! ISABEL lightly turning from him . And , Florence , if you 've finished with the  --  the footwear  --  ELLEN sits by the table , left center . AMES Oh , yes , we 've finished . ISABEL sunnily including JOHNNIE and speaking as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then would n't  --  would n't you three like to  --  would n't you three like to dance or something ? AMES What ? p. 106 ISABEL crossing to ELLEN near the table , left center . You must all go right on entertaining yourselves just as if we were n't here . We love to look on , do n't we , Ellen ? AUNT ELLEN with a glance toward FLORENCE 'S feet . Yes , when they behave . Sits left of table  --  ISABEL sits right of table . ISABEL laughing to ELLEN on this , then at once speaking to the other group . Ca n't you think of anything to amuse yourselves ? Then as with a quick afterthought , not seriously said , yet perhaps meant . You do n't mind our being here , do you ? FLORENCE jumping up . Of course not ! Turn on that record ! ISABEL Yes . Music , Johnnie ! JOHNNIE goes up . AUNT ELLEN grimly , to ISABEL , who is taking her seat by the table . But they do n't dance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ISABEL Oh , but they love it so ; they must n't be disappointed . To the others . She does n't really mind ; you can dance . She sits , taking up her " work . " p. 107 FLORENCE Attaboy ! She seizes AMES ' hand . AMES nervously . I do n't know these new dances ! ISABEL She 'll teach you . Music , Johnnie ! JOHNNIE turns on the record . FLORENCE forcing AMES to dance . C 'm on ! I never heard of a man that could n't dance with me ! Ouch ! She hops , her foot slightly injured , but keeps on dancing . AMES as she cries out . Murder ! ISABEL under cover to him ; he is close to her . Walk . Just walk . That 's all you need to do . He does better upon this . That 's it ; just walk . FLORENCE to AMES . Is n't it divine ? HENRY enters up right . ISABEL indulgently , to AUNT ELLEN . Is n't it delightful to see them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folded telegraph blank in his hand . She observes him . It is n't time for Mr. Ames ' train , Henry ? p. 108 HENRY No 'm . He shows the blank . ISABEL Oh ! Something for me ? She rises and extends her hand for the blank . FLORENCE seeing this . Oh , murder ! Under her breath . They stop dancing , left center . ISABEL as HENRY hands her the blank . What is it ? HENRY as ISABEL examines the blank . I do n't rightly know , ma'am . I was told about it in such a hurry . He glances nervously at FLORENCE . I may not ' a ' got my instructions just exactly . ISABEL puzzled . Your " instructions " ? Oh , this is n't really a telegram . No ; there 's no envelope and date , and it 's written in such a bad backhand I can hardly  --  oh ! She speaks as though with a sudden revelation , comprehending , and glances quickly at FLORENCE . Oh , I see . Rises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hands telegram to HENRY . FLORENCE Here , let me ! She comes to the rescue , seizes the blank , hands it swiftly to AMES , who stands dismayed . You see , Mr. Ames wired his partners from here and so this must be from them . Of  --  course it 's a telegram ; is n't it , Mr. Ames ? p. 109 ISABEL gently insistent . Is it , Mr. Ames ? AMES desperately . I ca n't read it ! ISABEL It is a difficult handwriting . She knows it is FLORENCE 'S hand , though somewhat disguised . FLORENCE taking the blank hastily . I can read most any hand . Why , yes , it 's perfectly plain . It says : " No business in the office to-day . If you wish to remain where you are no reason whatever for returning to New York . Signed Wither-spoon and Ames . " He told me himself he had a partner named Witherspoon . Goes back of table . JOHNNIE stops phonograph . ISABEL to AMES . Oh , then it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't . AMES as FLORENCE turns quickly toward him . Why , it  --  ah  --  seems to be . ISABEL Oh , then you 'll  --  you 'll stay ? If he stays it appears that he stays upon FLORENCE 'S urgence . AMES Why  --  I  --  I  --  p. 110 ISABEL covering her real feeling . Mr. Ames wo n't be going to the station , Henry . HENRY exits up left . FLORENCE has carelessly set the blank upon the table , after reading it , her fingers resting upon it , but AUNT ELLEN draws it away to look at it , FLORENCE turning as if to reclaim it . AUNT ELLEN rather excitedly . But there is n't even an envelope ; it is n't a real telegram ; the writing 's queer but it looks exactly like Flor  --  She finishes the word , but ISABEL cuts her off loudly on " Flor . " ISABEL pushing the bell-button , on left wall . Music , Johnnie ! Is n't it lovely ? Now you can dance all day ! She turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says " Oh , oh ! " as if in pain . JOHNNIE has started the vocalion at her first word . It plays softly . FLORENCE has seized AMES ' hand with a jubilant " Hooray ! " as the music starts . But they pause as AUNT ELLEN speaks . AUNT ELLEN What 's the matter with you ? ISABEL Nothing  --  oh ! She limps again. p. 111 JOHNNY WHITE coming down anxiously . What is the matter , Miss Stuart ? ISABEL Nothing . I 'm afraid I sat a little too long on a baggage truck in a cold wind last night , that 's all . It 's nothing . FLORENCE Oh , rheumatism ; that 's nothing ! FLORENCE retains AMES ' hand ; moves as if to begin dancing . MATTIE enters , left , her right hand behind her . AMES plaintively , to FLORENCE . Just a  --  He means " Just a moment , " but breaks away from FLORENCE and crosses to center to speak to ISABEL . I hope it 's nothing very  --  ISABEL No  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a touch . You must n't stop dancing . FLORENCE crosses to center , takes AMES up center to dance . JOHNNY WHITE taking her arm decisively . Here ! I 'll look after you , Miss Stuart ; I 'd prefer to . He gives FLORENCE a bitter look . ISABEL Thank you , Johnnie . To MATTIE . Did you find them , Mattie ? p. 112 MATTIE hurriedly . Ya do n't want to put ' em on here , do you ? ISABEL quiet pathos . No , I 'll  --  As if to go out left . JOHNNY WHITE Put what on ? ISABEL Nothing . MATTIE bringing her hand from behind her , showing an old pair of rather large , flat black slippers . Not displaying them pointedly to audience . Them . I do n't mind lendin ' ' em to you , but  --  ISABEL quickly , checking her . I thought perhaps they might help me , but not  --  not  --  " Not now and here , " she means ; the scene is hurried . JOHNNY WHITE taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why , certainly ! You let me put  --  ' em on for you , Miss Stuart . I 'd prefer to ! I 'd very much prefer to ! Here ! You better lie down . He is conducting her to the sofa , her limp increasing a little . ISABEL trustfully . Do you think I 'd better lie down , Johnnie ? p. 113 JOHNNY WHITE severely , to MATTIE . Why n't you fix those pillows for her ? ISABEL lies down . MATTIE hastily obeys the suggestion . She 's all tired out . And I guess she 's had enough to make anybody tired ! He takes off her slippers . AMES What is the matter , Miss Stuart ? JOHNNY WHITE quickly , sharply . Why , she 's been made awful tired and she 's got rheumatism and every thing ! ISABEL Oh , no ; not quite ! JOHNNY WHITE to MATTIE . Put that wrap over her . AMES starting to stoop to fix her slippers . Wo n't you let me  --  ISABEL stopping him . Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  AMES stares all the time incredulously at ISABEL . So does AUNT ELLEN , across left . ISABEL I 'm so much trouble , Johnnie  --  Pointing to the slippers . Are n't they awful ! JOHNNY WHITE as he puts them on . No 'm , they 're not . I prefer ' em myself ! I very much prefer ' em ! He puts her other slippers defiantly under his arms . You just lie back and rest , Miss Stuart . I 'll look after you . p. 114 ISABEL Thank you , Johnnie . She lies on sofa , head at right of sofa , facing center . FLORENCE Louder , Mattie ! MATTIE opens vocalion to its loudest . FLORENCE seizes AMES , and they dance . JOHNNY WHITE If you can rest with all this going on ? AMES and FLORENCE dance over to left front of table , go around table and come to center . ISABEL That 's right ! That 's right ! Referring to the dance . Is n't it lovely to see the young people so happy ? AMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at ISABEL . ISABEL , as if beating time , saying " One , two , one , two . " @x The scene is the same interior shown in the Second Act , the time is late in the afternoon  --  toward evening  --  of the same day . The outdoor light , seen through the sun-room windows , has a rosier amber than in the Second Act . A forerunning of the approaching sunset ; but the stage is still bright with light . DISCOVERED AUNT ELLEN , as in Act II , sits by the fireplace , which sends out a warm glow ; she is crocheting . MATTIE , on hands and knees , is facing the cabinet up right . The doors of the cabinet are partly open , revealing shelves of old boxes ; old ornaments of various kinds , small vases , silver porringers , etc. ; two or three old pistols ; rolled papers  --  old and tied with red ribbon ; some old books . MATTIE is pawing carefully among these , apparently puzzled . Scene to be played quietly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the left door of the cabinet . AUNT ELLEN comes down , center . MATTIE It certainly ai n't here , Miss Ellen . AUNT ELLEN But that 's where it ought to be . Did she tell you to scrape that date off ? MATTIE I was n't to say , Miss Ellen . Anyway , it 's only half the date was to be scraped off . p. 116 AUNT ELLEN It 's very singular ! But the rest of it is more singular . ISABEL enters , left . Did you ask Aunt Isabel ? ISABEL Did she ask me what , Ellen ? She limps to center . AUNT ELLEN Oh , the poor thing . She 's limping worse . It 's very singular ! ISABEL What is ? AUNT ELLEN It 's very singular , the Family Bible 's missing . ISABEL Oh , is that all ! ISABEL limps to sofa . AUNT ELLEN Is that " all " ? Do you realize the date of my birth is written in that Bible ? ISABEL sits on sofa , lightly . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I 've always thought fathers were an inconsiderate class of men . When they have a baby they only think of themselves ; they go and write down the date in a Bible , even when the baby 's a girl . They do n't stop to think . AUNT ELLEN looking at her with an approach to suspicion . What is the matter with you ? ISABEL Do you think something does seem the matter with me ? Do you really ? She is pleased with the idea that " something " may really be the matter with her. p. 117 AUNT ELLEN You have n't got upset this way for quite a long while now ; but it certainly is n't the first time , is it , Mattie ? ISABEL has her lace with her and begins to work . AUNT ELLEN does n't turn her head to make this inquiry , but continues her crocheting . MATTIE quickly and casually . No 'm ; it happens every time she has a shooter . Last one was that Philadelphy man-widower ; she half-killed him horseback ridin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo ; and then that old one  --  ISABEL quickly , to check MATTIE 'S list of suitors . Never mind the old one . Ellen , there 's another Bible upstairs . AUNT ELLEN But I 'm used to reading my daily chapter from this one . ISABEL Do n't you suppose you 'd find much the same ideas in both of ' em ? AUNT ELLEN sharply . Aunt Isabel ! ISABEL Yes , Ellen ? AUNT ELLEN I suppose you treat me like a child because I 'm only your niece ! ISABEL reproachfully . Ellen , have I ever taken advantage of my position as your aunt ? p. 118 AUNT ELLEN querulous . A great many people have very little respect for nieces ; and as I 'm only your half-niece  --  ISABEL taking her up indulgently . As you 're only my half-niece you have only half as much respect for me as you ought to have ? AUNT ELLEN severely going on . I do n't pretend to fathom your purpose in concealing the Bible from me  --  ISABEL shaking her head . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to look at all the pictures in any old Family Bible . But of course I do n't admit I did hide it . AUNT ELLEN incensed , becoming stately as she goes left . I decline to be treated like a child ! Exits left . MATTIE She 's on ! Coming down center . ISABEL She 's what ? MATTIE She knows the Good Book never walked out o ' there by itself . ISABEL turning eagerly in her chair . Did you do just what I told you to ? p. 119 MATTIE with a gesture to a chair , left center . She tells it quickly without " acting " . Yes 'm . I waited till he was settin ' in here alone a bit ago  --  so I come in and begun to look around , and I says to myself like , the way you told me , " Well , that 's funny , " I says , talkin ' to myself . " It 's funny where sech a thing as that could get to . A great big old Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say was missin ' ? " he says . So I says , " Excuse me . It 's nothin ' Only the Family Bible ; we always keep it in here . " With a gesture to the cabinet . " So I know it must be around somewheres , " I says . Well , he jumped right up . " My goodness ! " he says . " Let me help you look for it ! " he says . ISABEL Yes , Mattie ? Did he look all over the room ? MATTIE calmly . He pretty near took up the floor . Then he went out in the hall and looked under the stairs and under everything else . " Maybe somebody 's usin ' it fer jest a while , " he says , " and they 'll bring it back here where they got it . " " Well , " I says  --  I put this in myself ; you did n't tell me to  --  " well , " I says , " they might bring it back here , yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In the attic ? " he says . " I hardly got time to go up there , though , " I says . " I do take a terrible interest in Bibles , " he says . " Do you think there 's any objection to my goin ' up in the attic to see ? " he says . " Oh , no , sir , " I says , " none at all . " " Somebody might ' a ' put it there , as you say , " he says . " They often do , " he says , " and if you think Miss Stuart would n't mind " " Oh , no , " I says , " I know she would n't . You just go ahead , " I says . p. 120 ISABEL Mattie ! And he did ? MATTIE Yes 'm . I reckon he 's still up there . ISABEL On the whole , he seems quite excited about it , then ? MATTIE Well , I never see a man show so much energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ought to be glad this has happened , Mattie . MATTIE Why ought we ? ISABEL We ought to be glad to have such a religious man in the house . MATTIE dryly , going left . Yes 'm . Reflectively . I must say I do n't blame you fer hidin ' it  --  with all your ages  --  and the family scandal wrote out in it ! ISABEL What " scandal " ? MATTIE About your poor father , ma'am . ISABEL Good gracious , Mattie , it is n't a scandal for a man to marry a second time ! MATTIE Yes 'm . At his terrible age , it was . ISABEL Well , I never reproached him for it , because I should n't have been born if he had n't ! Have you seen my other case of needles , Mattie ? Rises. p. 121 MATTIE No 'm . What I do n't understand 's why you wanted him to know it was missin ' . She hopes to be told . ISABEL No , that 's very true . You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to go out . No 'm . Blankly . ISABEL When he comes down  --  oh , there 's that case of needles ! She sees it on the table , left center , and steps toward it . MATTIE warningly , Sh ! He is down ! ISABEL Down where ? She abandons her intention of getting the needles , though she is near them . She turns and goes quickly back , with almost no lameness  --  to the sofa and resumes her work . MATTIE stares , astonished . MATTIE I thought you was limpin ' this afternoon . ISABEL whispering across to her . Sh ! I am ! It conies and goes . Is he there ? MATTIE peering out of the door and looking back , whispering . He 's lookin ' under the hall sofy again ! She coughs , steps back , and AMES enters , left . AMES comes in quickly , with the frown of a person intent on a serious search ; his eye is on the cabinet , and he has come into the room to go there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . MATTIE observes them both with interest. p. 122 AMES center . Oh ! Oh ! How do you do ? ISABEL working . How do you do ? AMES I hope you 're  --  better ? He glances at the cabinet . ISABEL Oh , yes ; it comes and goes ; you know . Touches her knee . AMES in a sympathetic tone . No , I do n't ; I 've never had it , so far . ISABEL rising and looking about . Not " so far . " AMES rather eagerly . Are you looking for something ? ISABEL Yes , I had it a little while ago , too ; it 's stupid of me ! Rises . AMES eagerly , quickly , hoping she means the Bible . Ca n't you remember where you put it ? Did you have it in here ? ISABEL Yes . She moves slowly and her lameness is now somewhat more apparent . MATTIE , kept by her curiosity , at the door , observes her with enlarging eyes and an opening mouth . ISABEL goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here  --  if I could only think where I put it . Crosses left. p. 123 AMES eagerly . Let me look . You really should n't move about much , I 'm afraid . He is already looking about . ISABEL plaintively . You 're so kind ! It is a little bothersome , at times . There is a faint sound like a choke from MATTIE , not mirth , but a moral amazement . ISABEL turns toward her , at this . That 's all , Mattie . I sha n't want you for anything more . MATTIE Yes 'm . Exits left . ISABEL concentrating . If I could only think  --  it seems to me I left it somewhere over on this side of the room . The left side . AMES dubiously . I hardly think so . He glances behind a large wall chair . I already have looked all over this  --  Crosses to left to lower end of table . ISABEL with a little triumphant emphasis . Why , there it is ! On the table all the time ! ! AMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the little case of needles . Yes . Just where I left it , of course ! He picks it up . AMES blankly . This ? Is this what you mean ? ISABEL laughing at him . Yes ! My needles . What did you think I meant ? AMES I ? I did n't know exactly . ISABEL Then what were you looking for ? AMES quickly . I was looking for your needles , too . I did n't know they were what you wanted , I mean to say , but I wanted to find them if you were looking for them . ISABEL I see . You did n't know you were looking for them , but you were . I 'll take them , please . AMES Oh , yes . He hands them to her . They are about center , down . ISABEL Thank you . She has stretched out her arm to take the needles , looking at him gravely . Something in her look arrests him and he unconsciously retains his grasp of the little red case ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact upon it . Their eyes meet , and her expression for that moment becomes one of an almost revealed mockery . He starts slightly ; the mockery deepens , and she laughs. p. 125 AMES nervously . What are you laughing at ? ISABEL turning to go back to sofa . It was so peculiar , your looking for something without knowing what you were looking for ! She changes to a sudden little gasp . Oh ! AMES Are you in considerable pain ? Comes to her . ISABEL It just comes and goes . She laughs again , gasps again , laughs once more as she goes to the chair . AMES nervously . Wo n't you lean on me ? ISABEL as before . No , no ! AMES anxiously . Ca n't I get you something ? ISABEL sinking into sofa . No ; there is n't any in the house . AMES coming toward her . I 'm so sorry . ISABEL smiling . It 's gone now . It comes and goes . That is , it comes but it does go ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking up at him charmingly , wistfully for a moment. p. 126 AMES I must say  --  your eyes  --  ISABEL Yes ? My eyes ? I think I remember your speaking of them this morning . AMES Your eyes  --  ISABEL looking back at her work , speaks with a change to a matter-of-fact tone . Ah , what were you going to say about them ? AMES set aback . I was going to say  --  He assumes a solicitous tone . I was going to say , do n't you think you ought to get advice about using them for such fine work ? ISABEL They 've held out so well . I think now they 'll last my time . Do you have any trouble with yours ? Casually . AMES I ? Oh , no . I use glasses sometimes for very fine print . ISABEL I 'm so sorry . AMES laughing nervously . Oh , it is n't because of my a  --  " Age , " he means to say , but cuts it off . I mean it just happened . ISABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these little astigmatisms . They do n't mean anything . p. 127 AMES There 's something I have n't had a chance to explain to you  --  ISABEL Please do n't explain anything  --  especially if it 's about a telegram . AMES But that telegram was n't  --  ISABEL declining to listen . No , no ! Poor man , you had to stay , did n't you ? Affirmative . AMES seriously . I wanted to ! ISABEL with light indulgence . Of course . AMES turns to center . What have you been doing for the last hour or so ? AMES I ? He unconsciously looks upward , thinking of the attic . I 've just been looking about . He goes to the cabinet up right . MATTIE has left one of the doors ajar . You have so many interesting things . He quickly and surreptitiously opens the door wider as he speaks and takes a hurried survey of that half of the shelves revealed by the open door . ISABEL turns her head only a little , and applies herself to her work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ISABEL as if absently . Florence was with you ? p. 128 AMES absently . No ; she went fishing in your brook with young Mr. White . He wishes to open the other door of the cabinet . ISABEL Fishing ? She turns her head ; and he moves down , away from the cabinet , with apparent carelessness . Did she wear her rubber boots ? AMES absently repeating . " Her rubber boots " ? Then with a sudden start , comes down right . I do n't know ! I do n't know what her " foot-wear " was ; I 'm really not in the boot-and-shoe business : I 'm a lawyer ! ISABEL consolingly , as she rises . She wo n't be gone long . She goes toward up left as she speaks . I 'm so glad you changed your mind about them . AMES About them ? Front of sofa . ISABEL nearing the door up left . Yes , about the new generation : the " brazen little hussies " ! You frightened me last night about them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I was afraid you might n't like my great-niece . Under the circumstances , you see  --  well , that would have been too bad , would n't it ? She gives him a glance of quick smiling mockery over her shoulder , and passes out of the door up left . He stares after her , perplexed ; passes his hand hurriedly over his brow ; then goes to the cabinet ; opens its other door and stoops to look within ; ISABEL renters down left , having gone out only to see if he would go to the cabinet . She sees him there as she comes in. p. 129 ISABEL apologetically . I 'm afraid  --  AMES turns to her . I 'm afraid I left my work here . She comes down toward right . AMES embarrassed , moving hastily away from the cabinet . Ah  --  I was  --  your work ? Let me find it for you . In his nervousness he goes to the table , left center , to look for it . ISABEL Oh , no . Do n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She reaches the chair . Yes . She sits on sofa . I think I 'll stay here , after all , if you 're sure I wo n't be interrupting you . AMES Interrupting me ! Why , I 'm not doing anything . What in the world do you mean ? ISABEL You spoke of our having interesting things . I did n't want to interrupt your looking at them . AMES Oh ! A puzzled " Oh , that's-what-you-meant " is what he expresses . ISABEL placidly . I noticed you were interested in that cabinet . AMES somewhat relieved . Yes ; so I was . He goes to it and completes his investigation . Yes , indeed . He sees that the Bible is not there , and adds , in a blank tone : Yes , it 's a very interesting old piece . p. 130 ISABEL Do you think so ? AMES I 'm not an expert  --  on periods , but I 'd call it a very fine , quaint old piece . ISABEL with a little too much serenity . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fifteenth birthday . AMES Oh , oh ! I see , it 's a reproduction . It was made for you  --  your fifteenth birthday ? ISABEL Yes ; it had an inscription with the date on it . AMES trying to conceal his sudden great interest . It had ? An inscription with the where ? He looks quickly over the top and sides of the cabinet as he speaks . Where 's there any da  --  where 's there any inscription ? I do n't see an inscription . ISABEL I think it 's inside the door on the left . AMES swinging the door open instantly and putting on his glasses . On the left . Yes . It says : " To Isabel Stuart . On her sixteenth birthday , June thirteenth . " He begins the reading rapidly but slows up and looks more and more closely at the inscription , which is in small gilt letters ; and the concluding words are slow with bafflement . He repeats : " Fifteenth birthday . June thirteenth . " That 's all it says . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 131 ISABEL lightly . Oh , that was only the year they gave it to me . I suppose the figures have been worn off  --  with time . Do you think it 's an interesting piece of cabinet making ? AMES blankly , giving up the figures . Yes , very . A very interesting piece indeed , I should say ! ISABEL as if a little absently . Have you ever noticed how disappointing most fine quaint old pieces are when you come to look inside of ' em ? AMES Yes , that 's true ; they often are . Glances at cabinet . ISABEL We try to do better with that one ; we keep relics in it ; daguerreotypes , all sorts of things  --  the Family Bible and  --  Then , as by a casual thought . Oh  --  Mattie tells me it 's missing  --  by the way . She said you were so kind about it . AMES flustered . She did ? She said  --  Comes to center . ISABEL smiling gratefully . She said you helped her look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ! p. 132 ISABEL She said you were so kind . AMES Oh , no ! Not at all ! ISABEL with benevolent appreciation . It 's a little thing , of course , to stop and help a servant like that , but it 's the little things that show our characters . We learn that in Sunday-school , do n't we ? It was so thoughtful of you to stop and help poor Mattie like that ! AMES hurriedly . Oh , no ; you must n't praise me for it . It was nothing at all . ISABEL smiling wistfully and observing him as if rather wondering . Do you think you seem a little different to-day , from last night ? AMES Oh , no . Not at all . ISABEL Do n't you notice it ? AMES Why , no , of course not . Not at all . ISABEL Last night you were  --  well , you were quite  --  fluent ! But all day you 've hardly said anything except " Oh , no , not at all , of course not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " AMES Oh , no , not at  --  that is to say , I  --  ISABEL rises  --  sympathetically . Is it because you ca n't think of anything else to say ? p. 133 AMES Oh , no , not at  --  no ! No , it is n't because of that ; not at  --  not a bit ! ISABEL solicitously . You do seem to be thinking . I can see you 're doing that ; but why do n't you tell me what you 're thinking ? AMES Because I 'm really not . ISABEL You 're not thinking ? AMES No . Not about anything , I mean . ISABEL Is it something you wo n't tell me , or something you ca n't tell me ? AMES It 's nothing . It 's nothing at  --  nothing whatever ! Nothing whatever ! ISABEL sympathetically . Ca n't you think of anything else to say ? AMES desperately , yet feebly . Why , yes , of course . Of course I can . Anything at all ; anything . Goes around table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've changed since last night , do you ? You are n't disappointed in me , are you ? AMES Why , of course I 'm not . Not at  --  certainly not . Why , no ; not  --  p. 134 ISABEL " Not at all ! " " Certainly not ! " And you have n't changed , have you ? AMES Why , no  --  not at  --  ISABEL going nearer to him , reproachfully . Not at all ! Why , of course not ! Not at all ! Nothing whatever ! She turns up . AMES flustered . What on earth do you mean ? ISABEL Why , that 's what you were going to say , was n't it ? You have n't changed , have you ? Finishing with quick reproach . AMES Why , of course not . Not at  --  no ! I would n't ! ISABEL approvingly . That 's all I meant ! You would n't ! When you 've done a thing , you 're the sort of man that stands by it , no matter what ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe you 're making fun of me ! ISABEL Why , of course I 'm not ! Not at all ! AMES with plaintive vehemence . But you say one thing and you seem to mean something else , and you seem to mean one thing and you say another ! No wonder I ca n't say anything but " Not at all " and " Nothing at all " ! Crosses right. p. 135 ISABEL But , do n't you see , I 'm just trying to get us better acquainted with each other ! I think we ought to be , do n't you ? AMES subsiding to feebleness . I should think it would be a good thing , yes , indeed . ISABEL Let me see . I 've told you why I never married . Is n't there something in particular  --  is n't there something else you 'd like to know ? Ca n't you think of anything at all ? At each one of these interrogatories he seems about to speak ; then checks himself and dumbly shakes his head . She insists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down closer , facing him . He shakes his head again . And you feel profoundly happy ? AMES with a manful effort . Yes , indeed ! ISABEL with a culmination of bitterness but not in a bitter tone . I believe that 's the noblest effort I ever heard any man make ! Emotion chokes her a very little bit . AMES Effort ? ISABEL covering her emotion by speaking quickly , but her voice shakes a little . She goes up center . Yes ! It was ! But do n't be afraid ! Mr. Ames ! I really did n't expect you to be different from other men ; you 've done your best and you shall have your reward ! p. 136 AMES What " reward " ? ISABEL a little chokingly , as she looks off up right . I think Johnnie White 's bringing it . I think it 's a message . She turns aside with some pathos . AMES What " message " ? JOHNNIE enters gloomily up right . He wears an old knickerbocker suit , rough , muddy shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He comes down center and looks coldly at AMES . JOHNNY WHITE with a movement of his head to up right , speaks to AMES deliberately . She 's  --  uh  --  she 's sittin ' out on a limb of a willow tree that sticks out over the water and she wants you to come and look at her . AMES frowning . Who 's sitting on a limb and wants me to come and look at her ? JOHNNY WHITE Her . AMES " Her " ? JOHNNY WHITE coldly . I expect you know I mean Florence by this time , Mr. Ames . AMES incredulous . She sent you for me ? JOHNNY WHITE with the same even gloom . She got herself out on this limb and she looked over and took a look at herself in the water . Then she said , " Well , I do look right cunning out here , do n't I ? " " Are we goin ' to do any fishin ' ? " I asked her . Then she said , " I wish Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at you on that limb ? " I asked her . " I 'll go get him for you . " " Do n't let him know I sent for him , " she told me . " No , I wo n't , " I told her . " He would n't even guess when he comes out and looks at you that you want him to ! Oh , no ; he would n't ! " That limb she 's sittin ' on , it 's pretty old , and it might not hold her up too long , so do n't you guess you 'd better go , Mr. Ames ? p. 137 AMES I ? ISABEL gently . Yes , please do . AMES a little sharply , to JOHNNIE . I think it would be much better if you 'd go back and get her down from that limb and go ahead with your fishing , Mr. White . Turns away to right . JOHNNY WHITE still in gloom . Fishin ' ? She never meant that kind . I think you better go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there either till you come and see how cunning she looks or else falls in the water . ISABEL Wo n't you please go and bring her in ? AMES doggedly . Oh , certainly , if you ask me . He goes abruptly up right . ISABEL hurriedly , graciously . Of course I do n't mean for you to hurry back with her . To piano . AMES with some coldness . Thank you ! Exits up right . ISABEL looks after him rather pathetically. p. 138 JOHNNY WHITE She 's  --  she 's goin ' to get him , Miss Stuart . Up center . ISABEL turning down blankly . Sits right of table left . JOHNNIE comes down center . What ? JOHNNY WHITE She 's made up her mind , and there 's just one thing my life 's taught me and that is when a girl like her really starts after an older man  --  well , you know she 's goin ' to make him lift her down from that tree . ISABEL quietly . Oh , yes , certainly . JOHNNY WHITE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Stuart ; I 'd like to see a great deal more of you in the  --  in the future  --  as  --  it  --  were  --  than we have in the  --  in the past as  --  it  --  were . ISABEL quiet wonder . Why , what are you talking about , Johnnie ? JOHNNY WHITE What I 've been thinkin ' , why , you take a person 's character , especially you take a woman 's character , and no matter what 's the difference between her age and some younger man that thinks a lot of her character age , because she 's settled down and quit her foolishness the way you have , Miss Stuart , well , it 's the difference between a character like that and one that 's got to make a collection of every old man she sees , no matter what his age is , so what I mean ; why , this bein ' used just for a messenger boy , I better cure myself and get over it , and the best way 'd be to find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling about . p. 139 ISABEL incredulous . Do you mean me , Johnnie ? JOHNNY WHITE Yes 'm ; that 's why I 'd like to see more of you in the future  --  as  --  it  --  were . Will you ? ISABEL Johnnie White , what are you up to ? JOHNNY WHITE Well , you 've read Henry Esmond  --  or have you ? ISABEL Yes . JOHNNY WHITE Well , he had that sacred feeling the way a younger man does about a woman some older than he was , was n't he , did n't he ? Affirmative . ISABEL she jumps up . You funny , funny boy ! You think you 'll make Florence jealous ! JOHNNY WHITE earnestly . No 'm ; I do n't care much whether she is or not , not much . I mean it ! ISABEL laughing . You mean you 're a little cross with her for a few minutes , till she brings you around . JOHNNY WHITE No 'm , I mean it ! I expect it would do her good  --  D' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I preferred to , this morning ? But what I mean is , about you , why , I mean it ! p. 140 ISABEL still amused . You do n't mean you 've got a sacred feeling about me , Johnnie  --  White ! JOHNNY WHITE Well , there are n't many people 'd understand but I 'd like to think I 've got a kind o ' sacred feeling about you , instead of just a messenger boy , because I look up to you , because you 're so different from her . Wo n't you let me ? ISABEL laughing , but rather touched . What nonsense ! JOHNNY WHITE pathetically in earnest . Yes , but wo n't you ? You know how she acts . Wo n't you let me ? ISABEL with amused indulgence , putting her arm lightly , affectionately , round his shoulders . Why , yes , if you want to , you dear thing ! FLORENCE enters briskly up right just on the moment , but halts abruptly . She wears a " fishing costume " of a most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He takes her other hand . FLORENCE laughing rather loudly , with some disquiet of mind . Well ; of all the foolish sights  --  what are you two doing ? p. 141 JOHNNY WHITE giving her a very short glance over his shoulder , speaks very gently and solemnly to ISABEL . Let 's sit over there . He means the sofa , across the room . They are left center . He leads her . ISABEL is controlling amusement , but is rather tenderly pleased and touched by JOHNNIE 'S absurdity . ISABEL as they move toward right . Where is Mr. Ames ? FLORENCE He 's bringin ' my fishin ' traps . Then sharply . What is the  --  ? JOHNNY WHITE Lean on me . I prefer it ! FLORENCE Is Aunt Isabel 's rheumatism worse ? ISABEL Oh , no ! Emphatically on " oh . " JOHNNY WHITE quietly . No . It is n't lameness . He looks continually at ISABEL . FLORENCE Then what is it ? ISABEL as they reach the sofa . Did you want me to sit here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's sit here . This is the place I meant . They sit. p. 142 FLORENCE Well , of all the foolish looking people I ever saw  --  She is moving up center as if to go out , but stops as JOHNNIE speaks . Then goes down right to chair below fireplace . JOHNNY WHITE She could n't understand . It 's the difference in your character . She could n't ever understand . ISABEL covers her mouth with her hand and clenched kerchief . FLORENCE puzzled and beginning to be annoyed . What are you two  --  it really was a little queer , Aunt Isabel ! ISABEL What was queer , dear ? FLORENCE laughing rather uncomfortably . Why , to walk in here and find you locked in an embrace with Johnnie White ! ISABEL choking down her amusement . Oh , dear ! Did you see that , Florence ? FLORENCE still laughing thinly . And after last night  --  well , I guess the less said about that the better ! ISABEL Yes , indeed , dear ! FLORENCE getting sharper . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 143 ISABEL Yes , Florence , I 'm afraid I 'm a wild thing ! FLORENCE Why , you 've got poor Mr. Ames so upset he is n't normal . ISABEL Is n't he ? With more serious eagerness . FLORENCE I happened to be on the branch of a tree and he just said to " come down and go in the house , you were worrying about me . " She imitates a brisk , rather peremptory , tone . ISABEL quickly . Did he ? FLORENCE not " ugly " but reproachful . I do n't believe you want anybody to be nice to me ; you just want to flirt with every man in the world , yourself ! Starts up right . ISABEL But I do n't know ' em all ! JOHNNY WHITE She could n't understand FLORENCE very sharply , as this repetition goads her . I could n't understand what ? Comes back down right . JOHNNY WHITE to her coldly . Did you ever read Henry Esmond ? FLORENCE No , I did n't ! Sits on arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't intellectual particularly , Florence . It 's by William Makepeace Thackeray . FLORENCE Well , what o ' that ? JOHNNY WHITE Oh , nothing . Only he was kind o ' carried away with a light weight for a while . FLORENCE This William Makepeace was ? JOHNNY WHITE serenely . No . Henry Esmond was . It did n't last very long . Some novels are a good deal like life . To ISABEL . She could n't understand . FLORENCE raising her voice incredulously . Are you in earnest ? JOHNNY WHITE ignoring her . If she lived to be a hundred she could n't understand , could she ? ISABEL whimsically , gently , to him . I do n't believe she could ! AMES enters up right , carrying FLORENCE 'S rods and basket . FLORENCE stung . No ! Well , if I do live to be a hundred I hope I 'll understand how to behave at that age ! AMES turns to go out again , right , as if to avoid a family scene , saying , " I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , do n't go , Mr. Ames . AMES comes down center . It 's nothing . She is gently cheerful . JOHNNY WHITE to FLORENCE . Are n't you ashamed any ? FLORENCE Me ? For saying if I live to be a hundred I hope I 'll know better than to let mere adolescents talk mush to me ! Golly , no ! ISABEL to AMES . I 'm afraid she means her great-aunt . FLORENCE I should say I do ! ! Crosses center . Why , last month there was a three-times widower hangin ' round here ; he was n't four minutes under eighty , and a week before it was a child about nineteen . Last night it was Mr. Ames and now it 's Johnnie White ; and they began with a fond embrace ! I saw it ! ISABEL to AMES . Yes , she did ! FLORENCE Sometimes she does n't act more'n sixteen ! Crosses right , back of sofa . ISABEL rises . There , Mr. Ames , you have me ! AMES I beg your pardon ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I flirt with three-times widowers and with children of nineteen and with you and with Johnnie White , and Johnnie and I began with a fond embrace . To finish it ! I 'm a hundred years old and I 'm sixteen years old ! So there , my friend , you know me ! She curtsies to him , and moves rather quickly toward the door , left , limping a little . JOHNNY WHITE quickly , with a movement toward her . Wo n't you come back and sit here some more ? ISABEL checking him , smiling . No ; not now . But you can run home and change your clothes and come back to dinner . JOHNNY WHITE solemnly eager . Can I ? ISABEL Yes , you can ; and I 'll be waiting for you , Johnnie White ! She gives AMES a little sudden bob of a nod , which seems to daze him , and exits quickly , left . AMES sits blankly  --  right of table left . FLORENCE right . Well , of all the darn conduct I ever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it 's mysterious to you ; you could n't even be expected to understand . Goes up center. p. 147 FLORENCE coming a step toward him , irritated , speaking all in a breath . What is the matter with you ? Follows JOHNNIE up center . JOHNNY WHITE Nothing you 'd be able to under  --  FLORENCE almost shouting . Stop it ! If you say that to me again  --  JOHNNY WHITE I want to say just one last thing to you ! FLORENCE Oh , you do , do you ? JOHNNY WHITE It 's simply just only this : Hark ! A man really does like to have somebody to look up to ! FLORENCE Well , you do n't haf to be silly about everybody you look up to , do you ? JOHNNY WHITE with a pleasant thought about it and the manner assuming that this thought is beyond her . Well , I do n't know . I might . Why , yes . Yes  --  I think a man might feel a good deal that way . FLORENCE incredulously . What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Excuse me , I think that 's about all I care to say for the time being . He goes up and gets his rods and basket p. 148 FLORENCE Why , you darned little  --  JOHNNY WHITE with easy superior carelessness , but not smiling . I may see you later in the evening for a moment or so , if I have time . Near door up right . FLORENCE quickly , sharply . Why , you just told her you 're coming back to  --  JOHNNY WHITE in the same tone as his last speech . To dinner  --  yes  --  yes . I said I may see you across the table or somewhere , prob'ly ; thanking you for your kind attention , I beg to remain , et cetera , et cetera . Exits up right without smiling . Start to dim outside lights . FLORENCE Why , you  --  Then turns indignantly to AMES . Comes down center . Did you ever know any other girl that had an aunt like my aunt ? AMES shaking his head seriously . No  --  no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNIE 'S exit . Why , even that poor little child  --  it 's terrible ! What do you think about her ? p. 149 AMES " What do I "  --  I do n't know ; I do n't know ! I do n't know anything about her ! Not a single thing ! The scene is rather quick . FLORENCE viciously . Well , I think I know one thing about her . AMES You 're her niece and you think you know one thing about her ! FLORENCE I believe she 's been a coquette from the day she was born ! AMES repeating . " From the day she was  --  " He jumps up sharply . Have you happened to see the Family Bible ? FLORENCE What Family Bible ? AMES Your family 's . The one they keep in here ! FLORENCE Well , for heaven 's sake , what would I be doin ' with it ? AMES I do n't know . FLORENCE What do you want it for ? AMES What do I want it for ! He recovers himself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I collect first editions ! FLORENCE You collect first editions of the Bible ? p. 150 AMES Why , no . FLORENCE I thought not . Sits on sofa . Mr. Ames , do you believe an older man 's feeling for a younger woman is deeper than a younger woman 's feeling for an older man ? AMES I do n't know . FLORENCE Wo n't you sit here ? AMES Very well . Sits on sofa , left of FLORENCE . FLORENCE Before I settle down or anything , I think I ought to have the experience of a serious affair with some older man . Start to dim the stage lights here , very slowly . AMES Oh ! FLORENCE giving him a lovely smile . Oh , dear . I wish I had my slippers on instead of these . She holds up her booted feet plaintively . AMES rising nervously . Oh , I think you look very well in boots ! FLORENCE frowning . They 're so heavy . I do wish I had my  --  She is interrupted by the opening of the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pretty patent leather slippers . FLORENCE , staring . Well , for heaven 's sake ; just as I was sayin ' I wanted ' em . AMES sees the slippers in MATTIE 'S hand , turns and strides hurriedly up to the sun-room . FLORENCE goes on . How in the  --  She checks herself and at a thought speaks decisively . Mattie ! That 's no mere coincidence ! p. 151 MATTIE bringing the slippers and setting them on the floor before FLORENCE . No 'm . Your Aunt Isabel told me to listen at the door  --  FLORENCE What ? AMES turns sharply and stares at MATTIE . MATTIE going on casually . Your Aunt Isabel told me to listen at the door till I heard you begin talkin ' about changin ' your footwear and then to bring ' em in for you . FLORENCE She told you to listen at the  --  MATTIE casually . Yes 'm ; she says to be perfeckly honorable and pay no attention till I heard the word " slippers , " and she says the rest of the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . FLORENCE frowning , puzzled . Stares thoughtfully at the closing door , then turns front . Well , if that is n't queer ! Emphatically . AMES No ! It 's no queerer than anything else ! Coming down right . FLORENCE Well , after all , now that my slippers are here  --  AMES nervously . I do n't think I 'd  --  I do n't think I 'd better ! p. 152 FLORENCE rising , concentrating disapprovingly . Well , what do you think ? AMES with vehemence . Nothing ! He goes up to the sun-room . The light outside has grown rosier and inside it is a little darker . The glow from the fireplace brightens . AUNT ELLEN enters , left . She has changed her dress for a dark silk , which has a suggestion of state about it . AUNT ELLEN left . Florence , do you consider that an appropriate costume for the drawing-room ? FLORENCE right . Peevishly . It ai n't one ! AUNT ELLEN " Ai n't " ? " Ai n't " ? FLORENCE No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a living-room ! If people ca n't be young again , anyhow they can be modern ! AUNT ELLEN turning to go out again , left . I will withdraw from the room until you  --  FLORENCE picking up her slippers . Murder ! Do n't go  --  I apologize , gosh  --  I apologize without the gosh  --  I 'm going  --  Oh , murder , I 'm tired ! AUNT ELLEN Tired ! Why , you have n't been doing anything compared to your Aunt Isabel . p. 153 FLORENCE going slowly and wearily up left with a gloomy sigh . It seems to me as if I just spent my life dressing ! It 's all so savorless ! Suddenly she begins to sing brightly , breaks into a skip , calls back sweetly : " See you later , William ! " Exits up left , skipping and singing . AMES is surprised . AUNT ELLEN looks after FLORENCE , disapprovingly , very slightly shaking her head . AUNT ELLEN You must overlook it , William . Good gracious ! I mean  --  She corrects herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother . AUNT ELLEN left center . She belongs to a very different generation from the one you and I grew up with . AMES right center . Set aback by her " you and I " . Ah  --  yes . Yes , indeed ! AUNT ELLEN going slowly toward right . You and I were taught a very different behavior toward our elders . AMES gloomily . Yes , the  --  the previous  --  ah  --  generations had a very different training , though this one certainly has charm , too . I wonder how many of  --  uh  --  us , though , can remember just what we were like in our own youth . p. 154 AUNT ELLEN somewhat surprised . Why , I recall my own , perfectly . AMES brightening . That 's remarkab-ully  --  He changes the word to " remarkably " with a slight vocal struggle in the midst of it . Pleasant . Your  --  ah  --  aunt , Miss Stuart does , too , and about public events she remembers wonderfully ; we were reminiscing this morning ; all about Hayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happen to remember that campaign ? AUNT ELLEN looking at him over her shoulder ; she is touching some music sheets on the piano . Why , of course . AMES rather dismayed . Well , she said she thought it was a terrible thing , Hayes  --  and  --  Wheeler 's not getting elected , AUNT ELLEN with spirit . They were elected . Anybody that says they were n't is a  --  a despicable Democrat ! AMES hastily . Oh , I think they were myself . Feebly hopeful . I only wondered  --  I was n't just able to recall what year that campaign was  --  He puts a rising , plaintive interrogative upon this. p. 155 AUNT ELLEN It was in 1876 , the same year as the Philadelphia Exposition . AMES In 1876  --  oh , yes ; it was  --  ah  --  a historical reference  --  I see . AUNT ELLEN Historical ? I went to that exposition myself . AMES he looks at his watch with another feeble murmur of plaintive laughter . I 'm afraid I  --  I suppose I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better  --  He goes awkwardly left and glances upward , thinking of going to his room upstairs . I 'd better  --  ah  --  I suppose I 'd better make  --  ah  --  At the door . Well , I  --  AUNT ELLEN inquiring rather shortly . Yes ? AMES wiping his forehead hurriedly . Well  --  thank you . Uh  --  Exit , dazedly , left . AUNT ELLEN sits at the piano and begins to play rather softly ; she has a fine " touch " and plays with feeling . The light outdoors is the final rosiness of sunset ; the firelight sends forth a broad rosy glow ; but the rest of the scene is darkened as she plays through an old-fashioned melody . She has played about a dozen bars when a figure enters up left in the sun-room . It is ISABEL , but she is not distinctly seen . The glow up , beyond the sun-room windows , is behind her , and it is not until she reaches the table , left center , that the firelight falls upon her . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " than that previously worn in the act . She still suggests the slight lameness . She is carrying a large and heavy old book . When she reaches the table , the firelight falls on her and we should get a gleam of jewels . She opens the Bible upon the table , and lets it remain open. p. 156 AUNT ELLEN as ISABEL reaches the table . Is that you , Isabel ? She does not turn her head . ISABEL Yes , go on playing , dear . She crosses to the fireplace , using her cane , and sits , gazing into the fire . There is a pause , the piano continuing , and then their talk goes on through the playing . AUNT ELLEN My old tunes are better than Florence 's , are n't they ? I think music was best of all in my day . ISABEL gently . No . It was best in my day . Crosses right . AUNT ELLEN No ; I think it began to fall off by the time you came along . Music was best when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair at fireplace . Florence will say that some day . Music is best in each one 's " day . " What a pleasant thing that is ; that we all of us see , afterward , that our first youth was best ! AUNT ELLEN It is n't pleasant to see anything afterward . ISABEL Well , then , we can always look forward to  --  something  --  ca n't we ? p. 157 AUNT ELLEN struck by this . Oh ! Her hands pause on the keys and she glances round for a moment at ISABEL . Oh , I understand what you mean . He was in here a while ago trying to find out . You know what I mean . ISABEL serenely . He did n't ask you , though . AUNT ELLEN No . You can see he 'd be nice under any circumstances . ISABEL with a little regret . " Nice " ? Why , he 's the bravest man I 've ever seen . He 's too plucky to withdraw  --  some remarks he made to me last night ! AUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if I ought n't to stop calling you " Aunt " Isabel . ISABEL Why ? I am your aunt . AUNT ELLEN My half-aunt . ISABEL Is n't that plenty ? AUNT ELLEN I 've always liked calling you " Aunt Isabel " for one reason ; nobody 'd think I 'm too old to be alive while I 've still got an aunt . But it might n't be consistent now . ISABEL Why might n't it ? AUNT ELLEN very seriously , not playing for the moment . Well , if anything should happen  --  I really should n't know how to begin calling Mr. Ames " Uncle William . " p. 158 ISABEL Never mind , dear . It wo n't happen . AUNT ELLEN stops playing and turns . I never could call Mr. Ames " Uncle . " She is very serious . ISABEL thoughtfully . You might call him " Nephew . " Rises . AUNT ELLEN Pooh ! She plays softly . ISABEL Why not ? Is n't Florence what all men want ? Think of father ; mother was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sixty-five . AUNT ELLEN Poor grandfather 's weakness in marrying a girl as your mother was ought n't to be . She plays again . ISABEL sits on sofa . Yes ; but there it is . We 're like Portia 's caskets , we women , and the men come to choose without knowing what they 'll find . Silver-and-gold , that 's first youth , and it ought to have been written of that silver-and-gold casket : " Who chooses me shall choose what every man desires " ! But if any man comes to choose me  --  well , a woman past twenty-eight is a thousand  --  I 'll show him only lead ! AUNT ELLEN I never heard before of a woman that teased a man to make him think she was older than she was . And if it is n't to make him feel better when he finds out  --  p. 159 ISABEL No , I 've just told you why . AUNT ELLEN Oh , you can give all the pretty reasons you want to , but I know . You thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even daring to wonder how old you are . ISABEL rises to protest , saying , " Oh , I  --  " And he 's beginning to suspect . Think how pretty dancing was in my day . She begins to play an old waltz . ISABEL They were pretty , the old waltzes . AUNT ELLEN her memory of the music faltering . How did that go there ? She tries to remember by singing it . La , la , la  --  ISABEL rising . No , it 's this . She hums it and beats time , moving a few waltz steps but keeping to a hint of her lameness . Yes . That 's it . She hums and begins to waltz slowly in the same manner as before . ISABEL falls a little and a little more into the spirit of the waltz , never wholly abandoning the hint of lameness ; the waltz-time is rather slow but quickens a little and almost imperceptibly . ISABEL moves in and out of the firelight glow as she dances and her scarf floats , following her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stands looking on without surprise . ISABEL sees him , but only nods and continues . He wears a dinner coat. p. 160 JOHNNY WHITE Do n't you want a partner ? ISABEL coming toward him . Johnnie White , do you know the old waltz ? JOHNNY WHITE Yes 'm . Without losing her step she lets her left hand fall lightly upon his shoulder ; he catches her step and they dance . The waltz-time is now a little quicker , and AUNT ELLEN plays it with great pleasure . ISABEL dances with a greater abandon until she has almost forgotten the hint of lameness . The sun-room is so dark that the opening of the door up left is unperceived . AMES , who has changed to a dinner coat , enters there , and stands dumbfounded . FLORENCE enters just behind him and comes forward . FLORENCE exclaiming loudly . Crosses to up right above fireplace . Well , for heaven 's sake ! What are you doin ' now ? ISABEL startled as she sees AMES . Oh ! She at once remembers her lameness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . JOHNNIE stays down right , below fireplace . ISABEL I  --  I 'm afraid I forgot myself for the moment  --  I  --  you ought n't to have tempted me , Johnnie . It might be  --  dangerous  --  p. 161 AMES striding down to her . Will you dance with me  --  Isabel ? ISABEL a little breathless . What ? AMES Will you dance with me  --  Isabel ? ISABEL looks at him incredulously . ISABEL Dance with you , Mr. Ames ? AMES Yes . I remember the old waltzes . ISABEL But perhaps  --  you do n't realize how old they are  --  or how lame I am ? AMES I do n't care . Wo n't you dance with me ISABEL Yes . She puts her left arm on his shoulder , as she did with JOHNNIE , and with a much more pronounced lameness than before , and in very slow time , they begin to waltz , AUNT ELLEN playing softly . As they dance . So you and I are in the fashion again . They say everybody dances all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know anything except when I saw you dancing I wanted to dance with you . I do . ISABEL Do you ? No matter how slowly AMES crossly . Yes , I do ! p. 162 ISABEL But Florence would like to dance with you again . AMES What nonsense ! ISABEL suddenly radiant . Ca n't you play any faster than that , Ellen ? Why do n't you turn the lights up , Florence ? AUNT ELLEN plays suddenly with greater spirit . FLORENCE snaps on the lights and is revealed to be laughing inextinguishably . FLORENCE slapping JOHNNIE 'S back with her other hand in her extreme jocosity . My ! But those ole-fashioned dances are funny ! Do n't they look crazy ! ISABEL happily calling to her . Do we ? She discards her lameness entirely during the next few measures . The two dance like happy experts of eighteen . They look at each other like lovers . FLORENCE ceases to laugh and becomes mystified . So does JOHNNIE . They stare , with their mouths open . Finally FLORENCE speaks with the emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em lookin ' at each other ! JOHNNY WHITE grinning , but speaking indignantly to her . Ai n't you got any sense ? AUNT ELLEN lifts her left hand from the keys in a passionate gesture , not ceasing to play with her right . As her back is obliquely to front and right her left hand is toward FLORENCE and JOHNNIE. p. 163 FLORENCE inquiring poignantly the meaning of the gesture . What ? AUNT ELLEN repeats the passionate gesture . FLORENCE is more mystified and also somewhat petulant . Well , I  --  JOHNNIE seizes her hand and drags her quickly off up right . ISABEL not stopping . I 'm afraid we must stop . AMES No ! ISABEL I must n't wear you out . Upon this , without looking at them , AUNT ELLEN abruptly stops playing in the middle of a measure . She does not look at them at all , but goes quickly up and straight off left without turning . They are unconscious of her , and seem even unconscious that the piano has stopped or that they have ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of the table left center and close by it , looking at each other . AMES speaking angrily the instant they and the music stop . I want to tell you just this : you 've been mocking me every second since we first met in that God-forsaken railroad station . ISABEL No ! AMES fiercely . You have ! Every instant p. 164 ISABEL Never ! Never once ! Never ! Never ! AMES You were at it half the day yesterday and as much of the night as you could stay awake and all day to-day ! But it wo n't do ! ISABEL When did you decide I was mocking you ? AMES I thought so all day , but I knew it when I saw you dancing with that boy ! ISABEL Do you mind my dancing with boys ? AMES No ! I 'm not jealous . His tone is as angry as before . But it came over me ! You 've just mocked me ! ISABEL Ca n't you imagine a woman 's being a little nervous about one man 's knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born ? AMES with feeling . Am I the one man ? ISABEL That 's why women are afraid of everybody 's knowing ; it might reach the one man . That 's the reason a woman cares about her age ; he might care ! She touches the open Bible on the table . Look , Mr. Ames ! I 'll turn my back while you 're looking . She walks away from him slowly . AMES puts one hand on Bible but keeps looking at ISABEL. p. 165 ISABEL as he does this , her voice tremulous . On the left hand page you 'll find all of papa 's descendants by his first wife . On the right-hand page you 'll see where the poor old darling married again  --  such a heathenish time  --  afterward  --  AMES That 's what I thought . That 's why I was looking for your Bible . ISABEL Underneath is where you 'll find me . Her voice trembles a little more . Have you found me ? AMES with great feeling under his laughter . Yes , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look ? AMES crosses to ISABEL , holds out his arms as if to embrace her . AMES tenderly . Let 's sit by the fire , shall we ? Crosses right . He touches the switch key and the only light is the firelight . She sits slowly on sofa , looking up at him , and he takes a chair near by . Then FLORENCE is heard laughing gaily off up left , and a moment later she is heard again . FLORENCE affecting reproach , off up left . All right for you , Johnnie White . I 'll tell your mother on you ! p. 166 ISABEL softly . The fire 's pleasant , even in April , is n't it ? AMES Yes . Do you think you could say to me good night , dear , without the good night ? ISABEL I think I could  --  if you 're sure you do n't mind anything you did n't see in the Bible , dear . AMES You infant ! ISABEL Oh ! AMES takes her hand , kisses it , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little exclamation of delight.
