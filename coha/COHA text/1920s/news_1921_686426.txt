txt United States Steel Corporation has not considered so far arty reductions in wages or prices . Inquiry at the offices of the Steel Corporation brought forth a denial of the dispatches from Pittsburgh , Gary , Ind. , and accounts from local sources contained in the morning papers that wage reductions of 20% and cuts in prices of iron and steel products would be announced in the next few days . It was emphasized that no policy on these questions had been adopted . The Steal Corporation is undoubtedly affected by the failure of price cutting on the part of the independents to stimulate business and has always maintained the policy of proteCting its customers . While the independents were getting high prices for their products during the activity of the first nine months of 1920 , U. S. Steel maintained its price level at tho Industrial Board level established in March , 3939 . This policy has undoubtedly stabilized the steel market in the past few months and has been the biggest factor in preventing a radical price decline which would have caused trouble for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume to the corpora , tion in spite of the fact that the independents are underselling them . The demand for light rails at this time is particularly strong from the luMber camp railroads and other roads using the narrow gauges . The 10,000 tons rail order from the South Manchurian Railway Co. , the largest export rail order in some months , was also placed with the Steel Corporation .
