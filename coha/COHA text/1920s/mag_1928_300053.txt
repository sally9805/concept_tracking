In Germany , whose scientists have the world 's reputation for thoroughness , the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Breeding Science last week put on an exhibition . Present were blue monkeys , yellow rats , kinky-haired rabbits , 40,000 varieties of dandelions . Selective cross breeding had caused the weird results . Apparently species of animals and plants can be changed at man 's will or nature 's chance .
