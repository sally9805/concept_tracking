txt The warfare between Mayor John F. Hylan and Controller Charles L. Craig which has disrupted many meetings of , ? the Board of Estimate during the last few months reached a climax at yesterday 's meeting of the Board 's Committee of the Whole when the lie was passed between the two officials . White with anger , the Controller invited the Mayor into the hall to settle the dispute . The Mayor / declined the Controller 's challenge to fight it out and the Controller maintained his offensive by issuing a statement last night in which he declared that the Mayor had " retreated to the mud trench " and that ignorance and stupidity were charitable words to apply to the Mayor 's display of knowledge of city affairs when he was on the witness stand before the Meyer Investigating Committee . On that I occasion , the Controller said ; he had prepared the answers the Mayor was to . make to the questions of the committee 's attorney , but the Mayor got the slips of paper containing the answers mixed up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Meyer committee released him from the stand , " was the Controller 's comment . Outburst Came From Clear Sky . Yesterday 's outbreak between the two men came out of a clear sky , for although both had issued statements attacking each other a short time before , the meeting of the Committee of the Whole was proceeding peacefully when the Classon Avenue , Brooklyn . sewer assessment plan came up . It was suggested that the Board of Estimate confirm the I recent Legislative act to place the assessment upon the entire city rather than on Brooklyn alone . The committee decided to recommend to the board that the sewer area should pay one-third the cost of construction and the city the rest . The Controller suggested that some one should report to the board on the assessment area and Borough President Riegelmann of Brooklyn agreed to this . The Controller declared that threequarters of the people of the city were opposed to the assessment where only 21 per cent/ were benefited . President Riegelmann explained that the matter had been held up for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " TVs a waste of time . " said the Controller . The remark nettled Mr. Riegelmann , who declared the Controller was breaking a pre-election promise , as he had agreed to aid Brooklynites in the settlement of the sewer matter . Grand Larceny , Says Controller . " I think it is an ordinary case of grand larceny to take money from one set of citizens and give it to another , " barked the Controller . " It is nothing but an attempt by this board to pay off political promises . " " Never mind him , " broke in the Mayor angrily . " He gave out a statement Saturday ? " " I es , " retorted the Controller , " and I 'm going to give out another this afternoon . " " Your statement showed what kind of a liar you are , " shouted the Mayor . You ca n't call me a liar , " said the Controller , arising . " You are a liar. ? ? repeated the Mayor in great anger . The Controller was on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to step outside , " he said . " We can settle It in the hail . " Fearing that the Controller would strike the Mayor , Lewis F. Lang , the Controller 's confidential stenographer. seized Mr. Craig 's arm and forced him into his seat . Quivering with anger , the Controller turned to the Mayor and said : . ? I say you are a damned dirty liar when you say what you do . You got licked in three lawsuits and now you do n't know what to do . Your friends down in the Chase National Bank and in Wall Street ? " The remainder of the sentence was lost in the uproar that followed . The mem- bers of the committee were on their feet and several were shouting for order . Some of the Mayor 's friends surrounded him , anticipating an attack . " I want the public to know what a deliberate liar ' you are , " said the Mayor when the confusion had soaiewhat subsided . " I move we adjourn now to give me a chance to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a movement to arise . The bystanders about the Mayor moved in a little closer . Mr. Craig saw the movement and dropping back into his chair contented himself with the remark : " I want to say that a man is pretty yellow to use his chair to say things like this and when he gets called for it has not got guts enough to come outside . " " I think the Controller should be examined by Dr. Gregory of Bellevue Hospital , " was the Mayor 's parting shot . The Mayor made no further reference to the incident , but the Controller issued the following statement : " Confronted by three court decisions that stop his attempted raids on the Sinking Funds of the City of New York , the Mayor retreats to the mud trench . He tries to dodge the effect of the Supreme Court decisions by bringing in a lot of other aches ani pains that he has suffered since he has been checked in attempting to disregard the charter and the other laws designed for the protection of the public against czarlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts , so he invents some willfully false accusations about the Controller 's attitude toward the ** Committee . " No one knows better than Mayor Hylan who saved him from obloquy in the Meyer Committee investigation . He was making a pitiful exhibition when he began calling for help . Ignorance and stupidity are charitable words when applied to his display of knowledge of the city Government on the witness stand . In fact , the very Sinking Funds he is now attempting to dispose of in the dark and away from the possibility of public review or the Controller 's interference were his undoing . He did not know one fund from another , nor the object as defined in the charter of the various public trusts , vested in the Board of Commissioners over which lie presided . " His Ignorance has not been lessened to any great extent since the Meyer committee released him from he stand . This is proved by the three decisions ordering him and his associates to take their hands off the sinking funds and do business in public view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meyer committee an hour before his cries for assistance reached the Controller . His special counsel and coach called upon me to get the answers to the questions which were being propounded . Upon his urgent importunity I prepared the answers , in simple language , that even he might be expected to understand . But it is notorious that the Mayor failed , even then , to give the correct answers . He had the answer to Question No. 7 mixed with the slip of paper containing the answer to Question No. 9 , and after he had fumbled once or twice he fell back on his fatuous reply , ' Ask the Controller , ' or , ' Ask Duncan . ' " With prompters to the right of him and to the left , and behind him  --  and with all the indulgence allowed by his questioner in these directions ? he failed utterly to show any grasp of the affairs of the city about which he was being quizzed " The Mayor knows well that the Controller had nothing to do with the creation or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opposed to its object , which was plainly a political attack on the Administration . The attempt of the Mayor to circulate propaganda at this late date to the effect that the Controller was behind the Meyer committee investigation shows to what evil depths of desperation he has descended . " He says that the Coney Island releases of the city 's interest in lots was what prompted the attempt to grab all the records and papers of the sinking fund and the suppression of the minutes and calendars of its meeting . " If it had been left to the Mayor and his Board of Education and other subordinates , the school children of Coney Island would now be attending classes over a sewage ' pumping station on . Neptune Avenue , on property that had only just before been released by the Mayor and the sinking fund to private interests and was then about to be repurchased for the Board of Education at a high figure from a private owner . " The Mayor knows enough about the Coney Island lot proposition where it affects his friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a malicious disposition to distort the facts when he speaks of the Coney Island situation as an alibi for his sinking fund schemes . He did not dare present this alibi in his affidavits to the Supreme Court . There is a penalty for perjury , which he is careful to avoid . " The Controller has exerted every effort to protect the rights of the city in the Coney L.slancl lands . In so doing , his action has been sustained by Mi. ! courts . The Mayor 's outbreak this morning at a public meeting called to consider other matters entirely was nothing but an abuse of privilege as well as exhibition of gutter tactics that called for only one kind of treatment .
