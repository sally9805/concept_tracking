A bale of cotton was presented last week to the Bremen museum . No ordinary bale of cotton , this ! It cost the Bremen Cotton Exchange about $3,500 although cotton usually costs about $124.80 per bale in Berlin. * This bale was the first ever to have crossed the Atlantic in the air . It was part of the Graf Zeppelin 's cargo . <P> For service in Iraq , the British government has been using 25-passenger transport airplanes . So successful has the experiment been that the British admit they are designing 50-passenger air transports , with central engine , capable of being repaired in midair for minor troubles . Such planes would be immense : the largest Junkers plane seats only 18 passengers . <P> <P> * About $86.40 per bale in the U. S. , calculated at 18 a pound of a 480-pound bale .
