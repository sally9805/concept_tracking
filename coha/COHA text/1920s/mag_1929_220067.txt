The reporters at Valbuena Field , Mexico City , knew that a colossal story was coming their way-in fact , well nigh into their laps . They could see it clearly in the air , for there was the Travel-Air cabin monoplane City of Wichita , in which could only be Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh and his fiancee , Anne Spencer Morrow . It was apparent , from the gestures of the figure at the cabin window and from the naked axle on the right-hand side of the landing gear , that the Colonel had lost a wheel . It was a story with a hundred possible endings , any of them momentous . The reporters waited for the one that happened . <P> Somersault . Col. Lindbergh circled above the field several times , making preparations . Exactly what went on in the cabin is not known . But the windows were put down to avoid flying glass , and Col. Lindbergh undoubtedly packed cushions around Miss Morrow . According to one plausible report , he said to her : " When we land , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching the ground , the plane ran along , neatly balanced on its one wheel , for a few seconds . Then the wheelless axle struck the sun-baked earth ; the plane dragged 30 yards , suddenly flopped over on its back . <P> Col. Lindbergh 's right shoulder , dislocated five years ago in a parachute jump , was redislocated . Miss Morrow , though badly shaken , was uninjured . <P> " Augustus . " Col. Lindbergh said : " It was a mishap , not an accident . " Miss Morrow , perhaps without realizing it , gave out a long-sought-after titbit of news when she said : " Augustus will speak for me . " <P> Cotter Pin . The cause of the accident was narrowed down to a cotter pin , which one of the mechanics at Valbuena Field had forgotten to replace after greasing the landing wheels that morning . The wheel , Col. Lindbergh said , fell off after a stop for luncheon . <P> Army Cure . Early next morning , Col. Lindbergh and Miss Morrow climbed into small yellow biplane , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his left hand . <P> Again the press whooped for heroism but the hero and all other airmen knew that he had merely taken the cure prescribed by the U. S. Army Air Service-that a pilot who has cracked-up must make another flight at the first possible moment , to restore self-confidence . There was no need , however , for Miss Morrow to take the cure-except to be sporting and to do aviation a great and good turn . <P> Three Inches . A few days later , Aviatrix Amelia Earhart , who is tabloided as " Lady Lindy , " did a somersault in the mud at Curtiss Field , Long Island , while attempting to land her plane . This received space averaging three inches in the same newspaper which had made the Lindbergh-Morrow flop story-of-the-day.
