THE BISHOP MURDER CASE-S.S . Van Dine-Scribners ( $2 ) . <P> The original title of this book was " The Mother Goose Murder Case . " It was changed because the publishers probably feared that the public would think it a book for children-a gentle story with a fairytale murder . <P> A sportsman named Joseph Cochrane ( " Cock " ) Robin was found dead with an arrow through his heart . A man named Sperling ( German for sparrow ) was suspected . <P> Who killed Cock Robin ? " I " said the sparrow , " With my bow and arrow , I killed Cock Robin . " <P> It was , of course , not as simple as that . Other murders followed . One John Sprigg was shot through the middle of his wig . A scholarly hunchback , whom children called Humpty Dumpty , sat on a wall , had a great fall , was found dead . Then came the slaughter of the suspects-an annoying device which S.S. Van Dine used to better effect in The Greene Murder Case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two remaining suspects ; stupid readers would do well to flip a coin . <P> The majority of the characters in the book are a bit balmy-including the detective , Philo Vance , an arty fellow , who smokes Regie cigarets and says " amazin ' " for amazing . Chess and higher mathematics are discussed and rediscussed until the reader , too , is a bit balmy . <P> S.S. Van Dine is the murder-case pseudonym of Willard Huntington Wright , art critic and onetime editor of Smart Set ( TIME , Sept. 10 , PEOPLE . ) The Canary Murder Case is , far and away , his best .
