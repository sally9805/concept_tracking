Cheers turned to tears when Brazil 's Alberto Santos-Dumont debarked at Rio de Janeiro last week . All good Brazilians believe that he invented the airplane before the Wrights . And , because the U. S. this month is honoring the Wrights ' 25th anniversary of flight ( to which Brazil is sending no official representative ) , those good Brazilians organized a celebration of their own . They insisted that Senhor Santos-Dumont quit his placid retirement in Paris for a gala demonstration in Rio . He has lived in France some 30 years , earning aeronautical reputation as a pioneer builder &; flyer of dirigibles , as an early ( 1906 ) builder &; flyer of an airplane ; popular reputation as a feeder of Paris ' poor . <P> When his ship nosed into Rio 's mountain-shadowed harbor last week the port was reverberant with welcoming din . Airplanes cavorted about . A great passenger plane , with 14 people , half of them national notables , almost struck another machine ; the pilot veered , weakened a wing , went into a tail spin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned . Rio 's din ceased . Flyer Santos-Dumont walked from his ship , head down , depressed . <P> But in a day or two Brazilians were clamoring for some gesture from Alberto Santos-Dumont . They wanted the United States of Brazil to thumb its collective nose at the United States of America . Senhor Santos-Dumont satisfied them-by describing an invention , his " Martian transformer , " a device with which one can walk faster and with less effort . It is to be fastened to a walker 's back ; his strides activate it ; it in turn " energizes his nervous system . " He may climb mountains with as little effort as walking a sidewalk . A larger machine should enable one to walk " in birdlike flight . " U. S. neurologists consider the device 's description poppycock . <P> <P> * In 1901 he sailed around the Eiffel Tower , won a 100,000 franc prize . His experiments he describes in My Airships , published in 1904 by the Century Co . TIME will pay $5 for a copy of My Airships.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
