Last February The Harvard Lampoon ( humorous ) published a number burlesquing Town and Country ( society picture-magazine ) . It contained an article on a Catholic wedding at " St. Mike 's Church . " <P> Accused of blasphemy , the Editors apologized . Not content with that , the organ of the Knights of Columbus , Columbia , is now attacking the authorities of Harvard University because the editors have not been disciplined . <P> Columbia says that Harvard will decline , if its authorities forget " how to teach young men good manners . "
