On the tenth anniversary of Prohibition ( Jan. 16 , 1930 ) U. S. distilleries will be steaming fragrantly in the legitimate production of whiskey . Their activities will be altogether legal and aboveboard , with no Dry raids , no protesting outcries from irate prohibitors . <P> Such a news forecast came out of Washington last week when the Treasury Department prepared to issue permits which would start distilleries making bourbon and rye whiskies to replenish fast-dwindling medicinal stocks . Distillers from Louisville and Baltimore went into conference with Prohibition Commissioner James M. Doran who will supervise the reopening of U. S. liquor factories . Throughout the land government gaugers measured the whiskey supply held in bonded warehouses , forwarded their reports to Washington . <P> Receiving the reports , Commissioner Doran announced : " The Bureau of Prohibition will proceed to act upon applications ... for permits to manufacture whiskey for medicinal use . . . . The amount of actual whiskey on hand July 1 , 1929 is 9,549,017 gallons . If further manufacture is now permitted , it will be late fall or nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .
