Ten men have ten farms . Each raises pigs . Their common market is the village around which they all live . The pig prices they will get from the villagers depend on three things : <P> 1 ) The villagers ' hunger . <P> 2 ) The number of pigs raised . <P> 3 ) Who sells his pigs first . <P> To eliminate the last factor , the ten pig men cooperate . They agree on a pig-selling period . To protect themselves further from each other , they agree that , for each pig he sells , each pig man shall put a certain fee in a common fund . At the end of the pig-selling period , portions of this fund shall be advanced to any of the ten pig men who have had to sell their pigs , at home or in some other village , for less than what all agree upon that year 's " fair price " for pigs . The pig men have thus equalized their prosperity . <P> The pig men might avoid paying in their equalization fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund for them . Then , in years when the ten pig men raised more pigs than could be sold profitably in their home village , those who had surplus pigs could borrow from the fund to pay for transporting their pigs to distant markets , or to buy feed for pigs kept penned until the home village was ready to buy more pigs . In case the pig surplus was so great that the pig men 's borrowings exhausted the loan fund , the pig men could always fall back again on the equalization fee plan . To ensure honesty , perhaps the philanthropist had better administer the equalization fee as well as the loan fund . . . . <P> Last week the House passed the Senate 's farm relief bill . Representative Haugen 's name ( Iowa ) again joined Senator McNary 's ( Oregon ) as the author of what , in principle , was voted down once and shelved once by the 68th Congress , voted down and then passed by the 69th Congress , and finally vetoed last year by President Coolidge . The controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up above . The pig men are U. S. farmers-raisers of livestock , grain , cotton , tobacco . The philanthropist is the U. S. President Coolidge has been willing that the Government should set up a loan fund and a farm board to administer it . He has been unwilling that the U. S. should engage to administer the equalization fee , which he construes as involving price-fixing and as putting the Government directly into the buying and selling of various farm commodities . <P> During the House debate , the equalization fee plan was momentarily sidetracked . Into the Committee of the whole-which is the compact form the House takes during the reading of major bills-Representative Aswell of Louisiana introduced a bill omitting the equalization fee and asked that it be substituted for the McNary-Haugen measure . The Committee of the whole voted in favor . Hubbub then reigned , because the members could not agree as to precisely what had happened , whether a whole new bill had been substituted or just an amendment . When the whole House met , the McNary-Haugenites settled the matter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bill went to conference with the Senate to have conflicts removed . The main conflict was as to whether the equalization fee should be adopted with or without a stabilization fund to postpone its operation .
