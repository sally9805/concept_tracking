txt In their letter to President HARDING Judge GARY ? and his fellow-Directors of the American Iron and Steel Institute repeat their intention to abolish the twelve-hour day in the steel industry , and they do it in a form that leaves no doubt of their good faith . " We are determined , " they say . " to exert " every effort at our command to se " cure in the iron and steel industry of " this country a total abolition of the " twelve-hour day at the earliest time , " practicable . " But again the Directors make it plain that the change to shorter bnurs can not be effected until the supply of labor increases : in fact . until " there is a surplus of labor available . " words used by President HARDING ! in his letter of June 18 asking the Institute to pledge itself to act when Conditions of labor were favorable . In his speech at Tacoma on Thursday the President , who gave out the letter there , said , alluding to the pledge he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Important step . lt " will heal a sore in American industrial life which has been the cause of Infinite struggle and bitterness for over a generation , and it marks an accomplishment from the conscience of industry itself , a recognition of responsibility from employer to employ , that gives us faith in rightful solutions of the many tangled problems that are the concomitant of the rapid growth of America . In this statement the President hardly does justice to the Iron and Steel Institute . It was already on record as committed to the shorter day , and the " pledge " is a reaffirmation of a promise already given . As a matter of fact , the Institute has nat altered its position , which was that the twelve-hour day would be abolished in a labor market that made it practicable . It points out again that the change will " involve many ad " justments , some of them conapli " cated and difficult . " In an interview yesterday Judge GARY stated that 60,000 additional workers would be needed before the pledge could be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be increased 15 per cent . when there was an eight-hour day in all departments where continuous operation is necessary . He promised that " efforts to " get rid of the twelve-hour day will " be promptly made , " but he was careful to add that success would have to wait upon an increase in the number of workmen . He looks for reinforcements from the South , Mexico , the Philippines and Canada . The bulk of the increase seems to be coming from the South . From some States , like Georgia , there is an exodus of negro laborers . Judge GARY 'S tone and attitude are certainly auspicious , whatever Mr. GOMPERS may say about " bluff and insincerity . " Judge GARY is well aware that public opinion is behind the President , and he knows that it is only a question of time when the twelve-hour day will be eliminated altogether . The consumers may have to pay the cost of the charge , yet there is a hope of cheaper production in the establishment of the working day of three eight-hour shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
