Over the edge of the towering rostrum of the Chamber of Deputies there dangled for a few moments last week a pale green rubberized corset , a rose silk brassiere , and two other diaphanous feminine whatnots . <P> The occasion was a solemn debate upon the tariff bill of 1,200 items . From the rostrum Deputy Victor La Sache was urging protection for one item , feminine unmentionables . Holding up the corset by its dainty garters , he cried : " These are French products , made in French factories by French workers and worn by French women . Are they not lovely ? Have you ever seen anything imported from abroad so really beautiful , and at the same time so serviceable ? . . . La France demands protection for this industry ! " <P> The Deputies , though diverted by this escapade , did not impose a higher duty upon netherthings , but rushed the tariff bill through in approximately its original form ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . It was also passed by the Senate last week . The bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the duty upon farm machinery is reduced , while higher tariffs are levied upon all important food stuffs.
