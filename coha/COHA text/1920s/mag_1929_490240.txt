FROM our long felonious experience , we are inclined to agree with the federal judge who ruled that anyone is a felon who fails to report a person who serves him a drink . This gives the country a population almost one-hundred-per-cent felonious . In the forty-right states and Alaska there must be close to one hundred million felons , many of them ( and this is a sad thing ) women . There is something deplorable about a woman felon . In view of the circumstances we propose that about a thousand , or maybe fifteen hundred , fairly able felons unite here in New York , forming the Felon co Club . We propose further that the entire membership of the club , a date having been set , march in a body to the Custom House , singing " When good felons get together , " enter the place , and report each other . The machinery of government would be swamped , and the situation could n't he met . We know quite a few felons in town whom the government would n't dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of financial ruin to major industries . There would be only one alternative : to repeal the curious Volstead law and make the citizenry honest again . MONG the felons we forgot to mention above are , of course , several members of the New York Police Department . Last week when Flanagan Brothers ' restaurant in Grand Street t.vas raided by Major Campbell , arch-enemy of felons , the place was full of policemen , eating lunch . Three pints of rye whiskey and eighteen bottles of beer were found . The existence of these intoxicants must have been known to the policemen , otherwise they would not be " New York 's finest " but only " New York 's most undiscerning . " Thus we are in the predicament of having felons enforcing the law . Can a felon arrest a felon ? We do n't see how , on account of the confusion . THERE are one hundred and seventy-six pages in this week 's NEW YORKER . If torn out and placed end to end , as they deserve , they would reach from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard Club , narrowly missing several old members , and out the other side into Forty-fourth Street . There they would peter out of their own redundancy . The impudence of publishing such a heavy issue in a time of panic requires an explanation . The truth is , we did it for President Hoover , in answer to his call . We are trying to restore the confidence of the public in the soundness Of American business , regardless of how much clutter we make . According to the seismograph in our advertising department , the nation is pretty sound  --  a little dull , maybe , but pretty sound ; and the mere fact that most of our readers will have to borrow the fifteen cents to buy the issue should n't worry them . They need n't give it a thought . VV TE happened to be a passenger in the great four-motored Fokker , F-32 , just a few days before she fell down out of the sky and was consumed in flames . It was the second air disaster in which we felt a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford crashed and killed thirteen people . We had ridden in that plane , too . Such events tend to chasten our spirit and clip our wings . Also , they tend to give us pause about aviation in general . Much is being taken for granted , it seems to us ; and the race of fliers is still lifting itself into the air literally by its own bootstraps . The principle on which planes are built today is the same , exactly , as when Wright took the air at Kitty Hawk . It seems possible that it will some day be an obsolete principle , depending as it does entirely on tremendous speed and the continuous functioning of the plane 's power plant . It is our belief that airplane construction is due for revolutionary changes ; and that progress in heavier-than-air flying will probably be in the direction of the autogyro , which permits planes to fly slowly and , power or no power , to land gently . The F-32 was an impressive car of Juggernaut , but what we need is a plane modelled after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Q retold about Clemenceau since his death , we liked this especially . The great men of the Peace Conference , with the exception of Wilson , who had gone home , were sitting around table striving to select just the man for the job of Secretary General of the League of Nations . The fingers of Destiny poked here and , ? there , trying to locate the best person for this important position ; the mighty voices argued , suggested , and opposed . Meanwhile the Tiger , who was getting bored with all the conversation , began to doze in his chair , as he used to do in the long afternoons of the Conference proper , his gray-gloved hands clasped across his stomach . When he came out of this particular lapse , with a start , he noticed that there was only one man in the room who was n't saying anything , just standing there . " Who is that man ? " Clemenceau asked , leaning toward Lloyd George . " Why , " said the British Premier , " he 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll give him the job  --  he never says anything . " With which the aged gentleman closed his eyes again . The postscript is , of course , that the secretary in question , who happened to be Sir Eric Drummond , did get the job , and is still Secretary General today , a testimonial to Clemenceau 's good judgment  --  or lucky wit . Isadora 's Brother RAymoNDDuNcAN is in town with the idea of starting a branch of his academy here . He serves tea every afternoon in his studio in West Seventy-fifth Street , surrounded by his fabrics , his poems , his shepherdess , and his disciples . Reclining on a couch , he talks with you about the future , which he believes must be prepared for by throwing off the past and learning to perform the simple motions of life , such as digging and making sandals . His poems are five dollars , his " Eternal Beauty " is two dollars , and his fabrics run from four dollars on up . The couch is very hard . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks more like a witch than a shepherd . His long gray locks are held back by a ribbon , his tunic flows classically from his shoulders , and his chubby little arms that have woven so many yards of piece goods look rather flabby and old . After years of tending donkeys and goats on the Acropolis with Penelope , organizing refugees , rebuilding a city in Albania , weaving rugs , digging holes , dyeing linen , writing poems , and administering academies and temples of arts , always clinging tight to the immortal and somewhat elusive spirit of his inspired sister , he is still hopeful . He has n't had on a pair of pants in nineteen years , man and boy . While we were reclining with him , doing our best to look like a goatherd despite our sack suit , a lady entered the room and asked him " if it would brutalize him if she suggested a cup of tea . " " My dear Julia , " he replied , " the whole world is trying to brutalize me . " Brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small doily , and departed , our sandals clinking merrily along the pave . Anecdotes nESIDES his banking and Wall - LI Street activities , Mr. James Speyer is interested in so many charities and other philanthropic ventures that sometimes his friends get confused . Recently , in the midst of two simultaneous drives , one to provide watering troughs for horses , the other to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment , he received a sad little note . " Dear James , " it said . " I had today two letters from you , one demanding water for horses , and the other , ruin For men . I do n't know what to do . Here is fifty dollars . Use your own judgment or split it both ways . " WHILE we are at it , we can V V tell a tale about Mr. Max D. Steuer , the astute lawyer . Impanelling a jury for a law case which he was to try , he asked one of the prospects if he knew either himself or the opposing attorney . To his surprise , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did know Mr. Steuer " well enough ; " he said , upon being questioned further , that Steuer had been one of the lawyers in a case in which he had been interested . " Was I your lawyer ? " Mr. Steuer , mystified , demanded . " Oh , not " was the answer . " You were on the other side , " Had that left him with any prejudice , Mr. Steuer then wanted to know . " Not at all , brother . Not at all , " replied the juror heartily . " You got licked . " Newsreel MHE big question now about the I newsreel theatre is , who thought of it first ? Probably everybody has had the idea at one time or another . It is on record that five years ago an enterprising Frenchman actually tried it out in Paris , in a theatre so small it did n't even have seats . His idea was that people would drop in for a few minutes between appointments , glance at the newsreel as they would at the headlines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The present venture at the Embassy Theatre is done with much more elegance . They have snappy usherettes , a gleaming doorman , and a sign in the lobby which says : " The thirst for news may now be quenched , so drink thy fill of Knowledge . " So far about fifty thousand people have attended the theatre weekly . Such a success is it , that they are talking of a country-wide string of newsreel theatres . Everybody concerned is pretty much up in the air about the idea , rushing cameras here and there , and talking about revolutionizing the movies . When that unfortunate flier crashed into the side of the Y.M.C.A. building they had a cameraman on the spot within twenty minutes . Four hours later they were showing the film together with a short talk by Mr. Robert Baillie , the passenger who jumped by parachute and survived . That evening Mr. Baillie dropped into the theatre to see and hear himself . The actual news part of the program ? news , as distinct from human-interest stuff  --  is made up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie put out . It represents a culling from one hundred and fifty thousand feet of film sent in every week from all over . Two projecting-rooms are going almost constantly , running off the film , while editors , caption-writers , sound experts , etc. , sit at a row of desks in the back of the room , making notes . The staff also thinks up the human-interest features . It has been found that audiences like to see and hear other people talking  --  Mrs. Byrd telling Commander Byrd , by radio , that she drives her own car now ; Miss Shilling , of Baltimore , explaining why she offered to marry any man who would give her five thousand dollars . The audience wept when Mrs. Fall said that she still believed Albert Fall innocent . It hissed at Senator Sheppard boosting prohibition . Animal pictures go well . They are the hardest to get . Last year somebody in the Fox company got the idea of making a picture of two cats fighting on a fence , with sound . Cameramen worked three months on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , when they got the picture , it ran a minute and a half . Heckler DR . FR1Tz WITTE ns  --  w e ' re not trying to be funny  --  Dr. Fritz VitteIs , the Viennese psychoanalyst , was giving one of a series of lectures last Thursday night in the New School for Social Research , at Twenty-third Street and Tenth Avenue , when a resident of the neighborhood strayed in , apparently from some grogshop in the vicinity . Standing uncertainly , he gave ear to the lecture , which was entitled " The Mind of the Child " and was pretty technical . He began to look suspicious and grin , and finally he interrupted the proceedings in a husky voice . " 1 do n't know what you 're tryin ' to get at , brother , " he shouted , " but the Democratic Party it the only wan that gives a man a chance ! " It took five minutes of argument to persuade him to leave . Helping I-land ATE the other night , a man carry- ing a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down in the aisle seat beside a stranger , and settled himself for a nap . At Jamaica he woke with a start , glanced out at the name of the station , and rushed from the train . A moment later , the stranger noticed the suitcase on the Anon It was a time for quick thinking : the train was getting under way . He hoisted the window , heaved the suitcase out , and dropped it on the platform . He was just sitting down again , sighing self-satisfiedly , when he noticed the owner of the bag returning to his seat with the morning paper he had gone out to the platform to buy . New Ansonia HOUGH many of the guests do n't know it , the old Hotel Ansonia is being remodelled . They have been at it all summer , doing a floor at a time , while business throughout the building went on as usual . As fast as a block of rooms could be vacated , plumbers and carpenters moved in and began tearing out partitions , ripping up piping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole building will he completely done over by the first of the year and they plan a big New Year 's party , with a tremendous Christmas tree , to celebrate the event . The building itself , with its stone balconies , corner turrets , and mansard roof , will remain much as it was . Stanford White designed it for the late W. E. D. Stokes , who wanted " a hotel with the grandeur of an ancient castle , " it has become a kind of monument along upper Broadway . Inside , things will be a little more glittering . Plaster walls are being covered , sometimes with marble , sometimes with gold leaf . Old-fashioned cut-glass chandeliers are coming down , to be replaced by wall brackets of hinged plates of glass . Elevators will gleam in silver and black . A ballroom that will hold two thousand people is being arranged on the second floor . Most of the great rambling apartments , some of which had ten and twelve rooms , with kitchen , separate corridors , and servants ' quarters , are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , however , will remain unchanged . Senator Copeland lives in it now . It has eleven rooms , including one circular drawing-room , which was a favorite feature of Stanford White 's design . Almost every apartment has one , at least Because of the extra thick walls this shape requires , the Ansonia has always attracted singers and musicians : the rooms are practically soundproof . Chaliapin stays there when in town , always in the same apartment . He likes it because it has three rooms in a row which can he opened to form one enormous room , as large as a hall . He likes plenty of space . Dozens of people from the Metropolitan live there ? Volpi , Amato , Scrafin , Danise , Basiola . DcWoll Hopper , the actor , has lived there for years . The Ansonia barber , Mr. Mockel by name , is something of a celebrity . He has been with the hotel ever since it started , twenty-six years ago , and has shaved such eminent personages as Herbert Hoover , Jack Dempsey , John Bassett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charles M. Schwab , whose house is a block away . Babe Ruth is one of his regular customers today . When White designed the hotel he made one gargoyle in a caricature of Stokes , emphasizing his peculiar beard . One look at it , and Stokes went down to the barber shop and told Mr. Mockel 24 DECEMBER 7 , 1 929 " Are n't you jealous , us finding all this wood for our fireplace ? " to shave him clean . He never wore a beard after that . Montessori Methods ALITTLE girl , who suddenly burst out crying in the middle of an aisle , shattered the quiet of one of our better-bred department stores the other afternoon . Shoppers raised their eyebrows . The child 's mother pleaded . Nothing did any good : the little girl just stamped and yelled . ' Ti give you something to cry about , " the mother began , when a very gracious lady , sweetly smiling , intervened . " They always have some reason , you know , " she said . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She questioned the child ; she found that in this case it was a large doll in the toy department that the little girl wanted . Still smiling sweetly , the lady , using words of one syllable , marshalled her arguments , pointed out that there were lots of little girls who had no dolls at all , that one could n't always have whatever one wanted . The child , quieted , smiled . The lady moved away . Immediately the little girl burst out crying again , even more loudly than before . By patient questioning the mother finally learned what the new rumpus was about ; but it did n't do her any good . This time , it was the lady the little girl wanted . Three Times and Out THE elevator went up , up , and came to a halt at the twelfth floor . " Look here ! " protested a choleric old gentleman in the back of the car .

Calder 's Circus CONVERSATION lagging one night at a dinner party in Paris some three years ago , Mr. Alexander Calder amused his table companion by making a chicken out of a piece of bread and a hairpin . A success story has grown from that idle bit of modelling . Mr. Calder 's kangaroo is now one of the heaviest-selling gadgets in the Christmas toy lists ; his bear , bull , and dog are also popular numbers . He has also had an enormous succor d'estime with a wire , felt , and heaver-hoard circus . These raw materials he took up when he abandoned bread and hairpins . The Calder circus is in town now . You ca n't buy tickets to it , but people who have seen it say it is worth getting a bid to a private showing . The circus is held in the drawing-room , or kitchen , of sonic friend . Mr. Calder sits on the floor , beside a miniature tanbark ring , and is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wire joints and felt bodies  --  trapeze artists , high-divers , bareback riders , clowns , lions , horses , and dogs . The tricks are often ingeniously contrived . For example , the horses are mounted on a disc which Mr. Calder can whirl madly , by turning the handle of an old eggbeater . At the proper moment , a spring or something is released , a bareback rider in ballet skirts flies through the air , bursts through a hoop , and lands astride a horse . People scream . Calder seldom misses . For faint hearts , a net is spread beneath the trapeze performers . Clowns tumble about the ring , poodles sit up , a hoochie-coochie dancer brings down the house . It all lasts about two hours , and nobody ever walks out or even gets restive . Jean Cocteau , who is easily bored , saw the show in Paris at the studio of Fnujita , the Japanese painter , and was enthusiastic . He wants to put it on the stage somehow . MR . CALDER does this sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of a serious sculptor , A. Stirling Calder , who most recently did the I. Miller marbles , Mary Pickford , Marilyn Miller , and so on . That shows how serious he is . The son can even do serious things with his beloved medium , wire . Two seasons ago he had a one-man show of caricatures and portraits in wire at Weyhe 's gallery . His penetrating portrait of Calvin Coolidge shocked onlookers and gained considerable renown . His ballet-dancers ( the serious ones , not the common circus women ) are miracles of lightness and grace . For these he uses nothing but wire , which he bends with pincers and nippers . It was hard at first to interest toy-manufacturers in his lions , bears , etc . As a matter of fact he could n't interest any of the old-line , suspicious toy-makers . It was a manufacturing concern of another sort , out in Oshkosh , which finally took a chance and made up some of the animals from the Calder pattern . As we said , they are selling heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose bookshop near the old Jefferson Market we wrote about a few weeks ago . It concerns a young hook salesman who dropped in there one day on the chance of an order . Hardly had , he closed tlly , 0,144r behind him before : " Nothingjday . Nothing today , " a mysterious rice was repeating . Startled ( he could n't inkagine how anyone might have guessed his business ) he peered about and discovered Mrs. Pratt herself , sphinxlike among the hooks , regarding him . " How did you know ? " he asked her . Her eyes closed , as of one weary of wisdom , and opened again . " A man that comes in to buy somethim : : : , " she retorted sagely , " he keeps his hat on . When he wants to sell something , he takes it off . " While we are about it , we will correct a couple of rather unfortunate misstatements we made about the daily life of Mrs. Pratt . She does n't darn socks every day , but only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , she does n't skip rope one hundred and sixty times every morning .
