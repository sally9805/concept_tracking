" Thou Shalt Not Tamper Life " - Louis Hmon <P> The Story . Monsieur Ripois rid himself of his palling mistress quite as simply as she would have shed her soiled blue wrapper . He yawned at her solicitude , snapped at her tenderness , sneered at her complaints , assumed high dudgeon when her desperation became vindictive . His sooty little conscience glowing at her quick repentance , out he marched , free to take a new lodging , walk the London streets after work and supper , fondle his mustache , boldly scrutinize passing women and wait , thinking himself a very audacious chap of the world indeed , for further chances to cheat life of amorous adventures where the women gave all and he , Amde Ripois , gave nothing . <P> Winifred was next . A starving florist girl , she was so innocent she thought she had to go home with him because he gave her tea . She haunted his doorstep long afterwards , before turning prostitute . <P> He obtained Mabel with a clever mirage of Marriage , that sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress . <P> Then Nemesis tricked him . He lost his job in the City ; his few shillings went . Shivering nights on the Embankment and hunger 's fang stirred him to a violent design . He would get a harlot to take him home , then rob her . At this crux , his tears accomplished what his nerve funked . Marcelle kept him that winter as " her man , " a pathetic sop to her vestige of womanly honor . When Marcelle was jailed for soliciting , Monsieur Ripois was most adroit . He stole her savings and decamped to Cricklewood , where it occurred to him to advertise French lessons under a grandiose name . <P> Ella beheld Monsieur Ripois on Dollis Hill , stretching his arms to the spring sunshine in thanksgiving for his wellbeing , in vague supplication for something pure and fresh , possibly a new woman . Later , when he approached her , an erect , full-bosomed child-virgin , she did not see a little cad of 30-odd with a pale , muggy face , but remembered a man whose gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a dream of him , managed their whole affair in calm unquestioning ecstasy-quite the best affair he had ever had , thought Monsieur Ripois , until she told him they would marry now , for the child . At that Monsieur Ripois stole off and tried to materialize his greatest chance of all , incipient with Aurora Barnes , a rich , neurotic Francomaniac . <P> Mr. Barnes and his solicitor tripped that scheme . Monsieur Ripois ' pupils dwindled away . Again poverty sniffed under his door . He decided he had loved , really loved , Ella . He would go back , say he was sorry , marry her . <P> He went . Ella 's blind uncle proudly told him that the lorry had crushed her by accident . Monsieur Ripois knew better-much better . Pilfering meanly from life , he had failed to perceive and accept its rich free gift . The grief that came upon him , the suffering through another that he learned , was too great for even his cynical , acquisitive ego to shake off .
