In 1890 , one Harry Gordon Selfridge , Wisconsin born , became a member of Marshall Field &; Co. in Chicago . Fourteen years later , after he had shown himself a great department store executive , had become general manager of and partner in his firm , he retired from business . <P> Like all U. S. voyagers in England , he enjoyed the quiet , the courtesy , the fine products of the English specialty shop . These , the result of intense retail competition , were typical of 19th Century British trade . It was pleasant to shop in them . But , to the mind of Mr. Selfridge , restless in retirement , they seemed expensive to operate , each with its separate overhead charges . The U. S. department store , while more raucous , was more economical and , too , more convenient for customers . It should be possible to merge the advantages of both the British and the U. S. systems of retailing . <P> Selfridge &; Co. ' s department store in London , the embodiment of these reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street is a guidepost for beautiful store architecture . Sales people address clients by name . In 17 years it has become , except possibly for Harrod 's , the greatest retail store in England . <P> Mr. Selfridge has grown proud of his store . It has become his life 's accomplishment . So , with the intention of perpetuating it as the climax of his achievements , he last week wrote a letter to his customers : " I want to know that , whatever happens , the business which I have founded and into which I have put so much of myself will go on . Naturally , I should like Selfridge 's to remain in the family , but I do not want to feel that if one of my descendants is weak and incapable of administration , this great firm will go down with him . " <P> To provide against that , he had organized a 2,000,000 trust to take over the share capital of his-firm . Securities of this trust he was offering his store clients . <P> Mr. Selfridge hastened to anticipate carpings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these shares , and I have no possible thought of changing it or of ever retiring from active business .
