No Bet <P> Sirs : <P> Who gives a tinker 's dam whether or not a pig in Shelby , N. C. , slobbers on James Ledbetter ? <P> You say in your advertisements that TIME is written for " active persons of high intelligence and quick apperceptions . . . not for the masses . " <P> Really , I just ca n't imagine a person of high intelligence enjoying reading about slobbering pigs and rams butting fat women as reported in your MISCELLANY Department ( TIME , Dec. 26 , 1927 ) . <P> . . . Now I would like to make you a little bet , and I wo n't back down either if I lose . <P> Here it is . Ask your subscribers if they enjoy reading about rams butting fat women and pigs slobbering on people . If they like it , I will pay you double price for TIME for ten years . If they do not care for it , I get TIME ten years for nothing and you agree to cut out the silly , uncouth stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME finds it impossible to conduct polls among its 175,000 subscribers and newsstand buyers or take up every sporting offer made by speculative readers .

When he arrived at the Embassy in France no shoes big enough were handy . " <P> Let me tell you , TIME , there will never be a man on your staff big enough to " stand in Lindy 's shoes " ! <P> GRACE GORDON Cox <P> Boston , Mass . <P> " Golden State " <P> Sirs : <P> I call your attention to item in TIME of Nov. 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's lounge and smoking room on trains operated by the Pennsylvania R.
