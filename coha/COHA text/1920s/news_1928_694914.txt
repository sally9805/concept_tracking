txt The major industry of the publishing business seems to be teas lately . If one had strength enough he ( and it 's Just as often he as she ) could take tea in maybe two widely separated spots every afternoon . And when you can get tea at a tea party it is a springboard from which conversation for hours can leap . I reminded myself of a story I heard about Charles Hanson Towne the other night . Some one had said that he had spent one of those gorgeously funny evenings when unartie ? Towne did Shakespeare ( a grand stunt he does ) , and that it had been spent in Mr. Towne 's rooms . " Rooms ! " said the Incredulous per . son to whom he told the story , " I thought Charlie Towne lived in a taxi ! cab ! " That is exactly what might be said about the visiting elk from Chicago literary circles . What with taking tea from the Brevoort to the Salvoy-Plaza and from Claremont ( beyond ' Grant 's tomb ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding place down here , as the . Negro spiritual has it . Being a simple country maid and still believing that book publishing is one of the more secluded of the indoor sports , I ca n't help being startled at the stream of teas that seem to be one of the rules of the game . I ca n't see how anybody can get anything done . for having luncheon , going to a couple of teas , having a snack after the theater , and being dead on the vine until eleven the next morning must cut into the writing business somewhat . At any rate , the teas have all been swell . ( I will say that swell was one of my favorite descriptive adjectives some time ago . Now it 's such currency in the lit'ry circles that I 'm going to have to dig myself up a new word  --  elegant , maybe . ) That reminds me that , after seeing Elinor Wylie ' looking more and more beautiful over . a series of literary teas , I said that she looked handsomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " handsome " was her Idea of something like the Goddess of Liberty , and ethe did n't think she looked like the Goddess of Liberty ( and she Is right . ) Her new book , " Mr. Hodge and Mr. ' , Hazard , " is creating a lot of excitement . The Norrises , Kathleen and Charles , just alighting from Europe and about to be on their way , took the stranger within the city into their open , arms ? there 's something expansive , generous , really friendly about them just to look at , and Kathleen Norris has a reputation for wit unrivaled in lit'rY circle 's . Edna Ferber is my idea of one of the world 's most amusing human beings and one of its nicest . With two of the most brilliantly successful plays in town rolling up fame and fortune for her , she is exactly the open hearted friendly person who was the first person I ever interviewed , and still , even after all these years , taking her work terribly hard . We had luncheon one'day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just sat and listened , as who would n't ? One of the great sights of the city of New York is Mr. Mencken at a tea party  --  and having a grand time ! I never expected to happen upon such a moment , but there he was , at the Knopf 's , surrounded by what is com-. mealy known as a. bevy of beautiful ! ladies . Carl Van ' Vechten was there , , too , just returned from the west , and Thyra Samter Winslow , and Rose O'Neill , with a new kewpie ' doll that she had just invented , and Ruth Suckow , looking less like her pictures than any one I ever saw . And after that tea there was another one under the aegis of the younger generation of the Dutton family , John Macrae Jr. , where I saw Martha Ostenso looking more like her pictures than any one I ever saw . I recognized Larry Baretto by his pictures , also , at a tea party at John Farrar 's , where that dashing and lovely Dorothy Speare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soloists in the north shore festival in May  --  she writes books with her left , hand , knows it 's a left handed job , and loves it . Johnny Weaver , John V. A. to by exact , who is about to lecture at the University of Chicago , must do the tea business regularly , and Burton Rascoe and Isabel Paterson , for I met them all the time  --  and maybe you think it does n't seem grand to meet some one you 've known since you were all bright young things together ! By the way , Trader Horn is n't going to Chicago after all . I did n't see how , he ? has lasted this long , he seems so feeble . They have decided to take him back to England and maybe later bring him back . This has n't anything to do with the literary situation in either the big city er the provinces , but I am probably the only living literary editor who has ridden down 5th avenue in one of the new Fords . Mr. Russell Doubleday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he brought it into town and took me for a ride .
