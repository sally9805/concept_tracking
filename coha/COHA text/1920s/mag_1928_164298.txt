For 13 weeks the chosen wheat of California saw the light of twelve argon-filled lamps , 300-candlepower each . Touched by no sun 's ray , rooted in no soil , the wheat grew and flourished , drawing sustenance from jars of water in which the necessary chemical elements were dissolved . Although sun was excluded from the green house , the sun rays which contribute to plant growth were present in the electric light rays . <P> Last week Professor Alva Raymond Davis of the division of agricultural chemistry and Professor Dennis Robert Hoagland of the division of plant nutrition , University of California , pronounced the wheat mature . Not only mature , but superior in every way to its more conservative cousins which had spent five months growing in the old-fashioned way . Many have been the experiments in speeding up the growth of wheat , but never has the crop been of such quality , the time so short . The professors give the credit to the length of the light period . The lights were turned on for the most part for 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled , the plant development proceeded four times as fast , and when the light was applied for 24 hours the growth was " astounding . " The heat*rays of the lamps made these long exposures impractical in the past . Even filtering them through a water screen was unsuccessful , but Dr. Davis hit upon the idea of cooling the air in the chamber with an electric fan . This work so well that a 24-hour exposure can now be tolerated . <P> <P> *Heat rays-infra red rays .
