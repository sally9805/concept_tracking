A classic situation of rural melodrama is the moment at which the eloping or otherwise errant heroine is asked to produce her " marriage lines . " Lack of such is considered circumstantial evidence of the most damning sort . <P> Last week one Henry M. Blackmer , U. S. citizen residing in France , found himself lacking lines which , though not as intimate as a marriage license yet were of some importance to his wellbeing . For , the U. S. Government had succeeded in taking from him his U. S. passport , leaving Mr. Blackmer in the embarrassing predicament of a " person whose papers are not in order . " Mr. Blackmer is urgently wanted in the U. S. as a witness in the coming ( October ) trial of Albert B. Fall , onetime ( 1921-23 ) Secretary of the Interior , and Harry F. Sinclair , oil man , for conspiracy in the famed Teapot Dome scandal . Last May Mr. Blackmer refused to honor a subpoena to return and testify ; the passport revocation followed , presumably with the intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions . Not but that he can get out of France without a passport , but he can not legally enter any of the countries bordering France , which would seem to confine his movements to the high seas . <P> Mr. Blackmer has retained counsel to recover his passport , arguing that he paid $10 for it and therefore it is his property in perpetuum . Experts on international law , however , considered that the right to revoke a passport is included in the Secretary of State 's authority to " grant and issue passports and ... to refuse them at his discretion . " During the World War numerous passports were withdrawn and revoked . <P> Should Mr. Blackmer 's stay in France be prolonged beyond the date of the Fall-Sinclair trial , set to open in the District of Columbia Supreme Court on Oct. 17 , his absence may cost him $100,000 . For in 1925 Senator Thomas J. Walsh of Montana , head of the Senatorial investigating committee which had discovered that it was not oil wells that truth lay at the bottom of , secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summon witnesses from abroad . Furthermore , the law provided that a person refusing to honor such summons be judged guilty of contempt and fined to the extent of $100,000 . <P> Mr. Blackmer 's presence has been considered essential to the Government 's case by special attorneys onetime ( 1911-23 ) U. S. Senator Atlee Pomerene and Owen J. Roberts , in charge of the oil trials . Mr. Blackmer was onetime ( 1922 ) an official of the Prairie Oil Co. , which , along with Sinclair oil companies , bought from a Canadian oil company 33,333,000 barrels of oil . The Canadian company had bought this oil from the Mexia ( oil ) companies of Texas . It was claimed that the Canadian company , which made some millions of dollars on the transaction , was a " shadow " or " dummy , " concern , and that Albert B. Fall received $230,000 in Liberty Bonds as his share of the profits . When the Teapot Dome case first came up before a Federal court in Cheyenne ( TIME , March 23 , 1925 ) , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Prairie Oil Co. , left for France . Mr. O'Neil has not been located since . Mr. Blackmer was found on May 11 by U. S. Consul at Marseilles Bernard F. Hale and then and later refused to accept subpoenas proffered him .
