THE scene is AUNT MAHALY 'S deserted one-room cabin in a deep cypress swamp along the Cape Fear River late one August afternoon . In the center back is a heavy door partly swung open , letting in the sickly bluish light of gathering dusk . High up in the left wall , cut through the heavy logs , is a small opening serving for a window . A wooden shutter made of one width of plank swings from it . Through this window a sort of funnel-shaped column of light comes down , meeting the light from the door near the center of the room , and revealing an old black rusty wash-pot . Brambles and all sorts of puny creepers have grown up through the clay floor , some raising themselves up and falling back in great bows , others clasping the walls with their damp frail hands and running up into the rafters , sticking their heads out towards the window and the door and bending back to hang down in the room like long thin reptiles . A tall clump of willows and jimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye grows accustomed to the gloom , it discovers a sort of low bed in the right rear , partly overgrown with briars and tall large-leaved reeds . Here and there on the floor are broken boards , a box or two , an old chair and , near the center front , a small pile of dry firewood . Further gazing into the thickening shadows reveals an old dress and strings of dried herbs hanging on the left rear wall , and above the door a wide-spreading pair of cowhorns . The sough of the wind in the cypress trees outside moans and whispers , mingled with the long cool notes of calling swamp thrushes . As the dusk grows deeper and deeper , an owl begins hooting far off , and another screams out his ear-splitting reply close by the haunted cabin . The thump of running footsteps draws near . It stops , and then two low hushed voices are heard . After a moment a tall muscular Negro of twenty-five or thirty , wearing a cap , with torn clothes , peers in through the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another Negro , short and stocky , about forty , his clothes in shreds , staggers forward into the light . He carries a small satchel . BLUE-GUM ED Almost in a whisper .

Pipe down , nigger , an ' cool yo ' tongue . They both are silent . BOLL-WEEVIL. arranges his head more comfortably on the satchel . By this time the shadows have deepened in the room . The thrushes have ceased calling , and only the wind is heard , with now and then the hoot of an owl . Presently BOLL-WEEVIL calls out in a tired voice . BOLL-WEEVIL Blue-Gum , if I gits so I cai n't go fas ' on de next lap , you 'll stay by me , wo n't you ? BLUE-GUM ED Whut 's eatin ' you ? Sho ' I 'll stay by you . Ai n't we pardners ?

A moment passes and BOLL-WEEVIL begins to snore . BLUE-GUM cautiously raises his head and listens . He calls softly . Boll-Weevil ! Boll-Weevil ! As BOLL-WEEVIL makes no reply , he stands up , muttering to himself . Dat fool is a hindrance an ' a drag on me . ' Spicious , too , worse'n a ol ' woman . He pulls a long knife from his belt .

BOLL-WEEVIL I 's ' fraid o ' snakes under dere . BLUE-GUM ED Git under . Hurry . He crawls under , with the satchel still in his hand . I 'll lie behind dis mess o ' willows . He secretes himself in the shadows . In a moment the SHERIFF , a big burly white man , heavily armed , appears at the door and looks in . Behind him is a small thin man , his DEPUTY , armed also . DEPUTY Lonesome looking place , all right . SHERIFF It sure is . Waste of time coming by here . Them niggers is ten miles off by now . p. 12 DEPUTY I du n no , you never can tell . Want to go in ? SHERIFF You could n't drag a nigger to this part of the swamp with a two-horse team . DEPUTY That Blue-Gum Ed is purty keen . SHERIFF But not keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm gon na look around a bit . SHERIFF And I do n't like the looks of this place myself . I 'll tell the world . Them two negroes is headed straight for Fayetteville this minute . I 've already wired the Sheriff there . DEPUTY Wait for me while I look in and see what this old witch place is like . He pulls out his pistol and steps over the sill . The SHERIFF remains at the door with pistol drawn . Here 's a pot on the floor  --  what 's that for ? SHERIFF Poking his head in . They say old Aunt Mahaly used to have that in her witch business . I remember that old woman , and it was so . DEPUTY For God 's sake ! And here hangs one of her dresses on a nail . Been hynh many a year . Phew ! Everything 's growed up . And , say , here 's a bed . Looks like a fine place for highland moccasins and all sorts of snakes . It sure is ha'nted. or nothing ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys hallooing down the creek . Maybe they 've struck a trail . DEPUTY Suddenly shouting . Heigh , you two niggers , come out of here ! A drum of wings follows as some birds fly out through the door . SHERIFF Jumping back . Heigh , look out ! He fires his pistol twice in the air . DEPUTY Running to the door . What'n the world you shooting at ? SHERIFF Weakly . Something went past me with a whiz  --  and I took a couple of cracks at it .  --  Embarrassed. like a fool . DEPUTY Quietly . Nothing but birds I shooed out of there . SHERIFF Mebbe so , but it might have been ol ' Nick hisself from the racket they made . DEPUTY Looking back over the room . I guess you 're right , they did n't come by here . Got a flashlight ? SHERIFF No , I have n't . DEPUTY Why'n the devil did n't we bring one ? Trailing a nigger in the dusk like this you need a light to watch for tracks . p. 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then another lynching ! DEPUTY You 're right and a sweet message from the governor . They go out and are heard talking as they disappear down the slope . BLUE-GUM runs to the door and watches a moment ; then he comes back and sits down in the chair . BLUE-GUM ED Lawd , I do n't lak dat depity ! He looks at his watch . Heigh , Boll-Weevil , come out , you'n me 's gut to be leavin ' heah soon . BOLL-WEEVIL suddenly sets up a kicking and thundering under the bed . Whut 's de trouble ? Boll-WEEVIL , rolls out from under the bed , and begins slapping himself , his eyes turning in fear . You havin ' a fit , man ? BOLL-WEEVIL With a little moan . Lawd , I thought I was a gone sucker !

They stand calculating . BOLL-WEEVIL suddenly cries out . Look , foh God 's sake , at dat do ' a-shettin ' ! With a start of fear BLUE-CUM turns his head . As he does so , BOLL-WEEVIL springs forward quick as a cat , and brings his club crashing down on his head . With a deep groan , BLUE-GUM sinks to his knees . BOLL-WEEVIL searches in the corner and picks up the satchel . Now see who 's boss o ' de proceedin 's . Thank you very much foh de plans to git away . BLUE-GUM sinks forward on his elbows and knees .

Unseen by him , BLUE-GUM rises to his feet , draws his knife , and springs forward , BOLL-WEEVIL hears him . Whut 's dat ? He turns and sees BLUE-GUM upon him . His scream gurgles in his throat as the knife almost severs his head from his shoulders . His body falls in a heap on the ground. p. 23 BLUE-GUM ED Gnashing his teeth .

He spits on his dead partner , then dropping the satchel , he seizes the body , lifts it in his hands , and throws it crashing into the briars and creepers at the left front .

Git on , git on , don ' be ' fraid . He urges himself over to BOLL-WEEVIL 'S body and feels for his knife . Ugh , he 's all wet from his shoulders down . While he is searching for his knife a glow begins to rise under the old pot . It grows and gradually lights up the room . BLUE-GUM draws back suddenly from the body . Ooh ! his haid 's des ' hangin ' by a piece o ' bone . I sho ' gi'n him a rake . But I was mad ! Seems lak dey 's a light from somewhah . He turns and sees the fire mounting around the pot . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stands trembling . In a throaty whisper he talks to himself . Now whut kin dat mean ! Huh , is I crazy ? Sho ' cai n't be nothin ' , but dat lick I gut on de haid makes me see red fi ' lak dat . Dat 's all . With a trembling hand he pulls out his watch . Time I was leavin ' heah . He peers through the willows . Golly , dey 's steam risin ' out o ' dat pot . Mus ' be r'al fiah . He puts his hand to his head . Blood is trickling down his face from a gash above his forehead . He feels it gingerly . Lawd , I 's hurt bad ! He looks again through the willows . Who built dat fi ' , I want to know ? Hai n't been nobody in heah to do dat . With sudden terror . Ha'nts ! De ol ' woman 's mixed up in it somehow ! His voice in a whine . I gut to git away from heah quick . He creeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed to the door , keeping his eyes all the time on the fire . Picking up the satchel he rushes to the door . Dat 's quare ! She wo n't open . Pull harder . He sets the satchel down and puts his fingers in the crack of the door , pulling again and again . He wipes the sweat and blood from his face . Somethin ' wrong . Try ag'in , I gut to leave heah . As he is straining at the door , a great black dog rises up out of the shadow at the left rear of the room , comes near BLUE-GUM and begins licking up the blood on the floor . He has an enormous mouth and fiery , set eyes that always look straight before him . BLUE-GUM backs away from the door and runs against it with all his might . Then he grabs his head in both hands , shaking himself in pain . My po ' haid , my po ' haid . Too much of a jar ! I gut to have a log or somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to look for a heavy timber and sees the dog . With a shout he flies behind the clump of willows , and stands shaking as if with an ague . The dog then goes and sits on his haunches to the left of the door , his great red tongue hanging motionlessly from his jaws and his eyes staring straight before him . BLUE-GUM stands twisting his hands together . After a moment he gets up courage to peep through the willows . Dere he sets by dat do ' to keep me from gwine out . Whut is he  --  bloodhoun ' ? Ain ' no r'al dog , I ' spects . Pondering a moment . Seems lak I ' member heahin Pap say people 'd meet a dog lak dat roun ' graveyards . Ugh ! dat ai n't no dog . God a'mighty , dat 's a ha'nt . He crouches down on his knees . Whah 's my knife ! He feels in his pockets , in his belt . Gone  --  lost . Yeh , I ' member , she 's lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull three or four sticks towards him . He holds a heavy one in his hand and seems to draw comfort from feeling it . I reckons ef dat black devil ' tacks me , he 's gwine git de hardest tussle he ever had . Almost moaning . Oh , if I on'y had my knife ! He raises his head and looks over the room again and cries out almost jubilantly as he spies it lying a few feet from the dog . Yonder she is ! He makes a move to get it and stops . No , I cai n't face dat dog  --  wait 'll he moves . He sits down again , shaking his head and rocking to and fro . While he is doing this , a little girl dressed in white with long yellow hair rises up from the brambles and vines at the left and comes out into the center of the room , all the time keeping her face towards the rear . BLUE-GUM looks at his watch . Nigger , time you was leavin ' dis burg , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' somehow . No other way , I 'll clamb up to de rafters an ' bust my way th'ough de house top ! Mus ' be rotten by dis time . He staggers to his feet and sees the little girl . Gasping . Whah 'd dat li'l gal come from ! He watches her with fascinated eyes as she walks forward and picks up the knife and drops it in the pot . Then she walks backwards to the chair and sits down with her face averted from BLUE-GUM . Dere goes de last o ' my knife . He looks at her perplexedly . Something like joy comes into his voice . Things is lookin ' better foh me . Dat 's a sho ' ' nough li'l white gal . I b'lieves she is . Quare how she gut in , dough . I know , she 's lost an ' come heah tryin ' to fin ' her mammy . I 'll ax her how come she 's heah . An ' mebbe I 'll take her wid me an ' have her sont back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He addresses her in a gentle voice . Say , li'l gal , whut you doin ' in dis ol ' house ?  --  She do n't heah me ! Suddenly afraid . Mebbe dey 's somethin ' ' ceiving ' bout her , too . I did n't lak de way she put dat knife in de pot an ' den walk back'ards to dat chur . He calls again . Is you lost , li'l gal , an ' cai n't fin ' yo ' mammy ? She makes no reply . Is you a fur ways f'om de place whah you lives ? He watches her anxiously . I cai n't make out why she don ' say nothin ' . Is she lak dat dog  --  cai n't speak ? Eyeing her closely . Sho ' she ai n't no ha'nt . Look at her li'l han ' hangin ' by her side , des ' as purty as any li'l baby 's  --  flesh an ' blood she is . Wish I could see her face dough . Shaking his head mournfully . Don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gwine git closer an ' git her to speak to me . Suddenly jerking his head up . Lawd , I 's hear'n tell o ' people goin ' th'ough swamps an ' meetin ' a li'l gal in de road an ' she leadin ' ' em into de quagmars an ' leavin ' ' em to die . Catching his breath . Ooh ! she ai n't gwine lead me into no place to drownd . Nigger , heah 's whah you lights a rag . I 's gwine out o ' dis house . He grasps a log , preparatory to climbing up to the rafters . The little girl turns toward him . She has neither ears , eyes , nose , nor mouth . BLUE-GUM takes his hand from the log . Golly , ' bout to leave my satchel . Dat 'll never do . He looks longingly towards the door where it sits close to the dog . Cai n't tempt dat dog wid nothin ' in my han ' . Git me a stick an ' I 'll have dat satchel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He turns towards the pile of firewood and sees the little girl facing him . His eyes almost start from his head and he clutches at his throat as if stifling . He yells . Turn yo ' haid away ! Turn yo ' haid away ! God ha ' muhcy , she ai n't gut no face ! He puts his arm over his eyes to shield him from the sight . The little girl turns towards the rear . After a moment , BLUE-GUM dares to raise his eyes . He breathes with great relief when he sees she has turned away . Weakly he sits down on the ground , wipes his face , and rocks back and forth . Oh , whut 's to happen to me ! Out of the right corner near the bed rises JACK-MUH-LANTERN , a creature about four or five feet high , part boy and part dog . His body is hairy like a dog , he leaps like a grasshopper , and his face is terrible to look upon  --  thick sausage lips open from ear to ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks sharply down from his chin . He hops noiselessly to his place to the right of the door . BLUE-GUM rouses himself out of his moaning and rocking . I tells you , nigger , us mus ' be leavin ' out'n heah . You 'll have flesh an ' blood ha'nts to deal wid in another hour . He picks up a stick . Dog or no dog I 's gwine git my li'l satchel , an ' beat it . He taps the stick softly against the ground . Des ' hold yo ' nerve an ' be steady . He looks up at the rafters . Th'ee jumps an ' you is out th'ough de roof . Shaking his head . Dat dog 's whut gits my goat . Ef he 'd des ' shet his eyes or pull in his tongue or somethin ' . But he sets an ' des ' sets . With sudden resolve . Whut'n de devil you git groanin ' an ' moanin ' over it ! Ef dey is ha'nts you 's gut to stand ' em . He gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is better'n givin ' up an ' dyin ' . If dats a sho ' ' nough dog an ' tries to stop me from gittin ' away wid my money , he 's gwine call for de calf-rope an ' he'p to git dis chunk o ' wood out'n his th'oat . He turns quickly and takes a step forward , then stops as if paralyzed at the sight of JACK-MUH-LANTERN . The piece of wood falls to the ground . He drops to his knees with a sob , wringing his hands , crying out . Who is you , standin ' dere grinnin ' ? Speak to me ! Is you de devil come to tote me off ? He suddenly turns his back and sits panting for breath . Lawd , I cai n't look at dat sight no mo ' . He lifts up his hands and pleads . Jesus , help me , save me ! Keep dat grinnin ' critter from me . Moaning . Oh , somebody he'p me . Heah I is shet in wid ha'nts an ' cai n't git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , pulling his hair . Presently he grows calmer and sits up . Dese heah is ha'nts . Ai n't no doubt of it . Dat last one  --  I knows him . I seed him one night on de road to Selma . Dat 's Jack-muh-Lantern . I knows every one of ' em . Now , so fur , so good . An ' , nigger , you need n't call for help . You gut to help yo'self . Use yo ' haid , work yo ' brains , I tells you . I knows whut dese ha'nts does . An ' ef I keeps up a strong backbone dey cai n't make me do nothin ' I don ' want to . Questioningly . Now , I du n no ' bout dat . Mought be so ef I had a charm , mole foot or rabbit foot or somethin ' . Disgustedly . Listen at him ! ' Cose dey ai n't no power in sech . During his talk **25;1161;TOOLONG rises up in the left rear and stands between the dog and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw , hairless head , dressed in a loose flowing garment . His hands and feet are long , bony and bloody . His eyes and mouth are close . Not seeing him , BLUE-GUM goes on with his talk . Dis much is certain . Ef I 's to git away ' fo ' dem blood houn 's gits on my trail and chews me into flinders , I better be stirrin ' . I cai n't git out de do ' , it seems . I 's sho ' I kin make it th'ough de roof . But I cai n't go off an ' leave my money . Den  --  all to be done is to git dat satchel . An ' , ' y God , I 's gwine git it . He grasps the club and turns around . A gasp breaks from him as he sees RAW-HEAD standing to the left of the dog . His knees almost sag to the floor . Uh-huh , another one ! Every time I turns my back , one of you comes . I knows you , ol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , I ai n't gwine bother you . Yeh , lak all de rest , you don ' say nothin ' . Whut you all doin ' heah so silent lak ? While he is keeping up this rapid talk , he is cunningly slipping towards his satchel sitting between the dog and JACK-MUH-LANTERN . Yeh , you all think you 'll come heah an ' skeah a po ' nigger to de'f , don ' you ? Well , you 's gut yo ' han 's full . You all sees me wid my haid laid wide open , ai n't it so ? Well , look over in de fur corner an ' you 'll fin ' de body of him whut done it . Behind him near the willow bushes the IRON-FACED-MAN rises and waits with arms folded across his breast . His uniform is that of a Yankee soldier , without a cap . His head and face are the color of bronze or dull iron . BLUE-GUM moves nearer to his satchel , talking boldly all the while , although his eyes are rolling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find de fool whut tried to kill me in de dark . You ha'nts would n't harm a po ' nigger , would you ? ' Co'se you would n't . You 's des ' heah on yo ' own business . I ai n't never gwine tell nobody whut I seed . Go right on ha'ntin ' folkses , I ain ' never gwine stop you . No-suh ! He suddenly darts down and snatches the satchel from the floor and backs away from them . He shouts joyfully . Hooray , dey 's harmless , dey did n't even bother me ! Now , to clamb to de top . He looks up , searching a place to break through the roof . Dere 's a good place above de bed . Looks rotten dere . You 's des ' in time , my boy . Ef you 'd a-waited much longer , you 'd been cotched . Tomorrow you sleeps in Liza 's house , hee ! hee ! Lemme back back , an ' git a runnin ' start an ' I goes up lak a squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have bofe han 's free . Calculating the distance . Lemme see , I know , I 'll buckle dis li'l money safe to my belt . Suddenly springing up in the air . Lawd God , whah dat fi'ry bre'f come from ? He turns , sees the IRON-FACED-MAN standing stolidly before him . Ugh  --  who 's you ! He rubs the back of his neck with a trembling hand and whines . Don ' you breave on me no mo ' . Oh , don ' you move . Hah , I knows you , I knows you , I'on-Face-Man . Laughing weakly . Hee-hee . I 's de only man whut 's ever felt yo ' bre'f an ' lived . His voice rising high . Yeh , yeh , I cai n't be killed , dat 's it . I 's dea'f-proof . Pondering . Did n't dat low-down Boll-Weevil try to spill my brains ? Did n't do it . No , could n't , dat 's it . Den dat  --  dog come to skeer me to deaf . Could n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den each of you ghosts come to finish de job . Boldly . But you could n't do it . I 's too much man foh you . You cai n't skeah me . I 's lak de cat whut cai n't be killed . Take heart , nigger , take heart , you 's gwine make it yit . Now lemme fix dis satchel to my waist an ' out I goes . He undoes his belt and passes it through the handle and buckles it . While he is thus employed , the MOONACK , an old thin beardless man in a long nightshirt , carrying a walking-stick , eyes set in a deathly stare , his white hair rising like writhing worms above his forehead , a frothy substance on his lips , comes up out of the shadows at the right and stands between JACK-MUH-LANTERN and the IRON-FACED-MAN . BLUE-GUM , finishes fastening his satchel . Ef any o ' you thinks you 'll stop me now , you 's mistaken a mighty damn sight . Heah I goes . He sees the old man . Blubbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daid man ? Drawing back before his stare . Look at dem eyes ! Terrified . Yeh , Lawd in heaben , he 's come f'om de grave . He ai n't lak dem udder ghostes . I sees de purgin ' on his lips . Make way , make way , I 's gwine rise an ' fly . With a bound he is on the bed , and stepping on the edge of it , he springs up , but the satchel hangs between him and the wall , hindering his movements . He clings to a log and pants . How come I so heavy , cai n't lift myself up . Dat damn satchel in de way . Christ , I 's slipping back . His hands slip from the wall and he crashes down among the briars and debris of the bed . He stands up . I ai n't hurt , des ' jarred a bit . He springs out of the bed and lunges against the door , then claws at it . Moaning . Cai n't make it dere . I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbuckles the satchel . I 'll put dat long green in my shirt , den nothin ' to git in de way . He takes the satchel from his waist and buckles his belt tightly about him . Why n't I think o ' dat befo ' ? He opens the satchel and with eager hands pulls out a package wrapped in loose brown paper . She 's heavy , must be lot o ' gol ' an ' silver in it , too . He undoes the package and holds up a stone . His eyes almost start from his head . Whut 's dis , whut 's dis ! He seizes the satchel and feels in it , then throws it from him . Screaming . Dat Boll-Weevil robbed me ! Crying out in a loud voice . Whah 's my money ! whah 's my money ! He 's tuk it an ' hid it ! Seizing the stone . Gim me back my money , damn you , or I 'll beat you into sass . He springs across the room and towers above the dead BOLL-WEEVIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spit out , whah is she ? Lowering his arm . He cai n't answer you , nigger . He 's daid , daid as a do ' nail . Sobbing . Oh , you li'l devil ! why n't I look in dat bag ' fo ' I cut yo ' haid off ? He hurls the stone against the lifeless body and stands beaten and helpless in the middle of the room . Then he falls down on the pile of firewood , moaning and beating his forehead with his fist . He lays hold of a small stick of wood and sits thinking . Suddenly he springs up , brandishing the stick . Dat li'l v'lise was conjured . ' Twa n't Boll-Weevil done it , ' t was dem ha'nts . Glaring at the motionless specters . Gi'me back my money ! Threateningly . You 's gut it hid somewhahs , better tell me , better tell me ! They eye him silently . Do n't move , uh ? ' Y God , I 'll churn you into butter . He moves towards them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yell he springs forward , and whirling his stick above his head , brings it down on the IRON-FACED-MAN . It passes through him as if he were smoke , and he fades away . Jubilantly . I tol ' you I 'd smash you up . One gone . He strikes at the MOONACK , who also disappears in the shadows at the right . Two of ' em . He rushes from one to the other , fighting and cursing . In a moment he stands alone in the room , panting and wiping his face . I reckon I gut de best o ' dem devils . Dat 's somethin ' foh one nigger to do . Now I clambs out th'ough de roof . Looking around on the floor . But I cai n't leave my money . It 's heah somewhah in dis room . I 'll find it . Looking at the fire around the pot . Dat fi ' burn cu'ious . I 'll smash dat pot ! He starts forward with his stick raised , then stops . I gut to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put out de fi ' when I gits my kale . He falls on his knees and begins crawling among the vines and brambles , all the while talking to himself . Rise , dollars , show yo'self . You 's boun ' to be heah . While he is searching , a little old ragged Negro woman , wearing a slat-bonnet pulled down over her face , appears in the room and begins stirring the pot . She stops stirring and raises her fleshless hands above her head in an incantation . As she brings them down , a low rumble of thunder sounds in the distance . BLUE-GUM raises his head and listens . Ha , thunder ! Dat 's good . Come a big rain an ' I 's safe from de bloodhoun 's . He turns again to his searching , and the old woman resumes her stirring . After a moment she raises her hands again . A louder rumble of thunder sounds in answer to her summons . Sho ' is a storm rising aw right . Hot enough foh somethin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrubs . The wind moans in the trees outside . He scratches in the bushes and overturns pieces of plank . Dat win ' do soun ' lak lost speerits cryin ' . The old woman raises her hands again , and a louder roll of thunder responds . Dat storm comin ' nigher , thank God ! I 'll take it easy , mebbe stay heah till day or git dat money back . Sitting on his haunches and thinking . Oh , I cai n't think foh my po ' haid . Lemme see . Dat satchel was opened whiles I wo n't lookin ' . Dem ha'nts ai n't flesh an ' blood . Dey could n't tuk it . Yessuh , dat Boll-Weevil slipped dat money out an ' hid it heah , figur'n ' to come back an ' git it later . I 'll fin ' it , an ' dey wo n't be no splittin ' it up . He cautiously approaches BOLL-WEEVIL 'S body and rolls it over . Must be heah somewhah in dis corner , dat 's whah he sot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine , lak a stuck hog ! The OLD WOMAN picks up the open satchel and fastens it to her belt . Thought I heard a jinglin ' sound . He turns and gasps . Whah 'd dat ol ' ' oman come from ? Standing up . Who 's you ? She makes no response and goes on with her stirring . What 's she stirrin ' in dat pot ? Backing behind the willow clump . Dat dress an ' bonnet 's gone from de wall yonder . She 's gut ' em on . Whining . Aunt Mahaly , is dat you , come back to ha'nt po ' Blue-Gum Ed ? Is you ? The only reply she makes is to raise her arms again above her head . This time there is a flash of lightning seen through the crack in the door , followed by a heavy crash of thunder . BLUE-GUM stands watching her breathlessly . Muhcy , her han 's is nothin ' but white bone ! Whut 's she up to ? Dat thunder an ' lightnin ' seem to be answerin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A nearer crash responds . God a'mighty , she 's bringin ' a storm down on dis house . The wind begins to roar . I cai n't leave heah now , dat 's a harrycane comin ' th'ough de swamp . Whut kin I do ! Whut kin I do ! He raises his head . Whut 's she doin ' wid dat satchel ? As if in answer to his question , she reaches into it and pulls out a frog by one leg and throws it into the pot . Aunt Mahaly ! Aunt Mahaly ! Oh , she 's makin ' her witch soup to destroy me wid ! She pulls out a wriggling lizard and casts it into the pot and goes on stirring . The wind blows louder . He shivers and watches her with open mouth . She pulls out a snake and throws it into the pot . A crash of thunder jars the ground . He cries out . Aunt Mahaly , don ' put no mo ' in dat pot . Do n't destroy me wid thunder an ' lightnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases . BLUE-GUM moans and rocks on the ground and a wild glazed look begins to creep into his eyes . He sits with his back to the old witch . She throws a rat in . He starts as if a pain had caught him . His tongue hangs from his mouth , and he gasps for breath . The storm increases . He cries out in a high quavering voice . Do n't put dat spell on me , do n't conjure me ! He falls to sobbing . She pulls out several small bones and throws them in . BLUE-GUM squeals in pain , never once looking around . The wind and thunder gather in violence . Lawd have muhcy ! Have muhcy , Lawd . Save me ! save me ! She pulls out a dead man 's hand , hairy and pale , and throws it in . He springs off the ground as if convulsed in unbearable pain . The storm grows louder , with thunder and lightning crashing among the trees . His voice rises into a scream . He'p ! he'p , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell on me ! He pitches forward on his face , his hand falling on the stick of wood . His fingers feel it , and gradually close around it . The OLD WOMAN stirs the pot and begins circling it . BLUE-GUM crawls to his knees , holding the stick in his hand . Slowly he staggers to his feet . His eyes are insane with hate and fear . He foams at the mouth . Laughing wildly , he starts towards her . Hee-hee  --  I 'll beat you into de dirt wid my stick . As he comes across the floor , her face is turned towards him . He snarls . You 's a skeletum . I sees you . Hee-hee ! At a sign from the old witch woman the GOBLINS rise again out of the shadows and stand around the room . A moment of enlightenment sets BLUE-GUM crazy with fear and he springs like a cat to the right wall and begins climbing to the roof , all the time champing and foaming at the mouth like a wild animal . AUNT MAHALY makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her stick . She points towards BLUE-GUM , and as if struck by sudden paralysis , he falls with a thud to the floor , and rolls out into the circle . With a slow step that gradually increases in time , the GOB-LINS begin to walk around his prostrate form , AUNT MAHALY going before and the procession ending with the LITTLE GIRL . At a movement of the OLD WOMAN 'S stick , BLUE-GUM sits up . He begins mumbling and laughing as they go around him . The storm grows in intensity as the marchers increase their time , BLUE-GUM 'S singing and mumbling , rising with it . A man dressed in a palm-beach suit , carrying a small satchel , joins the procession . A wide blood-stain spreads out from his heart downward . BLUE-GUM shouts out in a crazy slobbering voice. p. 24 BLUE-GUM ED Ai n't you daid , white man , ai n't you daid ? Whah 's my knife ? He 's gut money in dat satchel . With fascinated eyes he watches them going by him . Gim me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a weak movement to rise and then falls back to the floor , clapping his hands in time with the marchers . BOLL-WEEVIL , with his head hanging on his shoulder and his throat cut wide across , comes out of the corner and begins marching behind the WHITE MAN . The marchers increase their pace , the storm grows louder , and BLUE-GUM 'S laughing and chanting rise shriller . BLUE-GUM ED Hi-yee  --  hi-yee  --  hi-yee ! Hee  --  hee  --  hee  --  Hi-yee  --  hi-yee  --  hi-yee ! Hee  --  hee  --  hee ! By this time the marchers are whirling by . Suddenly the GOBLINS stand still and AUNT MAHALY raises her hands . The room is filled with a blinding light and a terrific explosion . With a shriek , BLUE-GUM springs in the air and falls flat on his back , and lies still . The light dies away from the pot , and the room is filled with darkness . The wind and storm die away . Presently voices are heard outside . The door is pushed open and two figures are discerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . DEPUTY That bolt of lightning struck near here . By Jees , that was a sudden storm ! p. 25 SHERIFF It 's growing quiet now , no use going in . We 're already wet . DEPUTY Let 's git in from under them trees . A limb blow against us an ' our tale 'd be told . He steps into the room , turning his flash-light about . Heigh , looka here ! SHERIFF What is it ? The DEPUTY pulls his pistol and comes up to BLUE-GUM 'S body . DEPUTY Great God ! Watch out , here lies Blue-Gum dead as a nit . SHERIFF Coming gingerly in . Well sir , there he is . DEPUTY Turning his light about . Here 's something else . He discovers BOLL-WEEVIL 'S body . Boll-Weevil over here in the corner dead , too . SHERIFF With his pistol in his hand . The damnedest come-off I 've ever heard of . DEPUTY Picking up the satchel . Here 's the money , and that 's not so bad . He opens the satchel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the feel . His flash-light reveals a package of bills . SHERIFF Killed each other fighting over it , I bet . Let 's get out and shoot a few times , and holler for the fellows . He runs out at the rear and fires his pistol off , yelling , " Hoo-ah ! " Answering halloos sound down in the swamp.
