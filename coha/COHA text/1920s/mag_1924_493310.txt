The Most Important Book THE most important book in the world is that many-volumed anthology which gave us all our first ? and most of as our only ? taste of literature . The School Reader ranks even the Bible and Shakespeare . For it includes selections from both ; and it is learned practically by heart , with profound conviction , at their most impressionable age , by millions who never again read anything but newspapers . The compiler of such a book is a sort of literary Jesuit . Give him the moulding of a child 's mind for the first six years , and he cares not who his successors may be . His work can never be undone . The best start that literature can have in its race for immortality ? or at least for life ? is admittance to the School Reader . Consider poetry , for example . The Reader bards remain the sole bards of the masses . And even with the cultivated they win an unwarranted initial advantage . The Longfellows of literature , people divinely ordained for school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , with no other weapons than their foot-rules , non-juvenile s ge inrs , like Browning , of thrice their calibre . One Ella Wheeler Wilcox can repulse squadrons of Edwin Arlington Robinsons . Their strength is as the strength of ten because of the most important book in the world . Not that the souls of babes are always transfigured with enthusiasm for the school book versifiers . But when , in maturity , their poems come back to mind , gilding the very substantial pleasure of recognition with the glamour that now envelops far-off childhood , and adding perhaps the sentiment of dear and even sacred associations , they gain an advantage with us , specious perhaps , but inore powerful than almost any other ? more powerful often than that of extraordinary merit itself . In the appreciation of poetry , as of all the arts , there are few mightier forces than the pleasure of recognition . It lends value to such devices as refrain , alliteration and rhyme . Working on another plane , it glamours the recollected past . How often , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose of criticism , do we appreciate that p.m , not only at its full value , but at a little more ? We forget to allow for the artificial radiance shed upon it by circumstance . The scones etched upon our youthful minds by the Reader eon easily win a lifelong advantage over reality itself . What current of dirty water creeping sluggishly under bridges infested by Italian beggars , may ever become for us so convincingly " Tiber , Father Tiber " as the fantastic crystal torrent wherein the eyes of our young fancy beheld the brave Horatius plunge , under the maledictions of false Sextus , and the encouragement of that excellent sportsman , Lars Forsena ? Impelled by such considerations , and by a real curiosity to learn who were the literary . Mellins and Nestles of my infancy , I advertised in the Publishers ' Weekly for a complete set of the Readers used in the schools of Cleveland during my early youth . They proved to be Appleton 's , reinforced by Sheldon 's Fifth . The first thrill of recognition came from the blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimless way of a child with a Fly-leaf , had been scribbled up by hands unknown . True to the instinct of youth , their owners ' names , printed by liberally moistened pencils , sprawled in block letters along the closed edges of the leaves . And the fatter volumes were extra-illustrated with exactly the same iris-colored transfer pictures of beasts , men and gads with which I once beautified nay own books . In the slender First Reader I found nothing familiar but the inevitable opening illustration of C-A-T , and the neatly moral tale of The Little Red Hen , who so early inculcated the advantages of that national initiative and zealous attention to brisii ness which has been characterized by Louise Irnogrn Cuiney as Hustlerium Tremens sive Americanitis . I recognized little in the next two volumes . They were filled with anonymous pap , mechanically turned out by horny-tr , inded sons of literary toil , and calculated to insult the intelligence of any self-respecting eight-year-old . But the Fourth began wish that memorable thing of Benjamin Franklin 's about paying too dear for your whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They greeted me after all the years like steadfast friends . Here were real stories about worthwhile people like Gulliver and Grace Darling , Robinson &Mae; and Paul Revere . And voila , the first bit of verse I. ever learned by heart : " The stag at eve had drunk his fill . " Soon memory seems to have attained its scored wind and to have " committed " almost every potful it met . Here were the " mournful humbers " and the " barefoot boy " and the " spreading an d tree " for whose exclusive appreciation , es Mr. Cori Van Doren explains , youth is so fatally prepared by the protozoic metrical scheme of Mather Goo , It is cheering to find that the more artificial poems are not so well remembered , as where Bryant elegantly talks of " the too potent fervors " when he means the heat , and states that under its : nibs ence the clover " declines its blooms . " But , turtling to The Mariner 's Dream by Dimond , my pride bites the dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious days of youth I could see nothing either funny or unpoetic about a sphere groaning or an angel flapping . The worst of it was , our teachers said this sort of thing was good poetry . And doubtless the vast majority of as still consider it so . I think that a certain bit of astronomic doggerel out of the Third Reader once struck me with a more profound and pleasurable conviction than its adult version by Kipling does today . The new moon was to be used as a cradle : At eight this was as attractive as , ten years later . I found the proposal to inhabit a " separate star " and " a golden chair , " and " splash at a seven-league canvas with brushes of cornet 's hair . " Indeed , so strong is the persistent sorcery of childish impression , that at times one must consciously exert the muscles of maturity in order not to put the little red hen in the same proud coop with Chanticleer . Here and there in the Reader gleams a specimen of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our childhood . This is a gem from J. G. Holland : In the department of humor , as well , we were wronged with slap-stick stuff like Confessions of a Bashful Man . He treads on his host 's gouty toe , sheds ink on the carpet , and wipes it up with his handkerchief . At dinner , having knocked over everything within reach , he burns his mouth with pudding , inflames it with brandy and absent-mind. edly mops his streaming face with his inky handkerchief . Exit amid howls of laughter . Not that the Reader was wholly devoid of true humor . For example , it inoculated one of my comrades so thoroughly with selections from Alice in Wonderland that the habit of quoting her on all occasions has persisted . To this day he is sometimes accused of speaking with Alice aforethought . These battered volumes recall an emotion long forgotten , the rapture of getting a new Reader . With what disgusted relief its too familiar predecessor was flung aside ! With what greedy gusto was the near book gobbled up from frontispiece to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the despair with which we recognized that the new volume 's resources were now exhausted as well , and that we faced another year of nauseatingly familiar diet . The most repulsive were stories like The Bursting of Ouseley Dam and The Prairie on Fire , after their full-puffed tire of suspense had been punctured and flattened by the tacks of repetition . The monotony was maddening . We wretched youngsters were prisoners behind bookish bars , condemned for mental exercise to count the cracks in the cell walls . After the first three weeks the illustrations were even more repellant than the text . The picture people of those days had dead white paper faces , monstrous eyes and silly , microscopic mouths . They were the real melodrama of illustration , the sort of art you find surviving on the news stands of today in the naive ladies of The Police Gazette . Such art was not calculated to furnish pleasure , even to children , for for days a week , world without end . Surely my misunderstanding of a little fun by John Godfrey Saxe entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction ( which died all too late ) that China was a wholly farcical plate . I believe this poem was the first and only thing I read about the land of Confucius while in grammar school . I was thereby convinced that all its people had gashes for eves , noses of only two dimensions , club feet , nails " like an eagle 's claws , " pigtail , that swept the ground ; and trick names like " Great Hang-yu and You-be-Hung . " I felt sure that all Chinese ladies smoked pipes and devoured their pet poodles for lunch , and that every Chinese gentleman murdered his numerous wives in rotation , for which offence One sounders whether such misconceptions as these have not been fostered by the textbook of other nations as well . Are Chinese infants , for example , ever filled with equally fantastic notions about US ? It would be poetic justice if some Saxe of the far East were allowed to bias tender Mongolian minds by putting into their Readers , as the sole information about America , some such dog- gerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this our wiser day is vastly superior . Bathos and sentimentality have flown . Nothing more is heard of the flapping of death-angels , or dew-drops on little Charley 's hair . The slap-stick has ceased from slapping . Foreign lands are not solely represented by nonsense verses , and some of our best artists furnish the excellently reproduced illustrations . Supplementary reading has scotched the snake of monotony . No longer is this the worst hated of all books . But even so , it is not good enough . To live up . to its unparalleled opportunities it should be the best compiled book in the world . No expenditure of brains and time and treasure would be disproportionate to secure this result . We might set some such machinery in motion as Mr. H. G. Wells advocates for the making of his proposed Bible of Civilization . It would merely mean an editorial board of two or three hundred of the most brilliant living minds , backed by a fund of thirty or forty million dollars for salaries , printing and propaganda . Bearing in mind the Wellsian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of a race between education and catastrophe , eve might see whether the most important book in the world could not be made the best book in the world .
