ARMY &; NAVY <P> Watchers on the mountains above happy Honolulu descried a blur , then some blotches , then a forest , then an armada on the cobalt southern horizon of Hawaii . It was the U. S. battle fleet , 82 ships strong , steaming to Honolulu and Pearl Harbors for spring maneuvers . On the way out from California , an " enemy " had been met and adroitly disposed of . Now , nearing shore , the great fleet moved in circumspect battle formation , a giant circle of ships with the dreadnaughts in the centre , the cruisers in the perimeter and the carrier Langley out ahead releasing planes to scout far ahead for lurking trouble . <P> The battle fleet was to maneuver off to Oahu and out of Lahaina Roads until mid-June , then plow back across the Pacific to the home continent .
