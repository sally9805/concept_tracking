Originated as a patriotic order , the Society of Tammany in Manhattan makes a great to-do over Independence Day . On that day last week the city 's Democratic politicians crowded into their hall to hear New York 's Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt call for a new " Declaration of Independence " against " Centralized Industrial Control " in the form of corporation mergers . <P> Said Governor Roosevelt : " The huge mergers and consolidations . . . are challenging in their power the very government itself . The influence of huge trusts , with their almost unlimited resources , will be felt in this country . . . . Their power will have to be combated . . . . " <P> To his hearers the Roosevelt warning sounded like a political war-cry for 1932 , the posing of an economic , instead of moral , issue on which democracy might unite . <P> Tammanyites hailed their Governor as a new leader , cheered him as " our next President .
