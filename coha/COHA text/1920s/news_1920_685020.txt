txt Those to whom wealth is no novelty do not need to be told how little of personal enjoyment it can really buy . In fact , if it can not buy service its chief personal use ceases . It can be accumulated to buy power . But it does not matter , in point of persorial comfort , to the man whose cook has gone out and taken the other servants with her that his only other worry is the surtax in his income-tax return . His discomfort is just as great as any other man 's ? indeed greater , because he is less accustomed to fend for himself in the small necessities of life . The more magnificent a man 's mansion is the greater the staff of servants he requires to keep it habitable . The more his fancy turns to costly pictures and well-assorted bric-a-brac the more help he requires for the mere dusting of those objects of art , to say nothing of their protection from burglary or fire . In any case he is at the mercy of what the Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King 's enemies " . Destruction , like death , loves a shining mark , and he is up to be shot at . MERE MONEY SECONDARY It is a common mistake to suppose that Wall Street loves money for its own sake . Men like Cecil Rhodes , Edward H. Harriman and James J. Hill  --  all of these , as the present witness can testify , simple and democratic in their tastes  --  want money because it is the imperfect but necessary instrument in the work they have set themselves to do . Whether loyal service , comfort and freedom from those petty worries so destructive in the aggregate , go with it , these men will always tend to accumulate or control large volumes of capital because they translate it not into terms of bodily gratification , like the little man who ignorantly envies them , but into terms of power . Under conditions of service remarkably general at this time the man earning large wages , with the assurance that thorough knowledge of his craft gives , need not envy John D. Rockefeller , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforts the richest of us enjoys . Like Mr. Rockefeller , he can only sleep in one bed at once . If he wants to change his clothes three times a day he adds that much to his cares , and soon gets tired of the ability to display his variety of attire . WHAT THE WORKER . HAS He can have as good pictures as the late H. C. Frick , and certainly many more , without the trouble of taking care of them . If he loves art the Metropolitan Museum is open to him daily . He has access to books the millionaires do not possess . ' There is nothing they can do that can prevent him from sharing to the full in the enjoyment of scenery . lie has no concern in the upkeep of the scenery , and can disport himself at a price leaving change out of a dollar , in Central Park or the Palisades .

This worker is as nearly independent as anyone may be or should be . Why should he concern himself if cooks leave without notice , with the invited dinner guests waiting in the drawing room ? There was a king of old whose wise men told him that he could overcome his melancholy if he could find the happiest man in his kingdom and wear his shirt . His messenger searched far and wide , and at last the glad tidings came : " We have found the happy man . " The king instantly telegraphed : " Send his shirt . " Alas ! the prepaid answer was : " He has n't got one . " Thrice happy worker ! His wife is his cook , and how some of us envy him ! " RUES THE DREGS COMIC TO ' rim SLUFACE A French philosopher said that conditions , not only in France but elsewhere in Europe before the revolution of 1789 , laid down the principle that most of mankind were born with saddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride them . But in any condition of society there will be some who need service , some who by wise rule can command service , a large number fitted for service , with some of them still proud of serving well and grateful for affectionate appreciation . There is nothing new about an upheaval which for the time at least , has brought the dregs to the surface . The man of restricted means may well chafe at paying an incompetent general maidservant $50 a month , with her board and lodging thrown in  --  the only-trade , in fact , which is paid for learning its business . These thiiigs will right themselves . Shakespeare , in " As You Like It " , spoke of the service of an older day in terms of regret . It would be easy to make the mistake of supposing that a thing honorable in itself , service , has progressively deteriorated . The world moves in cycles , and optimists like to think these ascend in spirals , like a winding staircase . Is it unkind in these trying times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corkscrew ? DEGGARS ON HoitseinAcic Circumstances over which the richest among us have no control set an usually large number of beggars on horseback , and in spite of prohibition they are engaged in gleefully riding to the devil . " Sweet are the uses , of adversity . " The world might hare gone to the devil centuries ago if it were not for the truly civilizing influence of hard times . That is the indicated cure , unless the teaching of experience has become utterly empiric . But out of the confusion some voices are articulate . It is probable the country can even survive prosperity , although prosperity has ever been our severest test . Supporting people who work only with their mouths is one of the most costly luxuries it . engenders . But Wall Street , which means the financial , commercial and industrial thought of the country , its brain center . is learning valuable lessons . and most of us can bear with equanimity for a time the discomforts of the merely rich . Maximum prices and minimum wages are both bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our conception of u natural minimum wage was too low ; that ef ; ficiency point lies somewhere between the fringe of starvation and the ransom wages extorted regardless of the value of the worker 's product . EFFICIENCY POINT iN WAGES Roughly formulated , this minimum may be taken as representing not merely a living wage , but a balance over for comfort and thrift . Certainly a workman 's efficiency is impaired  --  using the word " workman " in a broad sense which would include every employe in Wall Street ? if he has no margin for saving . He is at the mercy of the chapter of accidents , and , to name only one terrible public loss , the amount saved in exploiting him is a premium upon race suicide . He can not afford to have babies if he can not reckon doctor 's bills in his budget .

We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a thousand other ways . New York pays absolutely unskilled labor something like a dollar an hour for snow removal , and never was the task worse performed . The famine of unskilled labor , in fact , is the most serious industrial problem before the country today . We shall be lucky indeed if it does not grow worse instead of better . As likely as not the foreign element , drawn from southern Italy and eastern Europe , living voluntarily in its customary squalor in order to save the more , will take what looks like wealth in Calabria back to countries where there is no moral obliquity about taking a drink . OUR NEWLY RICH Perhaps our newly rich class , and this includes work . men in the steel trade who arc actually making as much as $15,000 a year , has been a principal cause of what may be called the revolt of domestic service .

Without respect there is no service worth the name . To conic back to our text , service is something which money alone can not buy .
