The Klan fight by no means ended at the Democratic Convention in Manhattan . Frank X. Schwab , who is not a steel man but Mayor of Buffalo and Supreme General of the Knights of St. John ( Catholic ) , addressed his order at a business session . Partly he denounced , partly he seemed to threaten . Said he : <P> " I want to ask you with all sincerity to advance with all your power the military department of our order . This department , I believe , is more essential now than ever . <P> " God only knows if the time is not coming when our country , as well as our Church , will have to be protected against the un-American organization which is now becoming so strong in this country . <P> " We have seen within the last ten days the power that they have already developed . They are working underhanded whenever an opportunity presents itself . They are not true Americans or they would not have to cover their faces , and they would let the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " <P> He also denounced " the six greatest evils " of the day . These , according to his enumeration , are : " Divorce , race suicide , the public dance halls ( ' some dances , ' said he , are ' soul-killing in the extreme ' ) , the narcotic-drug habit , the hip-pocket flask , and the automobile-brothel . " <P> The Klan would agree with him in denouncing all these objects , possibly qualifying the objurgation of divorce . The Klan probably would also be at one with Mayor Schwab on the question of " a strong military department . "
