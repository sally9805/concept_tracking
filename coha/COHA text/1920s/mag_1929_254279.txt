Journey 's End . The theatre 's ways are sometimes stranger than its plots . Some months ago the Kingston Rowing Club , a London suburban organization , found the Thames too cold for paddling and decided to put on a play by way of diversion . The club 's personnel is wholly masculine , so something special had to be written for the occasion . The members turned to R. C. Sherriff , one of their number , who had had " experience " in the Surrey Amateur Dramatic Society . <P> Sherriff , 32 , dark , slender , taciturn , was an insurance broker . He knew little of playwriting but he said he would try . The only drama he knew was the War . He had enlisted at 17 and emerged a second lieutenant . He sat down and wrote the story of a dugout in which he had lived . The play was produced . Friends said it was good . At their urging he sent it off to the London managers . One by one they turned it down . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the London Stage Society , a semiprofessional organization not unlike Manhattan 's Theatre Guild but more like Cleveland 's Playhouse . The Stagers produced it one Sunday evening at the Arts Theatre , where Maurice Browne , playwright and producer , saw it . A few weeks later he produced it in London 's West End . That was in late January . Today Journey 's End is London 's outstanding success . <P> Shortly after its opening , Producer Gilbert Miller attended a performance . When the final curtain descended he proceeded not to the street but to the producer 's office . It was 3 a.m. when he finally left . It had taken him all that time to negotiate successfully for the U.S. rights . He at once placed an English company in rehearsal , played it a week in a theatre in London , sailed with it for the U.S. The company rehearsed all the way over on the boat . The players reached New York early last week , rested a day , made their debut in Great Neck , L.I. , and , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of Journey 's End . The plot itself is not nearly so involved . It is a simple war story of ten men in a dugout during 36 hours that precede a German attack . Their reactions form the basis of the play . They snarl , they laugh , they fight , they cower , they die . Standing out among them is one who hopes for death . He has drowned cowardice with whiskey . He has nothing for which to live . On the eve of the attack there is sent to his company the brother of the girl he loves-the last person in the world he wants to see him . In the end it is the youngster , eager for life , who dies . The other goes out to face the attack . <P> It deals with elemental emotions , this play , with a simplicity that is devastating . It is as fine a series of psychological studies as one will find outside a casebook . And it has the added benefit of perfect interpretation .
