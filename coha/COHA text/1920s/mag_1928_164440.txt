In Berlin , last week , Professor Eugen Steinach , medical Ponce de Leon , announced his possible discovery of a glandular fountain of youth . Injecting pituitary serum into docile , doddering rats , he noticed that they grew hair , an appetite , and sprightliness . <P> Rejuvenator Steinach had previously sought his elixir in the germinal glands , which he now claims have a secretive alliance with the pituitary gland . That small , oval , reddish-gray body , appended to the brain , is made up of two separately active lobes . The rear one exudes a valuable drug , which has been ingeniously injected to speed heartbeat , to increase blood pressure , or to make muscles contract . It is used in cases of surgical shock , in obstetrics , after abdominal surgery . <P> Sex and body growth are influenced by the front pituitary lobe . Overactivity of the lobe causes sexual precocity , great stature , large hands and feet , culminating in the giant of the circus . Underactivity causes sexual retardation , small hands and feet , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steinach fed extracts of the anterior lobe to his rats . Normal people gradually growing old will take another look at the circus side shows produced by pituitary glands run riot , before they try to stop Nature 's course with Dr. Steinach 's serum .
