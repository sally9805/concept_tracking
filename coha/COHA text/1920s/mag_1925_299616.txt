Religion , like the Arts and Sciences , has to maintain itself upon a strictly economic basis . That means that its debts must be paid , its servants salaried that they may live . To do this , Religion has depended upon charity ; for it is not per se a business , least of all a profitable concern in terms of cash . <P> Two years ago , was built in Chicago the Temple- " Methodism 's skyscraper church . " On the ground floor is the First Methodist Episcopal Church : above are 20 floors of offices of which , according to a statement made by William W. Dixon , Secretary-Treasurer of the Chicago M. E. Church Aid Society , 81% have been rented . <P> The church-skyscraper was built by the Aid Society at a cost of $3,500,000 on property valued at $3,000,000 , bequeathed many years ago to the Methodist Church . This Church aims at self-support and at making a profit , which is to be divided among other Methodist churches . " From first to last , " explained the Secretary-Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on according to strict business principles . It was financed by a mortgage , not by small bonds sold to church members . It pays taxes at the same rate as regular commercial buildings . It has been rented not through any appeal to the loyalty of church members but be cause it offered good offices in a favorable location . The largest number of tenants are lawyers . " <P> Some church boards have rented offices . We have a Presbyterian book shop on one of the upper floors and a Methodist book shop on the first floor . One thing we do n't have in the building is a cigar store . We could have rented a corner for this purpose at $9,000 , but we preferred to rent it for a candy store for $3,000 less .
