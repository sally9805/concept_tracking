June 14 , 1925 <P> Sirs : <P> Again I besiege the walls of TIME in the quest of knowledge , with firm assurance that your reply will be as prompt and gratifying as in the past . <P> The other day , I heard , to my great sorrow , that the lovely Church of Ste. Anne de Beaupr outside of Quebec , Canada , was burned last year . Having always cherished a secret , and not altogether unfounded , desire to visit this church , I would like to know if you can give me ( but of course you can ) any details regarding the catastrophy and also any information you may know concerning the plans for the rebuilding of this delightful church ? <P> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent Monsieur Beaucaire ( TIME , June 1 ) , I cast aside such titles as Madame Bernhardt , Queen Elizabeth , etc. - and hasten to sign myself . <P> SHEILA O'CONNELL . <P> <P> Demolition .

Anne ; but , by the time that a special battalion of the Fire Department had arrived , by special train , from Quebec , the cathedral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubble . <P> Resurrection .

Its length will be 325 ft. , its steeples will tower 245ft. - ED . <P> <P> Paunch Indeed ! <P> Buffalo , N. Y. June 15 , 1925 <P> TIME New York , N. Y. <P> Sirs :
