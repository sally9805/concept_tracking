" Papa " Poincar 's majority was defeated in the general elections for the Chamber of Deputies . <P> For weeks the paid press of France has issued stories proving that the Premier was certain of a majority in the Thirteenth Legislature ( the new Chamber ) . The press of the whole world followed suit . Yet , the Premier 's parties lost ' heavily . Final results by leaders : <P> Poincar ( six parties ) 282 <P> Herriot 130 <P> Briand 104 <P> Painlev 39 <P> Communists .. 29 <P> Total 584 <P> This means that the present Opposition has a majority of 20 over the parties faithful to Poincar . Premier Poincar is to remain in power until June 2 , when the new Chamber of Deputies meets . The choice of a Premier to succeed " Papa " Poincar lay between MM . Herriot and Briand . Briand is the more popular , but Herriot heads the largest party , the Radical-Socialist group ( Bloc de Gauche ) . Many people thought that Poincar would attempt to get together a small majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most unlikely . <P> Not long ago President Millerand threatened to resign if the Bloc National were defeated . The transfer of some 100 votes to the Radicals and Socialists leaves the Bloc in a minority and critics were wondering if the President would carry out his threat . A Socialist rgime would in no way suit M. Millerand 's policy of active participation in governing France . <P> The Socialists under Herriot are not Communists and are of much the same tenor as are the British Laborites . Whatever reshuffling of power takes place , Poincar 's foreign policy with regard to Germany and the Dawes report is not likely to suffer appreciably . Poincar 's intransigeance will in all probability be dropped , but the essential points in his policy such as payment of reparations , guarantees , etc. , are certain to be retained . The real divergence of policy is in religious matters . The new Chamber is anti-clericalist in complexion and opposed to Bloc National 's policy of happiness with the Vatican . <P> Among the most noteworthy people who lost their seats : Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Interior Manoury , Len Daudet ( Royalist leader ) , General de Castelnau , " Saviour of Nancy , " Prince Murat , Sadi Lecointe ( aeronaut ) . <P> Notables elected : MM . Poincar , Herriot , Briand , Painlev ; Communists Marty and Cachin , the former of whom was convicted of treason and later pardoned ; ex-Minister of the Interior Malvy , once accused by ex-Premier Clemenceau of treason .
