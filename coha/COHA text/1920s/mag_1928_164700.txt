The meek , cowed Cabinet of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini met last week for the first time since he sensationally " rotated " ( dismissed ) Finance Minister Count Volpi and several other most distinguished statesmen ( TIME , July 16 , 23 ) . " My ministers are rotated , " explained Signor Mussolini to his ministers , " when each accomplishes a cycle of fecund activity . . . . The cycle of Count Volpi as Finance Minister was completed with the stabilization of the lira on a basis of gold . ... He has immortalized his name . " The new Finance Minister , Senator Antonio Mosconi , a Venetian aristocrat , was next informed that he is expected to immortalize his name rounding out a fecund cycle bounded by Six Points : 1 ) " Immutable maintainance of the present level of stabilization ( i lira equals $.0526 ) . " 2 ) Total curtailment of foreign borrowing by the State , plus drastic censorship of private Italian loan flotations abroad . 3 ) Stern coercion of Italian tax evaders and delinquents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . " 4 ) " Resolute avoidance of any increase in taxation . " 5 ) " Introduction of the most crystalline simplicity and clarity in all state accounts , so that each citizen , without the aid of metaphysics of accounting or computing machines , can read them and understand them . " 6 ) " Vigilant economy and inflexible refusal to authorize any economic enterprise not considered vital . " Clearly the stringency of this Six Point Cycle means that // Duce will not stop short of so-called " Wartime measures " to ensure the fiscal recovery of Italy and prompt payment of her war debts . Ceaseless and ever potent must be Finance Minister Mosconi 's fecund activity . Inspiring to him , last week , was the fact that Italy 's germinal grain fields are now sprouting and flourishing with an activity announced to promise bumper crops . So impetuously potent is the grain , this summer , that demands for agricultural laborers have reduced the number of Italians unemployed from 447,021 last January to 429,211 last month .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
