The end of Lent is a season of music ; composers , stirred by the most human and the most tragic story in the world , have written notes to sound its sadness or its glory . The greatest of all such music is The Passion of Our Lord according to St. Matthew , by Johann Sebastian Bach ; this , 199 years after it was heard for the first time , was twice performed last week in Manhattan by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra directed by Ossip Gabrilowitch . <P> There is no variation of critical opinion concerning the St. Matthew Passion . " The deepest expression of devotional feeling that the art of music affords , " is the description which critics attempt to elaborate . Lawrence Gilman , able critic of the N. Y. Herald-Tribune , mentioned " pages of sorrowful , solacing tenderness , with their transported beauty , their touching devoutness , their measureless humanity . . . . " <P> Gabrilowitch brought his musicians to Manhattan in two special trains of twelve cars each , with two baggage cars and four diners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his performances in a special mood of gravity and that they refrain from wearing bright colored clothes , lest there should be discord in the earnest surroundings of Holy Week , and lest the spell of a " musical masterpiece " be injured . Further , Mr. Gabrilowitch said this : " In all the years of my musical experience I have never found as much joy and inspiration in any artistic task as in the study and preparation of Bach 's St. Matthew Passion . The performance . . . represents the work of three consecutive years . . . . " <P> There was no variation of critical opinion concerning the performance which Conductor Gabrilowitch presented . The chorus , dressed in black , and the soloists , with a proper effort at perfection , voiced the humble and victorious sorrow of the music they were singing . The tricky imitations which alone delighted its first auditors , the vocal echo of a cock 's crowing , were of course not emphasized . The score had been shortened from four and a half hours of playing time to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emendations had been wisely effected .
