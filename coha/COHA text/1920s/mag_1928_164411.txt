To open staid , conservative news organs and find the nose of the King-Emperor repeatedly referred to as a " snoot " has given Londoners a delicious , titillating thrill of sacrilege these many months . The sacrilege was last week not only permissible but even laudable because the London press was exulting at the slap administered by Chicago voters , to their blatantly anti-British Mayor , William Hale Thompson ( see p. 11 ) . Since Mayor Thompson invented and began the game of calling the nose of George V a snoot , the dignified and conservative London Morning Post permitted itself to gloat , last week : " Evidently the self-respect of Chicago has tired of being made a byword and laughingstock by its present Mayor . It has told him in effect that it is his own snoot rather than King George 's that needs to be kept out of the city . But though notice has been served of dismissal , yet , for some months the world may still hope to be entertained by the antics and extravagances of the champion buffoon whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Write me down an ass . ' " <P> Meanwhile the Liberal Star expressed " amazement at the orgy of violence which marked Chicago 's municipal elections , " and the blatant Daily Mail gave the impression that every Chicagoan who voted did so in imminent peril of being bombed . Even factual Times cried emotionally that " in Chicago every man 's hand seems to be raised against his fellow and the preponderating mass of law-abiding citizens is almost powerless to check the orgy of violence . " <P> Finally the Conservative Daily Telegraph ably summed up London 's reaction to Chicago thus : " Scenes like these have never occurred in Europe within the mem ory of the living , and could n't possibly occur . We are looking at a social organization which has united the riches and luxury of the most modern civilization with the manners and customs of particularly disorderly mining camps .
