A battered pontoon , found floating last week off the Fugloe Islands , north of Norway , was taken to be conclusive evidence that Capt . Roald Amundsen , Capt . Rene Gilbaud and their four companions were dead . The condition of the pontoon indicated that it had been torn from Capt . Amundsen 's seaplane by a sea crash . <P> Capt . Amundsen set out on June 18 to rescue Gen. Umberto Nobile , Italian Polar Pilgrim , whom he thoroughly detested . Gen. Nobile , saved by others , was reported last week at Milan and later at Rome to be suffering a high fever .
