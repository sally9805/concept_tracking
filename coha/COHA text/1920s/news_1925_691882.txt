txt With the rails being bought by other railroads or for the account of other railroads , a situation is created that can prove painful for the average trader . This has been demonstrated in the past . When a railroad has bought 40% of the stock of another road at -a reasonable average , it can afford to pay an extravagant price for the remaining 115 ' , - needed for control , and a'great deal more than an individual investor or speculator can afford to pay . If buying at the top is hazardous , however , it is nothing compared to the risk.of selling short much below the top . There has probably been more talk of railroad buying in recent months than actual buying , but there certainly has been sonic . New York Central and Baltimore &; Ohio have increased their holdings to actual control of Reading , while Central and ttfe Loree interests have been Eompetitive buyers of Lehigh Valley . Kansas City Southern interests have been large- buyers of Katy . and Rock Island has acquired a -- large interest in Cotton Belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the buying has been of a nature that might properly be described us a " fight for control . " The experience of shorts in Northern Pacific is a hackneyed story , but it is worth mention at this time . Selling around 150 and paying $4 , the stock attracted many shorts . Then came the corner , with the result ' hat it sold on May 9 , 1901 , for " cash " at 1.000 . Union Pacific buying in 1905 sent New York Central to ** Illinois Central to 183 and Chicago &; North Western common to 249 . The next year the preferred of the latter sold at 270 . Great Northern , before h it distributed its ore properties , sold at 335 in 1905 . New Haven sold a 255 in 1902 and ruled around or above 200 for years . Three of these roads have gone down hill , but New York Central and Illinois Central are worth more than they were in 1905 , and no one is safe in predicting that North Western and New Haven will not come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the rails at the top , but it could not be nearly as expensive as selling the wrong ones at the wrong time .
