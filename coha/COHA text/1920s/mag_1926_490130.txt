The Boys in Blue AFULL decade has romped past since the death of Mr. Anthony Comstock . A pale and somewhat wistful ghost of his passionate self has survived him , and it still , betimes , goes through the motions of his thunderous gestures . But the thunder itself seems to have rolled away . And if the signs may he believed , the reform movement in New York has about petered out . If such is indeed the fact , we have behind us a distinct and unique era , complete with beginning and middle and ( apparently ) end . And any era is amusing after it is safely gone , even though it he such a fantastic one as that . Before we hoist too much sail , however , on the hypothesis that the thing is really over , pray let us inspect the present case of the reformers . During Comstock 's life , his strange and dynamic personality was practically all there was to the movement he instituted . The purity cult itself was known by his name . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's more , for getting the judges to sit hard on the offenders thereof . The property that was destroyed under his hand was estimated by himself at more than $6,000 , o0o . And he personally saw to it that something more than 5,000 individuals were carted off to jail . This robust tradition was inherited by Mr. John S. Sumner , who became the priest of the pureboys at once when his master died . But the vein of honest brass that ran through the Comstock lode did not persist with Sumner . Almost immediately , he subdued his own identity under the unwieldy name of his organization : The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice . And after a fitful effort to imitate the methods of his Messiah , he began a gradual retreat , which leaves him at present practically imprisoned in his little office , plucking up enough courage now and then to howl plaintively at some violation or other of the Comstock code . But , nearly every time he does that , he is forced to admit defeat , and creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you can , Anthony Comstock allowing himself to sleep while the " Shanghai Gesture " or " Lulu Belle " beat their tomtoms on Broadway ! He would have wrecked the oriental bordello of Madame Godelam with his own personal axe , and demanded the applause of the audience into the bargain . And Lulu Belle would have been sent peremptorily to Sing Sing , without even the chance of an argument . Imagine Anthony Corn-stock willing to occupy the same world with Mr. Earl Carroll ! What a frenzy he would have been driven to by the producer 's nude ladies . And his frenzy would have been contagious ? at least as far as the magistrates ' courts  --  where he would have compelled them , by simple force of his iron personality , to carry out his will . Comstock would have been driven to desperation by the prurient devices of Mr. Bern arr M ac fad-den 's porno-Graphic , and by the same gentleman 's True Stories magazine , despite the five ministers of Heaven who sit upon itscouncils . We would still be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' legs , if the old lion were yet alive . But Mr. Sumner is no such thoroughgoing fellow . A defeat or two in the courts , and he slipped wearily into the relatively simple task of keeping the publication of " Only a Boy " and " Her Wedding Night " down to a minimum . During the Last three years , for example , he has brought about the suppression of but one dramatic production and two books . Nobody cared when he caused the withdrawal of the " God of Vengeance " because it was a dull and sordid thing . The books he suppressed were Frank Harris 's " Memoirs " and Maxwell Bodenheim 's " Replenishing Jessica " . A score of other books , as violently unrepressed , escaped him . Now it is easy to say that Mr. Sumner has failed to carry out the tradition of Comstock for the simple reason that people have more sense and refuse to have their entertainment ordered by fanatics . But in Comstock 's days  --  only a dozen years ago  --  people had quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , under the astonishing furore of his bellowing , people lost what sense they had . He had the power , as all great crusaders must have , of infecting those about bins with his zealotry . Where this quality is most essential , and where Mr. Stunner 's lack of it is most fatal to his cause , is in the courts . The same judges who used to listen breathlessly to Comstock , arid send his captives off to the chain gang , go to sleep when Sumner is about , and turn his captives free . The same laws that Comstock placed in the statutes during his lifetime are there now . But since death removed him , the Supreme Courts have decided that the laws no longer mean what they used to With Comstock gone , in short , the Supreme Court 's interpretation of his laws has made it almost impossible to convict any sort of book or play except the most flagrant and impudent kind . It was almost impossible , in Comstock 's presence , to be rational concerning sex and the related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is this state of affairs which led me , in the beginning , into the belief that the age of reform is over  --  until another zealot of equal fire comes along and starts a new one . CONSIDERING the matter as history , then , it is quite a lot of fun to look over old Anthony 's early days . Perhaps it was an ironic fate which used the mechanism of two mad dogs to start the reformer off on his career . He was living , in 1862 , in Winnepauk , Conn. , and already had displayed the quality of his genius by creeping through a saloon window , while yet in his ' teens , and knocking the bungs from the whiskey and cider barrels . But it was the mad dogs which gave him the chance to carry his banner of moral improvement out into the world . He was opening his shop one morning in spring , when a frantic Irish woman rushed past , shrieking " Mad Dog ! " Dropping to his knees for a moment in prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keg , and dashed out . The village street was empty , except for a small terrier dog that was stirring the dust in the distance as it merrily chased its tail . Reconnoitering first from the branches of a handy tree , he approached the beast and killed it with three rather nervously aimed shots . He was still praying beside the body when a group of school children hurried up with the news that another mad dog was terrorizing their playground . Young Anthony went to the scene , but one sight of the raging animal sent him flying to the safety of a barn . Neighbors killed the dog . Yet , with traditional injustice in the bestowing of fame , the town credited Anthony with the slaughter of both beasts , and rewarded him accordingly . With a few well-chosen words on the post office steps , the town banker presented a five dollar gold piece to the hero . Anthony had heard vaguely of the modern Babylon at the mouth of the Hudson , and made it his dream that one day he would go there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hard to get . With his prize for heroism now safely in his pocket , however , he set out . And a few years later , in the full glory of umbrella , gaiters , mutton chop whiskers and stove-pipe hat , he burgeoned forth as the savior of the metropolis . Carrie Nation and her hatchet had not yet come to town . The Bowery boy , with his skin tight trousers and bowler hat was still a figure . And the brightly lighted Bowery itself was the Mecca of Wall Street clerks and servant girls on their night out . According to the quaint custom of the day , barbers , poolroom proprietors and second-hand book men carried on a sideline trade in genuine " Parisian " pictures  --  generally ladies in tights . Upon these gentlemen first fell the wrath of the scourge from Winnepauk . Within six weeks , he boasted a collection of 7,00o photos of blondes in tights , and his tiny office looked like a booking office . This first work was carried on , through the arrangement of Morris K. Jessup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. But the association members soon tired of hurrying to court to witness against petty offenders , and asked Mr. Comstock to seek other affiliations . To convince the world , then , of his determination , Comstock issued his first " Confidential Report  --  Destroy When Read " . It contained more than one snappy reproduction from the collection of pictures , and several rather juicy paragraphs of text . The money poured in , with requests for all future issues . He had himself appointed a postal inspector , and after sending orders under an assumed name to firms dealing in supposedly improper literature , he received their wares and had them arrested . He promised a woman , whose sole estate was the copper plate engravings for a questionable book , $450 for the privilege of destroying them in public . Then he intercepted the van bringing the plates to his office , and destroyed them for nothing . He sent circular letters to every man that he jailed , extolling the beauties of brotherly love . He saw to it that his name was in the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street attack to bring it off . Take away , then , the melodramatic fanfaronade of the Comstock era , and this is all that is left : His 5 , o0o victims spent a grand total of 623 years in jail . Untold quantities of suggestive pictures were taken out of the hands of truck drivers and placed in the hands of school teachers and ministers . Of the 276 confidential reports he issued , a number are valuable items on the lists of pornographia callectQrs . The only two significant works ever suppressed by his society were Dreiser 's " Sister Carrie " , and Cabal 's " Jurgen " , and it was but a short time before the courts ruled the suppression WaS improper .
