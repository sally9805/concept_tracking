Aimee Rises from the Sea S I PREDICTED two years ago , th-e Cali- fornia Legislature recently putbMrs . Aimee Semple McPherson on the rack in a final effort to make her confess adultery . Sister had confounded the Babbitts of Southern California , their police , their newspapers , their courts , their clergy , and thousands of voluntary snoopers . This grand final trap was known as the impeachment trial of Superior Judge Carlos S. Hardy . The jurist , however , was only a ventriloquist 's dummy . He had demonstrated his unfitness for the bench by his conduct in the Hickman trial ; the American Bar Association had expelled him ; his " acquittal " was a foregone conclusion . No one was interested in Hardy . He was just Exhibit A , displayed to prove that IVIrs . McPherson exerted a sinister influence over Big Men , as well as over obvious morons . The campaign against her was never an effort to expose mountebankery in terms of sense . It was simply an under-cover attempt to suppress her ? and later an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey out of Southern California . The efforts to suppress her began in 1923 , with sniping and sowing of discord at Angelus Temple , when the clergy , the boosters , the civic-pride patriots and the new esthetes began to realize that Mrs. McPherson , by her success , was making a laughing stock out of Los Angeles in the eyes of the civilized world . She was a magnet , drawing to her the moronic , the bucolic , the sick , the aged ? and a whole army of former back-East Christians who , growing mellowed in the warm sunshine of Paradise , were turning against the Hell-fire religion under which they , had quaked all their lives . Angelus Temple was a mirror , reflecting the mentality of a multitude of tax payers and legal voters . The under-cover efforts to put down Aimee went on for three years . The open crusade against her started in the summer of 1926 , when Sister ' disappeared in the Pacific Ocean and re-appeared thirty-two days later at Agua Prieta , Mexico , with her kidnapping story . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medium height , about forty years old , and weighs , I judge , about 145 pounds . She has a proud walk , large wrists and ankles , a finely shaped head , wide hips , broad shoulders , a thick neck and a mass of heavy dark-red hair ? blonde and bobbed at present . Her smile is wide , engaging and friendly ; her voice is the husky , vibrant contralto of the Midway . Sister would be called a handsome woman . Like many a mob-master , she was educated in the School of Experience . Before she embarked upon her geat career in Los Angeles , she had been a wife twice , a widow once , a divorcee once , and was the mother of two children . She had knocked about the world , known and seen the seamy , side of life , met and learned much about many kinds of people . She had been , among other things , a school teacher in Canada , a missionary in China , a roaming rural evangelist , a barker for a side-show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is well fed , cheerful , shrewd , enthusiastic , voluptu. ous and full of animal magnetism . Mrs. Maher . son is an excellent sport . In private conversation one of her favorite colloquialisms is , " That 's Oke . " She has a highly developed sense of humor , and more vitality and energy , perhaps , than any , other woman alive . From holy Kansas ten years ago , Mrs .. McPher son surveyed Southern California : She saw glorified carnival , with thousands of released Puri. tans , bewildered farmers , elderly folk , mental and physical incurables dallying along the gorgeous Mid-way . Her thirty-two perfect strong white teeth flashed in a happy smile . She perceived that the spiritual needs of those people and ho peculiar talents fitted together like the Standard Oil Coma pany of Indiana and the Continental Trading Com-pany , Ltd . It was good . In the quaint phraseology of the cloth , Sister heard the Call ? just as chirCt practors , oil-stock promoters and love-cult leaders were hearing it in all parts of the country ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more unerring ear . Aimee had no money when she arrived in Los Angeles . She had no friends there . She started her work on a street corner . Within a few years she had thirty thousand devout and generous followers . They built her a $1,500,000 temple . It has a brass band bigger and louder than Sousa 's , an organ worthy of any movie cathedral , a female choir bigger and more beautiful than the Metropolitan chorus , a costume wardrobe comparable to Ziegfeld 's . Angelus Temple , indeed , boasts almost every appointment except a half-mile track and Swedish baths , including an auditorium with 5,000 seats , a $75,000 broadcasting station , a great commissary , and the classrooms of a university from which 500 young evangelists were graduated last year . The Temple payroll is $7,000 a week . From the day its doors opened , money has poured into it faster than the white-robed walking cashiers have ever been able to make change . It is possible , of course , that Sister had not analyzed the situation in Southern California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real estate beagles and patriotism quacks have done it , and she is superior to all of them . Perhaps somebody told her it was the place for her . Maybe she just lit on it instinctively , as a gold-digger lights on a butter-andegg man . At all events , she hit it . There is nothing mysterious about her success : it is a kindergarten operation of supply and demand . The great majority of people that move to Southern California are not Sinners . They have been Saved for years . Most of them have been going to church all their lives . Many of them are old , many are psychopathic , many are incurably sick . Eastern physicians prescribe Southern California for such people . After six months in the new semi-tropic wonderland , they demand new spiritual medicine and a new technique , the nature of both of which is strongly indicated . Fear is no longer effective . Threats of mundane calamities , floods , lightning bolts , darkness , tornadoes , hail-storms , blizzards ? immemorial medicine of theology ? work forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a land where such caprices of nature are unknown . The preachers are seriously handicapped . The only threat left to them is the earthquake ; that is an ace , but unfortunately , it is barred by the Chamber of Commerce . In bleakest Vermont a theological sadist might prosper for years by threatening old ladies of eighty-seven with Hell-fire and Damnation ; but he would have a hard time keeping a sharp edge on their terror for more than six months in a sun-kissed , flower-garden land of eternal June . The Old Testament threats gradually fail to convince . Nature is too kindly . In the orthodox evangelical churches , where nothing better is offered , the pews become less crowded . The last church census of Los Angeles , compiled by the churches themselves , told the story of decreasing attendance . Yet these people , as always , are crying for religion . They need it . They will pay for it . But they no longer care to be told that a cyclone will hit the wheat back in Kansas if they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Hell if they do n't stop necking . Forty years of that is almost enough . What they crave now is a few assurances ? something brighter , happier , more beautiful . Mrs. McPherson supplied this from the start . Sister substituted the III Gospel of Love for the Gospel of Fear . This doctrine was as strange in Southern California as it is elsewhere in Christendom . No ambassador of Christ in that section had ever thought of it until she introduced it ; the others had rejected it at once on principle . Sister substituted the cheerfulness of the play-room for the gloom of the morgue . She threw out the dirges and threats of Hell , replacing them with jazz hymns and promises of Glory . The gospel she created was and is an ideal bed-time story . It has a pretty color , a sweet taste , and is easy for he patients to take . She threatens nothing ; she pros ; ses everything . Plagiarizing from the Salva , in Army , Aimee built Angelus Temple on that great question : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Sister went the Army one better . She not only propounded the poser ; she answered it . She assured her customers that they were . Next , she invented the Four-Square Gospel . This is a trade-name , based on the supposition that Heaven is surroundeu 1 ) y four walls . Mrs. McPherson describes the Holy City literally ? the jewelled walls , pearly gates , golden streets , milk and honey . She says she is not sure ? she is not sure , mind you ? but she has a pretty good idea that Heaven will resemble a cross between Pasadena , California , and Washington , D. C. That will give an idea of what may be expected at Angelus Temple . The atmosphere bubbles over with love , joy , enthusiasm ; the Temple is full of flowers , music , golden trumpets , red robes , angels , incense , nonsense and sex appeal . The service may be described as supernatural whoopee . It is balanced by the stronger medicine concocted and dispensed at the Gospel Lighthouse , Sister 's third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has them scattered throughout the United States . Here she introduced a Military Note ? the Old Reliable ! ? with thrills and bold adventure . The Lighthouse was also built to a sure-fire theme-song : " Throw Out the Life Line ! " The ladies of the chorus are clad in dapper uniforms so much like those of American Bluejackets that the Navy went to court in a vain effort to prevent Mrs. McPherson from belittling the dignity of Our Boys . The typical Lighthouse service leads up to a Rescue . The grand finale shows a dozen night-gowned virgins clinging to the Rock of Ages , while the wind howls , the thunder roars , the lightning flashes and the waves beat about them . Sister ? magnificent in an Admiral-General 's uniform ? directs the girlish sailors as they throw out the life line , while a corps of male Coast Guard workers for the Lord sweeps a prop sea with searchlights . The virgins are Saved ; the curtain descends as the band crashes , the audience stands and cheers , and the American Flag waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $6.60 in a hellish theatre , run by the Devil and Jake Shubert . Sister merely says : " Put your willing hand in your pocket , praise God , and bring out a five dollar bill I " Divine healing was not , at first , one of Sister 's accomplishments . But it was too tempting to leave to the lesser quacks ; it came logically with time , observation and prayer . Sister , I understand , has cured cases of spinal meningitis and club feet . A doctor could never cure a veteran hypochondriac , for none would come within reach of any M. D. But he goes to Angelus Temple , and when Sister fixes him with her large electric eyes , brushes his cheeks with her frankincensed mane , and lays her moist , warm palm upon him , he leaps to his feet , shouts " Glory to God ! " and does a Paddock down the aisle : he is cured . He is cured as completely as if he had sat on a red-hot stove , and without the pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm ; others that she ' does a lot of good . Certainly she has never harmed anybody . The idea belongs to the nursery . On the contrary , she has pepped up thousands of elderly people until they see angels flying in a blue light over Hollywood . More , she has probably piped ten thousand C. P. I.'s1 into Ward Five . A public service . Watching these good people joking with Napoleon , I always followed Pollyanna . It happened for the best . There , gently rebuking Catherine of Russia , they are supremely happy ; and what is more , they are safe from the wolves . Let us be broad-minded , like the Rotarians . If they had not fallen under Sister 's seductive spell , they surely would have been the victims of some other more painful quackery : probably Real Estate or Oil Stock or Patriotism . They might , indeed , have fallen under the sinister influence of the Better America Federation . IV The day after Sister disappeared from Ocean Park in her pea-green bathing suit , the congregation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' doubtful whether such devotion to a religious leader will ever be seen again in our day . The faithful sang hymns , prayed , built bonfires , wept , wailed and moaned , kept vigil night and ' day for thirty-two days , played the trumpets , beat the tom-toms and danced on the wet sand in the moonlight . Fishermen dragged for the body and deep-sea divers went down for it . One diver ' died of ex 1 Constitutional Psychopathic Inferiorities. posure . One girl committed suicide , ' determined to follow Sister to a watery grave , and others were forcibly restrained from casting themselves into the sea . Angelus Temple offered a $25,000 reward for the return of Sister , dead or alive . It stood a month . Then it was withdrawn . Obviously , there was no use . Sister was gone . The next day twelve-hour memorial services were held at Angelus Temple . Perhaps twenty thousand persons attended . Strong men were required to carry the collection baskets . At three o'clock the following morning , Mrs. Mo . Pherson staggered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related by her a few hours later at Douglas , Arizona , and a thousand times since , are well known . Sister had been kidnapped by Jake , Steve and Mexicali Rose . While she was swimming they came to the water 's edge and called her . She was lured to a sedan on the pretext of healing a sick child . The two men pitched her into the car in her wet pea-green bathing suit , smothered her cries with blankets , and chloroformed her . She woke ' up somewhere . Her captors held her there for several days . Then they moved to another place . Then they rode a long time . Finally , they took her to a shack in the desert . Sister was watching every moment for a chance to escape , but thirty-one days passed before the opportunity came . Jake cut oil a lock of her hair and Steve burned her hand with a cigar . The night of her escape , the two men had gone away , and Mexicali Rose got paralyzed on mescal . Aimee crawled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thongs that bound her , and trekked across the burning sands , under a blinding ' desert sun , eighteen miles into Agua Prieta . She was not sun-burned ; the chapeau the kidnappers had given her was a big floppy hat . Her stockings were not even damp ; Sister had been too frightened to sweat . It was the ideal newspaper story : sex , mystery , underworld characters , spooks , hot sands , salt wa-ter , public indignation and religious fanaticism . There was great rejoicing at Angelus Temple . " Our Own Sister in Jesus has been found in the Wilder-ness ! Glory to God and Hallelujah 1 " In Oakland , California , a devout Brother dropped dead from joy . The perfect newspaper story . The hunt was on but not for kidnappers . The quarry was a woman , and not only a woman , but the best known character on the Pacific Coast . The law , however , was not after Aimee . It was after the kidnappers . The mystery came , as few mysteries had ever come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Public curiosity was boiling . The people of Southern California , outside of Aimee 's own flock , were crying to know every detail ? and they wanted her punished . It was a ' direct challenge to the press . Where had Aimee been ? Whom had she been with ? What had she ' done ? The sky was the limit ; the newspapers knew that nothing would be barred if they could expose the facts . All the papers and press services did their best : at Douglas , reporters handed out $20 bills like cigars . But always , directly Decembtif Z5 , I nv 1 ri rJ nnW ahead of them , and again directly behind them , was some emissary of the Lord with $50 bills . Aimee suffered perhaps five hundred interviews and cross-examinations by reporters , not counting scores by ' detectives . Unable to pierce her mystery , or break down her story which they knew was fiction , the reporters grew desperate . News columns were turned into editorial columns ; each succeeding article was more vicious and indignant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make her lose her smile . Not once did she weaken under the threats . " That 's my story , " she said , " and I stick to it . If you do n't believe it , ' disprove it . " She flourished on publicity , which she loves as a calf loves milk . Yet there must have been some dark moments when she wished all news-hounds in hell . What crime had she committed ? She could not be charged with manslaughter . And a public hoax is not a felony . But catharsis , like love , will find a way , and the desire to do something to this bold woman became a civic mania . Unable to prove her a liar , the public finally got her arrested on a technical charge of " conspiracy to ' defeat justice , " based on the claim that she was not trying to help the police find the kidnappers ! When Mrs. McPherson beat that case in open court , they arrested her on another technical charge , " subornation of perjury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth I In effect , this amounted simply to saying : " We still think you have been unchaste , and we insist on hearing the details . " The newspapers , of course , with the possible exception of The Los Angeles Times , had not been moved by any real indignation . At first they had merely anticipated the cry of the mob . Later they were spurred on by the realization of their own failure . But they have never yet been able to tell the public where Aimee was during those thirty-two days , how she got away from the beach , whom she was with , what she did , or how she reached Agua Prieta . All of this remains as much of a mystery to the public as ever . The papers , to be sure , have printed tons of rumors , suppositions , insinuations , veiled references , fragmentary and questionable evidence ? which failed to stand up in court ? deductions , and so on , but that is all . They have never yet been able to print the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , and I have seen it all . But facts in the archives are not worth much . Until they land on the front page they remain , for nearly all practical purposes save black-mail , as dead as a row of corpses in the morgue . All through the battle , against tremendous odds , Sister fought willingly , with great good humor , and with a superior understanding of the mob mind . Her flock paid all the bills . The mob was an organ ; she played on it ceaselessly , and her theme was always the same : " The Emissaries of Hell Persecuting Poor Sister in Jesus . " Raising cash to stave off the bloodhounds , she called it the " Fight-the-Devil Fund . " She returned every blow with a hearty kick in the pants . If there were times when she grew hysterical , scolded her advisers and wept , the public was not allowed to witness them . Sister , according to a private revelation vouchsafed me , originally planned to emerge from her watery grave and walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid to attempt such a miracle , you do not know the woman . Mrs. McPherson has the nerve of a brass monkey , and the philosophy of the Midway ? " Never give a sucker an even break " ? is grounded in her . She loves to juggle the mob . She glories in her power over it , she has at heart a deep contempt for it , and she can gauge its passions and imbecilities as few politicians can . She would have carried off this resurrection , too , had not some timid councilor , or perhaps an unexpected stab of caution , persuaded her to forsake the project as too ambitious , and so she returned by land , via the kidnapping route . The aphasia route was discarded as offering too little challenge to her sporting instincts . The enterprise , therefore , was not so startling as it might have been , but it was sensational enough . Did I hint that Sister lost confidence at one stage of her exploit ? If so , she had regained it two-fold upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous story in a balder manner or oftener . She undoubtedly believes it herself now . V If all the nonsensical articles and claptrap editorials written about Mrs. McPherson were placed end to end , they would reach from the pinnacle of idiocy into half the magazine offices in New York . There is nothing sinister about her . Voluptuous , yes , but not sinister . Sister is human . She has a hearty laugh . She has It , and plenty of it . She is a frank and simple fraud , somewhat like Texas Guinan , but more comical , and not quite so cheap . Aimee has neither the vinegar of a female wowser , nor the more peculiar acids of a political hell-cat . She is neither a radical baiter , a scandal monger nor a social climber . Her disciples arc not holy snoopers . They are not vice crusaders . Her flock spends its time getting Saved and rejoicing in the Lord ; it is guilty of the great American heresy of minding its own business . Mrs. McPherson is not a political parson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not join in the national crusade against Al Smith . The pull there was tremendous . Los Angeles , bear in mind , is Mrs. Willebrandt 's home town . Mr. Hoover was not only the favorite California prodigal son ; he was also a native-son brother to every Iowa farmer in Long Beach . In Southern California they were howling for Al 's gizzard . Sister herself was under attack . Here was the Heaven-sent opportunity to divert the indignation against herself into the greater wave of hatred and fear of Smith , and to ride back to a popularity she had never yet attained on the crest of religious bigotry . There are not many Christians , I judge , 14U 1 rl IN 12 , 1'V and probably no other ambassador of God in the United States , who could have resisted that impulse . 1 do not say that a sentimental regard for common decency inspired Sister ; nor do I say that it did not . It may have been merely constitutional inability . VI Mrs. McPherson meets a definite spiritual need in Southern California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , Dr. J. Frank Norris does in Texas and Bishop Cannon does in all of his dioceses . She suffers considerably from being a transparent mountebank instead of an opaque one . Like others , she is a Fundamentalist ; but she stresses Glory instead of Hell . She is aware of the possibilities of that place , but she does not exploit it . Hear her : " Who cares about old Hell , friends ? Why , we all know what Hell is . We 've heard about it all our lives . A terrible place , where nobody wants to go . I think the less we hear about Hell the better , do n't you ? Let 's forget about Hell . Lift up your hearts . What we are interested in , yes , Lord , is Heaven , and how to get there ! " Does she tell them how to get there ? Well , not exactly . She simply assures them , positively , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that they are going there . All old friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She calls upon her congregation for confirmation , and they voice it lustily . The shouts of " Glory to God ! " ? " Hallelujah ! " ? " Amen I " are spiritual equivalents of " Atta Baby ! " ? " You Tell ' Em ! " ? " And How ! " Aimee 's Jesus is not the wraith of the modernist theologians . He is not the Super-Salesman of Jerusalem . He bears no resemblance to the Anti-Saloon League 's celestial Cop . Sister has a greater personal following , perhaps , than any preacher in America . She gives them exactly the type of theology they desire . Are they any more or less intelligent than the followers of Bishop Manning or the suave Dr. Fosdick ? Do they follow a doctrine sounder or less rational , fundamentally , than that put out by Dr. Cadman or the Pope ? It is simply a question of Grade A , Grade B and Grade C , with the customers doing the grading . When Sister closes a sermon ? she frequently preaches three hours at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sends them back to their gardens and salmon-hued bungalows laughing and happy , the doubts , fears and cares of this depressing world forgotten . When she paints the picture of That Beautiful Land on High , the chests of young morons heave ; it is a wonderful light that comes into the eyes of old men with the palsy and old ladies with ear trumpets in the front row . Their faces are illumined , their eyes are stars . Unquestionably , Mrs. McPherson is sincere . She believes what she preaches when she preaches it , just as a politician of the better kind believes his campaign promises when he makes them , a lawyer believes his December 25 , .1929 argument when he ' delivers it , an author believes his fiction when he composes it . Sincerity , like virtue , is an art . Is Mrs. McPherson a hypocrite ? If she is not , living in the United States , she belongs in a museum . She is an opportunist , but not so great a one as Senator Borah . Is she a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent appearance before the California Legislature was the final battle ? the result of two years of consistent planning and scheming by her enemies to get her before that tribunal . It was the last chance in California to ruin " that red-headed sorceress . " In New England , they only hanged witches , but we have progressed since then . Defeat . ing the bloodhounds at Sacramento , with the aid of several San Francisco legislators who refused to join in the assault , Aimee has now beaten every interested agency , official and lay , in the State of California . That last battle was the end of a six-year war ; the victory for her marked her complete triumph . She is now free to serve the Lord until the Marines are called out .
