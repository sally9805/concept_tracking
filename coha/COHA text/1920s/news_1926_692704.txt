txt William Peter Hamilton , editor of rhe , Wall Street Journal , in Boston for a few hours , was in terviewed by the Boston News Bureau . He said : " If I may be permitted to look so far ahead , there should be the most remarkable and well established bull market for the Presidential election in 1925 , and the preceding campaign , this eduntry has ever seen . Of course , I bar what the old insurance policies call ' The Act of God and the King 's enemies . ' There are possible developments in Europe which might throw calculations out of gear . Among these I do not reckon the genval strike in Great Britain . It is likely to flatten out *ithin the ncxt few days , serious as it undoubtedly is and grave as the losses it involves must certainly be . " But there will be the basis for a bull market which , as usual , few people will then recognize , before this time next year unless the indications of the stock market averages are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century in which I have been discussing thew as the barometer of burliness . " There is no doubt in my mind that a major bear market in stocks developed in the middle of February after two and one-half years of an upward movement . We have had typical secondary rallies but I can not but believe that the major trend will be slowly downward for some time to come , not improbably for the rest of this year . " I can see that the business of thecountry is beginning to shape in the way the stock market barometer foreshadowed . It may be reassuring to say that the business and industrial recession now developing will be one of the mildest and most humane the country has experienced since therbeginning of the century . During that time there have been seven depressions , two of them , in 1907 and 1920 , of great severity . AN ORDERL.T CONTRACTION IN mrsiNEss " There is nothing remotely like those impending but in spite of the promise of a big winter wheat crop business tends to contract within orderly limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling ill real estate and what may be fairly-ealled the abuse of the holding device in utility companies and the exaggerated values recently given to good-will in organized and broadly-expanded retail business . " It is sometimes forgotten that the great usefulness of the stock market barometer arises from the fact that the stock market can change its broad direction promptly where general business takes a much longer time to shorten sail . " The steel trade is carrying on with a high percentage of capacity through the momentum of orders already en the books . These orders are not likely to be renewed in the same volume , although anywhere else in the world and at any other time in our history we would have bezn profoundly impressed by the magnitude of what we shall call in the next few , months , normal business . SOME NONSENSICAL t HEAP MONEY TALIC " A good deal of nonsense is talked about cheap money , especially call money , and its effect commercial demand is slackening , that is not a bull argument on business . What impresses me in Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of any encouraging market for new enterprise except of the most conservative character . " No countrj " s business can go on expanding forever , and we should rejoice that ours can contract in a manner so eminently safe and sane as it is likely to do in the next few months . There must be something thoroughly sound about ' a national structure-of commerce and industry which can be so simply and effectively strengthened without imperiling the foundations for anything but the merest scaffolding of the superstructure . As the French say , we are stepping back to jump better , and the conservative recession which I can not help but foresee will afford admirable investment opportunities and justify the beginnings of future developments which may well be surprising . " There is one point which I would like to emphasize . It is that commodity prices are trending downward , while the margin for reducing cost of production has been so much curtailed by efficiency already established that profits will be smaller . This will mean less a reduction in wages than a moderate reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few months . These are likely to be reabsorbed well before this time next year .
