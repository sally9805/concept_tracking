M. Andr Citron , " French Henry Ford , " received last week a nasty , grating , jerky jolt . His Trans-African Citron Co. , formed to finance a trans-Sahara route from Colomb-Bechar , southern terminus of the Algerian railways , to Timbuktu ( distance of nearly 1,700 miles ) was suddenly brought to an untimely end . <P> The route was to have been traversed in nine days by special Citroen auto mobiles , equipped with caterpillar tractors . Along the route M. Citron had erected many cheap hotels where native jazz bands were to have amused the transient guests . M. Citron , highly optimistic , had once said : " A new country is thrown open to auto tourists . Tourists , eager for new sights and new experiences , soon will be able to make this once hazardous trip with ease and dispatch . They will be deeply stirred by the magic of this unexplored land . " <P> At the outset , it seemed as if the plan would work as smoothly as a piston in a well-oiled cylinder . But M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , he had counted upon the sky-blue soldiers of France to stop them . Turbulent Moors disliked the headless , legless camels that were to scoot across the desert at 45 miles an hour , declared an unholy war upon them . French officers warned M. Citron that they could not guarantee security to tourists in the desert-finis . Sadly , painfully , reluctantly , M. Citron announced the abandonment of his scheme and presumably the greater part of the 15,000,000 francs that it has cost him . The King of the Belgians and General Ptain , who were to have assisted at the opening ceremonies , were notified that there would be no such ceremonies . <P> Far away in the wide open spaces of the sandy Sahara , lights went out , hotels were closed . The night descended , the watch-fires of the tribes grew bright and there was great joy in Moorish camps at the ignominious retreat of the infidel .
