Son-of-a-Blacksmith Benito Mussolini censored , edited and titled , last week , the newsreel showing him in the act of signing the new Italo-Papal Treaty ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) with Pietro Cardinal Gasparri , Son-of-a-Shepherd and Papal Secretary of State . <P> As soon as Il Duce 's titles had been inserted , the film was rushed to the Vatican and there viewed with approbation by Pope Pius XI , Son-of-a-Weaver . <P> The snorting motor truck which took the news reels and movie projector to His Holiness was emblazoned with the Italian Coat of Arms and was the first vehicle so emblazoned to enter the Papal precincts since 1870 . The estrangement between Pope and King which then began has now been so thoroughly patched up by the Treaty signed last fortnight that next June , according to announcements made last week , the Royal State Coach will clatter up to the Vatican , and King Vittorio Emanuele III will pay a call which the Supreme Pontiff will speedily return .               @ @ @ @ @ @
