At indoor sports , there 's nobody can beat us <P> At indoor sports , they 're all afraid to meet us . . . . <P> - The late great Bert Williams . <P> One May day last year , Yale 's ten brightest Seniors sat in Connecticut Hall scribbling answers to a Harvard English examination . They could smoke , but honor bound them not to speak , peer or signal . At the same time Harvard 's " ten brightest " took the same examination under like conditions in Cambridge . The Harvard men made the highest marks and thereby won a " brain contest " originated and financed-with a foundation of $125,000-by Mrs. William Lowell Putnam , sister of Harvard 's President . The victors ' spoils were $5,000 worth of books ( TIME , May 14 ) . <P> This year Harvard wanted to have another brain bout . Invitations were sent to Cambridge , England , to Princeton and to Yale . Last week , trustees of the fund announced that the contest would have to be postponed until next year . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
