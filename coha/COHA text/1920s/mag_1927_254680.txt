When representatives of the five Powers and six smaller nations comprising the Council of the League of Nations* assembled at Geneva last week for their regular quarterly meeting , they found that a document pregnant with international discord had been filed with the League by order of President-Dictator Ahmed Bey Zogu of Albania . <P> Because Italy holds a virtual protectorate over Albania , the note of Dictator Zogu received the respect appropriate to a communication undoubtedly approved if not ordered written by Italian Dictator Mussolini . It declared that the national honor of Albania had been insulted by " brutal and unconciliatory demands " made upon Albania by Jugoslavia , recently , to obtain the release of a Jugoslav spy arrested and jailed in Albania . <P> When these demands were refused by Albania , the note continued , the Jugoslav Government last week withdrew its Legation from Albania and gave the Albanian Minister in Belgrade just 24 hours to leave the country . <P> Such action pertinently suggested that Jugoslavia , after breaking off relations with Albania , would shortly declare war . The Albanian note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of a national alibi , registered with the League , so that , if war breaks out , Dictator Ahmed Bey Zogu of Albania may disclaim all responsibility before the world . <P> Actually Jugoslavia ( backed by France ) and Albania ( backed by Italy ) have been snapping and snarling at each other for so long that if war should break out between them the responsibility would be mutual . <P> The League Council Members , notably Sir Austen Chamberlain , M. Aristide Briand and Dr. Gustav Stresemann ( respectively foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany ) had power last week only to scan the Albanian note , make it a matter of record . They then proceeded with the humdrum but important routine business of the League . <P> <P> * Powers with permanent seats : Great Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Japan . Nations with temporary seats : Chile , Poland , Rumania ( 3 years ) : and Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Salvador ( 1 year ) .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
