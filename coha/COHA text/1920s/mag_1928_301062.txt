In Washington many an inquisitive glance has been cast toward the tiny , exquisite person of Mme. Katsuji Debuchi , wife of the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. It is known that Mme. Dubuchi in her home wears the flowered silken kimonos of Japan 's ancient mode , and that her hair is often coiled intricately in fashions ordained by a remote Japanese coiffeur . Certain insufficiently informed persons deduced there from that Mme. Debuchi was an old school Japanese woman , that she opposed the modern trend of her countrywomen toward emancipation . <P> Potent denial of such deductions came ( Continued on p. 19 ) ( Continued from p. 75 ) last week from Mme. Debuchi who showed her complete awareness of modern Japan by speaking to correspondents thus : <P> " The Japanese girl of today is much larger and stronger than the women of my generation . My own daughter , who is 14 years old , will be taller than either her father or myself , and I feel certain that this is due to her enthusiastic entrance into all sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , basketball , swimming and pole vaulting . Perhaps the most remarkable spectacle of these days is to see a party of Japanese girls climbing Mount Fiji . Ten or fifteen years ago this was unheard of . <P> " The increasing freedom from old established customs and traditions , and the number of women now earning salaries promises radical changes in the life of our nation . " <P> But most surprising was Mme. Debuchi 's declaration that not only do Japanese women engage in business but that many of them have become taxicab drivers .
