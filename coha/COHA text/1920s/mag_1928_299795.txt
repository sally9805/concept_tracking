Secretary Mellon rounded off his long program of Liberty Loan refinancings like a golfer who , having made par or better at almost all previous holes , encounters trouble at the final hole and has to accept a large figure to complete an otherwise happy scorecard . <P> The Secretary 's trouble was not serious . It was only that heavy stock market speculation , and increased exporting of gold from the U. S. , had stiffened the U. S. money market and kept it stiff . The Third Liberty Loan was to mature on Sept. 15 and a considerable portion of it had been left to be taken care of by the Treasury 's September operations . Secretary Mellon had to decide what interest rate he must offer to ensure the success of these operations . He delayed decision , hoping for a " break " that would make the playing easier . <P> The " break " did not come . The Treasury had to announce last week that it would pay 4% on an issue of nine-month notes , for which the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money conditions had allowed Secretary Mellon to retire some $3,900,000,000 worth of Second and Third Liberties , all bearing 4% , at rates ranging from 3 ? % down to 2% . Not since early in 1923 had he been obliged to offer 4%. * <P> The remnant of Third Liberties which the notes were issued to meet was some $970,000,000 . Secretary Mellon 's dislike of the high-rate situation was reflected in the small amount of the new issue . Only $525,000,000 were authorized , whereas $600,000,000 or more had been confidently predicted by Wall Street . The balance of the Treasury 's September bill , which with interest on the public debt will amount to some $1,040,000,000 , must be met by September income tax receipts . <P> <P> *In 1921 , a peak for short-term notes was touched , at 6%.
