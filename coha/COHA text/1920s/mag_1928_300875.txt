Outstanding among exceptions to the rule of prosperous , optimistic midyear statements were the balance sheets of U. S. automobile tire companies . Sales figures , if not exuberant , were satisfactory . But income figures were disheartening . Net income of the " biggest " Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. dropped from $6,364,005 ( Jan. - June , 1927 ) to $3,074,200 ( Jan-June , 1928 ) . For B.F. Goodrich Co. , a profit of $5,813,501 turned into a deficit of $1,574,889 . Fisk Rubber Co. ' s huge deficit was $4,983,134 . <P> Causes of this unhappy situation were not obscure . In December , 1926 , leading U. S. tire manufacturers formed the American rubber pool , proceeded during the next year to accumulate a great supply at prices ranging from 35 to 41 a pound . But last February , the price of crude rubber broke sharply , fell to 26.9 in March , 17.2 in April , stood last week just under 20 . Large tire companies took a staggering loss on their inventories . Tire prices fell to meet fierce competition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber reserve . <P> Chief among these competitors were the houses of Montgomery Ward &; Co. , Inc. , and Sears Roebuck &; Co . Each announced drastic price cuts . Each advertised huge mileage guarantees . Montgomery Ward 's " Super Service Riverside " tire carries a guarantee of 30.000 miles . Sears Roebuck gives its " Super Allstate " an assured life of 25,000 miles , proclaims : " No other manufacturer has dared to write such a guarantee , " declares itself " America 's Largest Distributor of Tires . " But Montgomery Ward counters with the slogan . " World 's Biggest Tire Dealer . " The tire war seemed localized to the two principal mail order houses . While the tire companies were piling up deficits , Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward showed largest sales on record . <P> But last week , tire manufacturers took vigorous action to meet the menace of the mail order houses . Two months ago , the dormant Rubber Institute was brought to life under the directorship of onetime Prohibition Commissioner Lincoln C. Andrews . Its first arresting act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 400 daily newspapers . Speaking for 44 companies , Tsar Andrews pungently flayed the mileage guarantee . This practice , so profitable to mail order houses , was branded thus : <P> " Rejected by standard tire companies as unfair and uneconomical . . . . Abused by unscrupulous drivers . ... An unfair sales inducement rather than a protection for the buyer . . . . There are no miles in a bottle of ink . You can not put mileage into tires by written guarantees-it must be built in . " <P> In place of this bitterly castigated sales promise , Tsar Andrews and his 44 companies offered a guarantee designed to sweep mail order house claims into oblivion . The Andrews guarantee : <P> " Manufacturers . . . guarantee tires bearing their names and serial numbers against defects for the entire life of the tires . " <P> At first reading , this appeared to be saying , in effect : " We guarantee a tire for so long as nothing happens to it . " But closer study revealed this meaning : " We guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton to hold it together , it will not fail because of any defect in material or workmanship . "
