Divorce as Manners and Customs MANNERS none ? and customs horrid . " So wrote the English midshipman in his Australasian diary . Suppose he landed among the wild men of Borneo and began observing their customs ? of marriage and divorce ! ? Some boasting lawgiver would describe the authority which he claimed to exercise . The priest ? or what 's his name ? would explain the conditions under which dusky divorcees were damned or saved ? or whatever those results are called in Borneo . But the midshipman of old or the observer of the National Geographic Society today might well be quite cold to such answers . He would rather ask , " How many wives , in fact , does a headman have in one life ? " " Are they parallel or tandem in their arrangement as to time or space ? " " Can the lawgiver or priest enforce rules with which the headman is out of sympathy ? " " Do the children , whom the lawgiver and priest call bad names , nevertheless get their share of the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the headman 's job afterwards ? " It is time to examine the divorces of civilization with the same nickel-plated torch of electric truth with which we should spy upon those whom we call savages . Let us begin with Yucatan . When the chaste matrons of the Back Bay used to attend the Boston Museum to endure with dignified approval the rhythmic posturing of the daughter of Ole Bull , and endorse the play written by a church organist , the theatre used to remain full after the danseuse had retired . It was full because Wild Rosy of Yucatan was coming back upon the stage . Why the actress then claimed Yucatan as her legal residence is hard to guess ; but any actress may wisely claim residence there now if her idea of a home residence is that it be well adapted for divorce purposes . Fifteen days and fifteen dollars are the only requisites for divorce in Yucatan . ( See the lively acount of a case in The Boston Post of February 11 , 1925 . ) In Yucatan the decree of divorce may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any from Paris . Its seals may be as red as any from Reno . The next marriage follows , performed by the same judge before the parties leave the court-room ? and the National Geographic Magazine may some day be filled with a well-illustrated and . sufficiently-clothed series of photographs representing how they all live happily ever afterwards in Yucatan . The petitioner whose story I am relating probably testified that he was a resident of Yucatan , but he held on to a government department job in Washington , D. C. , to which he returned on the round trip of his steamer . So long as Yucatan public opinion gives support , why ask the priests at Rome or the lawgivers of Main Street and Babbittville ? And , if Babbittville public opinion sustains such a returning couple , why inquire at the County Seat about the theory of the law ? The manners and customs of the savages of Bulgaria are likewise apposite . I disclaim , at once or sooner , all intention of reflecting upon the Bulgarians themselves . The savage whom I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The knowing can identify him through the circumstance that he has often published his contempt for his Alma Mater . ( See the omissions in his biography in the Class Book of 189 ? . ) He went to Bulgaria , took notes of its manners , and observed that its lawgivers treated divorce as something within the province of the priest , rabbi , or even missionary . And he returned from Bulgaria with a Bapt-odist divorce . The public opinion of his native state rather supported the first wife . But he had reigned there for a time ? powerful , eccentric , and able to rely upon a great body of public opinion behind his eccentricities . His only mistake was his supposition that the time was ripe for similar support of his divorce . Since the New Republic carries no advertisement for the excellent soft drink which Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes has declared innocent save for " a faint aureole of poison , " ( Coca Cola , Inc. vs . Koke Co. 254 U. S. , page 143 ) this lucubration may go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savages of Reno , Nevada . I disclaim again ! The home life of permanent residents on Main Street in Reno may be as pure as the " home life of our own dear Queen . " He whom I have in mind is a Southern Colonel , expert exploiter of a drink , and the court records of his once chivalrous but soon fragile affection . The court records show the lady 's voyage to Reno , her tarrying hard by the post office , whence she mailed her frequent promises of return ? and handy to the railroad station , with reservations made for the day after the divorce . But they also show his not at all chivalrous use of her confidential and somewhat affectionate correspondence . Repelling her breach of promise claim , he contended successfully that her Reno divorce was waste paper ; that she was , therefore , a married woman when she promised to marry him ; and that to such premature rearrangements the law permits no validity . Now the point here is that there was a real Southern Gentleman in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helped the jury to put this somewhat Circassian plaintiff where she belonged , he kept an eye out for the future of the fair Georgians who live on Main Street of his state . No Southern Gentleman ? so one reads between the lines of the printed opinion ? would contest . a Reno divorce so as to bastardize the innocent issue of the next marriage . This judge at least would meet that by requiring an overwhelming certainty of fraud . And he means , and frankly almost says , a certainty so great that it could never be proved . ' The criminal practice of the state of New York requires the same proofs before convicting for the crime of adultery . " It is n't done " in either place . Borneo , Yucatan , and Reno point the moral for Paris , France , and for the marvelously secretive divorce which may or may not be obtainable in the summer Paris of a state which I hesitate to advertise . These Paris divorces and their like are bought and sold for a particular use and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York bar , expounding the then latest decision of the Supreme Court of the United States ( Bell vs . Bell , 1901 ) , said in 1902 that he was still advising clients to get Reno divorces . " They want to use them for only one thing , " he said , " tiley want to take them out to dinner in New York society with the second husband , and these divorces are just as good for that as New York society pleases to make them . " In the twenty and more years since then public opinion has come around even more completely and now supports all such divorces and mill-end products . On Main Street everywhere they are good for everything they are bought for at the Paris shops . In the next generation a man would be expelled from his Rotary Club and a woman , from her Garden Club if either should start to contest one of these divorces in court . The opposition of priests and lawyers is then really of no importance whatsoever . The priests may say that the divorced ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows that the priests say that . The lawgivers are equally positive in declaring that such divorces are legal waste paper . And it will be a shock to most readers to
