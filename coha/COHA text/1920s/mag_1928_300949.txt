When Governor Benjamin Strong of New York 's Federal Reserve Bank died of an intestinal abscess ( diverticulosis ; last week , there were many expressions of sorrow . Reliant , well-liked &; resourceful internationalist , he had supported heavy responsibilities , weighty matters of finance on his ailing shoulders . Governor for 14 years , for 12 years his steps were dogged with illness . World War loans , rehabilitation problems , international finances hastened his breakdown . <P> Columns of newsprint recorded his achievements , mourned him . Editorial writers lauded him , decried his untimely end at 55 . Among all these encomiums there was one dissenting voice . Said the Barron-bereaved Wall Street Journal , editorially : " His services were of the highest value and conditions today might have been different if his health had permitted undivided attention to his office for the past three months . " <P> Bitter words to a dead man . More bitter had been the Journal 's polemics of the past six months . For many an analyst believed it was the Strong policy of easy money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many a bull , in Manhattan and in Chicago , damned bitterly the Federal Reserve Bank 's efforts to undo , by raising the rediscount rate , the mischief it had done . Most bullish of all bulls is the Journal . Most hateful , therefore , is the present high rediscount rate . <P> The damningly faint praise accorded dead Benjamin Strong by the potent Journal may give Gates W. McGarrah pause . Some think he , now Acting Governor , will soon be confirmed as Governor . <P> Ironic was the announcement , made the day before Strong died , that the National Bank of Brussels was to give him a marble bust of himself in appreciation of his aid in stabilization of Belgian currency . <P> Ironic , too , was a story in the Atlanta Constitution about diverticulosis published the very day Strong died . An ignorant reporter chose to be lengthily flippant in describing the contours of intestinal abscesses as shown on X-ray plates .
