From the belly of the giant British dirigible 12-33 , which moved majestically above a yellow haze that was the city of London , a trapeze was lowered on the end of which dangled a tiny airplane . For a moment it swung there perilously ; then its motor took hold and it careered away , maneuvering all about the big dirigible , sniffing at air pockets , nosing through patches of heathery cloud , like a baby kangaroo which had got out of its mother 's pouch . Presently the dirigible flashed a signal ; the long metallic umbilical cord was lowered again and the airplane whined close , ready to try the hazardous feat of mooring . While both crafts drowsed along at the same speed , the plane was hooked by a special apparatus , hoisted to the trapeze , lifted back into the body of the dirigible . The British Air Ministry declared that this experiment has been attempted before but never successfully . If the technique is perfected , it will be of incalculable value .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
