Two most interesting and unusual artists appeared in a joint concert at Detroit last week , Eva Gautbier , soprano , and E. Robert Schmitz , pianist . Both of these artists are notable for giving novel and even startling programs in which the shocks of modernistic composition are prominent . Their list of songs and piano pieces in Detroit did not undershoot expectations . <P> Eva Gauthier is the sort of person who arouses curiosity and imagination . She is a little French Canadian , dark , eager eyed and sprightly . Her movements are rapid and unaffected . A glance at her reveals a singular flame of honesty and intelligence . She sings with a pretty voice and a simply astounding amount of understanding , artistry and grace . With the sort of music she sings , a mere correct intonation of the ear-confounding sounds is an astonishment . In the ensemble of impressions , this little woman wears a strangely exotic air . <P> Her career has been one to make into a fantastic novel . She studied in Paris , and , as scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pelleas under the coaching of Debussy . Then , with a brilliant career in her hands , she married a Hollander , an official in the East Indies . To Java she went to preside over a satrap 's strange eastern household . She lived there for several years . As a powerful white functionary 's wife , she moved as a great person among the potentates of the oriental island . She tells of living as an honored guest in the harem of the Sultan of Solo . The orient entered her spirit . Of course , she studied the strange and subtle music of the Javanese . She returned to the West , to America , and re-began the career that her marriage had broken off by giving a series of recitals in which she featured Javanese songs . Her success in these led her to a specialization in exotic and other strange sorts of music .
