For speaking out of turn for Hoover at Kansas City , William S. Vare , U. S. Senator-suspect from Pennsylvania , Republican boss of Philadelphia , last week received a formal rebuke in the June Bulletin of the Republican League of Philadelphia . This League is not to be confused with Boss Vare 's machine . The statement , in part , read as follows : " Secretary Mellon was chairman of the Pennsylvania delegation . As such he could not announce the position of the delegates until after they had held a caucus . . . . For a member of the delegation , over the head of the chairman , to presume to commit the delegation to any candidate was effrontery pure and simple , and contrary to all the rules of party discipline . Unless the Mellons are willing to abrogate sic the leadership of Pennsylvania they must take cognizance of this effrontery and deal drastically with it . Otherwise party reglarity and organization in State affairs will be a byword in Pennsylvania . " <P> The League described Boss Vare 's act as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major importance during the campaign . . . . The humiliation of our distinguished Secretary of the Treasury which it caused is likely to reverberate. . . . "
