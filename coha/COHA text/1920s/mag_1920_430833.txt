 | MAUD MULLER TANNER , about as big as a pint of cider , with a dimple in her chin and sparkling black eyes , does n't look all she is , and it would be the hardest thing in the world to believe it of her , if it were not for seeing the actual work she has done and reading the profound opinions of her skill as stated by some of the most eminent men in her profession . For this little wren of a body is regarded as one of the foremost dentists of America . She has invented several dental contrivances that are revolutionizing in their influence ; is the first dentist in the world to give babies new teeth ? nice little porcelain ones that fit on where their tiny first ones prematurely decayed away ; has demonstrated her original dental work with babies before the dental conventions of numerous states ; was sent by the dental association of Oregon as its representative to the national convention in New York City ? the first woman dentist ever so honored by any state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentistry designed for supplementary reading in the public schools to interest and educate the child in caring for and saving his teeth . Most of all , she is afire over preventable dentistry . " Think of it ! " she said , quoting figures .. " Eighty-five percent of all human ailments originate above the chin , and ninety percent of these could be prevented by right dentistry and right living . You must realize the need of teaching on this subject . Always , to the average person , a toothache has been just a toothache . Now it is our task to make him realize that a toothache is a general health drainer . " Figures always inflame my imagination . At once , as the tiny lady talked ? for I caught her between patients in her handsome office suite in Portland , Oregon ? I could see streams and streams of young men stumbling along the downward way with hands to swollen jaws , all the fault of bad teeth , and with them streams and streams of young women . " But the baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little child have porcelain teeth , when by his sixth or seventh year he will begin to get his permanent ones ? " She flashed a look of impatience into my ignorance . " One bad tooth will hold a child back a whole year , " she declared . " And porcelain teeth give him something to chew on while waiting for his permanent ones ? this is when he loses the first ones prematurely , of course . " She turned about to a little boy playing contentedly on the floor . " Come here , Maurice . " He got up and fairly flew into her arms , a chubby , fair gentleman of three in his first middy suit . " Open your mouth and show this lady your nice new teeth . " He turned and opened , as proud as a peacock . There they were , sure enough , four pretty little porcelain teeth , each one screwed on to the root by means of the " Tanner post , " a new invention too technical for the layman , but apparently a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pulled out of a drawer a plaster impression of the boy 's mouth before he got the new teeth , showing a little row of black , diseased , charred , and broken stumps . " But it lasts so short a time , " I said . " But the boy lasts always , " she came back , " and mouth health now will contribute to his health to the end of his life . " Well , there was everything in that . We do n't think these things clear through , some of us . " You are not to blame , " went on consolingly . " Y were probably educated every subject under the a but the one that really malt ? yourself ? and especially t care of your teeth . Every o is in the same box . We haven realized till this war how i portant teeth are . Why , svuni should begin on prevent ii dentistry for their babies fore they are born ! It lint a bit too soon . And it 's going happen , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how to care f their teeth and the serious ' ) of not caring for them . I you suppose we would ha prohibition in America today if the effect of alcohol lain been taught in the public schools a quarter of a century ago ? These men and women who voted it out are the very ones who learned all about it in their little supplementary readers . Well , it 'll be the same thing with bad teeth . " And what will become of the dentists ? ' I asked . " Are n't you ruining a very lucrative business ? just as the alcohol fighters did ? " Her eyes flashed . " It might surprise you to know that the supply of dentists is failing off , " she came back . " Dentistry is getting to be more scientific all the time , requiring long and devoted study , and other things are calling men away from it . Of course , " she added , " as more women take it up ? " " Timidity will hold them back , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " she exclaimed . I wondered how she happened to take it up . For to be a dentist , forever bent above ill-smelling mouths with a buzzer in your hand , does n't seem an inviting profession for a really choosey person , and this little person could be put down as definitely choosey . And so , sitting there in the large , airy office looking out oil mountains and forests , she grew reminiscent and told me everything . She did n't dream I would publish all this , but it helps us all , I think , to get intimate glimpses into a successful woman 's life . There was denied .  | girlhood ? she was the eldest of seven , and brought the others up , for her mother died early ? and she did this on a prosperous , Illinois farm , where housework . cooking for harvest hands , churning , mothering chicks as well as children , and looking after her father required an up-early-and-to-bed-late program which allowed little time for any personal life of her own . At nineteen she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time she could seriously plan for herself . She knew exactly what she wanted to do . The dream had been buried deep always , but it was not smothered . She wanted to be a physician . Naturally her father was not sympathetic with the idea . Well-to-do Middle Vest fathers ? I know them ? rarely want their daughters to become independent . Their theory is that they will marry anyway , and in the meantime their father 's roof is their proper place . very good theory , but not attractive to the modern-minded young person , and this young person . for all her isolation , was distinctly modern-minded . If she was to have a way of her own . then . she had to make it , so she took the first thing that offered . She passed the civil service examination in domestic science and was soon sent out to Tacoma . Washington , on some special government work . She saved every possible penny . and when she had enough to make the start , returned to her old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here she struck her first snag ? lack of education . She was educated ? goodness knows ! ? in a million things the rest of us know all too little about , and perhaps in the very things the world needs most right now , but not in Latin : She went to the county superintendent of schools and toId him her troubles . He advised her to settle down and dig in and make up the lacks , and he helped her to do it . @# @#  | " Study , travel , read , " he said . " Do n't let those eyes miss a thing , and you ca n't fail . " It was her keynote . Her reading and observation brought her attention to teeth , to what they meant to human health , to the lack of understanding of their care , and so she decided to specialize on teeth , to make teeth her life work . The next thing was to choose a college . This was easy , for nearly all medical and dental schools were forbidden her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thtly was let her in , and this chanced to be Barnes University of St. Louis . Here she made her expenses as dietitian at the state hospital and carried off the highest honors of her class each year . She meant all the time to practise in the West , so for , her third year went out to . Portland , Oregon , thinking she could work up a practise while finishing her course . She ! completed her course , but struck another snag ! ? she could not pay her school bills , and the college would not let her have her diploma until they were paid . There she was , high and ' dry- , with skill in her finger-tips , eager to begin ! work , but forbidden to practise without a diploma , and forbidden her diploma because she could n't pay for it . SHE rushed to a lawyer 's office and browsed through the dental laws of all the states till she found one that would permit a dentist to practise without a diploma , merely by taking the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ? Arkansas . Fortunately the state examinations were then on . She passed ? 1 and then was swept by such a wave of homesickness that she just could n't stay , much as she needed the money . , She went on to St. Louis . accepted her old job as dietitian , and worked at it till she had sufficient money to pay her college bills . Then she returned to Portland . got her diploma , and looked about to see what next . Once more she was flat broke . She ended by going to a dental supply company and telling the kindly old gentleman in charge all her troubles . She had n't any money , but she just had to have a dental outfit and open an office of her own . She knew she could make money if she only had the tools to work with . " Of course you can ! " said the good-hearted old gentleman , and agreed to sell her everything on instalments . And thus at last , after the ups and downs , she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy from the first hour , day and Sundays and holidays . Every one in -. odd seemed to need dentistry . And as and delved in sick mouths , she began to see dentistry as the most important thing in whole world . She worked out new methods and definite inventions . She wrote about teeth . talked about them , educated her patients on the care of them ? and ways to save dentists ' bills . She educated the mothers to take care of their children 's teeth . She made dentistry a game for the children , got them interested , appealed to their imagination , and cured them of fear and hysteria , so that all her little patients now contemplate a visit to her as a lark . The subject opened out for her into unending channels of health and morals and general well-being . Her office work was too limited ? though she was soon keeping two men dentists busy in addition to herself ? and she began to plan and write text-books on dentistry for use in the public schools . She placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders from the city schools for the books for supplementary readers . One of these books , " Billy Forget-me-not " is as charming a bit of fairylore as a child could want , and all about his own little teeth . He knows his teeth when he gets through with " Billy " ? they are little pals and co-workers . For " Billy Forget-menot " is his own little tooth . And the little Portland tots come running to see their dentist and show her a new " Billy Forget-me-not " as eagerly and joyously as they would show a new baby in the family . For several years she  | has bean steadily in demand at state and natiorial. conventions , where she gives talks and papers and demonstrates her methods with children . One of the foremost dental authorities of America , John Philip Erwin , referring to her last visit to New York , wrote of her : " The late dental convention in New York had an inspiring character within its midst . . . a wee bit of femininity from Oregon who crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration for the oral hygiene campaign she has set in motion , and best of all to catch the patriotic spirit of the times which demands that every man , woman , and child do their part . . The silver-tongued words of that convention will vanish , the scientific papers be laid aside , and the skilful clinics give way to newer methods , but the spirit of devotion , of sacrifice , of determination to win , as exemplified by this loyal little lady , shall exert a lasting influence . Gentlemen , your hats off to Dr. Maud Tanner , of Portland , Oregon . " D there 's more : Cupid made his bow a A few months ago , and Dr. Tanner has a husband , though she continues to use her own name professionally . She confessed that with all her success , deep down inside she was miserably lonesome without a home ; that the coming of love has crowned her life . She and her husband , T. P. Scholes , are great comrades , working together in most things , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For what does the energetic little doctor do but get a semi-country home and a motor car . They have a garden , chickens , a cow , pheasants and pigeons and cats and dogs ? everything belonging to a genuine , back-to-the-soil home . And they manage the whole thing themselves , getting up every morning at 6:3o , which is nothing to an Illinois farm-raised girl . For dinner , a couple of broilers with half a dozen crisp vegetables pulled from the garden , and these two live like princes and potentates with never a thought of the high cost of living . Better still , the hours spent in this wholesome out-cf-door activity , compelling production from the soil , provide a perfect balance to her dental clay of patching up other people 's mistakes , and to his business day . " If men and women would spend their spare time in their own backyards instead of at clubs and movies , " the little doctor said , " they could cut the high cost of living in every way , for people who dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a tremendous wave of frittering going over the country . Every one is busy at things of little real value , . and mighty few of them helping to produce the food supply , over the high cost of which they are raising such a howl . I watch them from my windows here , streaming into the movies all day long , and I ca n't help asking . What right have you to complain about what it costs some one else to feed you ? Why are n't you cutting costs by raising your own food ? ' Well . the little doctor is doing it , and she never has a headache and dces n't know the meaning of nerves ? except those she silences in other people 's teeth .
