txt A young woman New York who came here to Usually look for work , after Is Kinder . graduation from high school in Denver . was found fainting in the street this week . Taken to Bellevue , it was found that she was suffering only from lack of food , and she was soon able to tell her story . She said that she had quitted Denver because " it was a tough ' place to get a job . " but she had $60 when she arrived , and , after hiring living quarters . " at a Y. W. C. A. , " she started out hopefully looking for a position , as a stenographer . This , , too , she found to be " a tough place ' - th which to search for employment . On Sunday all of her money was gone , and , as she put it , " I wandered about the streets without a home or anything to oat . " That may all be true , but the young woman need not have fallen into such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of and utilized any one of the several agencies in " the city that are provided to look after , help and guard just such persons as she . That the Young Women 's Christian Association would have turned her out Into the street as soon as , her little capital had been exhausted in the search for work is or ought to be incredible . According to the Truckmen executive secretary of Have the Merchant Grievance . Truck-a men 's Bureau , the present almost Intolerable street traffic conditions in this city will not be relieved until the parking of pleasure cars within certain large zones has been entirely forbidden . Speed regulations , he says , do not help at all . and the establishment of public parking places here and there has accomplished almost nothing , because the owners of cars simply do not use them when the result is being compelled to walk a few blocks to and from their offices or other destinations . Never much inclined to trusting their own legs as means of locomotion , the New Yorkers who own cars now do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of them , so long as it is permitted , will leave their cars for hours at a time wherever it is most convenient for themselves , regardless of the inconvenience they impose upon others . Truckmen , naturally , are most troubled by this habit , for they encounter long stretches of street where they can not approach the sidewalks for the purpose of discharging their loads . ' Their grievance is a real one , but it does not stand alone , and they themselves are so much of a nuisance when they do get a. chance 10 back up to the sidewalks that they should not be surprised if the riders in what they disparagingly call pleasure cars demand , if not the banishment of trucks from many streets , at least a restriction of the hours in which they can do their loading and unloading . Both of these Processes , too , might be done , it would seem , from the sides of the trucks , instead of the end . That traffic conWhose Car ditions in New York Shall are deplorable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? of commonest knowledge . Motor driven vehicles , potentially , are much faster than those displaced by them used to be , yet before they came it was possible to get around the city more rapidly and comfortably than now . The fact is that here , as elsewhere , the streets were designed for a service different from the one now delnanded from them . If they were two or three times as wide , things would be better ; but even then the ? conflict between crosstown and up-and-down traffic would remain , with its innumerable and almost endless delays for everybody . The real remedy would be one deereading the bit 19110*Vcre ? TOPICS OF THE TIMES . Whether public or private , each has about the same right as any of the others to use the streets . The first thought of almost everybody is that there are too many cabs , and that " cruising , " at least , should be prohibited .

It hardly would do  --  at any rate it would ruin the cab business , which is a legitimate and needed one  --  to rule that only when cabs are carrying passengers shall they be in motion . If any decree of banishment ever is issued , it will be against the so-called pleasure cars , and the city government that attempts to do that will find itself in water extremely hot . In reality , no- I body rides for pleasure in the city , and what inay be a pleasure car out in the country is one of more or less serious utility when it ventures into the crowded streets .

The reciprocating steam engine was a wonderful invention , but its best forms waste at least nine-tenths of the coal burned to move them , and the others much more . The turbine engine does better , but It must work at very high speed to be efficient , and therefore it is not easily adaptable to many kinds of work . The mercury boiler. it is said , will not have this fault , while it will come much nearer than does the steam turbine to the engineer 's ideal of getting out of coal all the energy it contains .
