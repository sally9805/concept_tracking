Earl Carroll 's Sketch Book . Early in this gaudy cycle there occurs a sound cinema of Comedian Eddie Cantor , who wrote the libretto , singing a song of his own devising called " Legs , Legs , Legs . " Thereafter a large and lovely group of girls attired in summery yellow dresses crowd out upon the stage , lie on their backs on an imitation grass terrace , raise their legs high in the air and wave them slowly to &; fro . This revel sets the pitch for the rest of the entertainment , which fulfills every standard-anatomical , luxurious , careless-that is associated with Producer Carroll . There is even a bath-tub interlude . Prominent among the personalities is Will Mahoney , a vaudeville Celt who clogs swiftly and loudly and takes terrific tumbles which are funny because he , as well as the audience , feels them coming long before they happen . Mr. Mahoney also smears part of his face with lampblack and burlesques Mammy songs in a way which should , but probably will not , eliminate them as legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote such fetching tunes as " Song of the Moonbeams " and " Kinda Cute , " not only rises mechanically from the pit , but moves slowly back across the stage and is ultimately hoisted high in air to accompany a hectic first act finale . <P> Producer Carroll says his Sketch Book will be an annual . <P> Bed-Fellows is a farce which might be enjoyed in remote farming sections where boredom sometimes inspires families to exchange husbands and wives . That is the plot of Bed-Fellows . The switch is legally accomplished , but the play 's title is , of course , never realized . Such things may happen but you can not stage them . After much raucous effort at humor and suspense , Bed-Fellows ends where it began , without a single inventive fillip to distinguish it from a score of other mediocrities . <P> Show Girl . Dixie Dugan lived in dingiest Brooklyn . Light of foot and heart , she obtained an interview with the great Producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr . by telling him she bore a message from his wife .

There was a penthousebroken aristocrat who tried to seduce her . Ultimately she was won by Jimmy Doyle , newsgatherer and Follies librettist . <P> Thus ran the story which J. P. McEvoy energized with Broadway chatter in his novel Show Girl ( 1928 ) . And thus runs the plot of the musical show which Producer Ziegfeld , as Writer McEvoy had planned , has energized with girls , Gershwin tunes , and spillings from the largest cornucopia of talent in the girl-show business . <P> Dixie Dugan is played by pert , agile Ruby Keeler ( " Mrs. Al " ) Jolson , whose reedy little voice blends naturally with familiar Broadway trebles . On the stage she is almost lost in the magnificence of scenes conceived by Joseph Urban , court painter to Producer Ziegfeld.
