For many purposes rubber from the guayule shrub is better than tree rubber , announced the U. S. Bureau of Standards last week after long research with chemists of the Intercontinental Rubber Co . This company ( Charles Hamilton Sabin , chairman of the Guaranty Trust Co. , is also its chairman ) has been cultivating this shrub ( the only shrub that so far has been commercialized ) in Mexico , California , South Carolina , Georgia and Mississippi . Thomas Alva Edison has an experimental farm in Florida . Others work in Texas . The shrub thrives in arid regions , and can be cultivated and harvested by machines . Last year guayule shrubs yielded 5,000 tons of usable rubber . But the U. S. needed 400,000 tons . The balance came from trees abroad . <P> In Brazil last week newspapers , politicians , and businessmen quarreled bitterly over the 50-year concession recently granted Henry Ford to cultivate rubber trees in the Amazon basin . By his contract he is permitted to engage in domestic and foreign trade without duty .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
