Easter , the solemnization of the resurrection of Jesus Christ , is the most important date of the Christian calendar . It begins the ecclesiastical year , yet is a variable holiday fixed for each year by a complicated equation of epacts , dominical letters and Golden Numbers . It falls on the first Sunday after the Pascal full moon , that is , the first Sunday after the ecclesiastical full moon on or after March 21 ( the vernal equinox ) . Therefore Easter can not come before March 22 or after April 25 . This inconstancy of Eastertide has irritated money-grubbing merchants , who long have surreptitiously , indirectly exported the spirited , springtime* surge of joy , light and purity felt by celebrants . People have stepped from decorating their altars to decking their bodies , until the Easter Sunday " parade " of fashionables and fops gets more notice in the lay press than does the sanctity of the holiday . This display of clothes and flowers and jewels and carriages , wily merchandisers have gloated over . None the less they have peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as they touted a robe as " hot from N ' York , lady , " or " new from Paris , madame . " <P> Last week the Manhattan Merchants ' Association stepped into the clear ; advocated a constant Easter ; stated in a bulletin that the second Sunday in April " will be " the date it believes will be adopted ; said further : " A late Easter often proves disastrous to sellers of many lines of merchandise because it shortens the spring season , thereby reducing the volume of business , while the lengthened winter season is of little benefit . With the adoption of a fixed date , all such difficulties will disappear . Clergymen were vexed . <P> * In Western Europe , the solemnization of the Resurrection early merged with the Teutonic spring festival in honor of Eostre , goddess of spring .
