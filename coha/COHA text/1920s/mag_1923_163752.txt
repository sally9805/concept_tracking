Those persons who have been concerned with the exploitation of Dempsey-Gibbons " fight films " know well that : <P> The Act of Congress of July 31 , 1921 , prohibits the interstate transportation of " any film or other pictorial representation of any prizefight or encounter of pugilists , under whatever name , which is designed to be used or may be used for purposes of exhibition . " <P> And that the statute , which was a result of the Jeffries-Johnson fight , is unusually strict , in that it forbids any person to take anything from the mails , or from any express company or carrier , which is forbidden to be transported , and provides for a fine of $1,000 or a year at hard labor . <P> Since , however , it is not illegal to exhibit prizefight films , the law has become almost a dead letter , except in cases where an attempt has been made to import prizefight pictures into the United States , when a customs inspection can be made . The reason is that if the pictures can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prevent exhibition . Congress can regulate commerce , but it can not prevent the showing of pictures any more than it could stop the sale of liquor before the Eighteenth Amendment . <P> Many attempts were made after the Willard-Johnson match at Havana to effect a lawful entry of the pictures of the fight . Finally , a camera was set up eight inches south of the boundary between New York and Canada . Eight inches north of the line a box was set up , and an original positive film of the fight pictures was run off through the box in front of an electric light . The camera and Canadian reel were so turned that an exact negative reproduction of the film was made . It was later rephotographed and a positive film was obtained for exhibition . It was argued that nothing was imported except rays of light , but the Federal Courts made short work of the argument .
