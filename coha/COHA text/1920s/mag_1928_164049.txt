SAFARI-Martin Johnson-Putnams ( $5 ) . <P> " ' Oh , I think it 's mean of them ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Johnson rushing indoors to her husband . <P> " ' Who ? ' I snapped , wondering angrily if the natives had been misbehaving . <P> " ' Those elephants . They 've been at my vegetable garden again ! ' " <P> The garden in question was located in the thick of African jungles , overlooking a beautiful lake , three weeks by motor from the nearest town , the capital of Kenya . Here dwelt for nearly four years Hunter-Photographer Martin Johnson &; wife , a pet monkey , a Boer mechanic , a native maid for Mrs. Johnson , nearly 200 native servants and an incredible number of supplies necessary for the making of good pictures , moving and still . Here meandered , day and night , elephants , " the good natured ( until roused ) bourgeois of the forest , " the always bad-humored rhinos , the stupid hippopotami , dainty Abyssinian bushbucks and their antelope and gazelle cousins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the carnivorous jackals , hyenas , leopards , lions , reptiles , nightingales , storks , flamingoes , etc . <P> But the greatest variety of beasts are on the open plains where the enemy-beasts can not sneak up so easily unnoticed . From a blind on the edge of a water hole , the Johnsons watched , photographed . Herds of oryx , the double-horned unicorn , wilde-beeste , kongari , eland , impalla , buffalo , zebra , came in turns to drink . Also the rare okapi . They respect and stand aside for the conceited and preening ostrich of the deadly kick . Zebra snap and fight among themselves continuously . Giraffes , " the creatures God forgot , " wander about nervously nibbling at the trees too timid even to drink . Defenseless against his fatal leap , they are the favorite food of Simba , the lion . <P> One day the late Carl Akeley , sculptor , taxidermist , proved to the Johnsons that lions that have never been hunted by man will not attack him . He showed them a valley inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , playing and sleeping . THEY WENT IN AMONG THE LIONS , spent two whole days photographing them . ( The movies are now being shown on Broadway ) . Had only one lion attacked them , they could not have escaped death in the general battle which would have ensued . The native porters , watching from a nearby hill became convinced that their masters had a godlike , supernatural power . All this is told perhaps better in Safari , the Johnsons ' book , than in Simba , the Johnsons ' cinema , currently showing .
