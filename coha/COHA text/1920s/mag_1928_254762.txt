Dr. George Walker has been practicing or teaching surgery since 1889 . He has been associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins University Medical School since 1905 . And , although primarily a specialist on ailments of the genitourinary tract , he has been studying the effects of cancer on his menagerie of 4,000 rats . So it was with considerable trustfulness that colleagues last week heard him explain a theory of treating cancer with heat . <P> Cancer cells perish at a temperature very close to 111 degrees Fahrenheit . If the patient could be heated to that temperature and kept so for at least half an hour without dying , Professor Walker hypothesized , he would be rid of the cancer cells . But human physiology has prevented the professor from performing a decisive experiment . In the base of the brain there is a kind of nervous thermostat which regulates the temperature of the body . If the body gets too hot or too cold the heat controller immediately strives to bring it back to the normal temperature of 98.4 degrees . <P> Professor Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will tolerate the high degrees of heat that he suggests be used to kill the cancer cells . <P> His difficulty approximates that of the roentgenologist who has learned that x-rays strong enough to sear cancer cells are more than strong enough to sear healthy cells . The cure can be as evil as the ill.
