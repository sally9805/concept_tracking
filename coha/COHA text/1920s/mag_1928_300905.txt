<P> In New York State , it is no great crime to spit in a subway car or on the street . It is no great crime to wake sleeping citizens with ribald songs , to walk on the grass . According to the State statutes these are only misdemeanors , minor offences which are not felonies . For a misdemeanor , a man may spend at most a year in jail , pay a $500 fine . <P> Maurice E. Connolly , for 17 years Borough President of Queens , N. Y. , has not been spitting , grass-walking , disturbing . But last week , in the Queens County Court House , he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the City in $29,500,000 contracts for sewer construction . Famed Lawyer Emory Roy Buckner , conducting the State 's prosecution , showed circumstantial evidence that Mr. Connolly had aided the late John M. ( " Gentleman Jack " ) Phillips to achieve a sewer pipe monopoly in Queens Borough . In 1917 specifications were doctored to require the kind of pipe that only Mr. Phillips could sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exorbitant . Lawyer Buckner dramatically displayed them on a chart . Mr. Connolly had the power to jockey contracts . He seemed to have awarded them as he wished . He mysteriously acquired thousands of dollars . Mr. Connolly , said many , looked like material for a long-time jailbird . <P> Famed Lawyer Max D. Steuer for the defense , employed his familiar theatricalities to emphasize the purely inferential nature of the testimony . The late Mr. Phillips , he said , was the true rogue . He had made more than $3,000,000 in graft . " I hope that to God he has made a satisfactory reckoning . " screamed Lawyer Steuer . The corpulent Mr. Connolly was pictured as the victim of persecution . But shades of the prison house still gathered about the ex-Borough President . <P> The haggard jury said GUILTY after 24 hours of bickering . Justice Arthur Sidney Tompkins gave the maximum penalty . Many were shocked . It appeared that conspiracy to defraud the city , when millions were involved , was simply a misdemeanor . Mr. Connolly was sentenced to a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had attained no greater stature than a subway spitter . <P> Engineer Frederick Seely , aide-de-camp of Mr. Connolly , was also convicted of misdemeanor . His sentence was suspended . Mr. Connolly had hardly spent two days in welfare island prison when Lawyer Steuer obtained a certificate of reasonable doubt on the conviction . Mr. Connolly was released on $5,000 bail . Glum experts figured that unless the grafters could be forced to surrender some $10,000,000 , the sewer conspiracy would cost every man , woman &; child in Greater New York $2.82.
