Colonel Carmi A. Thompson , suave among politicians , even more suave among business men , has become an oracle in the Philippines in less than a fortnight . Filipinos and Moros , little brown senators and big brown generals were curious to hear the personal representative of President Coolidge . Is he a meddlesome quack or is he a saintly surgeon come to mend their wounds ? <P> As an oracle , Colonel Thompson was a worthy successor of Apollo . His replies had a frank and sonorous ring , implied everything and committed themselves to nothing . <P> Example A : " Whatever conclusions I reach at the end of my survey , my report to President Coolidge will contain positive constructive recommendations regarding the future of the Philippines . " <P> Example B : " The Philippine Islands are approaching a prosperous era . " <P> Filipinos . Oracle Thompson was an interesting exhibit before the joint opening session of Filipino Senate and House . He was applauded half-heartedly ( Governor General Leonard Wood was not applauded at all ) ; he spoke of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . loyalty ; " he heard a unanimous resolution , agreed upon by both Houses , informing President Coolidge of the intense desire of the Filipinos for immediate , complete , absolute independence . Colonel Thompson had another entry for his notebook , along with the item that the night before he had drunk champagne to Mr. Coolidge 's health at the proposal of Manuel Quezon , president of the Senate . <P> Moros . Senator Hadjib Butu , representing Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago ( where Moros predominate ) , also visited Oracle Thompson . He promised to introduce him to the Sultan of Sulu when he traveled southward ; he told how Mohammedan Moros preferred U. S. rule to that of Christian Filipinos . Said Senator Butu : " The situation we face reminds me of the story of Joseph and his brethren in your Bible . The Moro looks up to the American as his father and upon the Filipino as his brother . Because of the love between Joseph and his father , his brothers threw him into a pit and left him there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippine domination . " <P> General Aguinaldo . Colonel Thompson reminisced on the Spanish-American war with the old insurrector , General Aguinaldo , who has now become a leader for the Americanization of the Philippines . He believed that many of the Filipinos would hate to have the Americans leave . Petite brown ballarinas had begun to like U. S. soldiers , sailors , wealthy businessmen , dance halls , automobiles from Detroit , clothes from Chicago . There is a possibility that General Aguinaldo may come out of his retirement to lead Americanists if Filipinos Quezon and Roxas continue their noncooperation policy toward Governor General Wood . <P> Rubber . While there seems to be a difference of opinion concerning exactly what the different peoples of the Philippines want , nevertheless U. S. business men have a substantial suspicion that Colonel Carmi A. Thompson wants to find a few hundred thousand acres for the cultivation of rubber by American industries .
