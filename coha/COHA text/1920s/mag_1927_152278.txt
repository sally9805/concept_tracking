POLITICAL NOTES <P> Bears . The U. S. Senate nearly lost its entire farmer-labor bloc lately . So the country learned when Senator Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota , lone farmer-laborite showed his friends some cinema films last week , taken by him on his vacation in the Canadian Rockies near Banff , Alberta . Upon the screen came three dark , fuzzy objects , moving about in undergrowth many rods away . The largest object struck an attitude of attention and started to approach the camera . Rushing rapidly , it soon proved to be a mother grizzly , charging to defend her whimpering cubs . She charged far enough for Senator Shipstead 's friends to see how an angry she-bear looks at 10 paces . Senator Shipstead 's friends wondered how Senator Shipstead looked at the other end of those 10 paces . <P> <P> Good Press ? Dwight Whitney Morrow , U. S. Ambassador-designate to Mexico , spent busy hours severing connections , settling his affairs , emptying desks and files in J. P. Morgan &; Co. ' s Manhattan office , whence he had resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as chief guest of Herbert Bayard Swope , energetic executive editor of the Independent Democratic New York World . Other guests , whose presence seemed to promise Mr. Morrow " a good press " in the U. S. after he reaches Mexico City , included Publishers Adolph Ochs of the New York Times , Ralph Pulitzer of the New York World , Roy W. Howard of the New York Telegram and 25 other Scripps-Howard newspapers , W. T. Dewart of the New York Sun , also General Manager Kent Cooper of the Associated Press ; also Editor Carr Van Anda of the New York Times , Julian Starkweather Mason of the New York Evening Post , H. S. Pollard and John H. Tennant of the New York Evening World and Marc Rose of the Buffalo News ; also Editorial Writers Walter Lippmann ( World ) and Rollo Ogden ( Times ) ; also Vice President Frank R. Kent of the Baltimore Sun . Among notable absentees was Editor Arthur Brisbane of the New York American , chief of the Hearst press . Mr. Brisbane was in Albuquerque , N. M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Hearst press when Arthur Brisbane wrote : " Mr. Morrow . . . is well fitted for the work that the President gives him . He understands finance , international relationship . . . " <P> " Suicide . " Commenting on complaints by Globe-flyers William S. Brock and Edward F. Schlee that the U. S. Navy had refused to help them , Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur last week said : " As long as I have anything to do with the Navy it will do nothing to aid and abet men to commit suicide . " <P> Seat . Governor Ralph O. Brewster of Maine told a convention of the W. C. T. U. in his state last week that " a Senate seat is now worth a million dollars to some men and interests . " The Governor 's phrasing made people think of seats on the N. Y. Stock Exchange , for which the latest price is $235,000 each ( TiME , Oct. 3 ) . <P> Father . " The meaning of a loss from a family of a youth in the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his parents centred upon his future can not be understood except by those who have experienced it . When that loss comes the sun is darkened , and from brightness the future turns to gloom . The map of life is changed in the twinkling of an eye . To a mother it seems hardly worth the living .
