txt Stockholders ' Responsibility . It is hard to understand the large amount Or attention that Professor P.Ipley 's recent article in The Atlantic Monthly has received , In view of the fact that the matters set forth therein have been recognized as true for a long time . The small stockholder in large American industrial and financial corporations has in theory a voice in selecting the directors of the same but he does not in practice desire such a voice . He prefers that the directors be selected by the comparatively few persons who are prominent in the industrial and financial world , thinking that his Interests will be best conserved by such a policy . The situation is admirably described by Mr- Henry S. Dennison In his letter published in today 's TIMES . We American people need very much to develop a desire for real democracy and a sense of personal responsibility , both in financial and in political matters . We as individuals do not care to give much thought to either of them , preferring to avoid thought by leaving these things wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " professional politicians . " Additional laws will not help us . Corrupt conditions in both financial and political matters will be overcome only by the slow , laborious process of individual thought and individual action .
