THE Wolf Pack had ravaged the towns and terrorized the region round about for four years . Then brave and decent folk got together and broke up the Pack and drove it out . But the wolf-leaders , Old Grizzle and Young Gray , escaped on blood-stained paws and took refuge in the grounds of a pious Small Neighbour , who was very particular about his legal rights . QI To him came the Community Council , and said , " Give us up those two wolves , that we may deal with them according to the law . " a " By no means , " said the Small Neighbour . " I belong to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Criminals . My estate is a sacred asylum . Besides , look at these two poor creatures , how harmless and playful they are ! They chase each other around like kittens , and if one nips the other nothing happens except an amusing yowl . They are converted and very religious . They afford innocent entertainment to many visitors , and bring me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you force me , and that would do disgrace to your own principles . " a The members of the Council , not being very subtle in these matters , looked at one another with Lloyd George eyes , ( the colour of which is changeable ) and doubted what to do . Qi . " Very well , " they said , " you shall keep your dangerous pets ; but you must keep them securely . Remember , you are responsible . " a " I am responsible , " answered the Small Neighbour , adding under his breath , " so far as may be consistent with my duties as an innkeeper . " Qi , Meantime the garden gates were left unlatched . One morning at dawn it was told that Young Gray , ( who was a Werwolf , ) had slunk away to his native jungle . Old Grizzle , gritting his teeth and slavering , paced nervously up and down behind the hedge . Along the borders of the northern forest joyful yappings were heard , and wild ululations of the other wolves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking . " Remember , " telephoned the President of the Community Council , " you said you would be responsible . " al , " Tell him , " said the Small Neighbour to his wife , " that responsibility has its limits for an innkeeper , and whatever happens we shall remain neutral . " a So he reloaded his pipe , ? and the Community Council , their guns , HAT famous representative of colonial aristocracy and breeder of prize cattle , the Prince of Bordentown , visiting Cape May , fell heavily in love with a gay , charming , young Princess of the Sea , and wooed her with such ardor that she consented to marry him , and they went to live in his ancestral mansion . a But in due time , his ardor cooled down to the mean temperature of the region , and her gayness was touched by drouth and frost . In the third summer , she met the young Duke of Seals at the shore , and yielding to his refreshing importunities very improperly went off to sea with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bordentown , ardent once more but in a reverse fashion , besought the Bishop of South-Central Jersey to pronounce an annihilating anathema against the errant Princess . fa " Softly , Sir , " said the Bishop , crossing his plump right knee over his plump left knee , " this is a matter which demands consideration . Did you make any promises to the late Princess when you persuaded her to marry you ? " Gil , " Oh , " said the Prince of Bordentown , " I suppose I did , ? a man will promise anything at such a time to make his point , ? a salt-water swimming pool lined with marble , an air-plane which could also be used as a submarine , unfailing devotion , and a gay time every day . " Qi , " Of course you kept these promises , " said the Bishop , crossing his plump left knee over his plump right knee , and smiling benignly . " Well , not literally and exactly , " replied the Prince of Bordentown , " for I found that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize cattle and a strict churchman . I thought that the late Princess ought to accommodate herself to the customs and traditions of Bordentown. " 1:11 , " H ' m , " said the bishop , uncrossing his legs , and looking with level eyes at his petitioner . " You thought the contract had only one side ; she must remain charmed and charming , while you were at liberty to become dull , morose , and neglectful . Let me tell you , Sir , that the word ' obey ' in the marriage service , has no such tyrannical meaning . A divorce no doubt the State will grant you lawfully , for the lady has grievously transgressed . But an everlasting anathema the Church will hesitate to pronounce in a case of marriage under false pretences . " HE THZT IA/CBE " ! SETH KNOWLEDGE INCRE4SETH SORROW. ? EccL. 1:15 ASTE R , " said the Young Fisherman to the Compleat Angler , " pray tell me how I may learn to distinguish the fish which is called a Fluke from that which is called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Compleat Angler , " are flatfish ; but the one is naturally flat and the other is temperamentally sharp . You can learn by experience to distinguish between them . " ( 11 , " But how shall this method be applied , " asked the Young Fisherman , " and how may I know that my studies have been crowned with success ? " ( II , " Success , " replied the Master , " is a comparative matter . But in this particular question , if you chance to catch a flatfish , you may explore his mouth with your finger . If he bites it off , you may be sure that he is a Fluke . " 111 , So the Young Fisherman caught a flatfish , and explored its mouth with his finger , and was sure that the fish was a Fluke . CI , " This is a certain way of learning , " said he , nursing his hand , " but it is costly . " Though in a land of pace thou art secure , yet how girth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17. : 5 HE mad river had gone down ; the land lay desolate . The sky was yet dark and lowering , and the people feared another deluge . Then said the Wise Man , " Let us build an embarkment . It may not be impregnable ; but it will safeguard us for a while ; it will give us time before the waters overwhelm us . Let every man bear a hand . " CI , But the Strong Man answered , " No ! I am too busy . I must not be entangled . Besides , I am safe , for my house is on rising ground . Moreover your plan is foolish , and your safeguard too weak , ? or too strong , ? I know not which . I foretell that it will come to nothing ! " CU , So the Strong Man withheld his hand . But the embankment was built . And the rains descended and the winds blew and beat upon it , and the waters rose and raged against it , but it stood , though shaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor thing , " said the Strong Man . " But now I wonder whether it might not have been better if I had labored on it ! " a So he sat watching the embankment , with fear and trembling in his heart , and'half an inch of water in his cellar . MEN OUGHT ALWAYS TO PRAY AND NOT TO FAINT. ? aura MAN saying his prayers in a quiet corner of the woods was disturbed by two voices disputing near at hand . As he felt unable to pray without giving his whole heart to it , he paused in his devotions , and went to see the disputants . He perceived that one of them was an obese Orator and the other a lean Scientist . ( II , " Sir , " said the Orator , " man is the noblest work of God . Look at me . Do I resemble an ape ? Nature is a mystery . You are - personally insulting and atheistic in endeavouring to unveil her secrets by what you call evolution , " a " Sir , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance to an ape is dubious , for your weight would forbid arboreal habits , though your manners are slightly simian . But will you tell me why you think I deny or dishonour my Maker by trying to understand the way in which He made me ? " 41 . , " You are irreverent , " shouted the Orator , " you disregard Holy Scripture , which says that the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground . " a " On the contrary , " replied the Scientist , " I accept that statement absolutely , and seek to verify it by tracing the method of formation . " ( II . " You despise the oracles of God , " cried the Orator . 0 , " You seem to ignore the works of God , " answered the Scientist . QL " Was your grandmother a monkey ? " roared the Orator . a . " Certainly not , " said the Scientist , " the latest evidence shows that monkeys were our ancestral foes . But permit me to enquire whether your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry ? " " You know nothing about it , " shouted the Fat One . " Very little , " answered the Thin One , " but I am trying to learn , whereas you make a boast of your ignorance . " So they passed down the forest disputing. ( 11 . " They seem quite angry , " said the man , " and I think the thin one had rather the best of it . But that is no reason why I should not go back to my quiet corner to finish my prayers , for I have many troubles ; and then to work in my garden , for it is a hard year . "
