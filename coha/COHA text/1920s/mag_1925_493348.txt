HANNAH MORE was the godmother of a great-aunt . Her picture is before me as I write , I sit upon one of her chairs , the slop ? ing grass outside is said to be imitated from her garden , and once I had a real mitten she knitted , but gave it ? away . The name of the picture is " Mrs. Hannah More and favorite squirrel . " They , too , are seated ? the old lady at a Chippendale table , the squirrel upon it . ' They face one another , they bend their necks with identical gesture , and the calm light of a hundred years ago flows in through square panes of glass upon the letter and the nut that they are opening . It must be Barley ' Wood , for she is very old ? Barley Wood where she hoped to die , but her servants mishandled and betrayed her . " I am driven , like Eve , out of Paradise , " she said , " but , unlike Eve , not by angels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discov ? ered licentiousness in the kitchen , in which even Louisa was involved . Who was Louisa ? A trusted orphan . Who on earth was Zachary Macaulay ? Mr. R. G. Trevelyan 's great-great-grandfather . Yes , here is the Hannah More of our tradition , fragile and philanthropic . The earlier Hannah , who quipped it with Garrick and scribbled it with Walpole ? she is less to our taste , she smacks too much of Louisa . Yet earlier and later were connected . Had it not been for Percy , a five-act tragedy in blank verse , I do not think she could have sat on that chair so calmly . She had received a certain amount of money from a gentleman who failed to marry her , but it was on the broader and more substan ? tial basis of Percy that her fortunes really rested . It held the stage for years . Poetry assisted- it ; when Mrs. Montagu read The Bleeding Rock she exclaimed : " Your ' Rock ' will stand unimpaired by ages . " Nor was she wholly wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other themes , cautiously descending the social ladder in the proCess , but never losing touch with the book ? sellers . The success of Parley the Porter and other tracts was enormous . Charles the Footman was translated into Russian ; Moses in the Bulrushes into Cingalcse . Two Persian noblemen called at Barley Wood and carried away a volume of Prac ? tical Piety for the use of the Shah , while of her full-length novel , Ccelebs in Search of a Wife , thirty thousand copies were sold in America alone . Her income was assured , and she and her sisters , having begun as Bristol governesses , were able to more into the country and practice philanthropy upon a commanding scale . - There were five of them ? Mrs. Mary , Mrs. Betty , Mrs. Sally , Mrs. Hannah , Mrs. Patty ? and though I have often encountered them in old letters and read praises of their gaiety and goodness , they have never seemed to me the least alive . Three sisters one can visualize , but who can get any con ? ception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the domestic to the conven ? tual ? ( Had Selina Mills kept faith , there would have been six . ) Five , all attaining the age of sev ? enty , all lively , hospitable , and jabbering , all sup ? pressing the Slave Trade and elevating the poor . Mrs. Minnah , thanks to her London flutter , was the best known , but shrewd observers thought Mrs. Patty the more formidable , and a letter of hers , which I will presently quote , confirms them . But oh , the schools and the hostile farmers ! Oh , the hostile curates and the appeals to the Bishop of Bath and Wells ! Lachrymose epistles , stilted dia.ries ? ( " Lord , look upon Cheddar , suffer not the work begun there to fail , " etc . ) . Abundance of strawberries and cream in the house . What can it - have been like ? It only becomes real to me in this . little picture , painted when the sands were running out . Here something faint and delicate emerges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir in the garden . The lovely provincialism of England takes shape , detaches itself from our suburbanism , smiles , says , " I like my books , I like my garden , I like elevating the lower orders , " and manages not to be absurd . Presently the old mistress will ring a bell , Louisa will fail to answer it , there will be horror , disillusionment , flight , the Industrial Rev ? olution , Tolstoy , Walt Whitman , Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb . But the glass is unshattered for the moment , and though all it mirrors is temporary , yet there exist in its depths gleams independent of fashion or creed . Surely she had charm , and her sisters some share in it also . Otherwise how explain the power they exercised from the depths of Somersetshire ? And perhaps there is some truth in our family tradition which declares that Hannah 's letters were altered by her editor , William Roberts , after her death , and that posterity will consequently never know the nature of her attraction . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ( writes her god-daughter ) " the recreant Knight of Devonshire , " which Roberts , thinking uncivil , I suppose , has altered into " the excellent and estimable Sir T. Acland , " two words that playful woman never used in her life . Somewhere else she began to me , " When I think of you I am gladerer and gladerer , " which he , thinking bad English , has done into " I am very glad . " Now if such an oaf as that will write a book , at least he should be honest . It is on the labors of the oaf that subsequent editors depend . Mr. Brimley Johnson , though he has done his selecting well , * can not hope to present a very arresting figure . Her piety , unlike her charm , can be documented . It centred round Sunday . The Protestant time-complex ( so much more tenacious than the Catholic complex of place ) had her in its grip . Recurring as it does once in every seven days , Sunday ended by making an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange corners . Going to the opera , like getting drunk , is a sin that carries its own punishment with it , and that a very severe one ( she writes in her youth ) . Thank my dear Doctor Stonehouse for his kind and season ? able admonition on my last Sunday 's engagement at Mrs. Montagu 's . Conscience had done its office be ? fore ; nay , was busy at the time ; and if it did not dash the cup of pleasure to the ground , infused at least a tincture of wormwood into it . I did think of the alarming call : " What doest thou here , Elijah ? " and I thought of it tonight at the opera . Sunday night . Perhaps you will say I ought to have thought of it again today , when I tell you I have dined abroad ; but it is a day I reflect on without those uneasy sen ? sations one has when one is conscious it has been spent in trifling company . I have been at Mrs. Bos ? cawen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out less , be ? came intimate with the Clapham Sect , and ended by thinking nearly everything sinful : " The word Trinity , you know , means three . I once lived in a street called Trinity Street . I do think it very wrong to give such sacred names to common things . " And " He who is taught arithmetic on a Sunday when a boy , will , when a man , open his shop on a Sunday . " For my own part I prefer her like this . She gained nothing by being broadmind ? ed , and what is the point of just being able to toler ? ate Gibbon ? She is more herself in the country , shocked and busy , and surrounded by her sisters . As to her work , it was good , if education is good . She taught the poor to read and wash themselves , observe Sunday , and honor the King , and before her day no one had taught them anything . They had taught themselves . Her desire to meddle in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in some ways she came nearer to village life than do those who approach it with respect . Unless her pupils were farmers ' sons she did not allow them to write , and she was horrified at the suggestion they should acquire history or science , while the suggestion that she had anything th learn from them would have evoked the French Revolu ? tion in her mind . Nevertheless , " if I know a little of anything in this world it is about the poor . " She shared their sentimentality , and that love of anni ? versaries and funerals which supplies the absence of art , and though she checked the vice which was their chief solace , she was not wild or stupid about it ; she could even accept help from " a woman of loose morals but good natural sense , who became our friend sooner than some of the decent and the formal . " If the destruction of instinct and the cre ? ation of an interest in the outside world are good things , then her work must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . Around her house for a radius of many miles the faint glimmer of education spread ? samplers and alphabets , the sparks of our present conflagration . The farmers , wiser than she , foresaw that in time it would be impossible to find a " boy to plough or a lass to dress a shoulder of mutton , " and that the evil old days might come back when the monks had preached Christianity from the top of Glastonbury Tor . The funeral of Mrs. Baber , not in itself a his ? torical landmark , may help us to realize the sisters ' outlook . Mrs. Baber died in August , 1795 . She was one of the teachers whom they engaged to help them in their schools . Mrs. Baber did her duty for many years , then she died , and rather fortu ? nately Hannah was away at the time . Patty takes up the pen , and produces one of the great master ? pieces of macabre literature . The lid has been re ? moved and she lets herself boil over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheddar , but alas I heavy grief and agitation render it almost impos ? sible for me to write another word . " It is a prom ? ising beginning : no short letter ever started with such a phrase . Images pour from her at once ? the black dresses , the little handkerchiefs through which the tears drip on to the earth . // 1 , Vherif the procession moved off , Mr. Boak , who was so good as to come to the very house , preceded the corpse , with his hatband and gown on , which , as being unusual , added somewhat to the scene ; then the body ; then her sister and myself as chief mourn ? ers : a presumptuous title amidst such a weeping mul ? titude ; then the gentry , two and two ; next her chil ? dren , near two hundred : then all the parish in the same order : and , though the stones were rugged you did not hear one single footstep . When we came to the outer gate of the church ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to her by bows and courtesies , we were obliged to wait for Mr. Boak to go in and get his surplice on , to receive the corpse with the usual texts . This was almost too much for every creature , and Mr. Boak 's voice was nearly lost ; when he came to " I know that my Redeemer liveth , " he could scarcely utter it ; but to feel it was a better thing . On our entrance into the church , the little remaining sight we had left dis ? covered to us that it was almost full . How we were to be disposed of I could not tell . I took my-old seat with the children , and close to her place . Mr. Boak gave us a discourse of thirty-five minutes , entirely upon the subject . They feared at one time Mr. till ? ing must have been taken out . If you could for a moment doubt my account , I would add that the undertaker from Bristol wept like a child , and con ? fessed that , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see such a sight . It is certainly worth going back over a hundred years , and nothing in Hannah 's own letters im ? presses me as much . Patty goes on from height to height : I forgot to mention , the children sobbed a suitable hymn over the grave . I said a great deal to them afterwards , and wrung their little hearts ; for I knew but too well that the world and young blood would make an excellent sponge to wipe out , full soon , the awful lessons of that day ; as we have not that ex ? alted opinion of the dignity of human nature that some gentlemen and ladies have . I promised to go next Sunday to open the school if I am able . I think I shall go on horseback . Then back again to her prey . She had longed to cry out and speak , " but I recollected that I had heard somewhere a woman must not speak in the church . Oh , had she been interred in the church ? yard , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then silence . We hear no more of Mrs. Baber , and not much of the emo ? tions that must for years have racked and sustained the sisterhood . No wonder they were suspected of " enthusiasm . " The line that divided them from Johanna Southcote or Elspeth Buchan was not too clearly drawn . Let us take one more peep at them , then lower for ever those venetian blinds . They are all to ? gether now , and with them is a younger virgin , Miss Selina Mills . Zachary Macaulay arrives to say goodbye : he is off to free some slaves in Sierra Leone . He wants to see the five Miss Mores , but he does want to see Miss Mills also . Hannah thinks this last wish undesirable , for Patty is pas ? sionately devoted to Miss Mills , and the harmony and usefulness of the house must not be disturbed . She makes excuses for the girl 's absence , and when he inquires if his affection is returned , she says " No , " telling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a secluded room , dashed in , and his Selina fell into his arms . There was a terrible scene , in the course of which the young missionary expressed his surprise " that those women who pos ? sessed the greatest share of intrinsic worth did not seem to possess that degree of estimation in the eyes of men which they merited : " He could have " bitten out his tongue with vexation " for making such a remark , still he managed to make it , and it was long before he and his bride were forgiven . In after years the offspring of their union , little Mac ? aulay Tom , visited Barley Wood and recited " all Palestine ' while we breakfasted . " Thus did time make amends , thus do the generations touch , and old Hannah , now sisterless and very gentle , ob ? served that But enough , enough . Release the squirrel , for he is also one of God 's creatures . Cover up the chairs . pursuing tears instead of laughs , they may , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keaton 's dumb solemnity was perhaps more touching in his frankly comic films than in this attempt at a sentimental one . Ste/la Dallas and The Tower of Lies are two long and pretentious films of very similar character and quality . They are both rather serious attempts at the realistic presen ? tation of the tragedies of simple lives ; and neither is a real success . It is apparently more difficult for the moving pic ? tures to be convincing with themes of this kind than with almost anything else . And the only way , aside from melo ? drama , in which we can be held by a story of country life like The Tower of Lies , is by being made to believe abso ? lutely in the reality of its people . An admixture of movie theatricality is here particularly conspicuous and particularly distasteful . None the less , it is perhaps unfair to blame all the defects of The Tower of Lies either on Victor Sea ? strom , who has obviously brought great intelligence and care to the direction , or on Lon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him in a role in which he seems miscast . The writer has never read the novel of Selma Lagerhif ? The Emperor of Portugallia ? upon which The Tower of Lies is based , but he remembers encountering else ? where in her writings the same mixture of poetic realism with sentimental melodrama that one finds here ; and he confesses to having suffered a similar malaise . Stella Dallas has , however , not even the advantage of a Selma Lagerltif to built upon . Though it includes some respectable elements , it is essentially a trashy moving picture based on a trashy story . I found it difficult to believe in the reality of the characters , with the exception perhaps of the young girl , played by Lois Moran , and the situations seem to me impossible . Stella Dallas , for all its touches of honest observation , is essentially an elaborate piece of hokum . An organization called the International Film Arts Guild has been founded for the purpose of reviving meritorious old films . They plan for the present to exhibit a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George M. Cohan Theatre and , if the enterprise proves successful , to take a permanent theatre and show a repertoire through ? out the week . Their first picture was Deception , a Ger ? man film directed by Ernst Lubitsch . This curious and rather interesting production , made soon after the War , deals with the wives of Henry the Eighth and appears to have been inspired by a strong anti-English animus . Henry the Eighth , well done by Emil tannings , is presented as a burly beef-eating Englishman , boorish , domineering , wilful , - unscrupulous , treacherous and cruel . It is a savage treat ? ment of an historical subject of a kind unconventional for the movies and perhaps such as could only have been arrived at by the imagination of one country applied to the history of another . At one point , the atrocious Henry is seen to tear up a scrap of paper .
