A Belgian soldier had a vision during the last German attack . He saw the whole earth , uprooted , dancing madly and monotonously to the music of Igor Stravinsky . Thus terrific , thus awful a genius does the Stravinsky of today appear to a handful of those who pretend to understand him . <P> His Petrushka was the beginning-a master 's tale of an individual tragedy made fittingly little to suit a puppet . <P> His Sacre du Printemps came next . To some people it was just a crazy progression of noises . But to others it was the primitive cry of a great horde . <P> Then came Les Noces and Stravinsky plunged into the realm of the absolute . Music hereafter was to be utterly objective , to stand alone , to find inspiration for itself within itself , for its own sake , not for the sake of those who should listen , not even for his , Stravinsky 's , sake . <P> Last week for the first time in the U. S. , Serge Koussevitzky 's Boston Symphony Orchestra presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its world premire last spring in Paris . <P> Sophocles told the story 2,000 years ago of ( Edipus , the kindly King of Thebes , Fate 's most luckless victim . Jean Cocteau took the Greek , made a text of it for Stravinsky , gave it to Monsieur J. Danielou who put it into Latin . In Latin , then , scorning all theatrical device , Stravinsky presented his ( Edipus . He had a speaker ( in Boston last week it was Paul Leyssac ) , to tell the story step by step . He had specific soloists-Charles Hackett for ( Edipus , Margaret Matzenauer for Jocast , Fraser Gange for Tiresias-and the Harvard Glee Club for his chorus . But they wore only conventional concert dress . They were forbidden to do any business , or to create any illusion . Illusion was to be the monopoly of the self-sufficient music . His music was to be absolutely untranslatable into program notes . <P> ( Edipus , Stravinsky holds , is his nearest approach to pure music , the expression of his most complete emancipation from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulas for themselves , he has overlooked the divine spark within himself , the spark that made the Sophoclean drama the greatest of human tragedies . In spite of himself , Stravinsky 's ( Edipus music is dramatic , tragedy-telling , alarming , dreadsome-in short , as exciting as any catastrophe , as comprehensible as any of the passions by which Fate works its will upon the simple soul of man . <P> Last week , Boston comprehended Stravinsky and shuddered . Said Philip Hale , dean of U. S. critics : " Stravinsky 's greatest composition ? Is it not the most important work that has appeared since Pelleas et Melisande ? "
