William Tatem Tilden has not been popular in France . A year ago at the St. Cloud tournament , the crowd disliked his patronizing attitude , his brusque commands to the ball boys ; one section of the stands hissed when he criticized a lineman 's decision . But when Rene Lacoste defeated Tilden in the finest tennis ever seen on the Continent , Frenchmen went to the cafes content . <P> Later , as everyone knows , Tilden was drubbed by both Lacoste and Cochet , in England and the U. S. France captured the Davis Cup as well as every important singles championship . <P> Last week , at the Hotel Carlton in Paris , occurred an incident that made Tilden almost popular among the Gauls . Drawings for the Davis Cup interzone finals between Italy and the U. S. were about to be held . " Where is Tilden ? " said a French official , " we can not go on with the draw unless the American captain is present . " <P> " Tilden is no longer captain , " said Joseph H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Then , Tilden came into the room , was cheered , and the matter was explained . A message had been received from the U. S. Lawn Tennis Association suspending Tilden from play in the Davis Cup matches or any other amateur tournaments , because he had written newspaper articles about the Wimbledon tournament . His defense was that his articles consisted of comment , not reportorial details . No hairsplitter , W. O. McGeehan , sportswriter for the New York Herald Tribune suggested : " There seems to be a simple and obvious solution for two of the most vexing current problems , prohibition and amateurism , and that is , to abolish them both . " <P> After the cable was read in the Hotel Carlton , Tilden cried : " I refute all charges . We will win the Davis Cup yet . I hereby apply for a job training American Davis Cup members for the gruelling matches ahead . " Baron de Morpurgo , captain of the Italian team , rushed up to Tilden , said : " I 'm sorry , Bill . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Baron grinned . But there was no doubt of the sincerity of Lacoste , who soon came to Tilden 's room to express regrets . <P> From bank to bank , from bar to bar , news of ousted Tilden spread . Even before EXTRAS appeared , groups of U. S. undergraduates were arguing bitterly about " a dirty rabbit-punch from back home/ ' The minority side of the argument was that " the young players were better off without Tilden bossing them around , anyway . " Frenchmen , almost without exception , said that Tilden had been treated unfairly. *They had heard a rumor that Lacoste was going to write articles for American newspapers. + The Parisian mind could not bring itself to understand what writing had to do with tennis eligibility . Not since Lindbergh had Paris become so worked up over an American phenomenon . <P> Next day , a handful of Frenchmen and several handfuls of U. S. tourists-500 in all-went out to the Roland Garros Stadium at Auteuil to watch the Italians and the U. S. younger ones play .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
