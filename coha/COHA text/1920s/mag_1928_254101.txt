A gentleman 's straw hat blew into the water , upsetting a sailboat . Yachts kept running into each other headon . In one race a blue sloop in front of all the rest had a collision with a swan and was forced off the course while hundreds of people watched the others , ship models , big in their grace , sweep on , racing in a regatta held by the Bureau of Recreation on a lake in Central Park , Manhattan . A deaf mute , one Raphael Freedman , won first prize with a boat made of aluminum . <P> A frail wind moved under dark skies , ruffling the water of Oyster Bay , L. I. , and filling the sails of some six-metre boats owned by rich men . Slowly the little fleet beat toward a buoy close to a sandy bluff , rounded the buoy , sailed back to the Seawanhaka Club where at sunset a cannon went off . The two boats in the lead-the Lanai , owned by Harry L. Maxwell , and the Saleema , owned by H. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in European waters this summer .
