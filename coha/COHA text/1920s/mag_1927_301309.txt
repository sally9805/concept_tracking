" Soon after we moved here , I took off the dirty old wall paper from the kitchen-several layers of it-and found , underneath , pictures of all sorts of birds . Some of the birds I recognized and some I had never seen . They were right pretty . <P> " About two years ago I got tired of them and so I got a can of good lead paint . . . and put a nice coat of paint all over the walls . <P> " A little later I got tired of the paint and put on green wall paper . Those birds have flown away for good , I guess . " <P> Thus James McGrath , railroad worker , occupant of rooms in a house on the upper end of Manhattan , Island . Experts in the restoration of paintings ruefully agreed that " those birds have flown away for good . " Ruefully , because the house where James McGrath lived used to be known as " Minniesland " and the land around it as Audubon Park . In " Minniesland " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trackless American wilderness , hirsute ornithologist and painter extraordinary of wild life . Beyond a doubt the palimpsest laid bare by Mr. McGrath on his kitchen walls was the work , casual or studied , of John James Audubon , who used the present McGrath part of " Minniesland " as a studio after he came to fame . <P> Prints of some of Audubon 's bird engravings now command many thousands of dollars . Audubon murals would have been a priceless haul for a natural history or art museum ; may yet be if art salvagers have sufficient ingenuity .
