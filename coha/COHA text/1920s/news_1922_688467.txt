txt Senators LA , FOLLETTE , NORBECK and NORRIS must be deeply gratified by the result of their labors to prevent the confirmation of PrEncx Bur= as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court . They were joined at the test by five Democratic Senators , including , of course , the irrepressible Mr. HEFLIN , in opposing Mr. BUTLER 'S confirmation . Presumably these Demo ? cratic votes were due to the pressure of that tolerant and useful tribunal , the Ku Klux Klan . Mr. BUTLER is guilty of being a Catholic , as Associate Justice is , as Chief Justice TANEY and Chief Justice WHrrx were . The " charges " against him were tenuous in the extreme . He was a " corporation lawyer , " a " railroad lawyer " ; in other words , a highly capable lawyer in large practice . This was the offense urged against Mr. WicicEitsuam when he was appointed Attorney General . He was an indefatigable prosecutor of the trusts , none the less ; and he has testified to the vigor and the value of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution of the Government case against the " packIt is hard to have any patience with the continual . bleating about " corporation lawyers . " As OLIVER ELLSWORTH , afterward Chief Justice of the United States , told JEREMIAH EVARTS , the father of WILLIAM M. , whose conscientious soul was disturbed after he came out of Yale by the question whether a lawyer ever ought take the " wrong " side , " any cause fit for " any court to hear is fit for any law " yer to present on either side . " Mr. LA FOLLETTE and the others , along with our omniscient " intellectuals , " do n't want Judges with a judicial mind . They want Judges committed by belief and habit to seeing only one side of labor cases and cases against corporations . The appointment of Mr. BUTLER ought to have been confirmed before . Nearly ' four weeks ago Chief Justice TAFT urged the Judiciary Subcommittee to do something as soon as possible . Tho Supreme Court finds it hard " to keep up with its work , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to retire Associate Justice PITNEY has been passed anti signed . The appointment of his successor should not be delayed .
