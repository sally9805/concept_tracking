What with cool weather , plentiful rains , promising crops and the honor of the President 's visit , northwestern farmers , cheered , encouraged , no longer plan to name their children after Senator McNary and Congressman Haugen . So , at least , many a caller has assured the President . Onetime ( 1919-23 ) Governor Samuel R. McKelvie of Nebraska , overnight guest at the State Lodge , stated that most Nebraska farmers frown upon farm relief of the McNary-Haugen type , ( i.e. , with a price-fixing feature ) but are open-armed toward extension of co-operative marketing and liberal financing arrangements ( such as the Administration is expected to offer as a compromise relief measure ) . <P> Presumably with no punning intent , State Senator S. E. Ainslee of South Dakota introduced into the South Dakota legislature a resolution to name a mountain after the President in return for the " high distinction " received by South Dakota in having been selected for the President 's vacation . The resolution , concurrently passed by South Dakota Senate and House , changed the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coolidge . The mountain has hitherto been known both as Sheep Mountain and Lookout Mountain . Thus the South Dakota legislature showed more ingenuity than the legislature of Vermont , which last winter sought to name a mountain for the President , was baffled on finding every Vermont peak already christened . <P> Senator Peter Norbeck of South Dakota has long been a mild insurgent . Recent events have encouraged Administration supporters to believe that he will continue to be mild but no longer to be insurgent . His repeated visits to the White House were considered to have helped much in determining the President 's choice of the Black Hills for his vacation . He has taken a paternal interest in Custer Park , and the President 's visit has given that locality advertising which a million-dollar publicity appropriation could hardly duplicate . When the President 's special train entered South Dakota , Senator Norbeck boarded it at the head of a welcoming delegation . At the State Lodge he has been a kind of master of ceremonies , ushering this and that visitor into the President 's presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hiram W. Johnson in 1924 and the McNary-Haugen bill during the last session of Congress , Senator Norbeck has thus somewhat conspicuously identified himself with Conservative Republicanism as headed and personified by the President . With Administration control of the Senate indeed shaky , the conversion of Senator Norbeck ( has he been , or should he be , converted ) would be a valuable by-product of the western trip . <P> " You look nice and sweet and pretty , " said the President to Naomi Gill , seven-year-old Sioux Indian girl , pupil at the U. S. Indian School in Rapid City . The President had just completed reviewing 1,200 South Dakota National Guardsmen when he discovered that 54 Indian girls , aged from three to thirteen , had also lined up for inspection . Said one of their instructors later : " These children are deeply patriotic . Seeing the President did so much to gladden their hearts . And when the President actually spoke to them their joy knew no bounds . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
