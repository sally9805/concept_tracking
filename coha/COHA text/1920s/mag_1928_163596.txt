The peoples of five Great Powers* received a clear though diplomatic warning , last week , that the French Republic has no intention of subscribing to the simple multilateral treaty " renouncing war " which was submitted to the Powers , last fortnight , by U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg ( TIME , April 23 ) . The French warning went to the Powers , in the form of an alternative treaty draft , proposed to take the place of the Kellogg Treaty . Inspection showed that Foreign Minister Briand of France had felt obliged to so qualify the expression " renouncing war " as to emasculate it of all meaning . The Briand Treaty is in six elaborately weasled articles , whereas the Kellogg Treaty contains but three which are explicit , lucid . The first sentence of Article I of the Briand Treaty runs to 112 words , is typical , may be instructively quoted : " The high contracting parties , without any intention to infringe upon the exercise of their rights of legitimate self-defense within the framework of existing treaties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such treaties constitutes a hostile act , solemnly declare that they condemn recourse to war and renounce it as an instrument of national policy ; that is to say , as an instrument of individual , spontaneous and independent political action taken on their own initiative , and not action in respect of which they might become involved through the obligation of a treaty such as the covenant of the League of Nations or any other treaty registered with the League of Nations . " <P> Further the Briand Treaty provides that violation of the pact by one of the signatories releases the others from their obligations ; and that the Treaty shall not come into effect when signed but await the decision of the signatories at a special conference called to determine when it shall become operative . <P> Such a document is wholly grotesque , a Pact of Qualifications , not a Pact of Peace . Yet Aristide Briand has won the Nobel Peace Prize ( TIME , Dec. 20 , 1926 ) , and his policies are the epitome of pacifism . Only in unprecedented circumstances would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . <P> The circumstances are that Frank Billings Kellogg has rather cleverly out-maneuvred Aristide Briand at a game of diplomatic chess which has been going on for nine months . M. Briand made the first move in good faith when he proposed to sign a treaty outlawing war simply between France and the U. S. ( TIME , July 4 , et seq . ) . <P> Such a pact would not have conflicted with the numerous European alliances and commitments of France . But Mr. Kellogg countered with a proposal to make the treaty a multi-power affair . By insisting upon that point he has gradually forced <P> M. Briand to admit , in effect , that France is bound by commitment , which obligates her to go to war under certain circumstances . Therefore she can not sign the simple , blanket Kellogg Peace Pact . Doubtless most other foreign Powers are similarly circumstanced , and possibly even the U. S. Congress would refuse to bind the U. S. by the Kellogg formula . But meanwhile the U. S. Republican Party should reap political profit by forcing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must refuse for the present to sign a treaty " renouncing war . " <P> <P> *The U.
