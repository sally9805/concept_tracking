Gulping mail clerks at Southampton , England , last month reported a " $500,000 mail robbery " from sacks ferried abroad in the Leviathan . The ship was detained at Southampton during a long investigation . Not until last week did she get back to Manhattan . By that time the Leviathan robbery had shriveled to some $10,000 worth of valuables actually removed from some 1,300 registered letters . The thieving had apparently been done after the Leviathan docked at Southampton . Suspicion attached to a British member of the crew .
