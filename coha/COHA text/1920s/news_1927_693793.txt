txt The big airplane in which Lieut . Commander Noel Davis and Lieutenant Stanton H. Wooster were to attempt to fly to Paris some day next week lay twisted and broken in a marsh near here today and Davis and Wooster were dead in the Portsmouth Hospital . The plane crashed in the last of its many tests and the two pilots were suffocated by gas fumes and water as they lay in the crushed cockpit , upside down in the mud . The plane was loaded almost to its maximum capacity , a dead weight of 17.000 pounds , as it rose slowly and sluggishly from Langley Field this morning . It needed room to get up speed and there were trees in its path . As it turned to the right it lost flying speed under its heavy load , slipped downward to a landing on a marshy bit of land and splashed into a pool of water . It buried its nose in the opposite bank , the tail sticking up in the air , and Davis and Wooster were trapped without a chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those watching it could hardly realize what had taken place . Davis had been Cull of confidence that he had overcorns all the difficulties he had encountered in testing , and had gone to the field feeling that the final test would be successful . That it was dangerous , he as well as every other pilot knew , but he regarded the risk calmly and felt that it was no greater than is always undertaken In testing a heavy plane under full load . Was Confident of Test . The night before he had talked over the long distance telephone with a member of the staff of Tiss Naw Ironic Tndzs in New York . " We 've got her loaded full and are only waiting 41r a good day to hop off , " he said cheerily . " I think we have licked all our troubles and I guess we will be in Paris as soon as the rest of them . It looks pretty good . " His final word to his mechanics was that he would take off in the morning if the weather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Davis woke his men and said that he would take off . When the ground crew , Kenneth J. Bodecker , field engineer for the Wright Motor Company ; F. F. Roberts , naval mechanic from Anacostia , and Andrew Sergeant , mechanic for the Keystone company , which built the plane , leached the field in front of the hangar , Commander Davis and Lieutenant Wooster had started the motors and were warming them up . The huge yellow plane trembled and thrust against the chocks as the motors roared . The massive tires bulged a little under the great load . The wings , pale yellow in the morning light , shook under the thrust of the propellers as if eager to be away . Davis and Wooster walked about looking over the motors , listening to them for the slightest hint of trouble , and , clambering into the cockpit , tested the controls . Each motor was tried separately , roaring to a furious crescendo and then dying down as another was speeded up . The plane had been off the ground several times with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each time she had lifted quickly and easily and Lieutenant Wooster had set her down again when she returned without the slightest indication of strain . This morning she weighed 17 , - 000 pounds . 0,000 of which was gasoline . The huge centre tank was filled and the big tanks in the wings were full also . Had a Mile to Take Off . When the , plane was ready Davis told the mechanics to go down the field and stand far apart so that they could measure his takeoff . He had pointed out the day before the point at which he expected to leave the ground and said that ' if he was not off , at that spot lie . would cut the motors off and try again . The course was from directly in front of the hangar across a wide , smooth held . toward an open space between the dirigible hangar and some trees , about a mile away . There was almost no wind when Davis and Wooster climbed into the high cockpit , sheltered by glass . The nose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusually long distance . like a snout , with the - centre motor at the end of it , and the cockpit was directly back of this , between the motor and the huge main tank . Davis waved'his hand and the chocks were taken from the wheels , Down the field ahead of him the mechanics were spread out in a long line . Near the dirigible hangar a little group of men and officers watched . The motors were opened wide , roaring with the ear-splitting din of their combined 700 horsepower , and the plane trembled and began to move . It moved slowly and sluggishly with its heavy load , as had been expected , then gathered speed and dashed over the slight impressions in the ground , its tail straight out behind . Wooster was nursing the plane with every bit of skill which had made him one of the best pilots in the navy . Down the line , past mechanic after mechanic , the cumbersome yellow ship sped , growing lighter and lighter on her wheels as the wings began to lift , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Twenty-seconds , thirty seconds  --  the spot - Which Davis had selected as the limit of his run was reached and passed . Still the motors roared . It is hard sometimes for a pilot in these huge machines to know when they have left the ground . Forty seconds passed , and the plane had slid 200 feet beyond the spot , and then the wheels lifted a little , slowly , very slowly , and it could be seen by the anxious watching men that she was in the air . Still Wooster kept her close to the ground , gathering speed before he began to climb , and finally , as men held their breath , he began to lift her . She did not respond quickly ; she could not with the terrific load , but she lifted about fifty feet , and was very slowly going higher . She was still about fifty feet in the air when the line of the dirigible hangar was reached . Everything might have gone well if there had not been a line of trees in he way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the big army bombers drop their missiles every day in practice . Day after day the Davis plane had- swooped over these trees in trial flights  --  never before had they offered a hazard . But now with the load and slow climb they stared Davis and Wooster in the face , a menace that might wreck them and all their hopes . Wooster turned slightly to the right . Turning a heavy plane with full load at low altitude is always a dangerous thing . When a ship turns it loses flying speed and with that load every bit of speed was needed to keep it in the air . The huge plane began to slip and lose height Quickly Wooster sensed what had happened , and straightened out again . He knew he was in for trouble now , just as did every flier on the ground who was watching , tensely . Recovers , Then Drops Swiftly . They hung on every movement of the plane . It seemed to recover and then began to drop again swiftly , and the pilot looked about with anxious eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him was the Back River , a tiny stream , and across that some mud flats in front of the little fishing village of Messick . It was as disheartening a place in which to look for a landing spot with a plane weighing eight and a half tons as could be imagined . A little to the right was a tiny peninsula in front of Messick , a small strip of green , marshy land , and beyond it a pool of water about seventy-ave feet across . It did not look very deep , perhaps the plane could plow through it , and it was Wooster 's only hope . He turned again slightly to the right , about a quarter return . and again the plane dropped faster . If he had been higher he could have gained speed with which to keep going when straightened out , but the ground was close beneath . Wooster headed straight for this little spot of green . the ship partly out of control , fighting with every bit of his skill and resource and courage to right it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship came down well : it seemed for a moment that Wooster had conquered it . The right wheel touched . the left still slig , htly in the air . the tail dropped down r:id the plane started in a long skid across the wet ground . Then the left wheel dropped and the most difficult of all feats that of landing a ship of 17,000 pounds without breaking the ground gear had been accomplished . If the ground had been hard the plane and the lives of Davis and Wooster might have been saved . Above  --  LIEUT . COMMANDER NOEL DAVIS , U. S. N. In Oval  --  LIEUT . STANTON H. WOOSTER , U. S. N. field , and It is believed that Commander Davis asked her to stay indoors during the test so that she would not have the anxiety of watching hira take off on what was to have been the last , and was known to be the most critical and dangerous test of all . She was told shortly after the accident of her husband 's death , and those at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been married only a few years and were devoted to each other . Wooster was a warm friend of both . Coommander Davis 's satisfaction with his plane and his assurance that it would do what he required of it made today 's accident the sadder , because when he took off this morning he felt that he had overcome what at first seemed almost insurmountable obstacles . His specifications called for a plane ' which would carry enough gasoline to give a 4,000 miles radius , 400 miles further than Paris , and sufficient to overcome bead winds or storms which might be encountered in the crossing . But when the plane was delivered be found that it was about 1,000 pounds overweight . Those at the field were of the opinion that no one was to blame for the accident . Both fliers were men of long experience In handling large airplanes , and had carried out their tests with great skill and caution , Commander Davis had said repeatedly that he would not take his plane off for Paris unless he was satisfied that it fulfilled every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with its performance . There was almost no wind at the time , and what there was might have gotten under the tail of the plane when it was turned . This would cause it to lose much of its lifting capacity , although some who saw the accident said they thought the breeze was on the tail of the plane when it started , and any change in direction would have been a change for the better . Army Board to Investigate . An army board was called to investigate the cause of the accident and to determine whether any one was to blame . This is done at every accident on a service field , and the board will convene tomorrow or Wednesday . at Langley Field . The bodies of Commander Davis and Lieutenant Wooster were removed to the field hospital and then taken in an airplane to the Norfolk Naval Hospital , from which they will be taken to Washington . The officers at Langley Field were greatly grieved at the deaths of Davis and Wooster , for whom they had the greatest esteem . The mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane were almost overcome with grief . They had worked with both officers before and there was little of the barrier of rank between them . Commander Davis 's sixteen months ' old son , Noel . Jr. , was with a nurse at the Commander 's home at Lee Heights , Va. , near Washington . Mrs. Davis informed the nurse of the death of her husband this morning and made preliminary plans to take his body to Pensacola , Fla. , from Washington . Mrs. Davis is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John A. Merritt of 619 Baylen Street , Pensacola , and she plans to take the body there for burial . A brother . Richard Merritt , and a sister , Mrs. Doris Rule , are expected to meet her in Washington tomorrow . When Commander Davis made arrangements for his flight he obtained the cooperation of the American Legion and linked his flight up with the coming convention of the legion in Paris . That gave the plane its name . and the ship was officially named by Mrs. Davis at Mitchel Field about ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis returned to Norfolk two days later to resume tests . PICKED BIG PLANE CAREFULLY . Davis Was Pleased With Great Power and Confident of Success . The plane in which Commander Davis and Lieutenant Wooster were killed was an unusually large and heavy machine , but one which the Commander believed admirably adapted to his purposes . He had selected it after careful calculations of all the available big craft in the country . It was a slightly new type called the Pathfinder . built by the Keystone Aircraft Corporation of Bristol , Pa . It was a biplane with a wing spread of 67 feet and was 48 feet long . It was powered with three Wright Whirlwind J-5 motors , an improvement on the motors which Commander Byrd used on his North Pole flight . These motors were also used on Byrd 's plane and the Bellanca . The fuselage was built of tubular steel welded together , a very strong construction . The landing gear was also heavy , built to stand up under an enormous strain . The fuselage and wings were standard wings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and the problem of construction was a new one . However , Commander Davis said the day before he was killed that it had satisfied him in every detail and was the best large plane he had ever flown . The plane had thick wings of great lifting capacity which more than made up for the heaviness of construction . The plane had to be strong to carry the weight of gas needed for the transatlantic trip , 1,500 gallons . One remarkable thing about the accident was that the pilot was able to land his plane with full load aboard , 17,800 pounds . without crashing his landing gear . Commander Davis had intended to drop this gas while in the air by pulling a rip cord attached to the dump valve at the bottom of the tank , so as to avoid the lines ed of landing with full load . " ' Hots Cool in Emergency . As the plane touched the ground Wooster or Davis cut the switches . Two fishermen standing on the little promontory , so close that they almost had to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed and were silent as the ship landed . An airman 's first act in making a forced landing with danger of crashing is to cut his switches to prevent fire . The pilot 's minds were working with all their usual coolness . Those back at the dirigible hangar saw a splash and water thrown high in the air as the plane plowed through the pool of water . It reached the other side . piled up against the edge and with startling suddeness turned over on its nose . The tail stuck up at an angle of about 45 degrees , the nose buried in the mud , and the cockpit half submerged . Just what happened to the gallant airmen inside is not yet positively known . It seems probable that they were suffocated by mud and the fumes of gasoline from the broken tanks in the wings which leaked down into the cockpit . As soon as the plane crashed Bodecker , Roberts , Sergeant , with Lieutenant and Captain Scott got into a rowboat near the dirigible hangar and rowed frantically across the Back River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshy ground where the plane landed on one wheel and tail skid and slid across into the water . The left wing was completely smashed , and the centre motor was buried in the mud . There was no movement in the cockpit which seemed half filled with water , but not enough to drown the fliers . Fliers Were Not Crushed . The rescuers struggled frantically to lift the plane enough so that they could smash open the cockpit and reach Davis and Wooster . The pilots were still in their seats , slung forward over their straps , which had not been unbuckled , so quickly did disaster overtake them , and so faithfully had they stuck to the task of attempting to get their plane under control . There were no marks to indicate that they had been killed in the crash by impact , although Commander Davis 's face was slightly cut . It was found that the wing tanks had been broken in landing , and gasoline was leaking down into the cockpit . The main tank semed also to have been cracked so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its straps and had not moved mire than an inch . But the entire forward part of the fuselage back to the cockpit had been smashed in , and the centre motor torn loose . It was still in the mud tonight . The plane had been in the air not more than fifteen minutes from the time it took off at 6:20 o'clock and had flown only about three miles from Langley Field in its slow , drooping glide . Lieutenant J. K. Nissley , Captain R. C. Cocke and a number of other officers went to the scene of the accident soon after the first boatload of rescuers had reached there and helped to right the plane . Colonel C. C. Culver , commandant of the field , with several officers and Mrs. Culver , flew over in an army blimp , Mrs. Culver insisting on going so that she might aid the men if they were still alive . Mrs. Davis , wife of Commander Davis , was not on the field at the time . She and Commander Davis and Lieutenant Wooster have been staying at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the
