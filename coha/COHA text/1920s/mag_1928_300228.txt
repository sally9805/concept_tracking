. . . How the hell can we work <P> When there 's no work to do ? <P> Hallelujah , I 'm a bum . <P> Hallelujah , bum again . <P> Hallelujah , give us a handout . <P> Revive us again ! -U . S. Workers ' Song . <P> The Federal Reserve banking system stabilizes the U. S. money market . Might not some form of " reserve " be set up to stabilize the U. S. labor market-a national job reserve ? <P> Dr. William Trufant Foster , Boston pedagog-economist , director of the Pollak Foundation for Economic Research , and Waddell Catchings , Manhattan manufacturer-financier ( shoes , collars , cans , rubber , motors , fruit , cereals , dairy produce , drugs , magazines , cinema ) , collaborated lately on a book in which they suggested that all U. S. markets would be steadied if the governmental agencies of the U. S.-federal , state , municipal-would map out and authorize large programs of public work which will be needed eventually though not immediately . Let these programs then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as labor and fiscal indices show or predict a slump , local or national . Then let the contracts , hire the men , buy the materials , do the public work , convert the slump into a boom . <P> President-Elect Hoover knows all about Collaborators Foster &; Catchings . They are the kind of citizens with whom he likes to think and work . Their " road to plenty " has much the same idealistic ring as his own " abolishing poverty . " Their job reserve plan served as an exegesis of his own campaign promise of a large continuous public works program . So he authorized Governor Brewster of Maine to explain the job reserve at the Governor 's conference in New Orleans last week ( see col. 1 ) and to announce it as an outline of the Hoover plan for protecting Coolidge prosperity . <P> As outlined by Governor Brewster-with such joyous phrases as " in the twinkling of an eye " and " like the house that Jack built " - the job reserve is to consist of some three billion dollars worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , translating them at judicious moments into sweat-producing , belly-filling , back-covering jobs for labor , and into cash-registering orders for business will depend upon the extent to which federal , state and municipal legislative bodies and officers can be persuaded and helped to " cooperate " ( Hoover 's favorite word ) . Also , patience and discretion will be required in large quantities to discriminate between public works needed now , public works needed tomorrow , and public works which will never be needed at all . The last category - joy of the pork barrel experts , sorrow of the tax-payer-is what will be watched out against by hard-headed businessmen who may suspect the job reserve idea of being " utopian .
