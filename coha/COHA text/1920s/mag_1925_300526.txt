Almost all men-from the strong boy who can bite pieces out of a crowbar , to the grubbiest , most dissipated little street sheik-believe that they secrete in their right arms a power that will maim and devastate . Some go through life without ever suffering a disillusion on this score ; others have their prayer , " Just gim me a sock at ' em , " gratified , but administer the sock only to find that it has small effect . It lands fearfully on the point of a jaw , and the recipient smiles and shakes his head as if a drop of water had landed on him . This is usually enough to discourage most sockers . In Buffalo last week , it discouraged Jimmy Goodrich , who was at the moment lightweight champion of the world . He had just socked Rocky Kansas , challenger , flush on the button . It was the middle of the second round . Throughout the first , Rocky ( a hairy 133-pound bullyboy , battered and be-cauliflowered by innumerable brawls ) had come plunging in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up for 15 rounds . Goodrich waited his chance . Kansas was standing off to loop a left to the head , when he sent across his sock . Wham ! With all the leverage of his springy body behind it , his right fist encountered the other 's jaw . Rocky did not waver . Oof ! Again the big right-hand sock . Rocky came tearing in . ... He was flogging Goodrich 's red ribs when the gong clanged for the end of the 15th round and the referee stepped forward to indicate that he-Rocky ( " Bleeding " ) Kansas-was the world 's new lightweight champion .
