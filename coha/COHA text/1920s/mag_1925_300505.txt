Despatches at length announced the long expected appointment of Senator Victor Henry Brenger to succeed Ambassador Nosky Georges Henri Emile Daeschner at Washington . Observers recalled that Senator Brenger is Reporter General of the Budget to the Senate ; that he came to the U. S. as second ranking member of M. Caillaux 's ill fated debt mission ( TIME , Oct. 5 , Oct. 12 ) and that he is almost as widely known as a financial expert as Finance Minister Loucheur . <P> Since M. Brenger will continue as a Senator , he will come to the U. S. on a " temporary appointment " renewable indefinitely every six months . Because M. Caillaux is generally thought in France to have cut his visit much too short for successful negotiation with Secretary Mellon , it is widely rumored that Senator Brenger comes as a sort of " permanent diplomatic conversationalist " to keep the French debt negotiations amicably simmering until they can be definitely pinned down to a fixed sum . <P> Finance Minister Loucheur gave out the following statement : <P> " It is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Caillaux that M. Brenger is leaving for the United States soon as French Ambassador , and we hope that when an accord is reached the French franc will follow the upward course of the Belgian franc and Italian lira . . . . " <P> Raconteurs , dwelling upon the personality of M. Brenger , recalled that a Washington correspondent once asked the 58-year-old Senator to name his favorite form of sport or exercise . Came the short-clipped answer : " L'escrime , la natation ! * Mais , mes distractions sont les voyages , la lecture et la promenade ! " + <P> *Fencing , swimming . +Travel , reading , walking .
