When the Senate sits again ( Dec. 3 ) , merry will be the smiles , hearty the chuckles , wise the " cracks , " between Republican Floorleader Curtis and Democratic Floorleader Robinson . Campaigning against each other will have altered their mutual feelings no more than it altered the lack of feeling between the Messrs . Smith and Hoover , who never met . " Charlie " Curtis and " Joe " Robinson are friends as good &; old as are " Charlie " Curtis and that other " Charlie , " Vice President Dawes , with whom Senator Curtis last week shook hands and beamed at cameras on the Capitol steps . <P> The Vice President-elect had not , of course , hurried to Washington to ask the Vice President for his gavel or for parliamentary pointers on how to preside over the Senate . For the gavel Senator Curtis can have no use until the business of the Short Session is completed and he has resigned as Senator and has been inaugurated . For parliamentary pointers the Senate 's new president , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabot Lodge ( 1924 ) , has about as much need as a grandmother has need for instruction in baby-washing . <P> What the Hon. Mr. Curtis undoubtedly did discuss with the Hon. Mr. Dawes was : who shall succeed Senator Curtis as Republican floor-leader ? <P> Senator George Higgins ( " Red Hot Stuff " ) Moses of New Hampshire , brisk , sanguine , ironic , emphatic , is the Senate 's President Pro Tern. , i.e. , first deputy when the Vice President leaves his rostrum for a snooze , stroll or conference . Senator Moses was Hooverizer of the East , another reason why he " rates " the position . Seemingly , only one thing could keep Senator Moses from being elected second-most-important man in the Senate chamber . That thing would be the same thing- whatever it was-for which Senator Moses was restrained from being his really dominant self in the Hoover campaign . The only imaginable thing that this thing could be , is that Senator Moses not infrequently admits that he is a Wet . <P> Quite as Wet at heart but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the redoubtable Committee on Committees , whose claims to leadership will be that he was Republican Whip ( assistant leader ) under the Lodge regime and that he is undoubtedly one of the most knowing politicians in the business . He can explain his opposition to the Hoover nomination by referring his fellow Senators to the presidential spark burning in all their humble breasts . Senator Watson was mentioned as a possible successor to Leader Curtis and a very likely candidate for President Pro Tern .
