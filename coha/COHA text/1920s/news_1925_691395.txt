txt At last the invasion of England by the French , so much dreaded in the time of NAPOLEON I , and productive of such amusing tremors at one period of the reign of NAPOLEON III , has come . French dressmakers take their models to London . They exhibit them in caf  --  s and dance clubs . They comfort their clients with cocktails . They bring them to the right tempo with jazi . They show them frocks that are a vision and a desire and send them home on approval . In case of sale , they fit Lnd m4ce alterations in them there . And pot in cafes and cabarets only  --  parents of most evils  --  are these alien artists found . Some are sheltered in hotels . Worst of sal , " society ladies ask them to their houses ; and sonfe of these offenders , as the Secretary of the London Employers ' Association writes , " are the " wives of our leading public men , " and while the husband is professing " his concern about unemployment " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ex " pease of our own employers . and " workers . " This is a serious charge , and letters from " British Dressmaker " and employers are pouring in on the press . Will not the Government , more or less platonically devoted to protection , protect the British dressmaking industry from these marauders ? Shall work be taken from the British workers , who , through collective bargaining of their unions , get reasonable wages and conditions of employment , payment for overtime and holidays , and given to underpaid Parisians , executing the orders so easily obtained in London ? The British employers make no objection to a French firm which has an establishment in London and pays rates and taxes ' as a British firm would ; but this business of getting orders , to be filled abroad , by means of temporary foreign exhibitors , ensconced in hotels , caf  --  s , houses of " distinguished hostesses " and free of " overhead and taxes , must be stopped . What would happen to an English dressmaker who tried to ' take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whale of a duty. , It is likely enough that she would see " a very large por " tion of her collection turned out " onto some dirty bench at the Cus-. " toms and ruined . " Apparently this is more than a teapot tempest , for the ' Inland Revenue officials are resolved to collect from the invading foreign dressmaking firms income tax on their English business : but that would deal with only one part of a situation that includes rents , wages , collective bargaining , unemployment , " work for the British worker " . and " business for the British employer . ' " As usual , woman is the cause of all this woe . Surely there must be enough British dressmakers doing ' business under French names in London . to supply " French gowns " for British women ; but Paris is full of English tailors , and it is vain to resist the magic of . foreign names , though they so often cover natives . If it be ? said that France , famed . in all great arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least the conservative London ladies should remember their principles . Besides , there has lately been a Symposium " in Paris on " chic . " The weightiest , if not the majority , opinions seems to hold that the clothes do n't make the wearer " chic . " The wearer makes the clothes and the whOle appearance and Personality " chic . "
