Most potent of those who moved from North China to Nanking last week was Ihe estimable Marshal Yen Hsi-shan , famed " Model Governor " of Shansi Province . <P> Although Shansi has long since federated with the Nanking Nationalist Government , Marshal Yen has delayed coming to Nanking , giving a typically modern alibi- " appendicitis " ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) . <P> Chinese alibis being what they so often are , it was freely rumored that Yen and his Shansi were at best holding aloof and at worst were likely to attack Nanking . Last week , however , the Marshal pompously approached " Southern Capital " upon his private train , accompanied by wife and retinue . At the station stood slender , waspish President Chiang Kaishek , and strapping War Minister Feng Yu-hsiang . As Yen joined Chiang and Feng , press photographers snapped " China 's Big Three . " <P> Shortly , Marshal Yen Hsi-shan was installed as Minister of Interior of the new Nationalist Government . At last it could be said that a single Cabinet contains all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appropriate if not imperative to explain just what the Nationalist State is . Available last week was much new and authoritative information which may be summarized thus : <P> The new Nationalist Government is not a Republic but an Oligarchy or Dictature . In many organic details it resembles the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics - " Russia " - and the Fascist State created by Benito Mussolini . <P> Theoretically supreme and sovereign is the Congress of the Nationalist Party . This is by no means a democratically elected body . Its members represent the Party alone , much as the new Italian Parliament will represent not the " People " but the Fascist Party . <P> Actually supreme at Nanking is the Central Executive Committee of Forty-Six , which recalls by its title the Russian Central Executive Committee . The Chinese Committee is technically responsible to the Party Congress ; but the Congress can not assemble except by order of the Committee , which is supreme when the Congress is not in session . <P> Responsible to the Central Executive Committee are the Political Council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political strategy bureau . The latter is unique ; but may be called a super-cabinet . The President of the State Council or super-cabinet is Marshal Chiang Kaishek , who is by courtesy " The President of China . " <P> Subordinate to the State Council of 16 are the five Yuans or Divisional Councils . The first of these , the Executive Council , is the Cabinet , comprising 10 ministries : War , Interior , Finance , Foreign Affairs , Agriculture and Mining , Industry , Commerce and Labor , Education , Communications , Railways , Health . <P> The second Yuan is that of Justice , headed by the great Chinese jurist Wang Chung-hui , onetime representative of China on the World Court . The third or Legislative Yuan is a large council of from 49 to 99 members , with parliamentary initiative . The fourth and fifth Yuans are those of Examination ( " Civil Service " ) and Council Control ( having powers of impeachment and audit ) . <P> Though this system of Government may seem complex and anomalous in the extreme , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committees , Yuans and Councils .
