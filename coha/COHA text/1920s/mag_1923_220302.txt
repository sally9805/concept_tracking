The Boston Transcript ( to Henry Cabot Lodge a very , very Boswell ) is apparently unable to take Mr. Lodge 's Senate confrre , William E. Borah seriously . Mr. Borah plans a trip to Russia this summer and has let that fact be known . Says The Transcript : <P> " Lenin is not in good health at all and needs something to amuse him , something like Beerbohm Tree 's Hamlet , which Sir W. S. Gilbert said was funny , without being vulgar . Trotsky needs distraction and Litvinoff has a sense of humor and there is no earthly reason why Senator Borah should not have a really good time . . . <P> " At the same time we are sure that a man who is so fond of reading as Senator Borah , will not forget the experience of that other investigator , Little Red Riding Hood . We do not think that the Soviet Government would eat the senator limb by limb , but we should be much surprised if it did not pull his leg . Lenin and Tchitcher are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private diplomacy . " <P> That is an excellent example of what is known as " Smart Aleck " writing .
