What might one find there ? That is the Op-at-ion to which wo shall seek an answer . Man will not be satisfied tati ; ' he knows . -I plan to lead an expedition to explore that reon , Starting in the fall . This will not be a dash to the south pole , far from it . We shall stay there for months , perhaps for a year and a half , in an effort to procure scientific : iko  --  rnation about that unknown continent . , . a ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten ellentistbiologiste , zodlogista , ornithologists , meteorologists. and experts id Study the magnetic forces and fields around the south pole . : It is my theory that in the antarctic region there lies a great area of land not covered by snow . 4In the antarctic summer , which is ? Dr winter , the antarctic continent should be warmer than the arctic during its summer , because during the etlithern summer the earth is closer to the sun . On lowlands in the arctic , ' lien the sun strikes , it melts the snow . This Would be the case at the north pole itself if it were lowland . It:is only in the higher areas that there is perpetual snow . As yet such 0.1139.9 have not been discovered in the a. paretic continent . There has been little exploration ( 14vni there for two reasons- First , the eyes of man have not been turned towards the south pole as they have been turned towards the north , and sicond. the ice which surrounds* the south pole makes it less accessible . Two Routes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and there have been two lines of March toward it . one by Amundsen from one end of the great ice barrierl and the other made by Scott from the I other side of this barrier . Now this ice barrier lies in the . Ross sea , south oeNefilr Zealand , and it is the best apptjaach which has been discovered to the south pole Itself , which lies a thousand miles away . It Is either send ice or snow and has a great many creases . Scott and his companions on their return from the polo got within fifteen miles of the depot , where there was food , when a raging storm came up and helil them to their portable tens until they starved and froze to dc.ath . We are making plans which we be lieve will protect us from such a fate . There is one great difference tween explorations in the north polartr and south polar regions . In the sum-mer there is not likely to be storms polar regions these storms spring up frequently and with terrine violence . Therefore , aviators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meteorology themselves and should take along the best meteorologists available . The great ice barrier to which I have referred ranks as one of the natural wonders of the world . It is 400 miles wide and 400 miles long towards the pole and 200 feet thick , solid ice which some scientists , Including Amundsen , think rests upon ground . May Start in September . We hope to accomplish our mission in two , trips . The first one will be a preliminary expedition . Wo are not yet ready to announce definitely when we will leave , but probably the earliest date at which the barrier could be reached would be the first part of September . The expedition will leave the Uzaited States some time in the fall , going try way of New Zealand to the ice which lies north of the Ross sea at that time of year . Ten we would have to drive through the ice ' in which many ships have gone down . . We expect to have a personnel comparable to that of our arctic expedition ? about half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which will be a three engined plane and one a one engine plane . Both of them can be equipped with pontoons , if necessary , to fly from water over snow where the pontoons can be changed to skits . The smaller airplane will be used for reconnaissance work and for finding landing places for the larger plane . We also expect to take with us dog team drivers and fifty doge with sleds . These will be utilized for many purposes , They will haul supplies from the edge of the let ) 11/ ) to our main base . They will help put down bases along the route to the polo . The scientists will use them on subexpedi . Lions of their own . Plan Base Every 100 Mites . We intend to establish bases every hundred Miles , so that in caao of a forced Landing of planes We can walk from base to base . So far as is known there is no food in the antarctic continent , whereas there are seals , polar bear , and smaller game in parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antarctic continent are there birds , seals and whales . On this preliminary expeditihn we will probably go down to the ice barrier on a whaling ship . On our first trip to Etah , the northernmost Eskimo village in the world and the base which Peary used to attack the north pole , about 1,750 miles away , we bad to buck considerable ice as late as July . We had less than a month for operation after that . If we reach the ice barrier on the south the first part ... of . September we will have until the first of March for operations , ? We should then be able probably to get enough information and to put down enough bases to be able to penetrate far into the antarctic continent the following summer season . If we succeed In this we may not ha-vo to remain through the arctic night , which lasts about six months . We will , however , go prepared to stay a year and a half .

We hope to reach the south . pole with our plane . And since the south polo is land , we hope to stay there a day or two for scientific observation . As for personnel . Floyd Bennett , my ao  --  leader on the north polar expedition , and Neville and Balchen , who are with me now , will be along . Also Mulroy and Demas , who helped us prepare , this present expedition and who were with us in the arctic .
