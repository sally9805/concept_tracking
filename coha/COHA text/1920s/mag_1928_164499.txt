Last Sunday morning the biggest news in Chicago was a black headline across the top of the front page of " the World 's Greatest Newspaper " : MAX MASON QUITS U. OF C. <P> In no U. S. metropolis is the president of a university as important a local figure as the president of the University of Chicago . His name is put on reception committees , figures in civic drives . He is a bigger frog in Chicago than Nicholas Murray Butler is in Manhattan . So it was indeed news last Sunday when Max Mason , 50 , resigned as president of the University of Chicago , to become director of the newly-created Division of Natural Sciences of the Rockefeller Foundation of Manhattan . Chicago regretted his resignation , for his three-year administration on the Midway had been energetic , progressive .
