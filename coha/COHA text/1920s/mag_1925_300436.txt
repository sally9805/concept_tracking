Last week two bright quizzical French eyes twinkled no longer . M. Leon Bourgeois , at 74 , relaxed in death the cares of state which had absorbed a career of 49 years . <P> Having held many portfolios and tired of them ; having been Premier for six months ( 1895 ) ; having declined a nomination for President of the Republic ( 1912 ) , he long remained the revered adviser of Presidents . During the War he was Minister without portfolio in Briand 's all-party cabinet . <P> Then the League of Nations seized his imagination . Under the leadership of Wilson he helped draft the Covenant . In 1919 he received the Nobel Peace prize . On Jan. 16 , 1920 , he presided as first Chairman of the Council of the League at its first meeting in Paris . In 1923 he resigned the Presidency of the French Senate , which he had held since 1918 , in order to devote himself to the League . The recent session of the League Council found him too ill to attend . But he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League . "
