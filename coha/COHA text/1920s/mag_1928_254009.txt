A fortnight ago Mrs. Bertrand Russell , author of The Right to be Happy , wife of the English philosopher , was refused the privilege of speaking before the " mixed " Student Forum at the University of Wisconsin on the subject : . " Should Women Be Protected ? " This subject involved companionate marriage , in which Mrs. Russell is a firm and earnest believer . President Glenn Frank of the University of Wisconsin had been consulted by the Student Forum and had approved of barring of Mrs. Russell ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . <P> Last week both parties had some explanations and tart reminders . <P> President Frank : " Despite some picturesque and vigorous editorial comment to the contrary , neither the present existence nor the future guarantee of free speech for students and teachers at the University of Wisconsin is in any way involved in the Dora Russell episode . <P> " . . .
