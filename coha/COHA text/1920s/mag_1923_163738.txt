The fall of the mark has so demoralized wage values that 60,000 men employed in the Berlin metal industries have struck . <P> Three-cornered negotiations between the Government , the companies and the workers broke down . The Government proposed a wage of 10,000 marks an hour . The workers demanded " real pay for real work " ; a sliding scale of wages based on the cost of living was urged . The Government feared it would add to the depreciation . The companies said a wage which varied each week would make it impossible to quote prices in doing business . The workers said that 15,000 marks an hour was the minimum on which a worker could live . They also demanded an immediate bonus of 500,000 marks . <P> Communistic elements are thought to have fomented this key-industry strike . A revolution is the hope of the Communists and Monarchists , who see an opportunity to regain power .
