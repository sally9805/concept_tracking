In tropic climes , on opposite sides of the twirling globe , shrewd men watched anxiously , last week , the struggle of Great Britain to maintain her world monopolistic grip on rubber . <P> From the East Indian realm of plump and prim Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands came challenging news that rubber production there has topped 93,000 tons for 1927* , an increase of almost 400% in five years . <P> Half ' round the world , in huge Brazil ( a land larger than the continental U. S. ) another challenge to British rubberdom was being prepared , last week , by bustling agents of Henry Ford . He , grown tired of paying British rubber prices , has purchased an immense tract of land near Belem , northern Brazil , which is now being laid out as a rubber plantation . <P> A third threat to British rubber supremacy looms in the Negro republic of Liberia , West Africa , where the plantations of Big White Rubberman Harvey Firestone are now in process of producing ( TIME , Dec. 20 , 1926 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend her grip on rubber ? <P> Despatches from Brazil , last week , told that a British rubber syndicate is about to negotiate for a new plantation close to and competitive with that of Henry Ford . This move was hailed by the Brazilian press of Rio de Janeiro , last week . <P> With such portents as these in evidence , it is significant to note that while the British Empire produced 67% of the world 's rubber in 1922 , the percentage fell to 57 last year . This was due , of course , in part , to the curtailment of British rubber production by Parliament under the Stevenson Act . Theoretically this measure was expected to intensify the demand for rubber and consequently raise its price by curtailing the supply . The actual results have been so unsatisfactory that last week a leading British newspaper in Malaya , The Malay Mail , declared : " In many quarters restriction is regarded today as on trial for its life , and unless tangible results are achieved in bringing supply closer to consumption in the near future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the law of supply and demand free sway are likely to receive a considerable accession of strength . " <P> That this view is coming to be adopted even in London was shown when Prime Minister Baldwin recently appointed a commission to report upon the advisability of repealing or modifying the Stevenson Act ( TIME , March 5 ) . Already the price of rubber has fallen in anticipation that the Commission will report against further curtailment ; and it seemed last week that the British Empire has been definitely forced out of its monopolistic position in the world rubber market . <P> <P> * Roughly 1/6 of the World production of 580,000 tons in 1927.
