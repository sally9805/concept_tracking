txt Amid continual hoots and jeers from the Labor benches in the House of Commons , the Government opened today the debate an its " Trade Disputes and Trade Unions bill , " which would forbid all general strikes . " You wasters ! You blackguards ! You ratters ! You thieves ! " Such were a few of the epithets shouted at occupants of the Government benches by 1their bitter opponents . The constant interruptions made a farce at times and almost a failure of the opening debate . All hopes of a distinguished or even an exciting discussion of the bill , which is the most contentious item of . legislation introduced into Parliament for a decade , were nullified by ceaseless interjections , which seldom rose above the level of paraphrasing the word , " liar . " " He 's telling lies all the way through ! " cried Will Thorne , Labor member from Plaistow . A Laborite Is Ousted . " The Minister is a liar from his head to his foot ! " shouted Jack Jones , ebullient Labor member from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker . Faced by these interruptions , Sir Douglas Hogg , the Attorney General , who moved the second reading of the bill and opened the debate for the Government , coula only deliver by fits and starts what he had evidently intended to be a coldly legal exposition of the points in the measure . He began with a guarded ' promise to accept in committee any amendments the object of which were not to defeat the main principles of the bill . The Government , he said , stood by four axioms : First , that a general strike was illegal and that no one must suffer for refusing to participate in it ; second , that intimidation was illegal and no man should be coerced ; third , no contribution to a political fund should be compulsory ; fourth , civil servants owed undeviating loyalty to the State . The only question , said Sir Douglas , was whether Parliament would be wise to inscribe these truisms in the statute as " merely fussy . " The answer , he said , lay in the general strike of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small minority in control of trade union machinery could ruin the country from political motives , which one Judge , Mr. Justice Astbury , in a decision arising from the results of the last general strike , had declared Would Balk Extremists . The second justification for the declaratory legislation embodied in the bill , he said , was that moderates in the labor movement , although beaten once , might succumb again to those extremists who looked on the last general strike as a first rehearsal . Labor leaders , he said , had been exaggerating the scope of the bill . Industrial strikes , whether sympathetic or not , would still be fully permissible , provided they were directed only against employers . Those strikes alone which were not purely industrial but directed against the Government or the community , were to be made illegal . The test was to be an action which the Attorney General would be empowered under the bill to bring before the courts upon any threat of such a strike in order to prevent trade union funds being used in support of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , of confiscating those funds , but before the strike was declared , every one would know whether it was legal or not . The Attorney General then went on to explain why the bill had omitted to penalize a sympathetic or general lockout as well as strikes of the same character . This part of his speech did not seem to carry conviction even to a section of his own followers , while the Labor members merely laughed at it . His argument was that sympathetic or general lockouts did n't happen , and if they did it would be simpler to take over the employers ' works under the Emergency Powers act . He indicated , however , that the Government , to prevent misinterpretation of the bill , would be ready to submit employers ' associationc to its provisions . Justifying the limitation of picketing , Sir Douglas instanced 7,000 prosecutions under this head last year . The permission of peaceful picketing , he asserted , developed into license for pickets to do anything , including indirect intimidation by threats , to a workman 's family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , there must be no treachery in the State 's household , such as occurred last . year in three civil service organizations affiliated with the Trades Union Congress . Reply by Clynes . T. R. Clynes , who rose to state labor 's case against the bill in the absence . of Ramsay in the United States , said the fight which the Government had chosen to begin would only commence when the bill was placed on the statute book . It was untrue to say the bill was only a declaratory law , he said , since the issue of the general strike had in fact not been before Mr. Justice Astbury when he gave the judgment referred to . It would be the duty of the Opposition , he warned , when it becam- , the Government , to repeal the act immediately . The general strike was not the cause of this bill , but only was made the occasion for it , he insisted . It was an elaborate denial of everything in the practices of organized labor . The bill meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might strike , they must do nothing to make their strike a success . They must not even make wry faces at a " scab . " " Why this Government solicitude for blacklegs ? " he asked . The bill 's stipulation that members of trade unions must contract to share political levies if they wished to contribute to them , instead of contracting not to share in them if they did n't , as at present , was said by Clynes to be an attempt to prevent the Labor Party from obtaining funds . It was a poor party , h declared , and could not " raise money by selling honors and offering ' beverages . ' " The two sections in the country which would most welcome the bill , he asserted , were the Communists and Conservatives . It would play into the hands of extremists and the forces of disorder . A law conceived in the spirit of this bill could not last very long , he observed , since it clearly sprang from class hostility and political vindictiveness . Liberal Attacks Bill . E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill . Sir Henry Slesser , Attorney General of the late Labor Government , showed that the bill would require severe amendment if it went only as far as Sir Douglas Hogg maintained . Later Conservative speakers declared the bill would be a workman 's charter and it ' was the claim of one of them that conservatism had nurtured the trade unions that caused Tom Griffiths , Laborite from Pontypool , to leave the House , screaming insults at the Conservatives as he went . A striking feature at the close of the night 's proceedings was a moving appeal by L. A. Spencer , Labor member , who was expelled from the Labor Party for bringing about a district settlement between a body of coal miners and their employers during the coal strike . He declared that unless something on the lines of the bill were accomplished unionism would be shattered by its extremists and its present leaders would be smothered in its ruins . The bill , he said , was the only salvation for the future Socialist Government from its revolutionary friends . After Mr. Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
