txt HARRT A. CH AND= of New Brunswick , N. the mail-carrying aviator who crashed into a tree near Bloomsburg , Pa. , Tuesday night and was terribly injured , showed the qualities expected from the military flier rather than of a man engaged in the peaceful work of transporting letters . Forced by fog to descend in what proved to be a field of growing oats , he must have known that it was a. bad place from which to start again , especially as it was dark . He had more than an excuse , therefore , for remaining where he was until morning . but to do so seems not even to have occurred to him . He had his mail to deliver on time at Bellefontaine and the honor of the Air Postal Service was involved . So CHANDLER , after such little examination of his surroundings as he could make by the light of his burning flares , started his engine and taxied off through the oats toward the dimly visible Susquehanna River . He struck a big elm at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . Near-by campers swam out and saved him from drowning . This is the first bad accident that has marked the aerial mail service in the Eastern district since it was started . It Illustrates the dangers to which all of the fliers engaged in it are exposed on every journey , for , in spite of all that has been done to decrease the perils of night flying across mountainous country , they remain many and large , and the aviators so feel it their duty to get through the allotted distance on schedule time at almost any risk that they take what to almost anybody else would seem to be needless chances . That spirit was magnificent and heroic in the war . and it is so still , of course , but the managers of the service should see to it that the men do not carry it too far .

Now the books have been so well advertised by these demonstrations of filial piety that their authors probably have high hopes of seeing them classified among the best sellers of at least a week or two . In neither instance will the indignant sons find that the defense of the father 's memory has accomplished anything . Captain WRIGHT 'S harsh ' reference to Mr. GLADSTONE was quite unnecessary and in the worst of taste , but so minutely can it affect the established reputation of the Liberal statesman that it well might have been ignored . The aspersion of Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL in an anonymous book of " Uncensored Recollections " was of a different quality . As this second book has been out for two years , and long since forgotten by all except a few specialists , it does seem that WINSTON CHURCHILL would have been wiser not to add his well-ripened grievance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLADSTONE 'S angry sons .

The winning of this victory is marked by the admission of women at last to a full share in all that the Royal College of Surgeons can give , and as it has the reputation of being among the most conservative of British institutions , there seems to be no excuse for maintaining any of the other rather vague disqualifications which still vex the souls of England 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to handle the scalpel after what would have been proper training for men  --  and if anybody would trust them to do it . Many do have that confidence , nowadays , and though women doctors still are far more numerous than women surgeons , the latter have as a class a record of at least average efficiency , and some of them are admittedly as skillful as the best of men surgeons . That they are is a bit surprising , not because of any essential inferiority of women , but because , through all the ages , they have not had the training in the handling of tools which naturally gives to men a special aptitude for the doing of such work . And surgery does require an aptitude of much the same sort that is needed to make a good manipulator of tools in other domains .

Unfortunately for that city , however , denials do not travel so fast or far as accusations , and already the dreadful score of 270 murders in a year has gone pretty well all over the world and everywhere has become the subject of comment by people glad of a chance to proclaim their own superiority to a neighbor . The Mayor of Chicago protests that the 270 waa the number of killings , not of murders . and that not a. few of them were the highly commendable shooting of dangerous criminals by the Chicago police . That is a legitimate defence of the city 's reputation , but the Mayor should remember that the figures to which he objects were collected and promulgated by Chicago statisticians , and he may have noticed that some of the Chicago papers put the 270 in big headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record .
