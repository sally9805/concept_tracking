The first , a tabloid , is the offspring of the second . Both are published by Col. Robert Rutherford McCormick , 47 , and Capt . Joseph Medill Patterson , 49 . Col. McCormick devotes most of his time to the Tribune , while Capt .

Andy &; Min Gump became world figures and the Tribune Tower was built ( Col. McCormick chose the site and Capt . Patterson suggested the $100,000 contest for an architectural design ) .
