txt As if New England 's investment temper has not already been sorely tried , the common stock of the American Sugar Refining Co. , which has long rested upon a pedestal of popular confidence , is daily making new low prices . Selling at 85% yesterday , the stock is lower than it has been since 1893 when it sold at 6131 , and is only 8 points above the record low since incorporation of thecompany-in 1891 . Of the $90,000,000 stock- ( mit-Preferred and hall common ) *ss , uso , tuu  --  or as a-ave ? as held in . New England , and $36,499,400  --  or over 40% ? in Massachusetts alone . Of 22,311 shareholders , 15,027 re . side in New England , and 10,402 in Massachusetts alone The steady liquidation of American Sugar stock reflects the growing fear of stockholders that another investment idol is proving to have feet of clay . The company went behind $10,886,000 last year , reflecting the big slump in sugar prices from the 24%-cent peak . At the beginning of this year duty-paid raws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are feat cents and 5% cents respectively . These declines mean , naturally , a further shrinkage on inventory account for American Sugar . At the end of the 1920 year , the corn . pany was carrying merchandise and supplies at $45,405 , - 154 . All of ? this was not sugar , but doubtless three-quarters of It consisted of raw and refined stocks on hand carried at considerably above current market prices , In view of the decline in sugar , the necessity for operating the company 's refineries at only part capacity , plus the certainty of losses as yet undetermined , although probably of large amount , from repudiation by its customers of contracts , it is probable that 1921 will be another distinctly unsatisfactory year from an operating standpoint . It is understood that the company earned its dividends in the first quarter of the year , but not so much can be said for the present quarter . For the balance of the year it would seem as if only an altogether unlikely recovery in sugar prices would enable the company to avoid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon two non-operating income items for a considerable portion of its total net . For instance ? in 1917 interest on loans and deposits amounted to $1,006,002 . In that year , however , the company 's cash balance ranged from $22,000,000 to $40 000 000 whereas at the beginning of the present ycsr cash was down to 88,839,232 . Income from this source will probably be relatively small for 1921 . From investments , including some 590 , 913 shares of miscellaneous beet sugar stocks the company received income of $5,202,893 in 1918 ; $4,314,095 in 1919 ; and $4 , . 289,185 in 1920 . As beet sugar producers are hit as hard as any other group in the present sugar depression , they will naturally pay much less in dividends this year than in preceding years . As a matter of fact . Great Western Sugar common , of which American Sugar Refiing Co. owns 30,498 shares . is now back to a , reqular dividend basis of 7% , whereas in 1920 and for several years before that the campany paid $40 a share per annum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cutting off of these extra dividends alone costs American Sugar $1,400,000 a year , or almost enough to pay its common dividend for half year . American Sugar is committed to capital expenditures running into millions on account of a new refinery at Baltimore and a new sugar estate in Cuba . These developments are making drafts upon the company 's treasury at a time which could hardly be less opportune than the present . All these factors combined explain - the rumors of forthcoming public financing by the company and possible reduction or passing of the common dividend . It should be borne in mind . however , that the company is now working on low-priced taws and hence does not need so large a working capital as when raws were costing from 10 to 20 cents a pound . As for the next dividerid , that payable July 2 has already been declared and directors would not ordinarily meet to act on the October payment until late in August or nine weeks away . But that great focussing point of opinion , the market . apparently fears the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
