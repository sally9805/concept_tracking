IF the Bible is the record of man 's progress in the knowledge of God , it is essential to understand some at least of the processes by which it has reached its position of authority . Where so much is claimed the credentials become the more important ; and though it is impossible to deal exhaustively with so large a subject in so limited a space , some lines of suggestion may be sketched . There were years during which the subject of the inspiration of the Bible was to inc personally a puzzle . In what I had been taught as to God 's taking possession of the minds and pens of certain individuals to produce work which would guide the world into absolute truth , I could see little or no reason . The process seemed so oddly indirect , so woefully roundabout . If He was doing this at all , why should He not have made the result . more lucid ? Why should He have strewn His course with traps and snares and stumbling-blocks ? The Holy Ghost which , has endued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence from that of all but their colleagues in producing Holy Writ could as easily as not have made the issue so clear that there would have been no wrangling . A series of divinely dictated books , which perplexed the world almost as much as they helped it struck me as perhaps the strangest of all the strange phenomena which religion placed before us . And yet I held fast to the inspiration . The more I read of the Bible the more sure of it I felt . Bewilderment remained , shaking this conviction but never quite destroying it . It was onlywith the passage and the thought of years that I was able to get the subject on the rocklike basis of what to me seems common sense . I beg to repeat here that what I have to say in this , and all other respects , stands for no more than a personal point of view . I am not arguing or trying to convince . If in what follows I seem to speak in that way , it is only for the sake of conciseness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my views because I have been asked , and only for what they are worth . If they arc wrong they are wrong . If on the other hand there is anything in them which a single reader finds helpful , it will be that much to the good . I have already acknowledged my debt to the Anglican , Evangelical , Christian Science , and Roman Catholic Churches , and wish to acknowledge it again . I speak as one who , in many of their aspects , reverences them all , and yet is outside them all . Outside them all , with some mental perspective between me and them , I am able , it seems to me , to accept more easily what I can accept from them , while what I must put aside disturbs me less . Bringing perspective into play , I am able to see them all as essentially one , with only minor differences between them . They impress me as a great family , with the same ruling traits , the same virtues , the same weaknesses , the same mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal bickerings , bitter among themselves , but affecting the outsider only indirectly . Owing them much , and admiring them all , it is from their united opinions , as I get them , that I distill for myself an idea of the Bible which possibly no one of them would countenance . Beginning with the human race before it has appeared above the horizon of written history , the Bible shows us first an elemental people with an elemental concept of the Divine . Nevertheless , certain principles have been evolved . Between Good and Evil the distinction has been made . Conscience has begun to work . Adam , the Man , and Eve , the Mother ? those two fundamental types ? having eaten of the Tree to be Desired to Make One Wise , have passed the stage of the innocence which is ignorance . The Garden of Childhood is behind them . Responsibilities have been incurred . The burdens of life must be shouldered . Its problems must be solved . In the opening pages of Genesis the human race has been started on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have probably not attained halfway . It is not , I take it , the object of the Bible to reflect the whole of that long struggle to the top , but only the part of it in which man works up from his primitive notions of God to the concept of the Universal Father . By reaching the concept of the Universal Father , I do not assume that he discerns all the fullness of God , but only the degree of that fullness which , in our present stage of development , we are able to assimilate . In proportion to God 's Infinity , that must be little ; in proportion to our own powers , it is much . The Bible begins with a God who is manlike , partial , incomplete ; it ends with a Vision of Infinity , Intelligence , and Love beyond any description or definition possible to thought or words . Having reached this point , it stops . It has given us all of which as yet we can make use . But whence came its authority to give us anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which draw from prehistoric data , some of which were penned perhaps three thousand years ago , all of which belong to epochs and conditions alien to our own , can have obtained such a. hold on that portion of mankind supposed with reason to be the most materially minded ? At the moment of writing I read in the newspapers that the presses which print the Bible can not keep pace with the demand . How did this demand arise ? What maintains it ? Why do people buy and read this ancient book , when they can buy and read so much that is newer , fresher , and , on the surface at least , more directly suited to their twentieth-century needs ? Of one thing we can be certain , that unless these books supplied something which the heart of Europe and America craves for its sustenance , no such demand would continue . Nowhere else in history , to my knowledge , do we find a group of peoples , extremely diverse among themselves , appropriating a whole literature not their own , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they never live on the most vital works of their own children . The phenomenon calls attention to itself , and is perhaps its own best explanation . Demand is always in proportion to the quality of the supply . That is all . There is no further mystery . It is with the Bible as with everything else . Where there is that which meets a need , those who feel the need will turn to it . No factitious sentiment would keep the printing presses of the Bible working overtime . No pietistic or sectarian or ecclesiastical incitement could , year in and year out , support a sale which possibly equals that of all the rest of the books in the world put together . Life does not work that way . Nothing is continually and eagerly bought and paid for which is not worth its price to the purchasers . Deception or overestimation may rule for a time , but it is discovered in the long run . If in the long run the demand for any article is greater than it ever was , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article which is not to be found elsewhere . There , then , is the basic reason for the Bible 's authority : its value . Make all the allowances you like for the unread Bibles on the shelves of homes , schools , and churches , and there still must remain a vast number of people in the world studying these hooks and finding in them truths essential to their welfare . It is they who primarily give to this volume its right to speak . It is they who have primarily given the Bible its power ever since the days when the first of these spiritual classics was singled out as having a special quality . The fact should be recognized that this was not done by some magic stroke outside the methods of nature , or by a mysterious divine influence differing from everything else we know . This is to cheapen the Bible and divine influence alike . The master-works of Hebrew literature took their place in public esteem by exactly the same process as those of any other literature . It was a matter of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among English writers , or Dante his among Italians , or Emerson his among Americans . Led doubtless by the cultured and critical ? as culture and criticism were understood ? the mass of the people came to know that such and such a work had a significance of its own , and it was placed apart . Let us put ourselves back in the days before any portion of our existing Bible had been compiled or composed . It was already , as recent discoveries in Egypt have shown us even more vividly than we knew before , a period of high cultivation . Among the Hebrews the ancient Babylonian wedge-shaped script , suitable for use on hard materials but not elastic in expression , had been superseded by a Hebrew alphabet nearly as graphic as our own . The clay tabletand the stone stele had been replaced by parchment , or some form of paper made from the Egyptian papyrus . Manuscripts were not common , but they existed . Where they existed they were held and housed in honor . Scholars were familiar with their contents . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among ourselves . There was an interested public . It was a public so - well informed as to the substance of their literature that a reference was all they required . In the historical books of the Old Testament , where some of a king 's most significant acts have been given , we come repeatedly on a formula like this : " Now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ? " Or again : " Now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and what he did , arc they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ? " That is to say , for a people who knew so well such books as they possessed , a mere videlicet was enough . Equally well , doubtless , they knew their other books , of which fragments at most have survived into our time . The Books of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chronicles of our present Old Testament . There were these histories now lost to us ; there were others . There was the Book of Jasher ; the Book of Gad ; the Book of Nathan ; the Book of Shemaiah ; the Book of Iddo the Seer ; the Book of the Wars of the Lord . There were others still . Some were earlier than any of the hooks of our Bible ; some were written while the Bible was in course of formation . My point is simply that there was a literature more or less known and enjoyed by the public to whom it was addressed . To this public , then , came the first of the books we now hold as sacred , Many critics think it was the Book of Job . For our present purpose the particular work is unimportant , and the Book of Job will serve as well as any other . The fact to bear in mind is that to those who first read it , or heard it read aloud , it was not a more sacred book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " This will be the nucleus of our Bible . " There was no thought in any mind that thousands of years later , in continents called Europe and America , millions of readers would pore over that book , and mark it with hundreds of millions of annotations . It was just one more book where there were already a good many . It is probable that the class to which the Book of Job belongs , the dramatic poem , was fairly well represented . The author had possibly written other books . Great masterpieces do not , as a rule , spring all alone . That the Book of Job is the sole survivor of its type and time means no more than the solitary column which marks the site where once there was a city . But some power was at work to keep this book a living thing when other books , which at first seemed equally vital , passed out of mind . The same power acted on behalf of another book , and of another , and of another still . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of instinctive , popular critical acumen . 1 call it instinctive for the reason that , even with regard to the works of the present day , we have never learned how and why it acts . I call it popular because its decisions come somehow from the heart of a whole people . It is not only among the Hebrews that we have seen it at work , but among all the nations with vitality enough to produce a literature . By this spirit of critical actunen , in the course of centuries , a selection of works was set aside as classical . As time went on the number of these works increased . As readers drew from their wisdom a more and more energizing strength , veneration for them became still more deeply rooted . But it must not be forgotten that the action wasthat which has singled out merit at all times , the use of a sound judgment on the part of the intelligent . In ether words , the Hebrew classics were marked as classics in the same way as the Greek or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different , but the method was the same . The Bible would probably gain much in living , practical use to us if we could view it free from the artificial or superstitious slants which the teachers of our childhood , for the most part unauthorized and uninformed , have taught us to assume . Otherwise expressed , Hebrew literature commends itself to the world by its own inherent value , and not because it is forced on our attention by the decrees of Jewish or Christian Councils . Jewish and Christian Councils have indorsed it , but they indorsed it long after the choice of works had , in the main , been made . Gold has its value as gold , not because the mint puts a stamp on it . The stamp of the mint means something ; but it would mean nothing were the real gold not there . Wisdom , then , gives its authority to the Bible , not the image and superscription put on it by any body of men whatever . All that a body of men could have undertaken was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done centuries before by the instinctive , popular critical acumen . This is not said to minimize the authority of Jewish or Christian Councils , but to give their due meed of credit to the Scriptures themselves . To those who find what they have to give , they are their own best introduction . Were this not so , the books which run from Genesis to the Apocalypse would never have stood out above those of Nathan or Gad or Iddo the Seer . The preeminence is natural , spontaneous , like that of the Alps or the Canadian Rockies above the surrounding valleys and plains . Where the spirit of man is passionate in searching after God it will , of course , reach a higher and more glowing point than where it is less intense . The high points are those which the Bible reveals to us . They are sometimes obscured by what may seem to us irrelevant matter ; but in the end they will make themselves visible , as the Schreckhorn and the Jungfrau will show their white peaks over seas of cloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We shall see that better if we know what we mean by the word . It is a word that has been used so vaguely , so inexactly ? I will even say , so corruptly ? that a simple matter has been made to appear difficult . Moreover , and the fact can not be stressed too strongly , a tradition acquired " at mother 's knee " has so woven itself around the phrase " verbal inspiration " that much passes current as Christian belief which Christians have never dogmatically taught . Lack of space forbids me to dwell on these assumptions , but we can not forget that they are made . We can perhaps meet them best by finding the basic cooperation through which God becomes the dynamic energy not only of the universe at large but of the rightly directed works of man . Briefly it is this : God is man 's working power . Our works are more inspired in proportion as they keep close to God ; they are less inspired in proportion as they tend away from Him . In complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no inspiration at all . In complete surrender to Him , as in the case of Jesus of Nazareth , the inspiration would be full . It is necessary to point out here that this inspiration must he available for all our undertakings . To see God as infusing Himself into one part of our legitimate life , and not infusing Himself into another part , is to bring inconsistency into the Universal . To speak of Him as giving more inspiration here , and less inspiration there , is to ascribeto Him an element of caprice . It is , in fact , to make Him in large measure the cause of our failures and defects . If He helps us to be right at one time , and does not help us at another , the responsibility for our going wrong must , at least to some extent , be His . If by an extraordinary use of His Holy Spirit He compels Matthew and Mark to write good books , and refuses this Spirit to me , when He could so easily breathe it into me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spasmodic inspiration would surely become the cause of our merely spasmodic successes . In all that we do that is right Omnipresent Energy must , from its very nature , be backing us to the last possible degree . There is not more inspiration for this task , and less inspiration for that ; there must be full inspiration for every task . To ourselves some tasks may seem more important than others . To Him who sees the end which all things serve all that is right must be equally significant and essential . Our initial confusion as to inspiration springs from the idea that God is more concerned with some of our occupations than He is with others , and that for some of them He gives us extra help , while He leaves others to take care of themselves . in this way we speak of a poet as inspired to write a song , but not of a carpenter to build a house . We speak of a bishop as being inspired to preach a sermon , but not of a hanker to extend a loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , but not of the Government to put it into action . It is easy enough to think of the Holy Ghost being present when . the Book of Ruth was composed , or the Gospel according to St. John , but not when Mr. Edison invented the electric light or Madame Curie discovered radium . God , for perhaps most of us , is a Being interested in churches , in services , in philanthropies , and all compositions to which we would append the word sacred , but not in business , or science , or railways , or coal mining , or any but the most idealistic forms of art . From the part of our life with which we ourselves are most anxiously preoccupied , we shut out His inspiration . To no small extent it is a matter of verbal expression . With the phraseology of our understanding we use our words backward . We say that God 's inspiration goes more into this than into that when we mean that this more than that utilizes God 's inspiration . God 's inspiration must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for all to breathe in like the air . It is for all right tasks , for all useful purposes . If the poet gets more of it than the carpenter , it is because he is mentally keeping closer to the source of it . If the bishop gets more of it than the hanker , it is because he is more consciously depending upon it . If the Church gets more of it than the State , it is because it expects to receive it . But all receive it to some degree , even when they do not expect it , or depend upon it consciously . God being the working energy of man , His force may be wasted , abused , or misapplied , but never lost entirely . The Bible , therefore , is not only inspired as all other honest work is inspired , but in the same way . If it reveals a higher measure of inspiration than any other work , it is not because it was given it , but because it has reached it . The powers its writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singled out . Gad , or Sherniah , or Iddo the Seer might have reached it too , but they fell short . Relatively , we all fall short : our artists , our scientists , our preachers , our priests , and our saints . Up to the present the writers whose works compose our Bible have grasped the universal inspiration to a point at which they have no rivals . They are our inspired writers par excellence , through the greatness of their achievement . It will be noted that the fact that God did nothing for them which He does not do for all of us by no means detracts from His honor or from theirs . On the contrary , it seems to me to add to that of both . There is something puerile in ascribing to God special efforts in this direction or in that . If He is going to make special efforts at all , we might reasonably expect Him to make them oftener and with more efficiency . He might ward off from us sicknesses , disasters , calamities , wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He refuses so to do has often made Him seem to the heartbroken an unreasonable , futile God , not worth believing in . Granting the existence of a God who can make special efforts if He likes , and yet will not make them , one can not refuse some sympathy to the indignation that denounces Him . On the other hand , a God who always gives all to all , and who gives to all differently , doubtless , and yet without injustice or inequality ? is so easy to understand that the heart goes out to Him spontaneously . Inspiration , then , being full and free , not only for the purposes of the Scriptures , but for all other purposes as well , what particular end is it meant to serve ? As far as the Bible is concerned we might say in a general way that it serves as a guide to truth . Truth is one of the Bible 's main objectives . By this I mean that , whatever the stages of development of the people whom it portrays , whether more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times struggling after truth To put up this struggle is this people 's ruling instinct . Where the Greek 's ruling instinct may loosely be said to be for Beauty , and the Roman 's for Law , the Hebrew 's is for the working out . of Truth as the medium of life . Not that they were always conscious of this aim , or that , as a life-motive , it was constant . Rather it was a blind impulse , often erroneously followed , often perverted or forsaken . Often , too , they rejected Truth after it had been made known to them . The pages of the Bible teem with their misconceptions , their abjurations , their distortions , denials , and apostasies . And yet in the end the movement was forward . Just as among ourselves progress maintains itself in spite of crises in which all that is best seems threatened with collapse , so among them there was the ebb and flow of effort which always carried the advance a little farther . Like the longing for God Himself , this longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked up and up till it found its fulfillment in Jesus of Nazareth . Truth was what He came to exemplify . " To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . " This purpose might be said to underlie all His other purposes . It might be said to infuse and mold and direct them . He not only knew the Truth , He lived it -- He made it manifest in action . It is what gives breadth and height to His mission . In it lies , I think , the secret of the charm which draws all men unto Him . With this life as its crowning point , the Bible has become a compendium of Truth and of truths beyond anything else in our possession . Here we must recognize and keep in mind some of our own limitations . Truth is doubtless a final Absolute , complete , positive , without variations . Reading of Trii th in the Bible , we should be able to see it at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-evident , admitting of no dispute . And yet , as it is we have a common saying that you can prove anything out of the Bible . The implication is that the meanings you can read into it are so numerous that they lead you nowhere . if they lead you anywhere , it is into confusion . It is a fact that cf the three hundred and inure Christian sects , each takes its stand by the Bible . Out of the Bible each proves itself right . Through the Bible each is ready to confound all who differ from its views . When you come to individuals , of whom it is probable that in the last analysis no two , however dogmatic thesect to which they belong , have exactly the same beliefs , the conflict of evidence , always drawn from the Bible , can be classed beneath the heading of the humorous . If you were the proverbial inhabitant of Mars come down to earth to seek an explanation of the Christian Church in terms of its Holy Scriptures , you would be likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two Presbyterians , or two Roman Catholics , or two Second Adventists would agree in what they would tell you . Each would think that he was interpreting the formulas of his church with a reasonable exactitude , and yet , such is the capacity of the human mind for individuality , that each would really he seeing from his own unique point of view . The oddest fact of all is that , considered with detachment , each of the three hundred sects , each of the millions of individuals can he more or less justified out of the Bible 's pages . If you carefully follow their reasonings , and if you exclude for the moment all other lines of reasoning , you will see how much there is to stablish their convietions . It is this that enables the Anglican , the Baptist , the Methodist , the Congregationalist , the Plymouth Brother , the Roman Catholic , the Quaker , and the Second Adventist each to swear by his own interpretation of the Scriptures , and ban all others as anathema . Now this incoherence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own . Truth as expressed in the Scriptures is of vast extent . It is not only stupendous in sum but intricately rich in detail . Sentences of half a dozen words are profound . Profound sentences are scattered as profusely as shells on the seashore . Their complete inter-relation is as yet beyond our grasp . Having no classification for truths as we have for Crustacea , we can only deal with them singly , or at best in little groups . Our view is so narrow that we see Truth only in spots . Each of us sees a few truths at a time , according to his capacity for spiritual sight . The whole of Truth is like the whole of the universe , an immensity beyond our range . Even the Bible does not present the whole of Truth ; but it presents more than any one man , or any one group of men ? be it nation , church or federation of the world ? can as yet compass or co-ordinate . A long step in advance will have been taken when one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bible something of Truth that has escaped himself . It will be a longer one still when one church is able to make this concession to another church . Only something of the sort will give us that inter-sectarian charity essential to saving the Christianity of our day , so clumsy and uneconomic as it is , from seeming a wastage and a futility . But after all , and in the final test , the value of anything whatever is its value to the individual . If one man who needs one thing can find it in the Bible , and another man who needs another thing can find that also there , it is the Bible 's wealth that must be apparent , not the boneless disposition we are often inclined to ascribe to it of being all things to all men . It is all things to all men , but in the sense of meeting out of its abundance the most diverse spirit ! ual needs . No real seeker after God can turn to it and be disappointed . He may be puzzled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may find the supply so much greater than his individual demand that by it he is almost overwhelmed ; but all types , and all tastes , and all ecclesiastical leanings , and all racial promptings , and all moral states of mind or soul can be satisfied therefrom . Inspiration acting in the Scriptures as a guide to Truth , it is important to remember the precise kind of Truth the Hebrew was trying to work out . Like everyone else , he had his limitations . He could go no farther than his national gift carried him . There were aspects of Truth , plainly evident to us , which he , in the main , ignored . In the main he ignored , 1 . Historic Truth ; R. Scientific Truth ; 3 . Truth in the sense of exactitude of statement as to persons and events . 1 . Historic Truth was almost unknown to the ancient world , as even to the modern world it is still without its sharpest point of precision . With all our advantages of scholarship and research , the histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small measure obsolete . History on the whole is no more than one man 's weaving of conflicting stories into a narrative that seems probable . Where strong interests center , as around periods like the Reformation or the French Revolution , or about characters such as Mary Stuart or Napoleon Bonaparte , there are as many versions of the theme as there are historians to handle it . If variation can be so common with the open archives of the modern world , still more must that condition have obtained where records were so few . As a matter of fact the ancient historian made little pretense at being accurate . Only at times did he possess the information to make him so . Taking the relatively little that he knew , he added what had come to him as hearsay , filling in with what he himself judged as likely to have occurred . He enlarged on events ; he composed speeches . To historical exactitude his audience was not sensitive , just as even now , in the twentieth century , no public that genuinely cares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still less was it the mission of the Scriptures to give us information on the subjects we class to-day as scientific . By the ancient world , scientific knowledge in our modern sense had not been dreamed of . It was scarcely dreamed of by Europe and America until a hundred years ago . It was , in fact , the coming to birth of a real Physical Science in the middle of the nineteenth century that directed the Church and the world to the Bible 's actual purpose . After the so-called struggle between Science and Religion in the seventies , eighties , and nineties of the last century , the Bible ceased to be a mere handbook of useful knowledge and it became , to an extent that it had never been before , the veritable Word of God . 3 . With regard to temporal facts the attitude of the ancient mind was so different from our own as to render it nearly incomprehensible to people like ourselves . One is driven to assume that the faculty of precision had not yet been developed , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children in discerning between what has happened and what they imagine to have happened is now a recognized condition of early childhood . The credulity of ancient peoples must he part of the same disability . When the mind is undeveloped the boundary line between everyday life and wonderland is easily moved . Strange tales are easily believed . Facts are not hard , concrete , clearly outlined ; they are vague , pliable , lending themselves to whatever use a speaker or a writer makes of them . The value of the literal event , with no less and no more , did not attain to general recognition till within the last two or three generations . Though tentatively pointed out by Aristotle , and emphasized in the thirteenth century by Roger Bacon , it was not till the nineteenth century that the child-mind of the race began to be outlived . It is not a question of truth and falsehood ; it is one of the adjustment of the mind to reality . The modern mind is only partially so adjusted ; the ancient mind was scarcely adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Testament which would doubtless not have been included had the compilers possessed the critical equipment of the twentieth century . Even so , our grandfathers had no difficulty in accepting them , and the disturbance of simple minds when asked to view such narratives through correct historical perspective is within living memory . What we can reasonably expect from the Bible is the gradual climbing up to the highest spiritual point of view ; and this is what we find . The effort to reach it lies behind myth , legend , tradition , historical artlessness , lyric hymn , and prophecy , waxing stronger as it runs . Inspiration is the force which urges it along . This inspiration may be briefly expressed as God 's co-operation with man 's endeavor . It takes man 's endeavor at the stage at which it is . If it is credulous it takes it there . If it is na ? ve it takes it there . If it is struggling up to higher and wider outlooks it takes it there . It is man 's best friend for all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave him in the lurch because he is not wiser than he is , or , on the other hand , force him on to knowledge which he has not worked out for himself . It is with him in all the ups and downs and backings and fillings of his progress . Unlike much of our own good intention , it is not in a hurry . It , gives man his time . Without haste , it is also without rest , content with no lower objective than that All-Truth into which the Spirit of Truth will eventually guide us.
