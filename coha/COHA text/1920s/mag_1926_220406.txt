At Melbourne , Australia , cinema censors grew wrathy at a preliminary showing of The Big Parade . <P> As unending motor truck lines of U. S.-cinema-soldier-actors flickered on the screen , it became self-evident that , should the picture be released , many an Australian moviegoer might forget that less than l/70th of the soldiers killed during the World War were U. S. citizens . <P> The Australian censors , long of memory , refused to pass the film , declared it " replete with excessive and offensive U. S. propaganda . " <P> At London , editors upheld the Australian view with Yank-seering diatribes . In Allied countries The Big Parade ( a tale of the A. E. F. , not a drama of the War entire ) was widely flayed by local patriots as one more ill-bred , ill-timed suggestion that : " The U. S. won the War ! "
