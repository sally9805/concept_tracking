At night Signor Mussolini lies between silken sheets in a huge , carved bed at the Villa Torlonia . A massive prie dieu stands at his bedside . A domed and gilded ceiling canopies above . From the sumptuous milieu he rose up refreshed one morning last week and spoke biting words to French feminist Vahdah Jeanne Bordeaux , who interviewed him after breakfast on the topic " Women . " <P> Benito Dixit : " Women are trusting , confiding little animals . When a man tells a woman that he loves her , she makes it a point to believe him , no matter how many times she may already have been deceived . She believes him because she is an idealist , and being loved is an ideal condition . She believes him because she is romantic , and the state or condition of loving and being loved is a romantic one . Oh , when it is a question of imagination , women are far superior to men . <P> " Women can not create . In all of the arts , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when they have attempted grandeur they have failed ignominiously . . . . For example , what woman has ever created a great painting ? <P> " Women are to man what men desire them to be-woman is to me an agreeable parenthesis in my busy life ; they never have been more , nor can they ever be less . Today , I have no time to punctuate my life with other than work , but in the past , now the long ago past , when I was free to pick and choose my style of writing , I often found the parenthesis a pleasant way to punctuate . <P> " Flirtations should be indulged in as frequently as possible up to the age of 40 , then a man should settle down to more staple amusements , such as work . <P> " What more agreeable than the enthusiasm a woman knows how to awaken in a man ? What more charming , thrilling than the first kiss ; what brings a more profound sigh of relief than the last ? <P> " The power behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No great man has ever been inspired to greatness by a woman 's unseen power . . . . <P> " Men are inspired by ambition or conviction ; their desires to accomplish something in the world are purely selfish . If you could look into the soul of every man you meet in the course of a day , no vision of a woman would be enshrined there . No woman ever penetrates to the soul of a man , despite all things said to the contrary . . . . Left in their proper relation to man women are all that is delicious , adorable , sensuous . They are , in a large sense , necessary to our physical wellbeing . . . . <P> " What do I think of marriage ? That it is a necessary institution , a contract to be entered into between a man and a woman for the good of the State , and for that reason it should never be dissolved , so long as they both live .
