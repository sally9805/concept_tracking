For I dip't into the future , <P> Far as human eye could see . <P> Saw the vision of the world , <P> And all the wonder that would be , <P> Saw the Heavens fill with commerce , <P> Argosies of magic sails , <P> Pilots of the purple twilight , <P> Dropping down with costly bales . <P> President Coolidge recited those lines , written by Tennyson in 1842 , to the first International Conference on Aeronautics at Washington last week . They were part of his rsum of aviation 's 25-year accomplishments . Flyers and aeronautics authorities from 40 nations heard him . <P> But Orville Wright , whom the President extolled , was not present . A train derailment had delayed him . When he arrived and unobstrusively entered the conference hall by a side door , a short grey-haired man in a sack suit , the delegates rose and applauded . He smiled , said nothing , took a seat near Charles Augustus Lindbergh . Later in the sessions , when Col. Lindbergh was summoned to accept the bronze Clifford Harmon trophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Nothing was said . A moment later , Assistant Secretary of Commerce MacCracken called Mr. Wright to join Col. Lindbergh in the presentation . The young man , 26 , who flew to world admiration , waited for the elderly one , 56 , who flew to the world 's skepticism . Arm in arm they walked to the ceremony , said nothing . <P> Another day , the House of Representatives voted Distinguished Flying Crosses to Wilbur Wright ( died 1912 of typhoid fever ) and Orville Wright . Orville Wright again said nothing. * <P> The business of the conference was , as must be , general . Research engineers and aerodynamists met and discussed their technical problems . Transport men heard papers on airgraphics ( meteorology ) , airways , airports , organization , operation and maintenance of airlines , radio directors , electro-magnetic compasses , altitude finding by radio echo . Private flying-clubs , a successful stimulant to aviation in England , are beginning to appear in the U. S. Significant was the observation that air travel now costs the passenger only 14 a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last action of the conference was to hear an appeal for the establishment of an international code of standards for airplane manufacture and certificates of airworthiness . Qualifications of those countries that belong to the International Convention for Air Navigation are fairly uniform . But the U.S. does not belong to that convention , and its lack of accord hampers the export of our planes , parts and accessories . <P> After the conference , delegates went to Boiling Field at Washington to watch Army , Navy and Marine planes maneuver . But dismal , foggy weather stopped the display . <P> More pleasing were the following dedication ceremonies-of a boulder and a monument-at Kitty Hawk , N. C. , where man first flew , the gusty 17th of December , 1903 . <P> <P> *Senators at another time had opportunity to shake his hand ; he chatted a little .
