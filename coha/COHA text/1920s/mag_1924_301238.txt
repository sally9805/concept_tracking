Professor Quidde , German pacifist , wrote a letter to Hans von Seecht , Commander-in-Chief of the Reichswehr . He deplored the fact that young Germans were being given military training . He pointed out that the Versailles Treaty was thereby being flagrantly and dangerously defied . He explained that the French were angered . He prophesied that enemies of the Fatherland would one day make " these military preparations " an excuse for invasion . <P> Replied the hard , harsh , bellicose von Seecht : " The ideas of peace are in themselves difficult of comprehension for a people so maltreated as the German nation , but when , after the experiences Germany has had in the invasion of the Ruhr , and at a time when France daily stamps on the Treaty of Versailles , a man devotes himself to the execution of this Treaty in the interests of France , I can only describe such action as the limit of self-abasement . Furthermore , I should like to remind you that in the event of any public discussion of the questions mentioned in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of siege quite apart from any proceedings for treason .
