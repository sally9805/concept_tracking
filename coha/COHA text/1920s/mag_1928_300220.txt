Dr. Raymond Pearl , famed biologist of Johns Hopkins University , was born and reared in Farmington , N. H. He well remembers two outstanding facts about New Hampshire society as he knew it during his young years : <P> 1 ) There was a State prohibition law , desired and admired by the leading citizens : <P> 2 ) There were plenty of saloons , run openly and comfortably , desired and patronized by the leading citizens . <P> After pondering these facts maturely and examining certain statistics relative thereunto , Dr. Pearl wrote a paper , published in the December American Mercury , called " The Psychology of Prohibition . " The statistics he examined showed that : <P> 1 ) As more and more of the U. S. population was brought under State prohibition laws between the years 1870 and 1917 , total consumption of alcohol in the U. S. increased almost three times as fast as the population . <P> 2 ) During the same period , per capita consumption of alcohol was multiplied more than two-and-one-half times . <P> 3 ) The deathrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking when the sale of liquor is illegal , was at its lowest point in 1920 , the year after national prohibition became effective . <P> 4 ) After five years of national prohibition , the alcoholism deathrate had more than tripled , surpassing its 1918 level , almost regaining its 1910 level , when only 16-96% of the U. S. population lived under prohibition . <P> Dr. Pearl drew a psychological conclusion : the people of the U. S. want both things at once , a Prohibition law and liquor . <P> Dr. Pearl made a psychological explanation : " To call our people names , and accuse them of hypocrisy because they want both prohibitory legislation and liquor too is the favorite attitude of Europeans generally , and of a good many persons in this country as well . But . . . the American psychology regarding Prohibition is basically only a form of the sort of make-believe and dressing-up that every child indulges in . No one would think of calling a child a hypocrite because he dresses up as a cowboy or a policeman . Other peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nave in their psychology as the Americans are about Prohibition . For example , consider the problem of why Englishmen wear silk hats . ( They still do . ) It is apparent to the meanest intelligence that a silk hat , considered as a hat , is a poor and ridiculous thing . It is uncomfortable , it is ugly , it is easily damaged by the elements against which it is supposed to be a protection . Why then do Englishmen generally , and American undertakers and politicians in particular , wear it ? For a simple reason . The silk hat is a symbol of respectability . Expensive as silk hats are , they still offer the cheapest of all known ways to achieve the outward semblance of respectability . <P> " In a precisely similar way national Prohibition is the silk hat of the American people . It ensures our respectability and has never so far interfered with the desired consumption of alcohol . We are psychologically not a realistic people , but on the contrary a naively idealistic folk .
