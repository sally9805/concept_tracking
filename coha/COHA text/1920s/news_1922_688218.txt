txt Political joint-debating has gone out of fashion in this country . The name persists but the thing itself has changed . Instead of two candidates meeting on the same platform , in the style of Lnkrcour and DOUGLAS , and answering each other 's arguments on the spot , about all that we have left , as the ordinary rule , is the sight of two political opponents reading prepared speeches , often with little relation between one and the other . But New York is fortunate this year in having the prospect of a real joint debate between the two men running for Governor . This is the hope held out to us by Mr. SMITH 'S speech of acceptance . He frankly took up Governor MILLER 'S challenge . Putting aside all national party questions relating to the tariff , foreign policy , and so on , he showed his desire to come to grips with his antagonist on the issues purely affecting the State . The two men may not speak in the same hall during the campaign , but they will be really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will judge which one has the better of the argument , ment . Governor MILLER was charged in 1920 with neglecting the State in his canvass , and speaking mostly about the questions agitated in the Presidential campaign . That may have been good politics at the time , as it Is certain that Mr. MILLER was swept into office mainly by the Republican tide which carried Mr. HARDING into the White House . But this year , at any rate , he is going to the people of the State on State issues . He is detailing to them the work which he has done and attempted to do as Governor , Is expounding the program which he hopes to carry through if re-elected , and solely on that record invites the considered judgment of the voters . He boldly declares that if the claims which he makes of having brought about economy and efficiency in the State Government are not justified by the facts he does not deserve to be made Governor again and would not wish to be . Here is Mr. SMITH 'S opportunity . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted mainly to a denial of the Governor 's contentious and a searching of his statements . It Is true that the two candidates have not yet Joined issues directly at all points . In the matter of State finances Mr. SMITH is so far general , while Governor MILLER is specific . On the other hand , the Governor has till now had little to say about his attitude toward social welfare legislation , while Mr. SmrrH enlarges upon it . To some extent , therefore , the two candidates are as ' yet moving on parallel tracks , but it can not be long before they meet in a head-on collision . To both candidates'the thanks of the State are due for thus narrowing the political discussion . Mr. SMITH asserts his intention to follow the Governor into " every nook and corner " of New York . We may be sure that the Governor will turn to meet him manfashion . The only question will be which one has the firmer grasp of the facts and the greater power of clear and orderly exposition . That the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount ) f its expenditures , and its precise Miranda ' situation today , is difficult : o arrive at , all inexpert outsiders ' reely admit . There is a jungle of ' figures to be gone through , and the most contradictory assertions are rade as to what they really prove . ) n this point the running debate between Mr. SMITH and the Governor Should prove of the highest educe. - timid value to the people of New York , Here are two ' men admittedly able and honest , who have been in closest touch with the affairs of the State , yet who differ radically in regard to the true meaning of the official financial reports . Out of their close-knit debating during the next few weeks the material for a sound judgment should emerge . As iron sharpeneth iron , so does the direct contact between two such men as Mr. fintrin and Governor MILLER sharpen not only their wits but those of their bearers . New York must count herself happy in having two such antagonists grappling with each other in the effort to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . Governor MILLER invited such a contest and Mr. SMITH is to be commended for his frankness and courage in not shrinking from the encounter . ' l
