One night last May , one Jacob D. Hanson was driving to his Niagara Falls home alone in his automobile . U. S. Coast Guard Glenn Jennings , in the enforcement of Prohibition duties , shot Motorist Hanson in the temple , making him blind . <P> It was a mistake . Jennings had erred in thinking that Motorist Hanson , honest citizen , was a rum runner . But that did not restore sight to Motorist Hanson . Nor did it prevent him from going mad last week , as a result of the same wound . <P> Foes of Prohibition were vexed .
