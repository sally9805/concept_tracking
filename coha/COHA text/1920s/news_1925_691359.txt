txt Twelve ancient bronzes , Egyptian , Etruscan and other types , some heavily caked with rust and others completely turned into rust , are being restored in the electro-chemical laboratory of the School of Mines at Columbia University by the process developed by Professor Colin G. Fink which turns rust back into metal , giving ba , clf shape and detail to genuine antiques and exposing fake ones . First announcement of the results of the work were made yesterday . More than 600 objects of bronze , silver and alloys have been treated by this method , which was worked out by Professor Fink at the suggestion of Director Edward Robinson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , who turned over to the scientist a number of bronzes which had lost tivir Identity through rust . A large number of fakes in private hands and In possession of art dealers have been detected b the pthbess , but all the objects owned by the Metropolitan have so far proved to be genuine . Last week the Metropolitan Museum turned over to Professor Fink for treatment an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze . sit was a small figure of a man on horseback which possessed the superficial characteristics of a genuine antique . Under the electro-chemical treatment at the School of Mines a. green antique finish of carbonate of copper and glue came off and a lead soldier on horseback was revealed . It was apparently a child 's toy , probably bought at a Fifth Avenue toyman 's shop . The heads of both the horse and rider had been considerably worked up by the artist , and a fine rich green patina tad been applied . The Patina. or crust , when reduced by ' the electro-chemical process , was found to contain a camel 's hair belonging to the brush with which the ancient finish had been applied . After the chemical bath the owner of this object made no sale . A Warrior on Horseback . One of the objects treated at the School of Mines was a Japanese warrior on horseback . A prominent New York dealer had bought It as a genuine Japanese work of 3,000 years ago . He contracted to pay $20,000 for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath was given to this object , which was nearly two feet high . The shaggy green coat of bronze rust came off horse and rider , and they stood exposed as a recent casting in type metal . " Many of the other objects tested in this way , " said Dr. Fink , who has been assisted at Columbia by Charles H. Eldridge , " proved to be genuine antiques , but recently varnished with green coats of bronze rust . This coat had been applied by the dealer because the objects , although ancient , did not look ancient . In other words , the genuine antique surface of the object- had looked new , and the dealer put new paint on it to make it look old . " One of the objects , which will probably be placed on exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum when a display of these salvaged articles is made , is a mother cat with a litter of kittens which was rusted through and through and completely devoid of the original metal when Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr . turned it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , the family picture brought out in great detail , and the material , which was soft enough to crumble at the touch , was hardened so that it could be handled freely . In its restored state it isgreatly prized by Mrs. Rockefeller . The process to a careful application of well-known elects-chemical principles . The rusting of metals is an electrical phenomenon . In these cases faint electrical currents operating for twenty or thirty centuries had corroded the metals . By subjecting the corroded remains to a stronger electrical current of the opposite sign . Dr. Fink reversed the effect , turned the rust back to metal and caused the objects to electro-plate themselves . In some cases shapes and designs were recovered from formless lumps of rust . Coins which had been rusted to several times their original thickness were restored until the image stood forth clearly and the lettering could be read . Rind of Objects Treated . The process is applied at present only to greatly corroded objects , because the thick crust of green which antiquity puts on bronze objects is highly prized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallic and gives a shock to connoisseurs . Meaningless lumps and ugly distorted things are chiefly what are being submitted to the process at present . The green encrustation is preferred , even when it obliterates some of the detail , to the restoration which makes it look as if it had just come from a shop . One year in New York City is equal to 1.000 years in Egypt in rusting bronzes , so that the method is expected to be of special value here . It is cheap enough to become a routine method of archaeology In treating ancient bronzes , silver and alloys . Besides exposing fakes the electrochemical process is of value in authenticating genuine pic : - ... fc that are under suspicion . One of the bronzes of the Metropolitan Museum was challenged by an expert of the British Museum . It was tested by Dr. Fink and found to be a genuine antique . Another bronze of the Metropolitan on which doubt had been cast was established as ancient in , the same way .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
