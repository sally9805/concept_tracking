The denial of democratic sovereignty which Great Britain imposes upon Egypt became , last week , once more glaringly apparent . <P> Prime Minister Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha attained the focus of interest when he recently submitted to party leaders the draft treaty which he negotiated in London , during King Fuad 's visit there ( TIME , July 18 ) . <P> Styled a " Treaty of Alliance , " the new pact contains important British concessions . The trouble is , from an Egyptian point of view , that Prime Minister Sarwat does not represent the majority party of Egypt , the indomitable Wafd , once headed by the late famed Saad Zaghlul Pasha . Whenever the Wafd votes down a cabinet and seeks , as the majority party , to assume power , one or more British warships are usually in evidence to menace Egyptian harbors . <P> The result is that British Might , made articulate by the British High Commissioner to Egypt , George Ambrose Lloyd , Baron Lloyd of Dolobran , is able to force the Wafd to tolerate as Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . <P> Last week the " Treaty of Alliance " raised the question whether the Wafd , with a clear majority in the Chamber , could be forced to accept what Britain is willing to give . <P> Before attempting to deal with this politically impossible situation , it seemed prudent for Sarwat Pasha to divest himself somewhat of his pro-British taint . This he attempted to do by the bold if paradoxical move of reporting to Baron Lloyd that the Egyptian Cabinet had totally rejected the treaty . <P> At the High Commissioner 's residence , Lord Lloyd , suave , impeccably clad and steelyeyed , received Sarwat 's report with quiet understanding . From the High Commissioner 's presence the Prime Minister went forth to his thankless task of trying to persuade the Wafd , now led by little known Mustafa El Nahass Pasha , that it must again knuckle under . <P> After several days of negotiations , the Wafd demanded and obtained as a minimum sop to its prestige , the resignation of Sarwat and his cabinet . Prognostications were that Nahass Pasha would again attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might possibly be permitted to succeed if he would convey a secret pledge of " good behavior " to Baron Lloyd . <P> Meanwhile the treaty text was not made public , but it was understood to involve a relaxation of British influence throughout Egypt proper , in exchange for more complete extension of British authority in the Sudan .
