Associated with such men at J. Edward Simmons , E. H. Perkins , James G. Cannon , James T. Woodward , and last , but by no means least , his old patron and chief . William A. Nash , Walter E. Frew brings to present times all that is best in New York banking traditions . When the late Sir Edward Holden , the great London banker , was here on one occasion , he remarked that he found the Corn Exchange Bank with its branch banking system more like an English bank than any other American financial institution he had ever seen . There was a certain atmosphere about the Corn Exchange Bank that made Sir Edward feel at home whenever he went in to visit his old friend . A minimum of restrictions under a state banking charter , which Frew was quick to profit by , gave his institution the character of English banking , which knows no banking laws other than the penal code .

Frew rose from an errand boy to the presidency of the old Queens County Bank , after winning the admiration of one of its important stockholders , the late J.

It was broad vision that caused Frew to blaze a way in branch banking in this city 27 years ago , at a time when other bankers were not bothering about it- In recent years , however , they have seen a light , and are now flocking uptown , paying in some cases enormous rents and opening expensively equipped offices .

As a consequence , his bank has been a good dividend payer , for eight years 20% per annum , and Frew can , in addition , point with pride to his $15,000,000 surplus account . Walter Frew is vigorous at 61 and in between his hobbies of opening branches , be finds time for a little golf .
