txt Dr. John L. Tildsley was- defeated for Associate Superintendent at yesterday 's meeting of the Board of Education , and District Superintendent Edgar Dubs Shinier was chosen in his place by a vote of 4 votes to 2 , six members of the Board being present . Mrs. Emma Murray , who favored Dr. Tildsley , could not get to the city from her Summer camp at Lake Champlain . Her presence , however , would not have changed the result . Joseph Yeska , woo has been seriously ill , came to the meeting just to vote for Associate Superintendent and left soon after the first and only ballot that was taken . The two members who voted for Dr. Tildsley were Arthur S. Somers and Frank D. Wilsey , formerly the President and Vice-President of the Board . The four who voted for Dr. Shimer were Vice-President Ryan , Dr. John A. Ferguson , Mr. Yeska and President Arming S. Fran . As a result of the election Dr. Tildsley is now without a job . Mr. Somers asked that , owing to Mrs. Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first regular meeting in September . He said that it was desirable that all the members be present when the election took place . Mr. Ryan objected , declaring that there had been a great deal in the press and among certain organizations against delay in electing the Associate Superintendent . Mr. Somers replied that the Board had , at its last meeting , postponed the election because of the absence of Mr. Yeska , and he thought the same courtesy should be shown to Mrs. Murray . In view of Mr. Ryan 's statement , however , he was willing to have a special meeting called for the purpose in August . His motion to that effect was defeated . Shimer Indorses TIldsley 's Policy . Mr. Shimer , who lives in Flushing , L. I. , said last night that the news ot the consideration of his name for the post of Associate Superintendent was a great surprise to him . " When Mr. Ryan told me for the first time last night that Dr. Tildsley was not going to be re-elected , that it would , be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . I said to Mr. Ryan , ' You ought to re-elect Dr. Tildeley . ' That I should be mentioned for the post came like a stroke of lightning . I did not seek the position . " Dr. Tildsley took the right stand in his campaign against radicalism in the schools . I am heartily in sympathy with the action that has already been taken by the Board of Superintendents in demanding full loyalty of students and teachers . " The question of freedom of speech does not enter into the work of the teacher . It is his teaching ability that counts . A. teacher is not at liberty to bring up anything at all in the classroom . I am heartily in accord with Dr. Ettinger as expressed in his letter to Dr. Wolfson , published last Sunday in THE NEW YORK TIMES . I stand behind every sentiment expressed in that docutnent . " Long before these recent disturbances took place in the high schools I called the attention of Dr. Ettinger to a teacher who was disciplined for disloyal utterances , and his license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning . " I certainly believe we want to make all our pupils loyal and patriotic Amerleans . We have no use for any other kind . But I do not believe in absolute repression . It is a large question . I have always done what I could to show the illogical reasoning of socialism , and I am opposed to the doctrine . " As for Socialists being school teachers , I may say that I do not inquire after a man 's political opinions , his race or religion when he enters the school room . So long as ho does not obtrude notions that are not proper for the children into the class room I pay no attention to him . " Politics , Says Dr. Tildsley . Dr. Tildsley said last night that his defeat meant the re-introduction of politics into the public schools and the nullification of efforts that have been made in the last twenty-five years to eliminate politics from the educational System of the city . " Each member of the Board of Education assured me personally that he had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one explanation possible . and that is that the Mayor or- tiered them to vote against me . Otherwise they would not have done so . I have had twenty-two years of service in the New York City public schools . So far as I know , no superintendent has ever been refused re-election if his work has been found to be satisfactory . " The four members who voted against re-electing me gave no reason at all when they were asked . This is the first case that I know of a superintendent being turned down for no reason whatever . It may he that the opposition was not directed against me so much as it was directed against the Board of Superintendents . The action of the Board would seem to make it impossible for a superintendent to do his duty and retain his position . " When Dr. ' Plidsley was asked whether lie thought his campaign against radicalism in the schools had anything to do with his defeat he said , " The Mayor is the only one who can answer that . " ' Somers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination Mr. Somers Was frequently interrupted with applause by the good-sized audience that was present . He asked if Dr. Tildsley was to be punished because of his Americanism . As a leader he had done good and faithful service , and had given much satisfaction by his work as Principal of De Witt Clinton High School and the High School of Commerce . He had become Associate Superintendent when this nation was bleeding and had forced from the educational system teachers who ' were disloyal . He was a protection against the persons who were threatening the foundations of the Government . He declared that it would he dangerous to drop , with his sterling record , such a man from his high and important position . " T can not conceive the board dispensing with one who has served so well and faithfully , " he declared . Mr. Somers said that in some things he had not always agreed with Dr. Tildsley , who , however , was a man of conviction and not afraid to say " no " when required . He hoped that the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination , spoke briefly of Dr. Tildsley . Mr. Ryan said that his blood was set boiling by some of the editorials in the press reflecting on certain Members for not re-electing Dr Tildsley . He declared there was Dr , behind all the clamor that had been raised in Dr. Tildsley 's behalf . There was no one who could justly criticise his own Americanism . In nominating Dr. Shimer , he said he had been a noted educator for forty years . Dr. Ferguson seconded the nomination . Ettinger for Tildsley . Dr. Ettinger , Superintendent of Schools , who is not a member of the Board but is allowed a voice in its deliberations , said that he thought the reelection of Dr. Tildsley was necessary . He knew Dr. Shimer and held him in great esteem , but Dr. Tildsley 's record deserved approval and his rejection would be a bad thing . It was necessary , he declared , that legislation would be asked to make the position of Associate Superintendent permanent on good behavior . There was a belief that Dr. Tildsley was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumor to the effect that politics was in opposition to him , but he did not believe this . Dr. Tildsley had kept Americanism in the school sand had driven out those who were opposed to it . Mr. Wilsey said that he had voted ten years ago for Dr. Shinier for Associate Superintendent . Dr. Shimer , he said , was now close to the retirement age and could only serve a part of the six years for which he was elected . Mrs. Julia Wheelock of Barbara Frietchie Post . which has 1,500 members . asked Mr. Ryan if Dr. Shinier would accept the superintendency if he should Se elected . Mr. Ryan replied that Dr. Shimer would do so . " I am sorry to hear that , " said.Mrs . Wheelock . " I still believe he would decline the position in Dr. Tildsley 's favor . " Francis M. Fallon , President of Captain B. Brook Past . 450 . American Legion , said that he appeared as a legionsire in fovar of Dr. Tildsley , under whom he himself had once been a teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not voting for Dr. Tild ; ley . American Legion Plea . President Prall called Mr. Fallon to mtder . ? " ' You are at liberty , " he said , " to speak on behalf of your choice , but you are not to heckle members of the asard . " Mr. Fallon then named posts of the League which had unanimously indorsed Dr. Tildsley 's candidacy . He said that ) ne of them was the Murray Hill post , which Irwin Rachdolt , formerly under Dr. Tildsley , is President . Maurice J. McCarthy , President of the tiew York Parents ' Association , said : hat Dr. Tildsley 's fight against radimlism should re-elect him . Richard M. Hurd , President of the American Defense Association , said that is 50,000 members were for Dr. Tildsley .
