To millions of men and women tike war has been as a book of Revelation . What did so many of us , coming out of the West , know about our dusky brethren of the East ? Less than nothing ; for were we not cursed with that knowledge ' which is far more dangerOUS than a perfect ignorance ? We had , perhaps , read Burton , and even Burckhardt , and Marmaduke Piekthall , and Kipling . Pickthall , by the way , is easily first , where it comes to English-written fiction dealing with Mohamme. dans . Then there is Doughty , whose Wanderings , however , are confined to Arabia . I , like so many others , had read all these , and I dare say more to the same effect : Moltke 's Reisebriefe , for instance , Loti , Vambdry , Russian and Polish stories of the Turk and Tartar . One was cluick-full of this shadow-show , Which revealed so little ; Which awaited the fertilizing stroke of actual contact and a practical experience . Well , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure for digestive purposes . Now Islam , to me , is a living thing , instead of a mystery concocted of forlorn warfare , domes and minarets , veiled women , and sacks of gold , and prayers , ablutions , and prostrations . I would like the.reader at this junc- ? ture to attempt a serious definition of Christianity and its exemplars . At only one point , so far as I can discover , is the normal Christian in complete accord with other Christians . He attempts to practise monogamy . He does not always succeed in this attempt ; in fact , his failures are a constant source of mirth and comfort to the Unbeliever . But monogamy and all that it implies in the way of home and children is his ideal , and more often than not he achieves it . In most of her respects the Christians of this world achieve variety . In the Levan , for instance , the typical Christian ' s an accomplished liar , an abject co ' ard , and a noxious parasite , pimp , at .1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these aberrations , and even admit that there are numerous exceptions to a general rule . In Great Britain , I am thankful to say , t he Christ ian is , generally speaking , a brave and honest man , who re.spects women and children and Whose ruling passion is a desire for fair play . The North American Christian , I believe , is not dissimilar . In France the Christian displays a more sanguine and , at the same time , a less reflective temperament ; in Prussia he becomes a braggart or a servile knave ; in Russia he is ral her a simpleton ; in Serbia he is a lion for courage and endurance ; in Australia his exterior is rough and his heart is that of a little One might go on for a week , enumerating the varied species that inhabit this part icular field of natural history ; but in the main one must agree with Buckle and that noble torso which enriches and adorns our ' vast heritage of British thought . As with the Christian , so with our 669 670 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have conspired to make him a person of infinite variety . Courageous , simple , and brave in a butte of innocence , ? I allude , say , to t he Turkish peasant or the fellaheen of t he Sudan , ? in Egypt he becomes a coward and a prevaricator ; in Palest ine and Syria a weakling ; in the Desert a sportsman and a gentleman ; in Afghanistan a bloody-minded fanatic ; in Northern India a soldier or a peaceful cultivator ; in the Malayan islands a secretive and remote survival . And as the Christians of the world are united by a common impulse toward monogamy and the family , so the Moslems of the world achieve at one point a unity by subjecting their women to polygamy and a system wherein the tribe or clan replaces our smaller and more intimate unit . The Moslem civilization is , beyond all other things , masculine ; the Christian civilization is of both sexes and has in the main , I believe , been preserved and guarded by its women . Islam , I sometimes think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turkish Empire may certainly be ascribed to such an exclusively masculine and emasculated domination . Life , and even religions life , is a perpetual warfare . We may disguise this fact and cover it up with catchwords , such as Progress and Reform , Evolution and Revolution . But warfare it remains . Islam was all these things . It was a better faith than the ' Christianity ' which it supplanted in the East , a ' Christianity ' chiefly notable for fetal , faction , greed , persecution , and sectarianism ; for anything and everything but the application of the Christian doctrine . It was a better faith than the image-worship which it destroyed and supplanted . It even made the attempt ? vitiated by its own puerilities and inherent animalism ? to combine in one faith the beauties and the truths revealed by Mo.os and by Christ . If the world had stood , till , moving neither forward nor backward , front , say , 1000 A.D. , and had remained so standing forever , Islam would Ikon been as good a religion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tho Christian faith , energized- by its own dynamics and the temperate ( humus wherein it found expansion and gathered forces at once magnificent and irresistible , has moved the world ; hats transformed it beyond any vision or dream permitted to the Prophet on the Arabian God . Had Islam conquered the world , there would have been no printing . press , no Renaissance , and no : kmerieas . The Western hemisphere would still be undiscovered . It is im almost incredible supposition , but , envisage it as one may , it is indisputable . All the mechanical and adventurous minuets of the human Saga are primarily of Greece and Rome and the Christian heirs of these two civilizations . Arabian culture died an early death . sterilized by too great a reverence for the letter of the Koran and the SINIage irruptions of those Central sksichin hordes whom , to-day , we call the Turk Never a very vigorous plant , / he culture of the Arabic theologians , midematicians , astronomers , architects , historians , craftsmen , poets , had run its appointed course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it has only recently , thanks to Allenby . Lawrence , and Feisal , made Sant ' sun of a recovery . The Turk took charge of the religion of his victim , and withtnore or less success imposed his will Lyon Islam . And , incidentally , he also enslaved such Christian communities as came under his hand ? Greeks , ArnmMans , Copts , and Syrians , to mull but the most familiar , and to omit I hose lib-crated by Pole and Russian . Austrian and Spaniard , Venetian , French , and British , in the more recent centuries . Trull one plunges into a strange and dramatic stratum of history when one sane , the rise , decline , and downfall of Islamic power . And even now I have omitted , and must perforce omit , the Western chapters of that epic ; must leave the Alhambra unvisited , the deeds of Moor and Frank and proud Castilian to the reader 's own passion or reattareh . Persia , and India too , free-thinking Omar and the anonymous painters who defied the Prophet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven-ascending monuments , a best of kings and conquerors , and that devout lover who raised the Taj Mahal . My own first contact with Islam cceurred in Macedonia . The Turk had ruled here and had made a wilderness . it every step one took , one thanked the Lond that . he had been kicked out . The Greek could not be worse and might be better . All that remained now of Islam was cemetery after cemetery falling to ruin , falling back into the wildness and the savagery of those deserted moors . There had been forests here ; t he Turk had destroyed them . There had been aqueducts and water and good roads ; the Turk had let them fall to ruin . His business was war ; in the pursuits of peace he had proved contemptible . He could neither govern , nor administer , nor organize , nor do anything but suck the blood of this fair province . Greek , Jew , and Bulger did their best under his exactions , till at last Greek and Bulgar , grown tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kicked him out . A furtive remnant lingers on in the city of Salonica , but it is moribund and powerless . You and me it despises , as it has been taught to do in its mosques and in its schools ; but it is extremely glad to take our money . We are still unclean and we are still the Infidel ; but at the same time we are the Conquerors , and must therefore be obeyed , until Allah , in his own good time , decrees our overthrow . Doubtless he has some good reason for our present elevation , temporary and disgusting though it be . Thus , more or less , argue the learned Mussulmans of Macedonia . The unlearned and the simple , however , are not so severe . I am quite unrepentant where , perhaps , I ought to be ashamed . To me , as to most other Englishmen , the unlearned Turk is infinitely preferable to the Levantine , be he Jew or Gentile , Zionist or Greek . I put the Cretan in the place of honor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near East . But after him I would place the Christians of places like Bethlehem and Ramallah , and , after these , the unlearned Turk . Though I spent two years in Macedonia , never a Greek or Jew came near me but to sell me , at three times its value , something I did not want ; or he might have been a pimp , or a vender of damnable liquor , adulterated from dregs to label . There are numerous exceptions to this general rule ? of that I have no doubt ; but such was my Own experience , and that of practically every Frenchman , Canadian , Serb , or British private and officer of the Salonica army . The Moslem , however , won often our respect and even our affection . For the educated of that faith I had little use . Those I met , and they were fairly representative , were mainly political refugees and assassins who had fallen out with Enver and the Committee of Union and Progress . Ridiculous title of a more than ridiculous society ! And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dupes won the support and confidence of all the ' liberals ' and humanitarians ' of the enlightened West ! 0 ? Bey was quite a good sample of the educated Turk . He had been in the diplomatic service , but had lost his job through a characteristic and typical misfortune . Appointed to a position of some consequence in a Protestant country , he had failed to respect the sexual prejudices of the Infidel . In Sodom or Gomorrah , or even in Cairo or Teheran , he might have served his country with distinction ; but in the less imaginative North he was de trap . I used to talk politics and play chess with him . The bey 's politics amounted to this : why did British diplomacy allow German diplomacy to lead poor Turkey by the nose ? He presupposed , firstly , that the Turk could do no wrong , and , secondly , that the Turk was an irresponsible and charming child whom it was the duty of the Great Powers to pet and spoil . To my unregenerate mind , a godd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bey was equally unconvincing . Hs would begin well , and then lose patience and make an ass of himself . At first I thought these wild moves had some sleep and hidden significance ; but after a game or two it was plain that . my friend had lost his self-cant rol and was heading straight away for ruin . The same psychology applied to politics will explain ; t deal that puzzles us about the conduct of the Turk , be it the massacre of Armenians or his pathetic attempts at government , beginning with himself . 0 ? Bey died suddenly . My own impression is that he was poisoned ; for of such is the kingdom of polities in the Near East . Our illiterate and untraveled Turkish friends were of quite a different stamp . Every time I came into Sa- Ionics from the wilderness , Achmet could not recognize ; so in I stepped In the barber would welcome me as if he investigate . A young girl , unveiled and dressed in black , came up and joined Ic . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most charming thing I had seen for months . I asked her about the tree that had so puzzled me . It was a pomegranate , heavy with fruit , and the first I had over seen . The girl spoke French , ? France has long supported a very noble series of schools in the Near East , ? and soon we were the best of friends . We sat on the stone circle that ringed the well , and talked away for quite a while . It was just like talking to a very bright and questioning school-girl at home ; and so we sat , droning and laughing together , till an old woman ? I suppose she was old ? came out to us , all veils and fury , and chased my little friend indoors . What happened to her afterward I was never Ale to discover ; but I can assure the reader that she was no young woman out of a Pierre Loti novel , but just a happy , healthy kid such as you may find ky the dozen in Europe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such were the first Moslem ladies I had the luck to encounter : the duenna , obviously of the orthodox old school ; the young one , less concerned with h the proprict ies , and trustful as a terrier pup that has never met unkindness . In a higher class ? the class of my defunct companion , 0 Bey I encountered absurd young women who raved about Enver . These were hopeless . Neither European nor Moslem , they seemed purely a destructive species ; and it is to be hoped that by now they are safely under lock and key and thrice guarded by officers of the harem . The next time I met the Turk , it was in Palestine , and he an open enemy and very much mixed up and muddled with his friend the Hun . Almost one felt sorry for the Hun . And one felt quite sorry for the common Turkish soldier . The common Turkish soldier had been VOL . IM ? NO. lied to more than any of us . In war and peace the Moslem has one sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the devils of religious fanaticism and hate , which we of the West have long since outgrown . As a Turk said to me one day , over a meal we shared in Jerusalem , ' You Protestants seem to have no religion . ' In his sense of the word , we have none ; for we had neither murdered nor enslaved our beaten foe , nor had we dishonored his women . Nor had Allenby , like his Turkish opposite , njelnak established a harem of two hundred selected ladies of the count ry ; nor had he robbed his soldiers of their pay , sold their rations and equipment , and let them starve and go naked . Saladin , by the way , was a finer gentleman than any of his Crusading opposites . By so much has s Islam degenerated and Christianity ascended since the twelfth century ; though the great majority of our politicians , so I am told , can still give points and a beating to any knight or bishop who wore the Cross . Another Moslem count ry with which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this planet . Macedonia is sinister and tragic ; Syria and Palestine and Sinai and Libya are charged with drama and the tears of things ; but modern Egypt is pure classic comedy from end to end . As my friend Judge X ? once said to me , and he had known the place With a judicial thoroughness for twenty years , Everybody out here is a bit magnoon : Magnoon means touched , ' or agreeably insane . Hamlet , for instance , was magnoon ; and so , I fancy , are many of the home-keeping Irish . The tedium engendered by great heats and a monotony of sunlight may account for this perversity . Whenever I think of Egypt and the Egyptian , I have to laugh . Otherwise , one might weep over him . England has given him two great men , Cromer and Kitchener . The rest have been nonentities , though Allenby may prove to be a third . It is interesting to talk with an Egyptian about Cromer and Kitchener . The first he respects , the second he loves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immersed in difficult affairs , and something of a scholar and a recluse , as any study of his writings will more than testify . Kitchener was more Egyptian than the Egyptians , a rare speaker of their tongue , a man who had read other men more than books ; and he was power ? which means devoted service ? incarnate . Ardent Nationalists have spoken to me about Kitchener as Verlaine speaks of that imaginary mistress who m'aime et me comprend , ' and whose ' regard est pareil au regard des statues . ' When there was riot and murder in Egypt during the first half of 1919 , similar Nationalists repeated , If only Kitchener had lived ! ' And they meant it , too ! The Oriental adores a master who says , ' Yes , ' or who says , ' No ' ; and Kitchener not only was such a master , but he had the means and the strength to enforce his decisions . With that , he ever treated the Egyptian as a man and a brother . In his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudanese , unspoiled by contact with the West , who had fought his battles , and whose battles he too had fought ; but he never showed this preference , and to all men and women , and especially to the poor , the learned , and the unfortunate , he was alike . Allenby has this same perfection of courtesy combined with firmness , a similar prestige and aura of great deeds and famous victories ; but as yet he lacks his precursor 's intimacy with the people and their language , and years of makeshift government have made his task no easier . In dealing with III the East , it is ncces. sary to have the patience of 174 camels , and , furthermore , one must avoid being too censorious . One 's own stand . ards of truth , honesty , self-control , and especially of sexual morality , need not be laid aside ; but one must accept the fact that the East views most of thetse matters in a totally different light . The East lives by its senses , the West attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more dominant than spirit ; in the other , climate , religion , light , and sanitation have reversed this position . Nor were we always the chastened heroes of to.2day . Read , for instance , the story of the Oddi and the Ilaglioni of Perugia , as recovered by John Addington Symonds ; read the Restoration dramatists or the minor Elizabethan playwrights ; or Rabelais , or Boccaccio ; or the filth that was written and printed in Paris before the a ar , and read throughout Europe and America . We are very far from being immaculate , and it is only of recent years , as history goes , that the Highland clansman has ceased to murder and rob his neighbor , the French serf to lie and accept forced labor , the Virginian to own slaves , and the English Catholic or Protestant to burn his fellow Christian at the stake . I really dare not say that Islam is much worse than we have been ; and , more than anybody , it is we who have set its present face toward revolt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon self-determination were applied to the state of Florida or Mississippi , where the negro population exceeds the white by many thousands , there could be but one outcome to such an application , which I sincerely hope and trust will never he permitted . In some such light one is forced to view what is called the Egyptian Question , where a numerically inferior Christian population is asked to accept the rule of an Islamic or pseudo-Islamic majority , calling itself for political purposes the Egyptian Nation , but in reality being neither a nation nor markedly Egyptian . In the light of historic truth , as well as in the light of factual experience , one has to admit that Egyptian nationality erased to exist a good many years before the birth of Christ ; that it has never recovered from this overthrow ; and that there is neither Egyptian language , literature , nor art . Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , and Turk have held Egypt by the sword ; Mameluke and Frenchman and Albanian have been its master ; and to-day , failing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardianship was offered , the British are in charge . No native-born Egyptian has governed in the Nile Valley for well over two thousand years . Nor is there any race of people in that country which may be regarded in the way one regards the Frenchman of France , the Englishman of England , or , say , the Dane of Denmark . A native of Egypt may be anything , from a woolly-haired negro to an ivory-colored landowner or government official . The practice of polygamy has made a homh-potch of the race and destroyed its identity . Patriotism , in the Western sense of that much-abused word , democracy , and those liberal institutions which are at once the glory and the stigmata of the Christian world , do not exist in Egypt or in any other Moslem province . The East is well content to do without them . My soldier-servant , Ibrahim , put the whole political situation in a nutshell , when , before we were separated by order of the higher authorities , he asked me to get him a new job . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I replied . ' I am only an Unbeliever and an Englishman . ' We were excellent friends and understood one another perfectly , and so I could permit myself these candors . ' If I go to an Egyptian , he say , " Bring me money , or bring me a girl , and then I find you a job . " If you send me to an Englishman , he say , " What can you do ? " and he give me so much pay . ' Thus Ibrahim . Where would you find a girl ? ' I asked next . Ibrahim shrugged his shoulders and said , ' My sister . ' The Egyptian Nationalist politician , invariably a lawyer , journalist , priest , or some other windy individual , wishes to get hold of Ibrahim 's money and Ibrahim 's little sister . In Europe and America , gullible Intellectuals and Labor people , of both sexes or none at all , applaud and sympathize with the noble periods and mendacities which come as easy to the Oriental astum Wing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after is Ibrahim 's money and Ibrahim 's little sister . IV The white man is in Egypt , India , and elsewhere , primarily to protect Ibrahim 's money and Ibrahim 's little sister . We of the West have managed to set some bounds to the rascality of our priests and politicians ; we have created a Public Opinion which t hey fear as the Devil fears the Cross . In the Moslem world it is different , just as in our own world it was different before the Reformation and the major revolutions . Fundamentally , there is not much difference between Islam and the Christian world of the Middle Ages . The trouble with Islam is that it is tied fast by the Koran and the intense individualism of the normal Mohammedan . In the modern world man must cooperate or go under . A religion that ignores the personal existence of an entire sex ; that forbids the lending of money , and therefore places its followers outside that whole system of loans and credit upon which , for good or for evil , our modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exclusions as to make the murder or robbery of an Unbeliever a matter of little or no account , can hardly hope to survive outside the dark places of the earth . In its own way it is honest , and in that it is pathetic ; but the world needs the cotton of the Egyptian , the barley of Palestine , the silks and spices , the oils and minerals , the fruits and tobacco , and all the other produce and raw material that God has placed in the countries which are at present occupied by the followers of the Prophet . And it seems to me that if the Mohammedan can not irrigate and sow and dig and cultivate and mine and bore , under the direction of men of his own faith , then he will have to accept the direction and , with that , the political ascendancy of the despised Christian . The French and Dutch , in their colonial administration , have accepted this point of view quite frankly and with a quite admirable logic . They are firm , but tolerant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this unready soil , and they are spared , in Tunis and Algeria , in Java ; mil Sumatra , all those ridiculous events and manifestations which must occur when an Oriental people is led , lden. , whom , into a blind alley . The Anglo-Saxon , inevitably perhaps , has preached Milton and Mill , and at the same time denied an immediate practical application of their theories . In this , Great Britain and America are much alike . Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity , however , though fine words to write upon a banner , are the most misleading of symbols . Man has to be ready for these ultimate gifts before he IS fit to be intrusted with their dangers and felicities . The Christian world has only in spots arrived at such a consummation ; the Moslem world is quite unready . During the four years that I lived among Mohammedans I never fell in with an original thinker or a mind ihat could be regarded as in any way intportant . And , indeed , Islam has Contributed little or nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , a well-known educationalist , once said to me , ' I have given ten ymr , to the study of Arabic ; I read it and I write it ; but there is next to nothing to read , and there is no audience to Which an original writer can appeal . ' This is perfectly true , as I discovered for myself when I looked for an Arabic version of Cromer 's Modern Egypt . There is no such version . Lit us assume that Cromwell or George Washington or Abraham Lincoln had been able to write a great book , giving a clear and convincing account of the events which he moulded , of the faith which upheld him , and of the Imo* he led out of the wilderness . Such a book is Crooner 's Modern Egypt ; and yet so incurious and so illiterate is the Moslem world , that , for all it cares , this masterpiece might have remained unwritten . Islam is a faith of inhibitions . It says , ' You must not , ' a hundred times for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not live by negation and denial . The Vest affirms , and in so ds ing saves itself . Every Mohammedan I have met who could stand up to and hold his own with the English or 1110 French was a Mohammedan only by courtesy . 5 ' paeha , for instimcc. had but a single wife , and was rather henpecked ; he drank good wine and enjoyed it ; and in religion he was an agnostic , with a sentimental attachment to Islam . His social outlook was that of a feudal baron ; he was hospitable and generous to a degree scarce known outside the East ; and with that he was fat , self-indulgent , and the reverse of warlike . There are dozens like him in the East ? capable men in their way , honest , industrious , afraid of the major responsibilities , lacking in initiative , and full of a conversation which is pleasantly superficial , and , in its larger moments , inclined to platitude . The Indian Moslem , being farther from Mecca and with a good many years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live a good many miles from Rome . My own information about Mecca , by the way , is mainly derived from Hurgronje , a Dutch Orientalist , who had the unique experience of a six-months ' residence in the Holy City , and of whose work there is no English translation . Some enterprising publisher should remedy this omission . The Indian Moslem -- some not very convincing specimens are at present touring the world in the Turkish interest , and for fine , confused thinking would be hard to beat ? is about the finest of the lot . One can , however , easily exaggerate his importance . The total population of India is 317,000,000 . Out of this immense reservoir , scarcely a million men could be found who were fit to serve in the late war ; and of this million only a fraction were Mohammedans . The bulk of the 66,000,000 Moslems of India are peaceful merchants , lawyers , teachers , craftsmen , and peasants , with a sprinkling of fighting men on the frontier who have little respeCt for their brethren of the Plains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted Afghan across the border , one recalls Sir Pertab Singh 's convincing reply to the Indian Nationalist : ' If India were given self-government , there would not be a virgin or a gold-piece between Peshawar and Calcutta . ' Here one comes to the arch-difliculty about Islam ? and all the semi-civilized peoples , be they professing Christians or professing Mohammedans . Islam , however , is almost entirely semi-civilized ; which means that its leading notion of political action is to murder and mutilate the men of the opposing party and to violate their women . One can not get round this fact . I have lived , revolver on hip , in the midst of it , and I have known less fortunate soldiers who were caught unarmed , clubbed to death by a mob of savages , their bodies divided and east out to the elements . For obvious reaeons the story of our women remains untold . Against such a factor no league of nations can prevail , unless it be backed by force , by the courage of its convictions , and by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break itself against a wall of steel . Islam would accept such a league , and , in the long run , be spiritually by so much the richer and the wiser . V Having envisaged this problem as a general idea , rather than as one which very much concerns the British Empire , may I be permitted to approach it on the narrower basis ? There are some 100,000,000 Moslems wit hin the British Empire . Generally-speaking , they are among the most loyal and contented of its subjects . We respect their religion and their code of law ? the two are inextricably combined ; they have been spared or reclaimed from the despotisms , the futile wars , massacres , fanaticisms , and savageries Which are the constant and never-changing marks of the self-governed peoples of Islam . Europe , down to the end of the Thirty Years ' War , was similarly accursed ; and it is with the European of an even earlier age than that that one may best compare our Moslem fellow citizens . Therefore the words Democracy , Parliamentary Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who regards all government as a thing outside himself , wherein he has no voice . It is the business of a government to govern ; and it is his business to be governed . That is his way of looking at it . He does not want to vote or waste his time attending meetings ; he recognizes that Allah has made certain men whose destiny it is to be Masters , and myriads of other men whose destiny it is to work at their handicraft or to cultivate the soil . The whole thing rests with Allah . If he be ruled by Christians , he does not much mind ; and if he be ruled by Moslems , so much the better . He is not a political animal ; he has other excitements , spiritual and sensual , which ; in his opinion , we Occidentals undervalue . He likes his rulers to be just , and , when their injustice becomes unendurable , he rises in his wrath , if he be strong enough , and slays them . A good liar , in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , can usually convince him of anything , and therefore his own rulers have invariably lopped off the heads of such orators . This simple remedy is far-sighted , in that it usually saves the killing of a hundred , or even a thousand , dupes . Our own methods of government , however , do not admit of these solutions . Our object is to get good men and send them to the East , there to maintain law and order and blaze a trail for Western knowledge . We have not always been wise in these appointments , and of late years they have been too much dictated by interest , ? political interest and class interest , ? and by the desire to find some nice young man ' an easy job . A cad in the East , or a tomfool , be he never so blue . blooded or meticulously intellectual , can do infinite harm . The Oriental is a student of men and not of books , and he is quick and unerring in his estimates . The war has handicapped us greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many others have been temporarily withdrawn , serving in the army , the navy , or wherever a place could he found for them . Unless he be their superior in cher . acter and breeding , the white man has no earthly business to impose his will upon the less developed races . The difference between the two , as between our own masses and our own classes , is mainly one of self-control . Slicer intellectuality does not matter ; indeed , more often than not it is a hindrance , leading to doubts and prevarications . A wise Egyptian of the educated class once said to me , ' The English are fools ; but they are honest fools . We do not want to be ruled by clever pee . ple ; we are clever enough ourselves ; we are far too clever . Where we fail is in honesty . ' He , at least , was honest ; but the Eng . lish administrator need not be a fool ; far from it ; and my Anglophile friend is not to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Imperial Civil Service would be to employ a somewhat similar method to that employed in our navy . Our future Nelsons are caught young ; they are the inheritors of a great tradition ; the service is , in many of its aspects , a lay priesthood . Personal selection by a board of veteran officers is the main principle of this method ; so that character and early training , a genuine vocation , are sought for , rather than any kind of special knowledge which answers to the limited tests of a written examination . The whole thing is more a dedication than a profession , and its rewards are paid in honor as much as in current coin . To-day the service has been reorganized on a basis which opens the higher ranks to whosoever is fit to enter them , and officers and men are often ' a band of brothers . ' Sailoring , incidentally , once an art or craft , has now become one of the learned occupations . Our Imperial Civil Service might fitly be a rival to our Naval Service ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to entail the reduction of the two senior services , then such a Civil Service might well replace and carry on the great traditions of our old-time fleets and armies . In the East , where money , and the prestige which goes with money , count for so much , the pay should be adequate , and more than adequate , to the responsibility . Nor should any young man be allowed to occupy a position of consequence ? and the lowest position is one of consequence where the white man is the observed of all observers ? unless he can write and speak one language of the country , and prove himself something of an expert in its psychology , religion , history , and ethnology . Nor is a man of much use in the East unless he be a lover of horses , dogs , and children . The rest will come to him easily enough if he can master these . The above conditions are only theoretically fulfilled under our present systems of administration . In the war , the conclusions and inconclusions of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly finding food for merriment , and more often for disgust , in the official attitude toward such men as Lawrence , Firth , or Edmund Candler ? I name but those whose names Come most readily . There were a round dozen of such men on every Oriental front , and every effort that could be made to stultify or minimize their abilities was duly made . Lawrence , thanks largely to the enthusiasm of an American admirer , is now revealed to the whole world ; but a system which can not extend spontaneous welcome to such a noun stands self-condemned . In addition to the regular imperial civil servant , a place ought to be left for the irregular whose undeniable qualifications can only enrich and broaden the none too remarkable reservoirs of human power now extant . The old stagers will laugh at me when I make a yet more singular suggestion . Being bored and unoccupied in the apOt at Kantara , I applied one clay for a civil post in Palestine or Syria . By an early mail a form was sent me , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the occupation and rank of my father , anal a. dozen other equally fatuous questions . Naturally , I tore this document across ; for I have known men , educated at Harrow and Oxford , let us say , and the sons of impeccable fathers , who were totally unfit to be trusted with a five-pound note . And , absurd as it may appear to the official mind , I have found perhaps an even greater proportion of youngsters and grown men , with the qualities that make for courageous and honest administration , among those connected with the Boy Scout movement than in any such general reservoir as has been indicated . And I will even go so far as to say that from this particular source might be drawn a goodly number of potential administrators . The undeniable mental and moral deterioration which is often induced by too long a sojourn under Eastern skies is a factor that no determined survey of the situation can overlook . Long leaves and plenty of outdoor sport and recreation are the surest preventives ; but where these fail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone rotten must be removed . It has ceased to be a personal question ; it is a matter that touches the honor , the worth or unworth , of a whole race . And now , reviewing this whole subject in an English light , one must inevitably arrive at certain conclusions . If our domination over Islam , or over any other of the more primitive peoples , means one thing more than another , it means that we are trying to fit them for self-government . Success , for us , means , therefore , a renunciation . If we succeed and teach the Indian and the Egyptian and the peoples of Palestine and Mesopotamia to ' run their own show , ' then we have done what we have set out to do . There can be but one logical end to such a mission . It will mean that many white men will be cut off from pleasant and interesting jobs ; it will mean that some of these will cry aloud and turn prophet . The air will be filled with evil tidings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian point of view ; and , moreover , it is so deeply bitten into our nature that , try as we may , we can not escape from it . And , accepting this argument , the peoples who are so fitted for self-government in the modern world will no longer be the peoples of Islam . Call themselves what they may , they will have accepted our ideals , and with them our gods . A remnant may continue in the deserts of Arabia and Africa , or in the mountains of Central Asia ; and their sport , their business , their politics , will still be war . Well , we were ever a sporting nation . But Islam of the plains , the valleys , and the cities will have ceased to be Islam ; just as the Christianity of to-day has ceased to be the Christianity of the Crusades , the stake , the conquistadors , and the Inquisition . On the other hand , ? and there is a good deal of evidence in favor of this supposition , ? it may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands and pressure of the modern world , and that it is the ungrateful destiny of the white race to function as a ruler . The late Mr. Roosevelt , admirably indiscreet , has said the last word on this subject . Or one may contemplate a third solution , disgusting and nboininable , and yet , under our present dispensations , not altogether impossible . The Christian world may destroy itself , ? it has done , and is doing its uttermost in this direction , ? and leave the more primitive peoples in possession . These ? cheap , fertile , and nearer to the earth ? may be our heirs ; and amid these , Islam , patient , shrewd , observant , is watching our antics and hoping for the best .
