Capt . T. J. J. See , Government mathematician and astronomer at the Mare Island naval base ( San Francisco , Cal. ) , has been conducting exhaustive experiments and computations upon-Nothing . Greater men than he have done the same , and he has been utilizing their findings - Sir Isaac Newton ( gravity ) , Pierre Simon LaPlace ( astronomy ) , Sir Christopher Wren ( architecture ) . Nothing is important , for it permeates and envelops Everything . It would be nice to know definite things about it , what it is and does . Last week Capt . See announced something about Nothing : <P> It may be called Nothing for it is entirely imperceptible to the senses of man . Only by inference and mental conception has man discovered that Nothing exists . Capt . See calls it " the world gas " instead of by its more familar name , ether . It is the substance that fills all the spaces among the heavenly planets , among the planets ' composite molecules , among the molecules ' composite atoms . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tenuous and insinuating substance . Capt . See figures it is 47 billion times less dense than hydrogen , the thinnest gas known . Its particles are 4,000 times smaller than hydrogen molecules , ( the smallest known ) . So fast are these particles moving ( as shown by the tenuousness of the substance ) that they go 23.5 times as fast as the fastest electron ( electric particle circling an atom 's nucleus ) and 57% faster than light . They go , in fact , 294,000 mi. per sec . <P> <P> With such particles " world gas " is , of course , highly elastic-about 689 billion times as elastic as air , Capt . See figured , in proportion to its density . And this elasticity , which accounts physically for the speed with which light traverses space , coupled with another property , is what ( according to See ) accounts for gravity and the fixture in space of heavenly bodies such as the earth , the moon , the sun . The other property is the weight of world gas . <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles are , it weighs with a great weight upon earth , moon , sun . Against its pressure they can not fly out of their orbits though their circling speed , imparted at birth , is not checked by the yielding mass . How strongly the world gas acts as marshal of the spheres was suggested by Capt . See : <P> " Exact calculation shows that if we had five trillion cables of steel , each a foot in diameter and the steel capable of lifting thirty tons to the square inch of the cross section , this whole giant forest of steel cable would be stretched to the breaking point to hold the moon in its orbit about the earth . To hold the earth in its orbit about the sun would require an 11-inch cable of such steel on each square foot of hemispherical cross section of our globe , which practically would cover the earth 's surface with such a forest of steel cable , each stretched to the limit of its tensile strength .
