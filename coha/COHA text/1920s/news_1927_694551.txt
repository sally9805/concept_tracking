txt Senator Borah , Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , took issue today with President Coolidge in the latter 's expression of doubt that the Constitution would permit the Government to enter into treaty arrangements with foreign powers for the outlawry of war or committing it to a course of conduct virtually hostile toward a nation which undertook aggressive warfare . The views of the President , which were disclosed at the White House yesterday , appeared to be aimed in large measure at Mr. Borah 's plan to outlaw war . There would he no restriction on the sole right of Congress to declare war if his plan were put into effect . according to Mr. Borah . In one important aspect , however . the President and the Chairman of the Foreihn Relations Committee were in accord . Senator Borah found himself ( mite in agreement ! with the President 's view that , to carry out proposals to have this Government prevent any American aid from being extended to an " aggressor nation , " it would be difficult to determine what constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . perhaps , in holding- that there was no means of defining an aggressor nation . Holds War Illegitimate . What Senator Borah chiefly stressed was that he was unalterably opposed I to any peace plan which recognized war as legitimate . His policy would be to make war only when there was violation of peace agreements and codified international law . He found nothing in the Constitution that would inhibit the United States from engaging in war against a nation guilty of such violation . In that respect Mr. Borah seems to be at odds with the President 's opinion , which , however , is an opinion not maturely determined , according to the impression given to newspaper men at the White House yesterday . " I do not think peace plans which turn upon the question of an ' aggressor nation ' are-workable , " said Senator Borah . " An ' aggressor nation ' is a delusive and wholly impracticable proposition as a factor in any peace plan . ' There never has been an ' aggressor nation ' and never will be in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machinery of peace . There is no practical way in an eaigency to determine what nation is an ' aggressor nation . ' Indeed . there is no way to deter mine , it seems , after the war is over . Against Arbitrary Standard . " If you set u , an arbitrary stanclare. such as treating that nation as an ' aggressor nation ' which refuses to arbitrate , you may accomplish the very rever3e of what you desire to accomplish . An evilly-disposed nation could very easily so present the nronosition that it would he impossible for a nation to arbitrate . " Such a standard is purely artificial and might very easily compel a nation to choose between complaing with an artificial standard and taking sides against a just and moral cause . This standard substitutes formality for substances . " So far as I am concerned , I would not support a peace Man which recognizes war as legitimate at any time or under any circumstances . If war has to come , it should come in contravention and in violation of peace plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or protection . " In an informal way , Senator Borah amplified these views . A treaty was binding , he contended , and a plan for preserving peace and making it difficult for a nation to wage war was not unconstitutional as far as the United States was concerned , for , in his opinion , a. treaty was binding on this Government . In Mr. Borah 's view the plan to outlaw war did not take away the constitutional power of Congress to declare war ; it merely created a condition where it never would be necessary to exercise that power . Differentiating between the proposal to outlaw war and the provisions of the League of Nations covenant , Mr. Borah expressed the view that in the covenant there was an attempt to transfer to the League of Nations that which Congress alone had the I power to do . He did not contend that the out , lawry plan would end wars , Mr. Borah explained , but in his opinion it would destroy the legality of war and allow public opinion to operate against a system which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he believed there was an opportunity for some one to come forward with a declaration that war was a crime and lead a crusade . He mentioned no names . As Mr. Borah saw the situation , any peace plan which recognized war was an absurdity . The ideal system , he contended , was codification of international law in which war was not recognized as an instrument to settle international disputes and under which the nations agreed to submit their differences to arbitration . Another thought put out by Senator Borah was that the only remedy against war was public opinion and he believed , he said , that public opinion could be educated in that direction . Specifying , he pointed out that once duelling was legal , but when it was declared illegal public opinion went against the practice . Once slavery was legal , even when ' William Lloyd Garrison fought against it , but , said Senator Borah , Garrison declared slavery was a crime and it was made so in thirty years thereafter .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
