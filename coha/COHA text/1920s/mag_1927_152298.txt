Manhattan Mary . For the past few seasons Ed Wynn has been in business for himself Now , having gone to work for Producer George White , + he suffers slightly . In his own shows Mr. Wynn wrote most of the material and it was fabulously funny . Manhattan Mary was written by others and not all of it is irresistible . Yet only cranks are carping . Mr. Wynn is not as funny as he can be , but he continues safely as one of the five or six funniest men in the world . Surrounding him herein are stunning costumes from the designs of Roman de Tirtoff-Ert and executed by Max Weldy , Parisian ; stunning chorus girls from the designs of Divine Providence ; and periodic blasts of song . The thing also seems to have a plot , something about a girl from Manhattan slums who became famous in the Folies Bergere . In his most recent Scandals , George White introduced the now virtually incessant Black Bottom . In Manhattan Mary , he supplies a prospective successor-the Five Step . Mr. White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalling days when he was an humble hoofer** for his now greatest rival , Florenz Ziegfeld . This innovation is second only , in importance , to the appearance in the pit of Mr. Wynn leading the orchestra , in which process his back begins to itch-something that well trained conductors ' backs never do . But Mr. Wynn 's does , and he scratches it . <P> <P> Murray Hill . Leslie Howard++ is so securely one of our best imported English light comedians that anything he is acting in comes already guaranteed . He is not , as yet , one of our ' best playwrights and as far as this ( his first effort ) goes , the guarantee must be tempered with a hint that Murray Hill is only fairly funny . Mr. Howard has written of spinsters horrified by intoxicated men-about-town ; of a will which promises golden future to a young man if he behaves . But he does not . There are two mixed identities and an urbane love interest . As a player , Mr. Howard is , as always , immensely entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really his wife . In a farce she would be . But before this purifying fact came to light the audience had been led laughing , but not immoderately , through the mazes of one of those farces with a will in " it . This will decreed that Jimmie should marry a woman of his guardian 's choice . Jimmie could not see it and had a way of running off with an actress for Atlantic City weekends . Thereby he nearly lost a fabulous fortune . There are audiences who will eat it up and some who will not touch it . It has wild oats in it .
