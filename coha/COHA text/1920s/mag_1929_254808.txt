New consignments of fat sausages , clinking cases of fizzy drinks , fragrant bales of fresh-printed programs , moved through the land this week in preparation for an annual event of great importance-the opening of the Big League baseball season . <P> Once a national pastime , now a Big Business , baseball still remains the same old-time game . Unlike football , its authorities seldom countenance changes in the rules . This year they rejected a radical plan for ten-man teams ( the tenth man was to bat for the pitcher ) . <P> General interest this year ( distinct from local interest in home-town teams ) centres in efforts to crush the dominance of the New York Yankees ( American League ) , undefeated in the last two World Series . At last opponents see a ray of hope . Small , shrewd Miller Huggins , the Yankee manager , has been forced to replace an important cog in his almost-perfect machine . The agile legs of Joe Dugan , third baseman , gave way . Huggins has moved Mark Koenig , shortstop , to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the services of one Lynford Lary from the Oakland , Calif. , club for a reported price of $75,000 . Florida sunshine , however , revealed serious faults in Lary 's fielding . What to do ? A young man on the substitute bench , Leo Durocher , had the answer . Durocher is 23 . He did not cost $75,000 , nor one-tenth that much . He has been on the Yankee " Yannigan " string for several years . Huggins liked him because he was alive . When the oldtimers " rode " ' Durocher he talked back . He even wrote them fresh letters in his off hours . When Durocher talked this time he had the right answer . He wanted to play shortstop . That is just what he will do now and a long step it is for a youth of 23 . <P> Experts agree there is little hope of heading off the Yankees in the American League . Cornelius McGillicuddy ( " Connie Mack " ) , Philadelphia 's oldtime practitioner , has virtually the same team that proved unequal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough . The American League has two new managers who may stir new interest . Walter Johnson , long venerated pitcher ( now retired ) of the Washington Senators is now in charge of the team . Stanley ( " Bucky " ) Harris , whom he replaced , has taken over the Detroit team . <P> In the National League , however , there is a real rival for the chesty Yankees . Backed by the chewing-gum millions of William Wrigley Jr. , Manager Joe McCarthy has built up a formidable combination . Said Bucky Harris after the Chicago Cubs had beaten his Detroit Tigers five straight games in spring training : " It is the greatest team I have ever seen on a baseball field . " Harris has seen the Yankees . He has seen them at their best .
