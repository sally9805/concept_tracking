Mr. Willis . Goaded by the pro-Hoover Scripps-Howard newspapers , of which there are six in Ohio , Candidate Willis enlivened the week by crying out at Columbus : " In these times we hear much of chains-chain broadcasting , chain motion pictures , chain stores , chain newspapers , chains in international trade . The fact is , under the chain system . . . the great middle class of our people face all the time greater difficulties in maintaining its independent existence . . . . Since when has the Republican Party come to the place where its candidates are to be dictated by a chain of newspapers that have never supported the Republican ticket ? " <P> Mr. Hoover . The Chicago Tribune beckoned . The New York Herald-Tribune pushed . The Scripps-Howard press coaxed and clamored and , more compelling than any of these , the Springfield Republican , a Bible to many Republicans , issued a fiat , citing 16 reasons . The last day approached , the next-to-last day arrived , and that evening Candidate Hoover did it-authorized the filing of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was already fighting Senator Willis for Ohio 's . <P> In one sense , Senator Watson 's " candidacy " for the Republican nomination is even more curious than the Willis phenomenon . Senator Watson 's reputation is extremely unsavory . The Springfield Republican 's 16 reasons for a Hoover campaign in Indiana were references to 16 members of the Watson political crew who have been indicted for crookery in the past four years . But , unlike pompous Senator Willis , easy-going Senator Watson has no pretensions beyond those of a " favorite son . " His game is simply to herd the Indiana delegates for delivery to his good friend Vice President Dawes or for barter with other big G. O. P. traders at the convention . Candidate Lowden did not file in Indiana , and therefore , since Lowden admirers realize that a vote for Lowden is virtually a vote for Dawes anyway , the Watson support in Indiana will be a Watson-Lowden-Dawes vote-really more significant for Candidate Hoover to beat , if he can , than the Willis vote in Ohio . <P> To suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Indiana by Republican newspapers or by his own disapproval of the Watson regime , would , however , be foolish . More and more a political technologist , he did not enter Indiana until convinced by Publisher Oscar G. Foellinger of the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel that there really was a chance of winning 17 or more Indiana delegates from Senator Watson . The Indiana primary law provides that whosoever wins a majority of the delegates , wins all , and Indiana 's delegates total 33 . <P> Smith v. Walsh . South Dakota , adjacent to the home State of Candidate Walsh ( Montana ) , held Democratic and Republican State conventions last week . The Republicans unanimously endorsed a Lowden-Dawes ticket . The Democrats voted on Smith v. Walsh . Result : Smith , 43,876 ; Walsh , 41,213 . <P> Mr. Woollen . So quietly that citizens of other States scarcely heard him , Banker Evans Woollen of Indianapolis formalized his candidacy for the Democratic nomination by filing for the Indiana primary .                @ @ @ @ @
