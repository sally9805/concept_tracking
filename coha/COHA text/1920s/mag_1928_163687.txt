On a ferry pier in Manhattan a crowd of commuters waiting for the boat that would take them to Staten Island saw a line of small boats come round the curve of the harbor . They were racing , each boat a dark point capping a triangle of spray ; the commuters looked on with interest . Suddenly one boat choked , caught fire ; the men on board could be seen working wildly , throwing something on the burning engine . The other boats swept on , then in a feather of foam one swerved , capsized ; a coast guard cutter raced out to pick up the men in the water , the crowd on the dock cheered . It was all , they saw , fine and exciting , dangerous , picturesque , good fun . <P> Next day the commuters read in their papers how the outboard motorboats that they had seen had raced round Staten Island and how Baby Olds , piloted by D. W. Brewster , had won after Miss Princess caught fire and the Corson upset . And they read how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big boats , sailboats , motorboats , were being launched , sailed , raced . <P> Outboard Motorboats last week lined up in Boston to race down the stretch of open water to the Cape Cod Canal , through the canal , Fisher 's Island and Long Island Sounds to Flushing , N. Y. Along the coast four destroyers and 40 Coast Guard boats were stationed to mark the course , help the disabled . Seventy boats jockeyed around the starting line until a cannon boomed . <P> Calm seas , clear skies favored the racers impartially until they neared the canal . <P> <P> Here a stretch of rough water called forth desperate efforts , threw two capsized sportsmen to the waiting rescue ships , gave a comfortable lead to a seaworthy Corker sea sled driven by Charles P. Stevens of Albany , N. H. Racer Stevens never lost his head . His time : 14 hrs. , 5 minutes , 37 seconds. * <P> Sailboats of all sizes raced at Glen Cove , L. I. , in the annual regatta of the New York Yacht Club . The tallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payne Whitney 's Vanitie , always sails against the Resolute and often wins . This time it won but was disqualified for failing to cross the starting line properly . At Southport , Conn. , Princeton beat Yale and Harvard in a race of eight-metre boats ( see p. 34 ) . <P> " Steam Yacht ready for launching " said the telegram received in Cincinnati by Julius Fleishmann , yeast heir . It meant that his twin-screw , clipper stem , Diesel yacht , with its accommodations for 14 guests , its lockers holding food enough for eight months at sea , its living room , smoking room , dining room , its owner 's private gymnasium , lounge room , and dressing room , its cold storage plant , its shining mahogany and brass , was standing at the head of a slide in Manhattan , worth $625,000 . Mrs. Fleishmann christened it . <P> <P> * Thirteen years ago Thomas Fleming Day , deep sea voyager , hung a one-cylinder Evinrude over the side of a twelve-ft. dinghy and chugged 233 nautical miles from New York to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outboard motor . A power cruiser accompanying the dinghy broke down twice , three times . Pioneer Day completed the course . His time : 52 hrs. , 47 minutes .
