it was at the beginning . Can you imagine a greater inspiration to the sluggard to keep on slugging ? If the moralist wished to put an end to it what a fool he was to send the sluggard to the ant ! To see anything work so hard and use so little imagination inspires me to put forth as much imagination as the ant shows energy . If I could do it I should have the world at my feet without lifting a finger . Of course , no one but a sluggard could understand an ant . Perhaps , then , the moralist of the Book of Proverbs is calling on the sluggard for information unobtainable from the biologist . Probably both are themselves ants ? my observation tells me that most people are ants ? so , obviously , they would never understand " the ant . " Children never understand " the child .

If I , for example , were to take ants seriously , I should be proving in a folio , with notes and appendix , that the author of the Book of Proverbs was an ant and a woman ? mark ye the feminine pronoun in the line which gives me my text , and further evidence in Chapter XXXI . She was one of thesehere-now good housekeepers , smirkingly setting an example to her " shiftless " neighbors . Ants ! I see them everywhere from Wall Street to Market Street , with Main Street all the way between . Ants ! What are traffic policemen but a sluggardly attempt at ant control ?

Remember that " to travel hopefully is better than to arrive , " and that to travel desperately is best of all . The farther I look into it , the more I am inclined to think that the whole Book of Proverbs is ant-propaganda , put forth by the Rotary Clubs and Ant Lions of its day . The ant , it tells us , " is little upon the earth , but exceeding wise . " Little , I grant you ; intelligent ( within limits ) if you will ; but wise ? Not if I know what wisdom is . And then , note the complete character of her below disguised as the portrait of a " good " woman . Good for what ? Why , to keep house , to be sure ?

" Clever of him , I say , to get his counterblast to the ant-propaganda bound right next to it in the same volume ! Now I know what you 're going to say : look at the conclusion he reaches ? all vanity , yes , and no anodyne for it but work . " Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do ?

As I have perhaps hinted , the sight is a great comfort to sluggards . I think , too , I have heard them speak disparagingly of other forms of wild life , both fauna and flora . I never heard an ant speak a good word for a lobster , a lemon , or a clam . I have never sat with a lobster at his own hearth , but as I have met him at table ( under what might be to him trying circumstances ) I have nothing but commendation for him . The lemon sets a good example to any ant by turning his sunny cheek to the world and keeping his acidity to himself ; if you force it out of him you ca n't blame him , can you ? As for the clam , he is the sluggard 's beau ideal . He does n't rush insanely about if he gets a sea-anemone on his back . He is a byword for his sunny disposition .

Church weddings , where one revels in space and seats , are to me , if I may use the expression , so much pie . Need I say that my friends recognized my talents , and I was in constant demand ? As proof I can produce seven dozen silver pencils , one gross of near-gold cuff links , fifteen canes , and a whole haberdashery of wing collars , cravats , spats , and gloves .

This preparation , sweetened by politeness and diplomacy , has endeared me to many who have chosen to be married in the old homestead or the new apartment , with only a legion or so of friends of the families invited . " One of the chief dangers at a house wedding is , as you know , that a large lady who has some hold on one of the families involved will insist on singing . There has seemed to be no way of preventing her rendering ' Oh , Promise Me ' or something . Appealed to by desperate bridegrooms on whom the affair was already a severe strain , I , and I alone , found a way to silence the lady singer . My stratagem was simple but perfect .

Nothing daunted , he proposed . 1 remember his telling me what a sweet old-fashioned girl she was , for she told him he would have to ask her father . " Expecting to find that gentleman in the library , he was informed by the girl that he was divorced and lived five floors up in the same apartment , but was out of town at the time .

With equal tact , I put the contingent with the bride 's divorced father on the bridegroom 's side of the hall . I seated the separated older sister of the bride successfully . I was tried but did not fail when the estranged cousins of the bridegroom appeared . And then , five seconds before the Wedding March , with every seat in the house full , a magnificent and imperious lady stepped up to me . Her words caused my hard-built reputation to crash about my head like a pack of wedding cards ! " The unhappy creature in the ambulance tore at his neatly brushed hair .

My divorce from the bridegroom 's best man 's father is pending and I am engaged to the father-in-law of the bride ! ' " The unhappy head usher sank back on the stretcher . " I do n't know what happened after that , " he groaned . As the ambulance stopped and they unloaded him and carried him down the aisle of the hospital ward , he whispered in wild yet touching tones : " I am neither a friend nor a relative of the bride or bridegroom .

I know a father who is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now that he is a parent parents are nothing . He has lost out on both counts . But , personally , I think that this business of being young is greatly overestimated . You do n't really enjoy being young because you do n't know you are young ? until you arc old . Most of this talk about how wonderful youth is comes from the very aged . But the old are wily , too . Although they praise youth , they are not going to let you have things all your own way . They are not going to let you forget that , although youth may have a future , old age has a past . And here they have a decided advantage , because the past is actual and definite , whereas the future is still vague . You ca n't point out to them the glories they are going to miss because you do n't yet know yourself what those glories are . You tell them that the future will be splendid . They say , " Maybe it will , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime , the past was splendid . Oh , no doubt about that at all . Nowadays all the fascinating people are dead .

Everyone is at the dogs . There 's no place to go . You ca n't go to Hell because Hell has been padlocked by the atheists ; it 's no longer functioning . Swearing is n't what it used to be ; lack of religion has robbed it of all its point . The strong , vivid phrases have all become obsolete . No , nothing is what once it was , according to my antique friends . You tell one of them , for instance , that you are going to hear Jeritza . " Oh , but my dear , you should have heard Nordica . " Or you say you saw Hampden in " Cyrano de Bergerac . " " Oh , but you should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you saw Bernhardt before she died . " Oh , but my dear , you should have seen her before she lost her leg . " It 's simply hopeless . They overwhelm you with names like Ada Behan and Henry Irving and Ellen Terry They talk about Terrace Garden and Daly 's old theater down on Broadway . They rave about tandems and horse cars . You can thank your lucky stars that you got in on the ragged edge of saloons . And it is n't just New York you 've missed out on . Heavens , no ! It 's everywhere . Post-war travel , they say , is like post-war liquor , bootleg stuff . Without flavor , without bouquet . Youmight as well stay at home . Europe is n't the same any more .

" You did n't know him well ; you did n't know him at all . You ca n't have the skull . I must confess that I found all this very trying , and terribly inconsistent with their constant assertion that youth is so wonderful .

There 's no poetry in them at all . You should have had the tremendous adventure of going to Weehawken on the ferry . You came over from Paris yesterday by aeroplane ? How dull ! Now in the old days we used to go on big ocean liners that took five whole days to cross . They were awfully exciting , those long voyages . You played deck games and bet on the ship 's run .

You can lead a man to liquor , but you ca n't make him drink . And then this idea of theirs about doing away with inhibitions . They have no business to take a man 's right to sin away from him . It 's unconstitutional . " Nothing is what it used to be . Take art , for instance . Art has gone to pot . There has n't been a single first-rate artist since 1928 .

" Yes , you see I am all prepared to be old and to do my best to take all the joy out of being young for youngsters yet unborn . I am spending my present accumulating a past so that those youngsters ca n't make me feel sorry when I no longer have a future . I am all ready with " In my- day " and " Back in 1928 .

MARTIN F OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for politics , and efforts have been made , quite earnest among the managers on both sides , to make it the closed season for religious polemics . How successful that has been the reader is welcome to estimate for himself . It is not entirely easy to keep the way of life and the way of government apart . Sometime when we shall happily have attained to a better understanding of everything and a philosophy proportionately improved , we may look back with amusement to sects and their differences . It is funny about them . Some originated in valiant spiritual leaders , as the Methodists in Wesley , the Quakers in George Fox , the Mormons in Joe Smith , and back of them the Baptists in various teachers , the Lutherans in Luther , and the assorted Calvinists in Calvin . These spiritual leaders usually saw very vividly indeed something that was really there . They got religion vitally , but when they tried to pass on what they had received , they seem to have done much what mediums do who get messages out of the Invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really included in what was shown to them . This they have usually done innocently enough , simply from being unable to separate themselves from their message , and because they believed all the products of their minds were equally important . Nearly all our great sects arc basically Christian , the Mormons ineluded ; and the variations in the Protestant varieties are due to the personalities of the apostolic characters who touched them off . The Roman Catholic Church , being a thousand years older than any of its Protestant children , is much more crowded with the results of particular religious experiences ; and to know how it came to be what it is would involve a protracted excursion back into Church history . After enduring persecution , dissension , expurgation , and secession , the Catholic Church of our time has come to be considerably a racial institution . The Latins , as a rule , have stuck to it and among the Celts , the Irish ; whereas the people of Northern Europe have for the most part gone Protestant . The nations of Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , find it hard to break themselves of the habit . The same as to the sects ; they have beaten one another up so much , used so much molten lead and boiling oil , so many racks , thumb-screws , and worse to bring about . Church unity , that they and their descendants , even in the United States , still find it hard not to bite thumbs at one another in any great discussion of the public business . But now the public business having had the floor for so long , it is the season again to discuss religion . How about it , is it doing well ? People who study religion as a curious human propensity that has transpired in some form since prehistoric times , think our present forms of it have about run their course and are heading towards dissolution . But people who have actually got something valuable out of Christianity as it now functions do not accept that conclusion . Men look for a better understanding and application of what we have . There are statistics about it . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of characters visibly improved , but the Department of Commerce ( lately in charge of Mr. Herbert Hoover ) reports that between 1916 and 1926 the churches of the United States gained thirteen million members , and that the value of church edifices in 1926 more than doubled what it was ten years earlier . That does not look as though religion were going into a serious decline . The churches at least seem prosperous , but their prosperity is not quite the same thing as that of religion . A lot of fault is found with some of them because of activities which are denounced as un-Christian and politically dangerous . It is of no importance to have more churches and more people in them unless they are getting sound religion that makes them good . A great many observers in our present world . some very intelligent , others fanciful , are waiting for something to drop .

Bull markets are unlike Tennyson 's Brook in that they do not go on forever . What will check ours is not yet expounded to us , nor when the check will happen , but that it will be checked is matter of course . Some lines of business are good , others bad . Banks and motor car companies and many other departments of activity are prosperous . Coal miners , textile operatives and operators , and farmers are not happy in their economic condition . They might perhaps have been helped in some degree by governmental interposition , and efforts should and doubtless will be made to help them in that way ; but it is not so much politics that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in habits of life , the drastic change in fashions for women , the increased use of machinery , mass production , and too slow absorption of over-production stimulated by the War . The fact that there are millions of people in trouble about the means of supporting life makes the election at this writing uncertain and leaves very serious problems to be handled by the next administration . And that brings one to realize that , however the election has gone , all responsible and thoughtful people of whatever party should unite to solve the great problems which the country has to meet . One great subject that now after election calls for prayerful consideration is the Foreign Debts . The present administration , so far as it is concerned , has been mainly concerned to collect them . It is true they have been abated , but it seems also true that no final solution of the problem that they constitute has been reached . Our bankers lend money to Europe to pay the interest on what Europe owes us . That looks very much more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mellon once said that good trade relations with Europe were worth to us more than all the debts . That expresses the right attitude on that subject , but power to make that attitude effective has not been given to Mr. Mellon or anyone else .

We , on the other hand , can see nothing in the least funny ( and I do not think this wholly due to the lack of a sense of humor ) in Mr. Villard 's so misusing his position and his influence as to tell the readers of HARPER 'S ( p. mo ) how foolish it is to be alarmed when we have not even a liberal party , " unless the Socialists are to be so ranked ? in the field in this Presidential election . " if Mr. Villard 's radical stand-ants are such that he , hesitates to class even socialists as " liberal , " surely the communists must be able to pass his test , whatever it may be . At this writing the communists , according to the press , have already qualified as a third party in sixteen states , the last being Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before election . MARGARET C. ROBINSON . Norman Hapgood , in his Weekly Letter , takes comfort from Mr. Joad 's paper on " The Future of Man " ; When we are worrying about poor old mankind . nothing helps more than perspective . Wells handled the trick welt in his Outline of History , and it is revived , with less vividness , but in an energetic article , in the September number of ILArsPEB's. one of the few American magazines that have any mental vigor . In the IlAnpvit 's article it is estimated that there has been life on the globe for Leoo , 000,000 years : , and human life for 1,000,000 , of which the civilized part is only a few thousand years . On an estimate of the globe 's remaining habitable for ten thousand times as long as there has been any life or ? times as long as there has been human life ( figure it yourself ) , not to compute the number of times as long as there has been civilization , there is room for at least a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces of nature is only about a hundred and fifty years old . For those who are worried about time there came along , only a few days ago , the assertion of Professor Millikan , certainly as distinguished a physicist as we have ? winner of the Nobel prize  - -  that there is nothing in the prevailing idea that life will cease to be when the stars grow cold . On the contrary , he says , the cosmic forces are creating heat with the same persistence with which they are destroying it . So take it by and large we may look forward with equanimity to man ( or his superiors ) having an opportunity to work out his irleals , if any .
