txt Yes , very comfortable , " observed Al Capone today with a smile , as he glanced around his cell in the " Park avenue " block of the eastern state penitentiary . And the former overlord of Chicago 's beer boys was n't exaggerating one bit the conditions under which he is an- enforced guest of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania . As he spoke . the dulcet strains of distant music were being emitted by a powerful cabinet radioreceiver of handsome design and fine finish . The formerly cheerless floor of the cell was covered by a beautiful rug In which soft colors and luxurious texture were combined . On the oncegrim walls of the penal chamber hung tasteful paintings . The whole room was suffused in the glow of a desk lamp , which stood on a polished desk . Nearby was a chest of drawers and a bed . Everything was cheery and homelike and Capone 's brief observation indicated his appreciation of that fact .                   @ @
