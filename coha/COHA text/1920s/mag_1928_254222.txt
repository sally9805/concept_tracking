Twelve special trains chuffed into the small town of Rzeszow , last week , bearing 10,000 docile prisoners , guarded by some 1,000 police . Soon a large military drill ground was fitted out with grandstands and constituted as an open air courtroom . Only 62 lawyers and 100 witnesses were present . The 10,000 defendants were charged with malfeasance as petty officials of the Polish Railway Men 's Benevolent Society , which has only 21,000 members . The case , first heard at Lwow last year , with a mere 6,000 defendants present , will now proceed in earnest , is expected to drag on for months .
