For most people pottery is too familiar an accessory to life to have much importance . Tiles , plates , saucers , cups , flower pots , vases are so necessary they are commonplace , manufactured and bought by the million . Normal purchasers exercise a natural regard for what is pleasing in pottery , but to select pottery as the distinctive work of a gifted individual would seem precious to most people . <P> Yet every great civilization has brought its pottery to an artistic level commensurate with its painting , sculpture , architecture . The Grecian urn , hymned by Poet Keats has become symbolic of rare beauty . Wedgewood is a name which added lustre to the reign of George III . <P> In rural Rockland County , N. Y. , lives Potter Henry Varnum Poor who works with the diligence of a Greek , who never duplicates , who sells every piece he produces to pottery cognoscenti at prices often mounting into three figures . In U.S. ceramics , he is at the top . Last week his work was on exhibition at both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter Poor 's method is Persian and difficult . Known today as " under-glaze decoration , " his method involves metallic oxide colors which must fuse with a glaze fully to reveal their tones . Most pottery methods involve repeated firings , which allow plenty of time for the potter to decorate and redecorate if he is not satisfied . Not so with the oldtime Persians , and Potter Poor . He must do his decorating swiftly and surely , and only once , for the glaze must quickly follow and the piece be fired without delay . <P> Potter Poor justifies his exacting process by showing that it necessitates brisk , simple design- ' ' the subordination of technique " - and produces " depth and brilliance of color . " The resulting ornaments-leaves , flowers , nude figures , abstract patterns-are so sketchy that the temptation is to call them naive . They are the simplification of form to only the essential contours , graceful and spontaneous . They are not precise and intricate geometry . <P> His color range is limited and there are no circus tints . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull reds and yellows , the tones seem caused by years of exposure to the decorative whims of nature rather than by a deliberate , conscious process . <P> It is this earthy naturalism of Potter Poor 's work , timeless and styleless as so many lustrous beach pebbles , which constitutes its solid , enduring value and which has quietly made its creator his reputation . Acceptance by the Metropolitan Museum , profuse with classic pottery , has dignified a career as unceremonious and sincere as that of a medieval illuminator.
