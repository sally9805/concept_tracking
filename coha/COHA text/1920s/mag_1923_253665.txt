There is a courageous paper in the South . It is the Enquirer-Sun of Columbus , Ga . In spite of K. K. K. 's to right and left , in front and rear , it says : " The whole Kukluxklan Kamelia Komedy is so foolish that one no longer wishes to protest against it because it is anti-Negro , anti-Jew and anti-Catholic , but rather because it makes the people of all the South appear idiotic when they continue to accept seriously Klonvocations and Klonciliums , and tolerate the fantastic ravings of men who are fattening on the money of deluded simpletons.
