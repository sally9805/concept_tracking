N OT long ago , in an English newspaper , the present writer saw some remarks , incidental but not uninteresting , on the ancient three-volume novel ? the " Old Three-decker " of Mr Kipling 's not least charming poem . Two reasons were , I think , alleged for its unsuitableness to present days . One was that the twentieth century had not time to read it ? a common but mistaken view as far as the novel , if not the century , is concerned . The average three-volume novel was by no means so long as it looked . The volumes were not very thick , and the binding was substantial for circulating library use ; the print was large and largely spaced and margined . You could , in reviewing such things , not by mere " dipping and skipping " but by honest if skilled reading , despatch a couple of novels between dinner and bedtime without dining very early , or outwatching any Bear of decent and domestic habits . But if I remember rightly , the journalist in question rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technique of novel-writing made the three-decker inconvenient and obsolete . Of that beloved old craft ? for even after having to do with some hundreds of specimens of her and discharging broadsides into not a few of them , the memory of the whole fleet is kindly ? it will not be necessary to say much more now , though we may return to her towards the end of this article . It is on the question of the " advance in technique " alleged , and of the character and value of technique itself in the arts generally , in literature especially , and in prose fiction most of all , that the spirit has moved me to say a few words . The subject ought not to lack interest in America for the first writer on it who occurs to me is my old acquaintance : the late Mr Henry James , and the next the ( I hope ) living Mrs Edith Wharton . Not that I propose , directly or even indirectly , to support or attack the notions of either , but their names which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shew that Columbia has not been indifferent to the matter . Now even to hint or hesitate doubt , dislike , or distrust of such a thing or such a word as technique may seem to argue either mere  | stupidity or idle paradox . What is just a little more , it would also argue ? in the case of a critic who for more than half a cen has done his little best to accentuate the importance of trea over that of mere subject ? something like impertinent in sistency . You look at your Greek Dictionary and you find ( posing that you did not know it before ) that techne means " the way or means by which a thing is gained or done " : and as all arts . coarse and fine , are concerned with the gaining or doing of thing art is a good way of translating techne into English . And all the arts , from cookery to architecture and from poetry to schoolbookwriting , require a large collection of detailed ways and means to produce and warrant their results ? details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et cetera . Now the mass of these ways and means may be justly called " technique , " and be separated . if you like , into selection of object , process , and material respectively . In point of process perhaps the arts of design require most elaborate technique : and accordingly there has always been more dispute about this with them than with others . As to music I shall say nothing because I have no technical knowledge myself . I merely judge it by the gross results on my ear which is tolerably catholic , but quite uneducated . It is of the technique of literature alone that I can undertake to speak with some expertise , if not of production , of valuation and judgement ; so to literature let us come Even in this one art ? if you can call it one where the diversity in its unity is so great ? the importance of technique varies greatly in different departments . In poetry it is of course , if not of greater , of more obvious importance than in prose : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a prosody of its own , and prose , metrical verse , and free verse alike have , at their peril , to obey or rebel against certain as yet very imperfectly discovered and perhaps never quite exhaustively discoverable laws of rhythm . Independently of this , which we may call the arrangement of words , there is the selection of the words themselves ; and independently again of the form altogether there is infinite possibility for technique in selection and treatment of subject . Now let us go back , for a moment , to our Greek Dictionary . We shall find there a subsidiary definition of techne " A set of rules : a system or method of making or doing a thing . " Now , beyond all doubt , this was the special meaning of the word , or rather of its derivative " technique , " of which our anonymous authority was thinking when he said that advance in it was adverse to the existence or revival of the Old Three-decker . Please observe that in assuming an attitude of at least dubiety in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment intending to attack any set of rules , any system , in particular . My scepticism is of a much wider and deeper kind . It extends to questioning the value of , and to denying the advance attainable by , such " systems " in literature generally ; and in novel-writing more than in any other department . Of course this is heresy : and save at very few periods ( when even at these it was rather triumphantly heretical than orthodox ) it always has been heresy . Mankind has always hankered after prescription , positive and negative : and has perhaps scarcely ever shewn its hankering more than in times and at occasions of apparent rebellion and revolution . Adam and Eve were to eat the apple not because it was nice but because it was to give them instantaneous and extensive education in good and evil ; murder , robbery , et cetera , are justifiable and justified to-day because " class-war " is such an excellent theory . Now every kind of technique is a collection of prescriptions negative and prescriptions positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd in the unconscious infantile manner , as when the excellent Alison pointed out that every principle of taste forbade the depicting of a Bandit with a Grecian nose ; sometimes they are , if not ridiculous , purely arbitrary as when the Right Honourable John Wilson Croker laid it down that every couplet of heroic verse must contain a completed sense , if not exactly a completed sentence . Often they are not at all absurd in themselves : but they are rarely free from more or less arbitrariness . Even when at their very best ? that is to say when they are intelligent and obedient generalizations from the best works of the past ? they risk , if they do not positively deny , the two greatest properties ( for these are something more than mere qualities ) of Art ? its Infiniteness and its Individuality . In mere mechanism you must have technique ; you may , in the beginning of things have to learn it by practice but if you neglect it or are rash in experimenting for it , you will have various unpleasant results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a city . In Science as that word is commonly understood , you  | need a good deal of it . But in Art , after the merest preliminaries ; ? colour-mixing , perspective , construction of musical instruments , voice-production , grammar , prosody , et cetera ? technique will be of little use to you and of no little danger . " Save your own soul you have no star " ; and if you are starless in that respect , the most cunningly and correctly built craft will only carry you at your peril . Now whether novel-writing be , as some have claimed for it since its coming of age , after being long in embryo and not a very short time in nonage , comparatively recently the ? or at least a ? supreme form of literary art , there is neither room nor need to discuss here . But there are certain points about it which make it the most closely human of the divisions of the most essentially human of arts ? literature . It may not command the heights and depths as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Drama . But then Poetry borrows a good deal , while making this its own as it borrows , from Music ; and Drama from the arts of colour , design , and action ; the novelist grips ( if he does grip ) his reader without the aid of any such accessories . He at once represents and appeals to that infinity and individuality of passion , manners , thought , and in short life which characterizes and constitutes humanity and which characterizes and constitutes Art . It will surely follow from this that Technique , except of the most rudimentary kind ? technique equally necessary to novels whether they be in twenty volumes or in three or in one ? is rather unnecessary to them , and may be rather more than dangerous . A curious example of this strikes me as I write . Perhaps there is no technical warning of modern times which has received , nay deserved , more praise ( for its neglect has often brought disaster ) than Matthew Arnold 's famous one in the Preface to his Poems as to the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , " in which " everything is to be endured , nothing to be done , " et cetera . Whether the critic-artist 's own Empedocles which he condemned on this score , deserved the condemnation does not here matter in the least ; it is enough that the caution or rule seems eminently reasonable and that it has sometimes justified itself . But ? and this is the important point ? at the very moment when it was written there had been written , and not long after it was published there was published , one of the most remarkable novels  | if not of the very highest class only a little below that ? Fromentin 's Dominique : which its warmest admirer would find it very difficult to free wholly from the operation of Matthew 's rule . The rule operates but the result escapes . Nor in this case can that most misunderstood of all sayings , " the exception proves the rule , " be urged with its usual misunderstanding . The rule fails , not because of the exception in this case or in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind admits none . I believe it is hardly an exaggeration to say that there is not a great novel in the world in which a sufficiently acute and practised critic could not detect a breach ? nay a number of breaches ? of technical rules by no means of the ridiculous or the excessively arbitrary type . " Women are rum creeturs " though Mr Snodgrass did so indignantly deny it ( I fancy Emily Wardle taught him better later ) . Men are creeturs perhaps less obviously but not much less decidedly rum : and the novel which should deal with both , including of course their circumstances and experiences , their wills and ways ? is a rum creetur too . Now technique presupposes that its creeturs will not be too rum ; that they will be at any rate orderly and obedient in their rumness ; that even if they go in for complexes and inhibitions these can be in a manner foreseen and provided against . They can not . That is to say , of course , they can : but you will do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nay more ; you can , if you possess certain powers not wholly of the right kind , educate and breed up a public which will enjoy or think it enjoys your technical or Frankenstein-made creations . But theirs is a diseased appetite : and you are pandering to it . No one of the very great novels of the world ( as has been said already ) subjects itself to any technique ; the exception which used to be made in the case of Tom Jones has been impartially disproved by objectors who had no idea at all of attacking technique in itself . Perhaps the greatest and surest rule of apparent technique ever formulated at any time is the old Aristotelian doctrine of the superiority of plausible-probable impossibilities , over possibilities not rendered plausible or probable . Yet if you consider this you will see that it annihilates technique altogether . The next greatest text , with a huge expanse of time between but so close in sense as to be almost identical is Coleridge 's " suspension of disbelief . " Sovereign of course . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to make impossibilities plausible ) " God bless us all , that 's quite another thing . " I have read as much criticism , technical and other , as most of my fellow creatures I believe . I have n't found many effectual receipts or directions for the production of these little morphological changes . A friend of mine once received one of those curious uncomplimentary compliments which are perhaps the sincerest , from somebody who said to him , " You have a wonderful way of telling a story . I do n't mean as a novelist would tell it . " Now the novelist must of course have the gift of telling a story as a novelist tells it and there certainly is a difference . I once heard a novelist ( and one of no mean class too ) tell a story just as it had occurred to him , walking up and down the room and gesticulating the while . He printed it afterwards : but it was by no means the same thing . " Ah ! " you say , " the technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the technique we have been talking of , the technique of rule and scheme ? of sidemarked analysis of motive and the like . The only real prescription that I know of ? after critically reading thousands of novels and reading for pleasure at least scores of them over and over again ? is something like the famous one of an older art , perhaps the oldest of all , Cookery . " First catch your story ( whether by head or tail does not much matter ) . Then catch characters which will enable it to work out . Catch words to put in their mouths , that will in the best sense accompany ' the action . Catch description et cetera to garnish with at pleasure . " But exactly how you are to do the catching no one can tell you to any good purpose , and the people who pretend to tell you will probably tell you , if not to bad purpose , to bad result . Practice may help to make you perfect : but by no means certainly . There are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelists , from the author of Manon Lescaut downwards , than there are single-success artificers in any other craft . To put the conclusion of the whole matter you will write good novels if you are a good novelist : but exactly how you become a good novelist and how you write good novels probably you do not yourself know , certainly no other human being can tell you .  |
