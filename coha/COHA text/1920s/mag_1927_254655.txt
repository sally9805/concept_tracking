Three motor cars lately jounced and bounced along the dusty pot-holed road into Samarkand , Russian Turkestan , ancient seat of Khans , golden city of Western poets . They had come from Harbin , Manchuria , some 4,000 miles . Their chauffeurs were moderately excited because none of them had had to regrease his car . At Harbin they had been supplied with the invention of one Alexander Muhacheff , Russian engineer ; an oil extracted from the seeds of a weed that grows wild over vast areas of Manchuria . Despatches last week from Peking stated that some Japanese gentlemen had interested themselves in Engineer Muhaeheff 's new lubricant , which is very cheap to make . They had built a factory at Harbin to " revolutionize " motor lubrication.
