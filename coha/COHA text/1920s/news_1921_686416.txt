Many of these babies and toddlers get very little fresh air becausd their mothers are not strong enough to carry them far and they never have enough money to buy a carriage . Many a poor mother has two babies who can not walk , the tiny new baby and the " old baby " who is only 12 or 15 or 18 months old and can not walk out in the street . Now that the Spring days are coming , it would be a wonderful pleasure for these mothers and little children to be out in the sun and fresh air for hours each day , and this would be quite possible if every such family could have a carriage or go-cart . There are many people in Nest- York with baby carriages in their storerooms , people who would be glad to send the carriages which their own children have outgrown to those to whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carriages will be more than welcome if sent to the Relief Bureau , the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor , 103 East Twenty-second Street . In behalf of the little children who may be benefited let me urge the importance and value of this service . BAILEY B. BURRITT , General Director A. L C. P.
