Most of the fine or the expensive pictures which are sold abroad ( see below ) are bought by wealthy U. S. collectors . Over a long period of years , perhaps as much as $250,000,000 worth of works of art have left England for the U. S. This fact has caused sentimental Britons to feel pangs of regret and it last week caused Arthur Brisbane , Hearst editor , to offer caustic reproof rather than sympathy to the sentimental Britons . Wrote rich Mr. Brisbane , whose splendid homes are by no means bare of pictures : <P> " Britons mourn because they have ' lost $250,000,000 in antique art . ' They ought to rejoice because they have gained 250,000,00 modern dollars and use some of that money to develop or revive art in their own country . They have plenty of art left , in museums , and it does n't matter whether Raphael 's Madonna and Child stays in the private house of Lady Desborough , or moves to Millionaire John Snooks ' home in America . In either case it is wasted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
