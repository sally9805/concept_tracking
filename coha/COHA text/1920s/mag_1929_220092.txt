Some years ago after a concert by the Flonzaley Quartet in a small U. S. town , a man in the audience rushed up to the second violinist and said : " Beautiful , but not like old times . " " What do you mean ? " asked the second violinist , bewildered . " You should have heard Mr. Flonzaley himself at the head of this quartet , his bowing , his musical feeling ! " The second violinist bowed his head . " Yes , we never could come up to the old man , " he murmured . <P> The second violinist was courteous , but the misguided show-off had blundered . He might as well have told one of the six Floradora girls that not one of them could sing like old Senora Floradora . For the Flonzaleys are as unrelated as most teams which have a single name. * There was no Mr. Flonzaley who fathered them all . There was instead a Swiss banker , Edward J. deCoppet , who wanted chamber music in the U. S. He appointed Violinist Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it after his Swiss villa , Flonzaley , which translated means " brooklet . " <P> This year , the twenty-fifth of its existence , the Flonzaley Quartet is making a transcontinental tour of farewell concerts . Last week , they played what was to be , save for a supplementary benefit to be given March 17 , their farewell concert in Manhattan . Two of the players will join a new Stradivarius Quartet , ( socalled because they all own Stradivarius instruments ) in which Wolfe Wolfinsohn is to be violinist , Gerald Felix Warburg , son of Banker Felix M. Warburg , the ' cellist . The remaining two announced no plans . But their work as a unit is done and , last week , their story was reviewed , their achievement attested . <P> The Record . When the Flonzaleys first came to the U. S. , the sole chamber ensemble of any importance was the quartet of Franz Kneisel , violinist of the Boston Symphony . Kneisel was the pioneer . The Flonzaleys have spread the gospel , making it possible for many to become acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some 2,000 concerts in 500 U. S. cities , some 500 more in Europe-so have they done what Banker deCoppet meant them to do . For balance , clarity and unity they have been and still remain the best of their kind in the U. S. , without challenge . Comparable to them abroad might perhaps be the London String Quartet , the Vienna , the Busch ( Berlin ) , and three Hungarian - the Leuer , Budapest and Roth. * <P> The Players . The original Flonzaley players were Adolfo Betti and Alfred Pochon , violin player ; Iwan d'Archambeau , ' cellist ; Ugo Ara , violinist . The first three are in the Quartet today but Ara left to join the Italian army in 1917 . Ill health prevented his return and Louis Bailly , now of the Curtis Institute , succeeded him until 1924 . Then Felicien d'Archambeau , brother of Cellist Iwan , played for a season and since then Nicholas Moldavan . The Quartet now stands with Betti , an Italian ; Pochon , a Swiss ; d'Archambeau , a Belgian ; Moldavan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name Flonzaley , so bound by their playing and rehearsing together , that they have rarely been considered individually .
