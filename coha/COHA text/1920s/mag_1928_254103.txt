At the end of their month-long Quadrennial Conference , Methodists meeting in Kansas City decided who should succeed the retiring Bishop of New York , Luther Barton Wilson , who is aged and somewhat infirm . Bishop Francis John McConnell , hitherto of Pittsburgh , was the man they chose . <P> Since 1919 , when , in criticizing the condition of the steel industry , he rebuked the late Judge Elbert Henry Gary and spoke harshly of the 12-hour working day prevalent then , Bishop McConnell 's name has been perhaps more familiar to laymen than that of any other Methodist . Always vitally interested in questions of public as well as churchly import , Bishop McConnell headed the active Committee on Christian Unity and Industrial Problems at the recent International Missionary Council in Jerusalem . At Kansas City , Bishop Mc Connell was assailed on almost frivolous charges of " maladministration and immorality . " In transferring him to the New York Bishopric , which is regarded as a promotion from his previous station , his peers showed how little seriously they regarded these aspersions.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
