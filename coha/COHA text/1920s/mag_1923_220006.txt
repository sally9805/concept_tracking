Dr. August von Wassermann , distinguished German serologist , who developed the so-called " ; Wassermann test " for syphilis , announced another achievement in preventive medicine- a method of determining the presence in the body of latent tuberculosis before it becomes active in the lungs . This will enable physicians to weed out the probable victims of the dis- ease . A regime of appropriate diet , rest and fresh air , applied in special schools and at home , will then go far to prevent tuberculosis from claiming those who would formerly have been its prey . Dr. Wassermann 's method-he refuses to call it a discovery-is the result of long research based on the groundwork of American and French investigators , during which he tried out more than 500 different serums . He gives credit to the United States for first rank in the world-wide fight against consumption . Most human beings carry the tubercle bacillus in their systems from early childhood , but the majority are able to throw off the disease through their natural powers of resistance . Others fail to develop this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new test consists of a serum which is mixed with a sample of the patient 's blood . This serum reacts positively only when the tubercular process is still actively present , and not when it merely has existed in the past . It is not affected by syphilitic toxins . While he does not claim that his test will make possible 100% accuracy in diagnosis and complete cure of the disease , Dr. Wassermann believes that it will enable the forces which are already fighting tuberculosis with well-understood methods to get a stranglehold on it in its earliest stages and greatly reduce the present death rate .
