txt Six weeks or so ago . dispatches from Scranton and surrounding towns told of the hardships being undergone by miners and their families . Starvation and famine existed on every side . Mining resumption was looked forward to eagerly . The mines reopened and men went back to digging coal . The first pay day arrived happily . The second one was welcome , too . But last week the urge to labor had diminished . On Thursday the men worked eight hours . Friday was a holiday . Saturday , being between a holiday and Sunday , was disregarded by so many miners that loadings of anthracite were negligible . Sunday yielded nothing and on Easter Monday the mines were idle . A four-day and for some a five-day holiday was enjoyed . A. C. L. L. A brokerage house with Washington connections says one reason for the sharp declines in Atlantic Coast Line and Louisville &; Nashville has been due to the feeling that the merger of the properties would be delayed by the Nickel Plate decision . lie adds lie gets it on authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be a merger . " he said , " of two roads that are already practically one . " T. G. S. One of the reasons for the strength of Theas Gulf Sulphur is that between 30.000 , and 40.000 shares were purchased recently by one large interest for investment . thereby reducing the floating supply . ' ennui , A EN IL 11 ** A Y Third Avenue Railway stock selling around 37 , with more than $5,100,000 in interest accumulated on its $22 , - 536,000 adjustment income bonds and with first eight months of this year showing a deficit after adjutment bond interest of $18.898 , is evidently discounting changed future operating conditions , which may or may not occur . If it is discounting favorable action on its application to operate some So buses in the Bronx . it reflects a quite favorable opinion of the profitability of bus operation . In estimating lau , operation profits , perhaps comparison is made too frequently with results of Fifth Avenue Coach Co . This company operates mostly on a 10-cent fare and for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fifth Avenue Coach , says if his company secures franchises for operation of 84 buses in the Bronx it expects a loss of $50,000 to $100,000 annually for three years . This is the best estimate that has been made on the net results to be expected from independent bus operation in the Bronx . It is contended that buses can be used as feeders to the Third Avenue surface cars , but with any very extensive system of free transfers front buses to the cars it remains doubtful whether earnings of Third Avenue applicable to its stock would he appreciably increased . PASSIAG COMMENT New Trader ? " Seems kind of quiet compared with the : 3,000,000 share days we were having tip to a week or two ago . " Old Trader ? " It is simply the calm after the storm . People are getting their bearings . Rather a case of suspended animation . " New Trader ? " Do you think we will get back to two and three million share days in the near future ' " Old Trader ? " Tell me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what the market is going to do . Some people are amazed over the refusal of business to fall off much after the heaviest stuck market decline we have had in years . They do n't quite understand it and sonic think that depression after the stock market crash just has to happen . It would n't be true to tradition if it did n't . Therefore , they are holding back purchases of stocks . When they arc convinced that business will continue to be clone at the old stand without the aid of S. 0 . S. signals . they will get back in - he market and we will then get sonic two and three million share days . " New Trader ? " But why do you think business is going to continue good . and the market will eventually become more active with the tendency of prices upward ? Many people take opposite views . " Old Trader ? " I ant simply guessing like everyone else . I base my forecast on the fact that we went through a severe break without a failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conditions are sounder down here than ever before . Not one corporation was distressed by the break . Several individuals had to be helped out , but their trouble was due to an overextended position in the market . Money continued comparatively easy all through the smash and will continue easy . One reason is that industry has more cash than a year ago and inventories are about the same notwithstanding record gross business . And with brokers ' loans off $500,000,000 since the first of the year , a good foundation has been laid for a better stock market . " New Trader ? " Judging from your views you must be heavily long of stocks . " Old Trader ? " No , I have n't got a share . Like all the rest When they are up 15 or 20 points , if they go that way , I may be convinced that what I am telling you now was right and buy a few shares . The trouble is few of us have the courage of our own convictions .

HEARD ON TUE STREET Seventeen thousand shareholders for Studebaker , a gain of 3,000 over a year ago , indicates better distribution of capitalization . Not in many months has the demand for funds from brokers been so light . Some stocks reactionary .
