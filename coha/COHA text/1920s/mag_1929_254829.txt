A fear of ergot has been subtly inseminated throughout the U. S. during the last year , adding to the trepidation of conception . This week the source of that fear , a trade controversy , became public . <P> Ergot is rotted rye . A fungus grows on the rye head and eats away the grains . What is left is a collection of hard bodies , each shaped like a cock 's spur . Hence the name ergot , from French argot ( spur ) . Good , dry ergot is of inestimable value in obstetrics . Its extract contracts the uterus and arteries , stops hemorrhages , raises blood pressure . Good ergot saves the lives and bolsters the health of hundreds of thousands of women annually . But bad ergot may contain poisons which cause abscesses and kill . U. S. pharmacists get their raw ergot from Spain , Portugal , Poland and Russia . <P> A man who makes it his business to examine samples of ergot from all countries is Dr. Henry Hurd Rusby , 74 , professor of botany , physiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of Spanish and Portuguese ergot Dr. Rusby has usually found good . The usual condition of Polish and Russian ergot has horrified him . He has found it mixed with black-eyed worms and gray lice . Samples were consistently old and mouldy . Extracts often killed experimental animals . <P> All last year good Dr. Rusby tried to raise a scandal . It spread subtly to women and has scared them . Doctors , however , paid no attention to his exclamations . They knew that manufacturing druggists who use dirty Polish and Russian ergot cleanse and refine it thoroughly when preparing ergot extracts , that the extracts sold by reputable pharmaceutical houses satisfy the high U. S. Pharmacopoia standards for the drug . In addition to ignoring Dr. Rusby 's scandal , they were vexed to learn that his good friend , Howard W. Ambruster , Manhattan importer , held a corner on all the Rusby-approved Spanish and Portuguese ergot . They imputed to Dr. Rusby a too-willing protagonism in a mere trade controversy .               @ @ @ @ @ @
