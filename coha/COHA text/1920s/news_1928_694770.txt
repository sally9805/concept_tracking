txt Two additional education bills , the most far-reaching of the series of ten now before the Legislature , were introduced tonight by Senator Seabury C. Mastic : , Republican , of Westchester . One empowers the Mayor of any city or a member of th fiscal council whom he . may designate to attend every meeting of the city 's Board of Education that concerns the making of the educational budget . The Mayor or his appointee would have full freeddln to take part in the discussion or debate . This proposal is in line with the appeals of city authorities for more power to . check the financial policies of boards of , education which now exercise a considerable amount of fiscal independence . In some communities the ethicational authorities do not have to submit their budgets to other city officers and in other cities the manner of expenditure . if not the total amount , is free from supervision or revision . In New - York City the Board of Education ? makes its ' own budget without statutory cooperation with the Board of Estimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggregate estimate , but not of dictating items of expenditure . In some instances this lack of authority has resulted in friction . between the Mayor and the Education Board . The other bill provides for the appointment by a Board of Education , at its discretion , of a business superintendent or manager to direct the management and fiscal affairs of the schools and other educational activities of the board . His terns , manner of appointment and salary would be subject to the board 's direction . Both measures are said to follow an agreement by a subcommittee of the joint Legislative Taxation and Retrenchment Committee , of which Senator Mastick is Chairman . to recommend better business management in school affairs and greater power in the responsible financial authorities of a city to supervise the finances of the Board of Education . The introduction of the two bills allayed much of the criticism from city representatives in the Legislature who had protested the " ineffectiveness " of the prior series of bills .               @ @ @ @ @ @
