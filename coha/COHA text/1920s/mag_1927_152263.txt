When President Coolidge " chose , " he startled his secretary and his doorman . He startled Main Street , Rapid City , and Wall Street , Manhattan . It is not unthinkable that he even startled himself , but certainly he startled no one more than his political impresario , William Morgan Butler , Chairman of the National Republican Committee , who , just when the laconic lightning struck , was on a jotting jaunt in the Northwest , a tour of inspection to see what properties would be necessary for the Prosperities of 1928 , starring Calvin Coolidge . <P> Lest President Coolidge 's statement be made to seem a pet of political temperament , Impresario Butler closed his lips tight , pocketed his incompleted jottings , left the Northwest . But before going to Canada for a vacation , he did say that Calvin Coolidge was not to be thought of as definitely unavailable for the Prosperities of 1928 . During Mr. Butler 's vacation , President Coolidge repeatedly if silently insisted on his unavailability , finishing up last week with the almost crabbed words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading for Washington last week , obviously had a lot of new plans to make . <P> Mr. Butler was heading for Washington to confer informally with some members of the Republican National Committee , whom he had summoned privately by letter . The " Sic ' Em Boys " ( Democrats , insurgent Republicans , and copy-starved political correspondents ) anticipated his arrival by spreading reports that Mr. Butler was still planning a " Draft-Coolidge " movement . When the President characterized these reports as " unfriendly , " the " Sic ' Em Boys " transferred the epithet to Mr. Butler and forecast a Coolidge-Butler spat . They also whispered that Mr. Butler was going to pick the G. O. P. convention city ; that Mr. Butler was perturbed over insurgency in Wisconsin ; that Mr. Butler was about to put Republican pre-convention doings on an official party basis . No one suggested that Mr. Butler was going to resign , but the New York Times called him " our most perplexed statesman " and others sketched the enormity of the task with which he , or his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boys used to repeat at least once a year : <P> Ask your papa for fifty cents <P> To see the elephant jump the fence . <P> He jumped so high <P> He hit the sky <P> And never came down till the Fourth of July . <P> The Republican National Chairman paraphrases this limerick at least once every four years , substituting " March " for " July " in the last line . The first line contains the first charge of his chairmanship . If the Republican elephant is to jump the fence , there must be moneys . So well is this known now by good Republicans that the financial duties of the National Treasurer have become almost automatic . All Mr. Butler has to do is indicate the amounts that seem necessary and his committeemen do the asking-papa part . <P> The short couplet , with its promise of a thrilling performance , is the difficult thing to fulfill . With President Coolidge unavailable , Mr. Butler and his committeemen had soon to determine-whether they began determining last week or not until the National Committee routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be most likely to take the elephant skywards.
