txt LENIN NOT THE MAN . Recovery of Russia Must Come Through Others . To the Editor of The New York Times : Being a Russian by birth I am naturally interested in the development of the situation , which is extremely complicated , to say the least . Mr. Hoover says there shall be no trade agreement with Russia , and advances very sound arguments in support of his contention , while others would like to think it over before Lenin 's note is answered . There are lots of things to consider , and it would require a lot of tall thinking to make a step in the right direction . Russia , from the standpoint of commercial standing , is a bankrupt party . The possibilities of her recovery are contingent upon many a political factor . However , it must be borne in mind that Russia has strong recuperative power , because of her large exports in normal times . Before Russia can function again as an economic unit on the market of the world there will be required a lot of capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industries of every description . The United States can offer mostly manufactured goods , while Russia can offer mostly agricultural products . This situation means the money for payment for American goods must come from a third party , that is to say if we are reviewing the case along broad lines . If Lenin 's Government were to try raising money so badly needed for reconstruction of ruined Russia , I , for one , would not like a job of a salesman to sell the bonds . After having his balloon ride Lenin has decided , or rather has been forced to decide , it was about time to come down to earth . But , surely , in this case coming down to earth is much more difficult than " going up . " The much advertised Russo-British trade agreement looks more like a political stunt than anything else . Surely it can not stand analysis other than that of a political nature . It appears impossible to solve the Russian problem without formation of some sort of international syndicate of great financial backing , supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of control of Russian affairs to guarantee the good faith of Lenin 's Government . Under the circumstances it is hard to devise a practical , and workable means to accomplish the results . There is no question that the Russian people have suffered the tortures of hell during Lenin 's balloon ride , and they will welcome any change toward a more conservative state of things . The will of the Russian people has never had a chance to express itself , but it must be with their approval that the foreign Governments be invited , and contracts and treaties be made with them to help Russia to get back on her feet . Most certainly Lenin is not the party to sign for Russia . V. V. MESSER . Douglaston , L. I. , March 22 , 1921 . At Ellis Island . To the Editor of The New York Times : Silt : As an average citizen I have had the average faith that in spite of all the criticised shortcomings of our Government officials they maintain a reasonable minimum of efficiency and of consideration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . This faith included our immigration officials . Recently faith has been shattered . Immigration is in all our mouths and on the front pages of the daily press . The loudest cries are for restriction . They should be for consideration  --  of the immigrant . Last week a steamer from Glasgow docked In this city . With my wife I tried to meet , and extract from bondage , a third-class passenger , a young girl coming over to be a governess in our household . The office of the line told us that the third class would be sent to Ellis Island , the day after landing , for examination , and that at their office we could procure a pass admitting us to the Ostend , where we could claim the passenger and secure her release . After waiting in line in the street an hour I procured the pass . It got us as far as the Ellis Island Ferry . The ferry gate was guarded . We could not pass . Because no passengers from the S. S. " B " would be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of the line . Wo telegraphed the girl this report , telling her of our efforts in her behalf . No one haw yet given an explanation of the non-delivery of the message . The next day the mystic pass advanced us to the ferry entrance . " The ' B ' ? Nothing doing . Come back at 12 . " Quest for further enlightenment was terminated abruptly by one of New York 's " finest . " who shoved us , with some seventy people of foreign birth , bewildered , anxious about family and friends , none too gently back from the ferry gate . At 12 we were told to return at 1:30 . At 1:30 the word was " come tomorrow . We ; were assured vigorously , positively , that no passengers from the " B " would be at the island until the next day . This was confirmed at the steamship company 's office . At 9 that evening , alone , terrified , ! old no inquiries had been made for her , doubting our existence , the girl arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island both days . The first day some third-class passengers who were claimed were examined and allowed to leave the island . At the end of the second day all were released . During those two days men , women and children , many children of all ages , and babies , had nothing to eat between an early breakfast on the " B " and a meal or . their return at night . They were carried from the ship to the island on a small steamer and kept on the steamer . There were few places to sit . There was water  --  in a barrel on the deck with no means of dipping it out . They asked for food . There was none . Mothers asked for milk for their babies , in some cases leas than eight months old , still feeding from bottles . -e was none . One baby , crying from hunger , barely escaped convulsions . ( I am told that on the island itself a limited number of baskets of food could be purchased for $1.50 a basket . ) These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . There is no typhus In Scotland . Yet Eastern Europeans were herded among them on two occasions during the two days . There is typhus  --  and cholera  --  in Eastern Europe . The above is not an isolated instance . In February the steerage passengers of another steamer were kept on the island a week hi tents . Achniting the tax upon the personnel and facilities of the island , is there any excuse for the condition depicted ? Is this the way to instil Americanism ? Is Your faith ffrent-e than mine ? DANFORTH GEER Jig : ? Short Hills , N. .1 . , March 31 , 1021 . The Aged in Austria . " When the war is over , the enemy must pay ! " Well , the war is over , Austria has paid . She is bankrupt , dismembered , ruined , hopeless . Such is the m and moral outlook of those of her people ' whose lives are nearing an end ; those who , if with nothing to look forward to for themselves , may still have consolation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of their material outlook ? Iu Vienna Crib once well-to-do upper middle classes have known famine for three years . Something to relieve the old people , of whom there are but too many , has been and is being done ' by the Friends ' Relief Mission . Old age pensions are granted to " Mittelstand " cases , consisting of fortnightly rations of groceries ; and in cases where the houses are quite unheated , 230 kroner for fuel . Out of the many thousand cases needing relief ' hot all gan be aided , and the help given . rnay seem miserably inadequate to the need . But how much that little means to those who receive it ! Is it worth while helping to keep these old people from starvation ? Perhaps , in a strictly rationalistic regime , it would be better to save the children and the productive members , of the community only , and let the aged perish . But we live in the world as it . is , and their death is not sudden , but full of misery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crumb of bread  --  such a death must surely shame the conscience of all humanity and make the very angels weep . OLIVE IrESELTINE . Member of the Friends ' Relief Mission . 10 , Singerstrasse . Vienna 1 , Feb. 28 , 1921 . French Catholics . To the Editor of The New York Time : : : I read with amazement the tsiegram printed In your issue of Mare ! : 31 in which John D. Moore protested in advance against the presence of M. Vivian ' at Cardinal Gibbons 's funeral . Apparently Bishop Corrigan  --  to whom this telegram was sent  --  did not share in Mr. Moore 's view , and Mr. Moore appears today in the unpleasant situation of an ill-advised , Ihasty person who gives unsolicited advice to his superior and gets snubbed . There are many Catholics in America who rejoice at seeing France resume her hereditary traditions by working in accord with Rome . These Catholics are on the side of the Pope , who also openly rejoices . There are a few other American Catholics who seem to see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gernictn propaganda . German propaganda is doing all it can to make the American Catholics forget that there is hardly a cathedral in the United States that did not have a French Bishop ? one of tits predecessors of Cardinal Gibbons was Archbishop Marechal , whose name is enough to explain his origin  --  and that half the religious orders now existing on American ' soil are also of French origin . But facts are facts . M. Vivian ! , like everybody else except fools , has learned . He has been from the first one of the champions of resumption of intercourse with the Vatican . Perhaps Mr. Moore would have refrained from flashing his retrospective indignation at a Bishop of his own church if he had been prudent enough to ask for a little information . ERNEST DIMNET .
