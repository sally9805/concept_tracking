txt O. Jean-Aubm ** I Of far greater import than their obvious interest to admirers of the work of Joseph Conrad are the two volumes of his " Life and Letters , " Just published . To those of vs who thought  --  and always will feel  --  that Conrad was one of the greatest writers of all time , they are the most intimate and blessed gift . ' But there are not enough of us in the world to make possible the gathering together of two thousand of his letters If those letters wore not as much the comment on life of a great man as they were a comment on letters of a great writer . It is , therefore , as the souvenirs of a great man that M. Jean-aubry presents his letters , and from them there emerges a picture of a humap being colossal . There was  --  quito unconsciously ? in Conrad something of the old martyrs ; untinged with any thought of the modern martyr complex , suffering what fate gave them to suffer , stating it as a fact. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehoW , as Conrad says in one of his letters , being certain only that ho would bear up somehow . There has been much said and written about Stevenson 's devotion to his art despite his illness . So many sermons have been preached about it ? in pulpits and in less public spots  --  that the world has come to think of Stevenson as the most bitterly handicapped writer of our times . But Stevenson had not the terror of hunger staring at him through the bars of his illness . Ho had a childhyod of happy memories . Conrad was taken , as a baby , to an exile camp in Russia , where he was ' the only child , where his mother died ' before his very childish eyes and his father before eyes old enough to understand . He was eleven or twelve before ho left , except for a short visit , an atmosphere of the most depressing kind . His passion for the sea was , so Jean-Aubry says , more of a passion for freedom , as exemplified by the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , and it was undoubtedly because his health was so shattered in Africa that he became a writer instead of remaining a sea captain . Never , until " Chance " was pubfished , wan there enough Money to live on . And not one year during his entire lite after he left " The Heart of Darkness " was ho free from what he calls " gout , " which Was a virulent pain in his feet and his wrists , literally laylog him low for weeks at a time , and at one time for seven months . Writing , the physical exertion of using a pen , was at times the most exquisite torture . And ho was a vieot constantly ' recurring terrifying fears that ho could never write nnother line . And yet , never did anything leave his pail that was n't corrected and recorreeted until he was satisfied with it . Thera was apparently an inner urge  --  though ho does n't say so ? which dogged him like a demon . He was never free from a passion to write , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical as well as mental deprossibn of the blackest kind . It ' ever the pains of literary parturition are described with perfection Conrad describes them In his letters . And the very bulk of the letters is another light on a great character . A good two-thirds of them are letters to friends of his who have written something and sent it to him , and to whom he replies with the most open hearted joy in their success . There is n't a line of envy in the hundreds of letters to " Dearest Tack " ( John Galsworthy ) or to Cunninghame-Grahame , , or to Edward Garnett , or to Arnold Bennett , or to H. 0 . Wells , or to his literary agent  --  to whom he might have occastionally lot go a word of eagerness for his own financial as well as artistic success . He oven writes Cunnginhame-Grahame that any number of people  --  himself especially  --  would have felt it an honor to have gone over his proofs for him and correct them . He had a. sort of Instinct for writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose which Is as beautiful as any in the language . That instinct made him a brilliant critic , as some of the letters bear witness . I would like to quote them ? so much to the point of literary skill do they come  --  but it is about Conrad the human being that I am writing now , for it is Conrad the human be ing who makes these two volumes great . There Is an exquisite courtesy about ell of the letters and a gentle family sweetness . The children of his friends , even their dogs , he always inquires about . Casual friends are mentioned with kindliness and no hitter is ( apparently ) left unanswered . These are only a part of his letters . Most of those to Edward Garnett will be published separately , and all of those in French will make a sops rote book . But the way that he found it possible to give so lavishly to his friends was by absenting himself entirely from anY other life . For years he saw practically no one , because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and too torn with the feeling that he must , MUST write if life was to be kept together for himself , a. crippled wife and two children , who seem to have had every ailment possible . Ho was not too sick or too poor or too busy to give that priceless word of encouragement and appreciation to Ms friends , however , and his letters are inspiring . The letters disclose little that we did not know of fact , except-OW be was offered a knighthood , just ' before his death , which he refused , and that there had never been for one moment a heeltalon in his mind between French and English as a writing language . " When I wrote the first word of Almayer 's Folly ? I had already for Years been thinking In English . " He goes on to say Olat there were other consIderationci , " the sheer appeal of the language , my quickly awakened love for its prose cadences , a subtle and unforeseen accord of my emotional nature with he genius . You may take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I woulid n't have written a line for print in tall life . " Tho editor of the letters has written a short history of the early days of Conrad , frian whom no letters were preserved , arid of the later periods of his life a few pages before each group of letters , making the two volumes actually what ; he says they are at their end , really another memorial to be added to his twenty-eight matchless volumes .
