txt The chic of the Paristonne , fa-moue the world over , has never been adequately analyzed . What Is this intangible thing that makes every woman from Sioux Falls to Poking long to be mistaken for a Pa. riefenne ? Is It something that can he acquired ? Or Ls it a fairy gift bestowed on every little ? Parislenne at birth , and to he struggled fur by others ? Is it the way the Parisienne woman wears her clothes ? Is it the size of the woman Inside the clothes , or the clothes themselves ? Is It an inborn sense of line , of color ? Is it her walk ? Or is it purely psychological ? I asked an observant young American doctor studying here in Paris for his analysis of this thing which the average woman would rather have written on her tombstone than that she was respected by all who knew her . lie said , " It is the walk of the Parislenne . The way she carries herveil , the way the puts her feet down . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour watching there go by . We both agreed no women could walk like the French woman . " I asked an artist who has been living in Paris for years to contribute his ideas on the vital subject . He replied , " It 's their absolute femininity , The French women are good to look at because they do not interfere with the figures God gaye them , as the American ( woman seems prone to do , trying to look like a boy and succeeding in looking like nothing . " I asked a male author , one with an eye for the ladles , and a chuckle for the latest popular phrase . Said he : " It 's purely psychological . When you ca n't explain anything any other way , say It is ' purely psychological . " Ehat explains everything from trick ' boy murderers to French chic . " Dispose of the Frills . Apparently an adequate solution of the mysterious workings of the Enviable Order of Chics calls for a confer . ence of the league of nations . That not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we in our " splendid isolation " attempted to get to the bottom of this important international problem ourselves . As Mr. Kipling says , you learn about women from women , ' so wo took his hint and began to study the femme from this more direct source . Whether we have solved the great mystery to our own satisfactiou- we arc still a little in doubt . But among the things we have learned from and about the Parisienne are that the first commandment of Ode is to rid oneself of every supertkmus frill , sub or super , every bit of excess Jewelry , garish trimming and ornament . Another , is the French woman 's wholehearted acceptance of her mirror as her best friend and severest critic . She dresses to please her own fastidious self , more than to pleas'e her neighbor , her neighbor 's husband of his brother , although there is no offense meant nor taken should a male eye be lighted up by the vision . No offense Whatever : The consequence is that when she steps out she has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no single frayed edge of hair , complexion or dress to disarm her confidence . With the help of her aforeeaid severest critic she has undergone the minutest scrutiny and she knows all 's right with herself . Consequently , there are none of those days in her life when she wishes so-and-so had not seen her looking " such a fright . " Nothing is toe much trouble where the true Parisienne 's appearance is concerned . She has the time , no matter how busy with other interests , to study herself and to perfect every little detail from shoes to shingles She is a skilled needlewoman herself , almost without exception , and she can correct a line that is unpleasing with a deft stroke or two . Always a Feminine Touch . But upon me , more than any other feature , the sheer femininity of the Parisienne makes ' the impreasion . She has maintained the lure of sex through It . She may wear a tailleur , but there is the scarf or the buttonniere , the light hosiery and daintily shod feet to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet she is a creature of curves , not angles . She may wear her hair in a boyish bob  --  yet she is never boyish She stands erect and instead of trying to flatten her chest Into a boy 's form she is proud of a curved and definite bust line . In other words , she is a woman and dresses and acts as though she were proud of While you may agree the American woman is better shod on the whole than the French , yet the latter 's feet are nonathletic and distinctly feminine gender-ed in their short vamps and high heels . Her shoes , I believe , make her walk what it is . Curiously enough , in spite of the high heels generally adopted around the age of 15 , the French women are notoriously free of foot deformities . We are taught to believe the majority of foot troubles are duo to this high heeled habit . The French foot is shorter and broader than the American . The American girl dresses her feet and puts them down as though she-were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . The French feet look its though they might be bent on some mysterious little rendezvous along the way . Speaking comparatively , one might say the whole bearing of the American girl is an **39;30;TOOLONG manner , whereas the French girl carries the unfathomable mystery of woman about her . What relation that ? may have to chic you 'll have to try on your own cross word Puzzle . Again , the French woman has an instinctive feeling for line . You see it in the midinette , in the way she wraps her cheap little coat around her ; In the angle at which her hat is pulled down on her head ; In the inexpensive frock she wears , more Ake's- tnan not , made by her own hands out of a bargain remnant , and in She never obtrusive color scheme of the whole outfit . Drawing a Conparison . Apropos , ' I was walking down the Rue de Riven , with a little vendeuse the other day , The Rue de Rivoll , the French wilt tell you , is a street supnert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich Americans , " as we are all supposed to be over here . It Is lined from end to end with shops : dress , hat , and jewelry . We stopped in front of one window with dresses on display . " They 're terrible. * tea ! d Cecile . They 're for the foreigners , American , Spanish , and South Americans . " The dresses were embroidered in. the most vivid colors and patterns . " French women do n't wear things like that , " Cecile added . ? - They wear black for the Street a great deal , A black hat , slim lined long black coat with narrow bands of fur at neck and cuffs , short skirts , light hosiery ( dark hosiery Is never seen ) , and trim patent pumps . Yet when they adept a color from head to feet it is one perfect color scheme . There is no haphazard choosing of a hat . The hat is bought to wear with the coat or with the suit . It is almost as important as getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . Susanne is secretary in a film publicity office . She picked up a remnant in dark green cloth one day and had a coat made . For two weeks she could not wear it because she had not yet found the dark green felt hat to go with it . She could keep on ' wearing the old brown coat because her hat was brown . With one of us , the new coat probably would have been out parading with the old brown hat , instead of waiting for its perfect mato . Not with Susanne . But she has that elusive thing I have been trying to analyze . In an ultra-smart dining and dancing place you will see a handsome woman enter , well dressed , even stunning , as we say . At the next table sits the chic Pa.rlsienne . You begin to ask yourself why the woman at the first table has suddenly lost your interest . Perhaps it is because she has not applied her makeup with that attention to infinite detail characteristic of her at the second table . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an expensive thing , to be sure , but an extra thing . Perhaps it Is the beaded dress , just a bit too glittery . The C. P. , too , is wearing . white  --  yes  --  and there are beads on IL But they do n't , lilt you in the eye . With No. 1 you are conscious of a handsome woman , an expensive dress , beautiful pearls , diamond bracelets ? several of them  --  and a rich husband . ' With No. 2 you are conscious of an exquisite toning down of ornamentation and a tremendous chic . And you wonder if that 's it , after all ! You 're pretty sure it 's the half of It . anyway !
