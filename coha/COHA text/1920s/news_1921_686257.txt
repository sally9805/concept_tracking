txt That John D. Rockefeller had a total income of from $43,000,000 to $45,000,000 in 1917 , and that his income in 1918 was at least $37,000,060 , and possibly as much as P40,000,4 ) 00 are further deductions made today after a study of the statistics of the Internal Revenue Bureau for those ears . The drop in the size of Mr. Rockefeller 's income for 1018 , as compared with 1917 , probably was due in part to decreases in dividend payments by corporations . The new excess profits taxes then in operation took away many millions of the profits of the corporations , and thus , in turn , reduced personal incomes . The high water mask in Mr. Rockefeller 's affluence was readied In 1017 , it would therefore appear . The statistics covering that year are interpreted to credit him with a net income of $34 , - 930,601 . This sum , it is understood , did not include general deductions which are taken from total income . General deductions include interest on personal indebtedness , taxes on dwellings and personal property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the general deductions allowable to Mr. Rockefeller might have amounted to $5,000,000 , thus bringing his income for 1917 to $39,936,004 . To this sum may be added another $4,000,000 representing income derived by Mr. Rockefeller from tax exempt bonds , Federal , State and municipal , in which he had heavy holdings . A total would thus be obtained of $43,936,604 as representing Mr. Rockefeller 's income In 1017 as far as it can be estimated on the basis of internal revenue department statistics . For 1918 the best estimate of Mr. Rockefeller 's total income , on the basis of Revenue Department statistics , was $33,000,000 , of which possibly $22,000,000 was subject to the Federal tax after general deducticns were made . Mr. Rockefeller 's income from tax-exempt bonds in 1918 , which were not reported , may be estimated at $4,000,000 , although the sum probably was slightly in excess of that .

He has given to public benefactions about $500,000,000 . What , if any , private distributions he has made to members of his family or others is not known . As to the important items of Mr. Rockefeller 's income in 1917 and 1918 which may not have been included in the statement of income for taxation purposes , he is known to have subscribed to $20,000,000 of the First Liberty bond issue , which in 1918 would have yielded him an income of $700,000 . In addition to this it is believed that he held a considerable amount of United States bonds of pre-war issues . Mr. Rockefeller is known to have subscribed for large amounts of municipal bonds , the income from which was also in the exempt class . Besides his reported purchase at one time of $25,000,000 of New York City bonds , he was reporte.1 to be a subscriber to many other issues .

This deduction probably was about $5,000,000 , leaving approximately $30,000,000 , which apparently was subject to tax in 1917 . The amount subject to tax in 1918 Is shown by the statistics to have been about $22,000,000 , with the allowance for donations deducted . On this basis Mr. Rockefeller paid taxes on a personal income in 1917 which was about $8,000 , - 000 in excess of his taxable income in 1918 .
