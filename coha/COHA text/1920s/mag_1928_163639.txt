SAWDUST AND SOLITUDE-Lucia Zora-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . Sensational circus performer , 20 years ago , Lucia Zora was the first woman to tame tigers , train " the big herd " to their ponderous tricks , dose colic-stricken elephants with paregoric or Jamaica ginger . But she deserted the arena to indulge her second hardy ambition : pioneer prospecting . At a Colorado altitude of 8,000 feet , she and her husband ( ex-menagerie superintendent ) struggled six years with reluctant agriculture , mountain blizzards , and " Cabin Fever " which is a loneliness verging on hysterical insanity . For sacrificing the thrill of " sawdust " to the good citizenship of " solitude " her reward is a prosperous ranch , complete with radio .
