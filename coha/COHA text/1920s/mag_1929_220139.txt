One of the twelve richest men in Europe is Belgium 's picturesque , choleric Emile Francqui . Like the late great Cecil Rhodes , he found his fortune and lost his temper beneath the blazing sun of Africa-Belgian Congo . Three years ago , as Finance Minister , he won world fame by ' ' saving ' ' ( stabilizing ) the Belgian franc ( TIME , Nov. 8 , 1926 ) . For the past month he has represented Belgium on the Second Dawes Committee which is striving at Paris to revise the Dawes Plan ( TIME , Feb. 18 , et seq . ) . Last week a news leak from the secret Committee sessions revealed that of all the Allied delegates only M. Francqui has roughly baited and tried out cross-examination methods on Germany 's correct and stiff-necked " Iron Man . " famed Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , Chief German Delegate and Governor of the Reichsbank . Typical was the reply of Belgian Croesus Francqui , last week , when correspondents impertinently asked whether the Belgian Government is paying his expenses in Paris . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Francqui , irate . " Even as a Minister of the Belgian Crown I have never accepted a centime for service to my country . " <P> When Dr. Schacht proceeded to dwell again , last week , on the palpable iniquity of expecting Germany to pay Reparations for 62 years , the five fingers of Croesus Francqui 's right hand were observed to tap impatiently on the Committee table . As the Governor paused for breath the Belgian leaped up , fire in eyes . <P> " But why not 62 years , Dr. Schacht ? " he challenged , " Do n't you know that Belgium has been paying such a debt for 99 years ? " <P> " Nein ! " snapped Berlin 's Schacht , " What debt ? " <P> " My country , " cried Belgium 's Francqui , " is still paying 3,000 a year to the descendants of the English Duke of Wellington . That is part of the price of our freedom after Waterloo . The agreement was made 15 years later , in 1830 . We have paid 297,000 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without grumbling ! " <P> The present Duke of Wellington celebrated in his Piccadilly home , last week , his 80th birthday . As a grandson of the " Iron Duke " he holds the highest foreign titles possessed by any British peer , is the Netherlandic Prince of Waterloo and a Portuguese Knight of the Grand Cross of the Tower and Sword , and ranks in Spain as a Grandee of the First Class . His 19,200 English acres bring him far more in revenue , of course , than the 99 year-old tribute of little Belgium .
