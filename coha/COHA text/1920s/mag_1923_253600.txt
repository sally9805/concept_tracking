A correspondent of The New Statesman , London independent weekly journal , summarized the political situation in India thus : <P> " Politics in India are entering upon a new phase . The failure of the noncoperation movement has passed into history in spite of the feeble efforts of Mr. Ghandi 's followers to keep it alive ; but the causes of that movement are still operating , and to them can be attributed the latest developments of the Indian situation . Noncoperation is dead , but Nationalism lives and is the stronger for having learnt the lessons of Mr. Ghandi 's failure . The Nationalist movement . . . . is part of the great awakening of Asia which is destined one day to baffle and alarm a war-weakened Europe . <P> " What the Nationalist stands for is freedom-freedom to govern India with an Indian Government subject to an Indian Parliament , freedom to maintain a truly Indian army , officered and manned by Indians , and freedom for India to express herself as India and not as a semi-Anglicized Asiatic dependency . These aims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth of nations , and , indeed , that ill-defined expression " Dominion Status " defines the present aims of the great bulk of Nationalists . " <P> The declared policy of the British Parliament is to increase the " association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire . " The British and Nationalist aims , therefore , differ only in method . The British policy is a progressive scheme of Indianization ; the Nationalists want a revolutionary and not an evolutionary change .
