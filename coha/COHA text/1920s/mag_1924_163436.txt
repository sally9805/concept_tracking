At the Metropolitan , Massenet 's Le Roi de Lahore was given its first showing one evening last week . As a stage spectacle , it was ultra-magnificent . Boris Anisfeld , most vigorous of modern Russian ' decorative artists , given a free hand with Eastern temple scenes and Oriental Gardens of Paradise , had splashed his paint regardless . The story , too , had its points as melodrama . Alim ( King of Lahore ) , Scindia ( Prime Minister ) , Timur ( High Priest ) , the god Indra , rajahs , priests , fakirs , soldiers , dancers , bayaderes , slaves , musicians united in scenes of love and war to produce a scheme of action , ending gloriously in two suicides that gave unexampled opportunities to the composer . But Massenet 's score disappointed those who might ignorantly have looked for more Meditations from Thais . <P> Le Roi de Lahore is one of Massenet 's early operas , done in 1877 , a year after Verdi 's Aida , came to Paris .
