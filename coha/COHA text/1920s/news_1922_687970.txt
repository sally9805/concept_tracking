txt RIGHTS AND DUTIES . Capital and Labor Both Responsible to Society . - To the adttor of The AVM I cow . The present industrial and economic situation grows out.of the over-emphasis upon " rights . " We have been fed up on the idea of the " - sights " of citizenship , with little or no attention to the fundamental " duties , " Despite the fact that strikes may not actually be forbidden by law , there is ' not , and can not be , any " right to . strike , " whether the striker is a union of workingmen or a combination of . capitalists . The right to cease employment under any one person or corporation and the right to employ this or that pet-son has nothing to do . With the case . In one of the earliest so-called " labor " decisions in ' the case of a railwayr - tie- up , Chief Justice Taft , then Judge of the United States Circuit Court , declared that " the starvation of a nation could not be the legal purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processes upon which the orderly life of society depends . be the " right " of any body or combination . Courts are created and maintained to protect the rights and to enforce the duties of citizenship against all injustices between individuals . The jurisdiction of a competent tribunal will have to be extended over corporate and collective bodies , whatever they may be , in order to preserve the existence of society . Capital with its ability , labor with its skill , each is equally trusteeship held for the behoof of that organized society without which neither would or could have value or use , and simultaneous with the restraining influence of courts there must be education to emphasize the ' " duties " ' of citizenship , Without the ' discharge of which in good conscience by all the people there will soon be no " rights " to- enjoy . E. W. HAI ... FORD . ' Leonia . J .. July 31 , 1922 . Vaux &; Olmstead . To the Editor of The New York . Times : I infer from the letter headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to erect a monument or memorial to him . This is eminently fitting , but it would be incomplete did it not include the senior member of the ' firm of Vaux Olmstead , Calvert Yaux , who with Olmstead jointly planned the park . Few there probably are who realize to whom they owe the blessing of Central Park ! Who ever thinks of the men whose farsighted vision foresaw in the fifties this Oasis of green in a desert of bricks and mortar ? As a young ' man it was my good fortune to be thrown in intimate relations with Calvert Vaux and his family , ' and often have I heard from him ' of the difficulties to be overcome in transforming what was once a wilderness of rocks interspersed with morasses , and covered largely with shanties , into a Park that is a model of its kind . And so well were the plans drown and with so much foresight for the needs of the city that the planners knew must some day surround the Park , that practically no essential alterations in these plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest ' ideals , of a shy , sensitive and retiring nature . A pupil of Downing , he was one of our pioneer landscape architects , as well as one of our greatest . All more fitting is it that he and his partner , Frederick Law Olmstead , should have a monument commemorating their work . WALTER . MENDELSON . Germantown , Philadelphia , July 28 , 1922 . Two Views of Poincare. 2'o the Editor of The New York Times : I may be minus that acute eye of the connoisseur , but Cesare 's splotch entitled " Raymond Poincare , " In today 's TIMES . BooK ANn MAGAZINE , is the closest , approach of " Old Black Joe " I , ever viewed . In the Summer of 1919 the President of Switzerland arrived at the Gare de Lyon and was met by Poincare . During the drive from the station to the Bastile I had occasion to note , not with the artist 's precision , but with the layman 's sober observation ; the features of the ex-President of France ; which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say vehemently the subject appeared nothing like the ' illustration .

To the Editor of The New York , Times : In your article on John Sanford Saltus of recent date you make mention of his gift . the statue of Joan of Are , on Riverside Drive ..
