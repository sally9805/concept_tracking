txt The conviction and sentence of William H. Anderson , former State Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of New York , was unanimously affirmed yesterday by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court . Justice John V. , writing the opinion of the court , holds that , while the " compass of the act charged as a crime here is very narrow . " the trial fully developed relevant matters " which preceded and were concomitant with the precisely charged dereliction " ? forgery in the third degree . The appeal was heard on May IR , when ex-Governor Charles S. Whitman appeared for Anderson and Assistant District Attorney Ferdinand Pecora for the prosecution . Mr. Whitman maintained that no harm had been committed by the act of third degree forgery of which Anderson was convicted and took exception to numerous points In the Court 's charge . Regarding the false entry by which $4,400 credited to 0 . Bertsall Phillips , solicitor of contributions , was transferred to Phillips 's " expense account , " the opinion of JurgIce says : Book ! , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render the books capable of showing by- legal proof that Phillips did not receive his full earnings as commissions and salary . This hardly needs argumentation . It Is vain to protest that it hurt nobody , because , whether it did or not . it was a , false entry which spoke against the fact In a material matter and fell within the bounds of the charge I in both counts of the indictment in that it Intentionally changed the effect of the Previous entry to the possible prejudice and damage of the corporation employer , and was a false entry on which an intent to defraud some person might well be predicated . " The defendant urges that no facts were given in evidence which either expressly or impliedly indicate that the false entries were capable of being used to defraud . If this be a correct deduction from the proof , it is a fundamental defect and these propositions should not have been submitted to the jury , since such a submission would be without evidence to sustain either count . Arrangement on Commissions . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Phillips by which Phillips was to divide with Anderson one-half of the amount of his yearly salary and commissions in excess of $10,000 . Anderson 's testimony on this matter differed from that of the people 's witness , Phillips , only in this , that Anderson asserted that Phillips voluntarily offered to give Anderson one-half of his earnings over $10,000 yearly , while Phillips in effect asserts that the division was compulsory . " It was in testimony by the defendant , Anderson , that he directed the false entries in question be made , in order to obviate the necessity of Phillips paying an income tax to the Federal I and State Governments on $4,400 , which had been properly charged to Phillips . The defendant also testified that , although he received this $4,400 from Phillips out of the latter 's earnings for 1920 and deposited the same to his personal account , he likewise paid no income tax to either the Federal or State Government on i such a sum . " Finds Books Were Faalfied . Justice 's opinion cites certified public accountants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and points out that the latter 's testimony supported the people 's contention that the books were falsified ; " The fact proof as thus summarized , " continues the opinion , " warranted a finding by the jury that there was an entry in the corporation 's books falsely made by defendant 's direction with intent to defraud , and that the corpora- tion 's books had been altered by an employe with a fraudulept and corrupt purpose whereby the right of the corperate body might be Jeopardized . " After examining the assignments of error which it was claimed on Anderson 's behalf invalidated the Judgment of conviction , the Appellate Division reached the following conclusion ; " The record discloses a trial wherein scrupulous regard was had for the rights of the defendant in the submission and exclusion of evidence and in the full , clear and painstaking charge of the learned trial Court covering the facts and the law re:ating to the crime set out in the Indictment , and since no subStanti9.1 errors are found we think the judgment ought to be affirmed .
