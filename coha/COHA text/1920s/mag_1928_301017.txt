The Cavalier has Richard Talmadge , long popular in horse-and-pistol pictures , playing two parts-El Caballero , rescuer of the daughter of an impoverished grandee , and Taki , a good Indian helping the other poor Indians , ground down by Spain in South America . He flings that dagger through the window , is chased by those bloodhounds , jumps over that wall , snatches that bride at the altar onto his horse and , as they approach the leap over the ravine , says , " It may mean-Death. . . . " at which she answers , " Death . . . with you . . . . " Spectators lingered in the hope that at some point in this nonsensical fairbanking Mr. Talmadge would fight a duel to death with his double and that they would both win . <P> The Midnight Taxi shows Helene Costello falling for an honest bootlegger in a complicated but exciting melodrama filmed on a train . A variation between the race between the car and the train is one between train and airplane . In sound , Comedian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot : the line of taxicabs bringing Antonio Moreno 's Scotch up from the boat . Best loud-line ( Dugan ) : " I was in jail but I got pppp ... I got pppp . . . par . . . they let me out for a while . . . . " Best criticism ( Variety ) " Can go into any wired house for a week . " <P> The Legend of Gosta Berling , made in Sweden several years ago , brought the disturbing face of Greta Garbo to the notice of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Co . Lars Hanson ( here Gosta Berling , an unfrocked Swedish preacher in love with a Count 's wife in a Nobel Prize story by Selma Lagerlf ) came to Hollywood with her but quarreled with directors , protested against the stupidity of the roles they gave him , went back to Stockholm where he is now a leading " legit " actor . Miss Garbo , too , after immediate success , showed temperament but was soothed . In this picture , awkwardly constructed , ludicrously titled , finely acted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less exciting than that which , in recent films , has ravished U. S. manhood . <P> Ten Days That Shook the World , heralded as another masterpiece from Amkino ( Russian ) studios , producers of Potemkin , turned out to be a brilliant , tiresome piece of Soviet propaganda . In an impressionistic manner not , as is commonly believed , originated by him , Director Eisenstein shows kaleidoscopic guns firing , statues falling , bottles breaking in superimposed shots the rapidity of which strains the eyes and makes them hard to watch . Hollywood directors , advised by intellectuals to learn their Eisenstein , would profit little from seeing , as they will not , this newsreel of the Russian revolution which lacks the most valuable feature that a newsreel can have-impartiality.
