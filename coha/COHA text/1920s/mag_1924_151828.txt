Trinity Church ( Broadway and Wall St. , Manhattan ) stands on one of the most valuable plots of land in the U. S. Yet a clever group of swindlers is reported to have made a fortune out of questioning the validity of Trinity 's title to the land it occupies . <P> The scheme consists in informing gullible individuals that they ( the gullibles ) are descendents of one Anneke Jans Bogardus , wife of the Rev. Everardus Bogardus , who owned the valuable plot some two centuries ago . For a modest fee to cover the expenses of investigating the title , the swindlers hold out to their prospects the possibility of sharing in the sale of the property for many millions of dollars , should it be found rightfully to belong to the Bogardus heirs . For many years the clique lived off the " fees " obtained from the " heirs . "
