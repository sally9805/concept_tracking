In France , a new type of safety device has been developed for automobile traffic . It was tried out at two dangerous crossings on the outskirts of Bordeaux , and in several weeks there was not a single accident at these places where accidents had previously been frequent . <P> The device uses a plate set in the pavement . When an automobile passes over this , it makes an electrical contact . A large sign " DANGER " over the roadway is automatically lighted , giving the motorist a chance to slow down . A similar sign on the cross-street also lights up to warn cross-traffic.
