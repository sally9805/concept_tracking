Denominationalism in the U. S. is accustomed to justify itself by the thought that Truth appears to man in many different forms . With this and other commonplaces , the average American protestant evades the horrible thought that if the Presbyterian Church is the one true church , the Baptist Church is not , etc . <P> But the current justifications for denominationalism become thin when missionaries in foreign fields endeavor to translate them into heathen tongues . In Chinese , for example , the Methodist Episcopal Mission becomes , literally , " the doubly beautiful society , " because there are two m 's in M. E. M. , and the Chinese pronounces m as " may , " and " may " means " beautiful . " The Wesleyan Methodists are the " following the Doctrine society , " the Lutherans the " doing the Doctrine society , " the Limited Methodists the " be with me society , " the Congregationalists the " common sense society , " etc . <P> All this was pointed out by Dr. C. Y. Cheng , leader of Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now nearly 400,000 Christians in China , said he ; but the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy has added to the difficulties of presenting to the remaining 400,000,000 the Christian faith in its essential simplicity .
