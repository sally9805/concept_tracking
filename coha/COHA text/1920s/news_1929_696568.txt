txt How difficult it Is for the human race to accept philosophically a changed state of heart in one of the opposite sex ! We accept death , accident , mis ? hap with finer stoicism . But let a girl or a man become friendly with one of the other sex . Let them go around together for six months or the year . If one becomes careless in his telephone calls or the other asks that dates be restricted to once a week or twice a month , the party of the second part is puzzled , grieved or wounded beyond all proportion to the offense . Leon says he has known a girl . for four years , and for a year he squired her about steadily . Last month she went on a vacation . On her return there was a difference in her attitude toward him . The presumtion is that some other Leon has intrigued her . Or , Grace has known a chap for five months , during which time they have been seeing a great deal of each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grace ca n't figure it out Why should he bhange2 Attempting to figure out the reason is an idle waste of time , chiefly because we ca n't see ourselves as others see us . We may be quite different persons on closer acquaintance than we ap . peered to be In the beginning . But most of all , it is foolish to spend wistful moments mourning over a lost interest since nothing can be guaran. teed stationary about one 's emotions A man may be attracted to a girl this month by the pretty trick she has of lifting her eyebrows . Next imonth he may be as completely en- ' snared-by a smile . Until the thing known as love reduces him to a state of permanent slavery , these fluctuating emotions have to be counted on . Girls I have them ' just the same , until the deciding force , true love , enters and slays the fickle fancies . It- need be no personal reflection whatever upon the courted one to be made to wait for the calls that do not come . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to check off the incident as simply one of those things that happen in the best regulated lives , and let it go at that . * Sorority Tea Tomorrow .

French Toast , The Item we might call fried bread is more universally , called " French toast , " yet In a French cook book I once found it under the name of " Spanish toast . " Commonly , however , In the French it has the name ' - pain perdu , " ' Mildh is translated lost bread , and the stale bread can be So completely lost as to be sold as a subgtitute for coffee cake , in some of the bakeries . In Germany It has the name " armor titter , " which is translated " poor knight . " It is sometimes also mentioned as egg toast , and I have even seen it called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to cook . It is most usually fried in the frying pan , but may be cooked in deep fat almost instantly because the egg cover sets so soon . Sauces , slrups , fruit or bacon are served with it . Just as we can find a great number of titles for this simple and pleasant toast , which Is something more than toast or near to an omelet , so do the dips into which the bread Is put before it is fried , or in which the bread Is soaked for a little while , vary enormously . Probably the easiest and most common dip Is simply one-half cup of milk with one egg and a little Q1,011 r or /In to four tablesnbons . When the treatment is to be mote elaborate there is much more milk , and one finds that - many different flavors have been used until it is possible to find . recipes , which direct that ' the bread be soaked in beaten eggWithout any milk , but in place of the milk there were such items as brandy and rum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flavors that we can find in different recipes for French toast . By using brown sugar for the sweetening we can change it a little . One French girl , " Marierose , " once sent me a recipe for " pain perdu au caramel.

For each egg yolk add two tablespoons of cold water , beat lightly and add one-tablespoon of blanched almonds cut in small pieces . Soak in tills some slices of white stale bread for eight or ten minutes and fry in butter , turning often , and each time sprinkle generously with some granulated sager .
