txt On the western edge of Kentucky , where the Mississippi bends and curves the boundary , stands , or stood , the " city " of Columbus . It is a very small city , only 600 inhabitants at the latest count , but it has known greatness . In Civil War days it was a thriving community . The northern terminus of the Mobile &; Ohio Railroad was here at one time and trains were ferried across the river on their way to St. Louis . Tradition has it that the early sponsors of the town had visions of its becoming a great metropolis . They laid out a community four miles square , sufficient in area to house more than 100,000 people . Streets were to be built In the familiar checkerboard , parallel to the river bank and at right angles to it , with little reckoning how they were to mount the high bluffs .

They made up their minds to turn the disaster to good account and called in the Red Cross and a city planner from Indianapolis to help them do it . In The American City Mr. SHERIDAN tells how they set about their task . The old town was built on the plain at a point where , because the river curved suddenly , the full force of any flood was inevitably felt . The result in this particular case was the destruction of the levee , the inundation of the whole district and the sweeping away of more than forty buildings . It was clear that every flood would bring disaster in its wake so long as the town remained on that site . The inhabitants , accordingly , took the common-sense course and decided to move to the bluffs . There the City of Columbus is now being rebuilt , with broad avenues -- a Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the city planner and all those for whom he is doing his planning in the years to come ample elbow room .
