Last week , a group of stragglers arrived late for a Toscanini concert in Carnegie Hall , Manhattan . They clattered down the aisle , banged down their seats , threw back their coats . They may have thought themselves unnoticed but the little man on the conductor 's dais had been disturbed . He wheeled on them , crossed his arms in a Napoleonic attitude , stared them up and down and said , quite distinctly , " You are late ! " Philadelphia audiences have been frequently rebuked by Conductor Leopold Stokowski ; Manhattan , never before , by any man .
