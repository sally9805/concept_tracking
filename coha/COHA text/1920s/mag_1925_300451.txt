In Manhattan last week a lady put her hand into a vase and drew out a piece of paper with a name on it - a name often stamped in blue on the snowy fat of hams and neatly printed upon bacon boxes - Swift , of Chicago . Mr. Harold H. <P> Swift was thereby entitled to choose a picture from the Grand Central Art Galleries for his own . <P> Every year the supporters of the Gallery are rewarded for their in vestment with a free lottery of selected paintings . Mr. Swift chose the only Sargent in the Gallery , a portrait valued at $15,000 . The second name was Charles Clifton , President of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy , who chose Heavy Weather , a marine painting by Irving Wiles . The third , James Parmelee of Washington , acquired Lilian Hale 's Spring Reverie . <P> The fourth name drawn was Otto Kahn ; he chose a portrait to be painted by John Johansen ,                   @ @
