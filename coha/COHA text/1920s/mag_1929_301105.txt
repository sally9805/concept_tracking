One foggy twilight last week , New York radio stations suddenly stopped broadcasting and the air was filled with SOS calls . While radio listeners wondered what the silence might portend , there was administered in the outer reaches of New York Harbor what might be called perfect disaster treatment . It began when passengers on the British steamship Fort Victoria , inching along in the soupy mist toward Bermuda , heard the bedlam of fog warnings , the fierce , hoarse blasts of a whistle which seemed altogether too near . Then the prow of the Clyde liner Algonquin , outbound for Galveston , loomed out of the murk and buried itself with a mountainous thrust in the port side of the Fort Victoria . <P> Only one occurrence threatened to mar the disciplined success of the rescue work which followed . A bevy of panicky Chinamen from the galleys of the Fort Victoria started to run amok with kitchen knives . An armed officer quelled them ; the well-regulated filling of lifeboats with women and children , then men , continued . Pilot boats , revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white pall , in a quiet , gelid sea , the Fort Victoria listed further and further to starboard until only seasoned Captain Albert R. Francis , his pilot , and a skeleton crew of twelve vigorous pumpers remained on board . An attempt was made to tow the foundering vessel to shore , but at length the bubbling water closed over it . Captain Francis and Pilot Frank Moran , last to slide down one horizontal side , were hauled by rescuers out of the Fort Victoria 's sinking whorl . All the crew and 255 passengers-everyone aboard-had been saved without accident except a fainting spell which overcame a Mrs. Nellie Stringer of Brooklyn who suffers from sleeping sickness . <P> Twice again during the week disaster struck at New York , but twice again was parried . <P> From the ferryboat West Point , rammed in the Hudson River by a car barge , 700 passengers were taken safely . <P> From a short-circuited subway train under the East River , 800 passengers stampeded , trampling 89 of themselves but killing none .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
