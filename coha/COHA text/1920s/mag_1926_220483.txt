Year in , year out , for many a year , pleased citizens have contemplated lawyers ' proposals for judicial reform . Other citizens have been vexed that the field for reform never lessened . Last week a familiar twa , ng was sounded in the annual meeting of the American Bar Association . Mayor Dever of Chicago decried prohibition . Onetime Bar-President Chester I. Long decried present methods of judicial procedure . Oscar Hallam of St. Paul decried paroles . Expert witnesses , insanity defense , Senator Thomas J. Walsh ( who is holding up in the Senate a bill for simplification of procedure ) - all were decried seriatim ; Finally , the Association elected former Governor Charles S. Whitman of New York president for the coming year , then adopted a resolution that " the American citizen of today is bartering his individual liberties and rights for Government bounties and bonuses . " <P> Simultaneously , the report of the National Crime Commission was published . Headed by onetime Governor Hadley of Missouri , and composed of distinguished barristers like Judson Harmon , former Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard Law School , Edwin R. Keedy , a former Judge Advocate of the U. S. army , this gathering of greywigs spoke weightily . It recommended : <P> In order to eliminate forced confessions and third degree methods , persons charged with felony should be informed as to their rights , then allowed to answer publicly the charges preferred against them . <P> Defendants charged with conspiracy should be tried jointly . <P> If a defendant fails to testify , the Court and Counsel should have the right to comment upon the fact . <P> Judges should be permitted to instruct as to the law , and to comment upon the evidence and upon the testimony and character of witnesses . <P> In felonies , excepting capital offenses , five-sixths of the jury should be allowed to return a verdict . <P> Criminal procedure , now framed about the archaic conception of the protection of individual rights , should aim rather at prompt determination of the accused person 's guilt or innocence . Felons should not be permitted to escape by grace of a technical legal error .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
