The abdicated Crown Prince Carol of Rumania , estranged father of six-year-old King Mihai , suddenly moved from his retreat near Paris to Nice , French Riviera , and stopped last week at the dazzlingly white and sumptuous Hotel Negresco . <P> Clearly flushed with hopes and expectations , Prince Carol talked with blazing indiscretion to correspondents while he smoked innumerable cigarets . Said he : " I wish to qualify a statement recently made by one of my aides that I will be upon the Rumanian throne in two months . That was merely his personal opinion . It may be two months or it may be two years . <P> " My mother Dowager , Queen Marie , and my sister , Princess Ileana , will soon visit me in Paris . It is a fact that important political events are occurring in Rumania . That is the reason my mother is coming to confer with me . " <P> Motoring from Nice to Monte Carlo , Prince Carol conferred there with the one Rumanian who can conceivably set him upon the throne , M. Juliu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opposition ) . At peasant mass meetings throughout Rumania , M. Maniu has furiously denounced the Government of Premier Vintila Bratiano and skirted treason by dark hints against the Regency . That the leading opposition statesman should thus journey all the way from Bucharest to Monte Carlo for a conference with Prince Carol gave an aura of importance , at last , to that loose-lipped , irresolute young man . <P> Though Prince Carol abdicated of his own free will , and in Italy where he could scarcely have been forcibly brought to do so ( TIME , Jan. 11 , 1926 ) , he began almost at once to itch for the sceptre which would otherwise have been his when King Ferdinand of Rumania died ( TIME , Aug. 1 ) . The reasons for his abdication may remain forever partially obscure , but it is clear that they originated in his desire to escape the responsibilities of rank and dwell inconspicuously with various ladies . The latest of these , Mme. Magda Lupescu , comely Jewess , was sharing Prince Carol 's suite at the Negresco , last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in Nice and Monte Carlo was to interrupt momentarily certain German-Rumanian financial negotiations which had been proceeding quietly at nearby Mentone . There Foreign Minister Dr. Gustav Stresemann of Germany was taking an industrious rest cure at the sunny Hotel Cap Martin ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) . He had been joined by Foreign Minister Nicholas Titulescu of Rumania , who recently visited Rome and Paris ; and with the arrival of German Finance Minister Heinrich Koehler the negotiations were in full swing . They related to Rumania 's claim upon Germany for redemption of the German paper marks which were spent in Rumania by the German forces of occupation during the World War . <P> No sooner did Prince Carol arrive in Nice than M. Titulescu , desiring to avoid all contact with him , moved himself and suite across the border from French Mentone to nearby Italian San Remo . Good natured Dr. Stresemann then kept the negotiations going by motoring back and forth between these neighboring towns . Prince Carol , not provided with papers permitting him to enter Italy , could not and possibly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rumanian Government with which he is at odds .
