txt Lord ConzoN 's declaration of Britain 's policy toward the Ruhr is not altogether unambiguous . He speaks of British neutrality between France and Germany , and yet insists that the Entente with France is unbroken . He believes Germany should make an offer , and yet he clings stubbornly to the Bonar Law program for reparations which was rejected by the French , Belgians and Italians at the Paris conference just before France went into the Ruhr in January . What was this British reparations plan ? Bilefly , it provides for scaling down the paper figure of Germany 's reparations payments from 132 billion gold marks to a paper total of 67 billions , which , under the advantages placed at Germany 's disposal , can be scaled down to an actual payment of only about 27 billions , of which not more than 20 billions is reparations , the remainder going for occupation costs and all other charges arising out of the treaty fulfillment . More specifically speaking , the Bonar Law proposal provides for the cancellation of the " C " bonds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th . actual value of these is probably hardly 10 per cent . of this paper value , the loss is not so great as it would seem . For the remaining 50 bi:lions , provided for in the Class " A " end " R " bond ' .. is rrnrosed to issue a new- series , known " Bonds of the ? First ** to the amount of 56 billion gold marks These are to bear no Interest for till first four years , and for the next foul years 4 per cent. , and thereafter I " por cent , until maturity in 1053 . The unpaid interest under this scheme h to be funded and new bends to the total amount of this interest compounded may be- issued in 1033. ? this sum comes to about 17 billion gold marks , it brings the total paper value to 67 billions . Here , however , as Premier Pomcwat pointed out when Mr. BONAR LAW first submitted his proposal , there arises a serious difficulty ; These " first series " bonds may be redeemed by Germany at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an increased cost each year . If , therefore , Germany avails herself of this redemption privilege , she may be quit ' of the " first series " bonds for 25 instead of for 50 ' billion gold marks . The second series of bonds could be redeemed for about two billions . Inasmuch as the British proposal provides that only 80 per cent . of the " first series " shall go to the reparations account , it means that Germany 's total reparations payments would come to only 20 billion Bold ; marks , or about 85,000,000,000 . Of this France would get 51 per cent . Practically all of the cash realized on the second series would have to go for treaty charges and for the redemption of Belgian debt . This would mean that France would receive only about $2,600,000,000 with which to pay for damage in the devastated regions , estimated at between 8,000,000,000 and 1$11,000,000,000 . Clearly ; this is unacceptable to France . The wisdom of M. FoiricAnz 's refusal to accept SONAR LAW 'S plan is , from the French point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which responsible German spokesmen are now suggesting as within Germany 's paying capacity . The 20 billion gold marks mentioned by ROSENBERG has been raised to 35 , and there is every likelihood that when the actual negotiations are made Germany will agree to at least 50 billions . This , sum is not beyond her capacity to pay , according to students . of Germany 's condition , provided she is willing to make an earnest effort to repair the wrongs committed by her .
