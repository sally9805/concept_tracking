txt Sensational charges of the lavish use of money in the recent Republican Senatorial primary campaign in Illinois , equaling , if not exceeding , the amounts expended In the Pennsylvania Senatorial-Gubernatorial primary , were made in the Senate today by Senator Thaddeus H. Caraway , Democrat , of Arkansas . In substance , Senator Caraway virtually alleged that great public utilities corporations in the State contributed heavily to the campaign fund of Colonel Frank L. Smith , then and now head of the Illinois Public Utilities Commission , who won the nomination over Senator William B. , candidate for renomination . Senator Caraway said that It bad been reported that Senator spent $1,000,000 and Colonel Smith $2,000,000 in the primary campaign . Senator Caraway called for an investigation of reports he had heard concerning this alleged state of affairs by the special committee of the Senate which is investigating the Pennsylvania primary . The special committee already had taken cognizance of the Illinois primary election by determining that after Congress adjourned It would go to Chicago to inquire into the Illinois situation . The impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who himself is the head of one of the largest public utilities corporations in Illinois , had been made the political victim of a combination of other pubic utilities interests with Governor Len Small and the Thompson Republican organization in Chicago . Says Insult Gave Millions . Mentioning that Governor Small had appointed Colonel Smith as Chairman of the State Public Utilities Commission , Senator Caraway went on to say that Samuel Insull " was the real public utilities monarch who is reputed to have poured millions Into primary and election campaigns in the last few years . " He then made this statement : " I am told that his contributions have not been made always willinglx , but as he operated utility properties with a gross income of over'a hundred million dollars a year he found it more profitable to ' come across ' whenever he was asked than to refuse to pay and take the chance of losing millions in decreased rates at the hands of unfriendly public officials . " Senator Caraway did not make direct charges on his own responsibiilty , but qualified his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " I have heard . " To Mr. Insull he ascribed contributions of more than half a million dollars to the Smith primary campaign fund , and mentioned as something he had heard that " a man named Messer , claiming direct authority from Insult , " offered nearly 6160,000 to Illinois foreign language newspapers for advertising in consideration of their support of Smith for the Senatorial nomination , but that these newspapers were credited with having " declined to sell out . " Labor Men and Bankers Named . ? It was also set forth by Senator Caraway as something he had heard that orders of the State Utilities Commission affecting certain public utilities were contemporaneous with heavy contributions to the Smith campaign fund , among them more than 6100,000 from " the interested bankers , E. H. Rollins &; Sons . " He wanted to know " how much money was given to John Walker and Frank Farrington . the men who are said to have handled the labor vote in Illinois . " Other reports chronicled by Senator Caraway were that " an army of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " neglected their duties to ' work , in the Senatorial campaign , but he did not specify in whose interest they were active . Among other things , Senator Caraway said it was reported that Barnes . Secretary to Allen Moore , Smith 's campaign manager , sent checks of from $100 to $500 to men and women for their expenses to visit " the imposing headquarters in Chicago , " where , accoilding to Mr. Caraway , they were " awed by the promise of easy money " and went forth to organize in Smith 's behalf . His statements , said Senator Caraway , were basedton " some investigation " he had made into political practices in Illinois . , Senator Carae &y's; speech was read from manuscript . He did not indulge in any oratorical flights and as the reading was in a rather subdued tone it did not appear to attract much attention from the Senators who were present in the chamber . Urges the Senate to Act . " The country , " said Senator Caraway , " has been shocked by the enormous expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also been made concerning the Illinois primary election . The committee of the Senate now engaged in these investigations are rendering a most valuable service . " I have been told that in Illinois not only were vast sums of money used . but positions of public trust were debauched to procure contributions and influence votes . " Recently the Mayor of Chicago appeared before a committee of the Senate to defend the reputation of his city against the charges ca corruption and crime which were being made by Chicago citizens of influence , some of whom were in public office . Some rumors that have come to my ears have led me to believe that the conditions in Chicago have their root and foundation in the political practices that prevail and control in that city . " I have made some investigation of the political method and practices that exist in Illinois , and if my information is correct this body ought to be advised of the facts and take cognizance accordingly . " I was somewhat impressed with the Illinois situation in 1920 , when Frank 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business organization about him . Opposed to him was ' Big Bill ' Thompson , then Mayor of Chicago . and a bunch of professional politicians including Len Small , ' Frank Lunden and Frank L. Smith . The anti-Lowden gang succeeded in making Smith their United States Senator , and Thompson and Lunden became chief patronage dispensers . " Governor Small made Smith the Chairman of the Public Utititis Cornmission , the most powerful body in the State , with jurisdiction over billions of dollars of property employed ' in the public service . The present Senator from Illinois Mr. was the head of one of the largest utility corporations in the State , and Samuel Insult was the real utility monarch who is reputed to have poured millions into primary and election campaigns in the last few years . " I am told that his contributions have not been made always willingly , but as he operated utility properties with a gross income of over a hundred million dollars a year he found it more profitable to ' come across ' whenever he was asked than to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased rates at the hands of unfriendly public offie.ials . Smith Retains Utility Post . " I have neen astonished to learn that the successful Senatorial candidate in the recent Illinois Republican primary Mr. Smith held on to his job as Chairman of the Utilities Commission throughout his primary campaign and will do likewise during the campaign for the election this Fall . " Small , with the aid of his Chicago crowd , including the State 's Attorney of Cook County , of which Chicago is the seat of government ; the Chicago Sanitary District , whose board is appointed by the Governor 's Chicago machine , was re-elected Governor of Illinois m 1924 , notwithstanding the Supreme Court has decided be owes the State over a million dollars in interest on funds which he has coltected and retained on State inieley he had unlawfully used for his own gain while it was in his custody as the Treasurer of the State . " It is openly charged that , being Chairman of the Utilities Commission , the successful candidate received enormous contributions from the heads of the public utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or through his utility organization , contributed over $500,000 . " I have heard that a man named Messer , claiming direct authority from Insull , offered nearly $100,000 in advertising to the foreign newspapers in Chicago in return for their supporting Smith for Senator . I have been told they declined to sell out , but 1 want to know theiltruth about it . Wants Smith 's Manager Called . " It is said that contemporaneous with the issuance of orders by the utilities commission affecting certain public utilities , large contributions flowed into the Smith campaign- war chest ; that a utility deal involving about $20,000,000 of property drew from the interested bankers , E. H. Rollins &; Sons , more than $100,000 into the hands of Allen Moore , Smith 's campaign manager . I want the committee to compel Allen Moore to tell how much he received in contributions to Smith 's campaign fund and- from : Whom - he received it and what connection these people had . with Illinois public utilities . " I want to know how much money was given to John Walker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled the labor vote in Illinois . Is want to know how much was spent in maintaining the palatial headquarters in the Congress Hotel in Chicago , which it is said were conducted on the scale of a national campaign with traveling representatives going out all over the State displaying'great quantities of currency freely used to get votes . " I want to know whether the charge is true that an army of State payrollers and a. like army of Federal jobholders deserted their offices and at , public expense went out into the high- , ways and byways of Illinois to nomi-nate a candidate for United States , Senator . " If it is true as charged that JohnFlanigan boasted of lining up the railroads and public utilities , many of ' whom tie represented , to contribute to a Senatorial primary fund , we want to know it as a part of our information in determining the course of railroad legislation in this body . " We want to know the truth concerning the operations of the **27;641;TOOLONG - Lundin- Smith combination to control Illinois politics . " We want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising and what it cost . " A man by the name of Dan Schuyler is said to have spent vast sums to collect votes in the so-called colored wards and foreign language groups in Chicago . I find only a few years ago this man Schuyler was under indictment for making false income tax returns : that his real defense was that the moneys h- ' was shown to have received from Insult and other corporation heads were really only contributions to the **28;670;TOOLONG campaign fund . " Under a Republican Attorney General the indictment against him was dismissed . If he is still in the same business we want to know it . I understand the public utilities and railroads are his best clients and yet he seldom appears in court or before any public ' , tribunal . " It is charged that Governor Small 's Tax Commission functioned very efficiently in the recent primary . Also that the use of money was not confined to the men . I am told Allen Moore 's secretary , a man named Barnes , sent out  --  checks to individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to visit the imposing headquarters in Chicago . and , awed by the promise of easy money , they sallied forth with vast sums to o ? -1 ganize  --  organize  --  organize . " In the home county of the unsuccessful candidate it is claimed Moore 's agent , named Lon Palmer , said he ' had unlimited funds an.i made slisplays of cash that called forth unusually heavy outpouring from the other . side . " I believe it will be a good thing for Illinois and especially for Chicago , if even part of the charges of corruption that are made are true , that the people ' become ? orrned . " It is said the . epublican Party in Chicago is a joke . It is simply a case Of which faction has the most money . I do not want to see the Democratic candidate for Senator in Illinois laboring under the unfair advantage of competing with a Republican adversary who under the Small regime hangs onto the chairmanship of the commission which passes on all security issues and fixes rates for all utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position has it in his power to raise vast contributions from public service corporations . " The opportunity for corruption can not be denied . We want lie committee to find out how much has been used . The people want all the facts . "
