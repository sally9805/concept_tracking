txt Speedy resuscitation of patients unconscious from alcohol and prompt relief of milder symptoms of intoxication are reported by Drs . T. F. Hunter and S. G. Mudd of Boston . who have been experimenting with an apparatus now in use by the New York Edison Company in 1 this city for administering oxygen and I carbon dioxide . This combination , has been highly effective , according to Dr. Charles Norris . Chief Medical Examiner , in saving the lives of asphyxiated persons , but has not yet been introduced here as a treatment for alconolism . " Carbon dioxide has been found to be a respiratory stimulant and causes the sufferer from gas to ventilate the gas from his system more rapidly , " said Dr. Norris . " There is no doubt whatever of its value for this use . and it should be introduced everywhere for that purpose . I have n't heard about its value in treating alcoholics . " The use of a small quantity of carbon dioxide to Stimulate the breathing of persons ' suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning was worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Yale . It was found valuable also in increasing respiration in operation patients and enabling them to get rid of the ether in their lungs and blood . The latter use suggested to Dr. Haggard the probable therapeutic value of carbon dioxide and oxygen . in acute alcoholic cases , and the two Boston physicians tried - it experimentally . The acceleration of the sobering-up process was described by them in several cases rePorted in the Boston Medical and ' Surgical Journal . It toolC.three policemen to bring in " Case 11 " reported by the two physicians . After giving a terrific battle , the patient suddenly passed into deep coma . The report on the treatment in this case is : " At 3.14 A. M. there was no response to shaking or supra-orbital pressure . Carbon dioxide administration was then begun and continued for thirty minutes . During the middle of the administration the patient began swearing and struggling and had to be held down . When the mask was removed at 3.46 he gave his name , address and occupation . " Twelve minutes later ( 3:58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes with the patient quite co-operative . Ten minutes after the removal of the mask he was quite sober , remorseful and swore off liquor ; he asked where he was and how he had gotten there . TO all appearances he could have been discharged . " On the following day he remembered trying to shake off the mask during the first period of carbon dioxide administion and all subsequent events . He stated that he felt better than usual . There had been no hang-over or nausea which , judging from past experiences , he should have had . " Similar results were reported in other cases , and then a controlled laboratory experiment was carried out , A volunteer drank good whisky for the experimenters aria the amount of alcohol in his blood was tested from time to time . On a later date this experiment was done oven again , the carbon dioxide treatment being used on the second occasion . When the carbon dioxide was used , the amount of alcohol in the blood was cut 50 per cent . In one hour . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bloat dropped only 2 or 3 per cent . in an hour .
