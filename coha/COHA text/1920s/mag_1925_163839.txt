When winter driving of motor cars became common , a great impetus was given to the manufacture of industrial alcohol . Drivers began to consume large quantities of this product for anti-freeze mixtures in their radiators . <P> Last year our total output of industrial alcohol was in the neigh- borhood of 70,000,000 gallons . The production is increasingly competi- tive . The U. S. Industrial Alcohol Co. was responsible for between 25 and 30 million gallons , and National Distillers ' Products Corporation for about 7 millions more . On the other hand , several sugar companies have recently entered the business , in order to utilize molasses , a by-product of sugar refining . <P> Another serious problem for the larger makers of industrial alcohol is the competition afforded their product by glycerin compounds for preventing frozen radiators . Glycerin is a by-product of soapmaking , and such large soapmakers as Lever Bros , and Procter &; Gamble are strenuously seeking to market glycerin anti-freeze mixtures . The Commercial Solvents Co. and the United Carbide Co. also are perfecting competitive mixtures for the same purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , on the weather this winter . A severe cold spell will be a boon for makers of anti-freeze mixture .
