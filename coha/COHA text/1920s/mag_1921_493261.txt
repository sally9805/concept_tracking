ONE day , when I was quite a little girl , I heard my Grandmother say to a neighbor , " You Can say what you like about Mr. Brown , but Mrs. Brown wears the pants . " That was strange , I thought . I looked across the street , expecting to see Mr. Brown suddenly attired in petticoats . But he was raking leaves in the front yard , wearing his ordinary old clothes . I hung around , waiting for Mrs. Brown 's return from High School , where she Was the principal . Bitter , bitter was my disappointment to discover that she had on her familiar , greenish-black serge skirt . My Grandmother had told a fib or perhaps she was just talking in the funny way grown-ups have , when they do n't want children to und ? r stand . It was some years before I could interpret Grandmother 's symbolic remark , and after I did , the Browns remained in my memory . There was Something droll about them . Everybody made fun of them ; and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and his wife was tall , and he stayed at home , and she taught school , nevertheless , they laughed . The womanish man and the mannish woman have always been one of the world 's best jokes . I laughed , too , until lately . I3ut having met Edward , I am beginning to wonder if Perhaps we have all been making light of what is really a serious problem . Perhaps , when Nature shuffles the cards , and deals out human character ? rsties , it is n't as ludicrous as we have supposed , When they fall , not according to sex , but by dis- P , osition and temperament . It was Edward who nrst set me thinking . iidward came to me highly recommended as the best day 's worker in the city . He was a small , apologetic Englishman , with a thin , sensitive face a'r1c hands , as scarred by housework as a woman's. ( 1 . Fle really is a marvel , " my friend assured me . You must n't be prejudiced against him just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At first , I must confess that I did have , not eactly a prejudice , but a feeling of doubt . The powerful Maggie who had ministered to me for so ng , had been utterly inefficient , to be sure , but I always believed that being a woman , she could have taken care of my apartment , if she had wanted to . I was always hoping that she would want to . And Edward was only a man . Could he clean , dust , wash , iron and attend to the thousand and one details that make up a day 's work ? On the evening of his first day , I knew . The apartment was clean , the pictures hung straight , some small pieces of laundry , beautifully ironed , were laid carefully across the couch . There seemed to be no toll of breakage . Best of all , the day had been painless , as far as I was concerned . Edward glided about ; he did not groan , exclaim or protest ; he worked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - details of his neighbor 's ailments and domestic affairs . It was several weeks before I became really acquainted with Edward . His silence was almost taciturn . I learned later that he was habitually on the defensive , as uncomfortable as is a woman who first engages in an occupation which has previously belonged only to men . Yet when he discovered that I was pleased , even enthusiastic about his work , he became positively expansive . My appreciation seemed to heal a wound of spirit , remove some old insult from his heart . He had always been fond of housework , he ex ? plained , and his wife did n't like it at all . Before she was married she made shirtwaists in a factory . After she was married , she was miserable , staying at home and doing the housework . She loved to run a power machine and she enjoyed being with other people . Edward 's hatred of a factory still emphasized his speech . Machinery always got out of order when he ran it , he loathed the noise and confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Parrots ! " he said , " all parrots ? screech ? ing , yelling , chattering ? never ' quiet a minute . " For quite a while , when they began keeping house , he went to the factory and Mary stayed at home . They were both unhappy . She could n't seem to do anything right , the food was burned , the flat was in disorder and she was always tired . One ' day , they decided to change places . He stayed at home , took care of the baby , made the house clean and was at the door to greet her when she returned . It worked like a charm . There was not a family in the whole tenement as happy as they . Then , the ; children grew up and went away , and one day , his wife died and he was left all alone . After all his years in the home , he was like a widow . He did n't know what he should do , or how ow he could earn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career un ? folded . The friend who sent him to me , came to his door one day . She was looking for a woman named Quinn , a laundress and day 's cleaner . Ed ? ward told her there was no such person in the building . She seemed greatly disappointed as she explained : " I have just come back from the country , and I must have someone to clean my house and attend to the children 's laundry before school opens . " The words came to Edward like an inspiration . " I will do it for you , " he cried . And from that day , he became a houseworker . " Only , " he added with not a little bitterness , " lots of women do n't want a man doing their work ? sometimes I have to go for fifty cents a day less , just to have enough places . That ai n't right . Because I do it just as good as a woman does , and some say I do better . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new point of view about men 's work . Knowing him has made me realize how many in ? justices to men exist in the world . In suffrage days , I thought that women had preempted all the inequalities . Now that we have won the vote , and so many occupations are open to us , I begin to see the need of a new campaign for human freedom . This time , for men . Women have achieved , at last , the privilege of going out of the home . But did you ever hear of a man who was really permitted the full privilege of going into it ? By no means . The home is still woman 's sphere even though she leaves it at will and claims the whole world as her hunting ground . John Doe may carry his wailing infant up and down the hall , of course , and sift the ashes and beat the rugs . He may even wipe the dishes on a Thursday night or when his wife is tired . But he does it under Jane Doe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't really belong ; he 's just an extra . Outside of the home he may sew as a tailor , run a washing machine in a laundry or cook in a bakery . He may be a chef in a big hotel , but he is doing it as a business , not a homey , woman 's task . If by chance , a man prefers the sheltered , individualistic , domestic sort of work , society is against him and considers him unsexed . So , a man like Edward is a pioneer , just as were the first women doctors or lawyers or engineers . He is living against the same kind of obstacles , trying to get into the home as were the first women who tried to get out . It is strange how everybody is against the do ? mestic man . Consider the case of the Margaret Winstons . Harold Winston is like Edward in disposition , except that he is the product of people who have never done their own housework . He is not lazy . He likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . This does not mean that he is effeminate . He 's a good out-door per // son , plays tennis and swims , and is a great camper . In fact , it was on canoe trips and camping expedi ? tions that he learned to cook so well . He really is a specialist in food . He can plan menus , carry out a scheme of floral decoration , manage any kind of a servant , black , white or Japanese , and he is a perfect host . No one ever gives such delightful dinners and teas . In short , Harold has just that genius for home-making that all women are sup ? posed to possess by instinct and almost as seldom do . Margaret is one of those women who has no knack at all , in household ways . Her rooms al ? ways looked like a series of offices , before she was married . She wore tailor-made clothes , she bought tailor-made furniture , she tried to run an apart ? ment as if it were a factory efficiency department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold ; she merely existed in a house . Now Harold had never had a paying occupation . He had tried a number of things : interior decora ? tion , semi-amateur theatricals , running an arts and craftsy florist shop . Nothing he did ever succeeded and he was always in debt to his father . Margaret , on the other hand , could always get a good job . When she met Harold she was making a large salary as employment manager for a big corpora ? tion . She wanted to keep on with her work , but also she wanted companionship and a real home . No ' body knows by what process matters were ar ? ranged , but they now have a charming house which Harold manages , and Margaret works as she did before they were married . It seems as if both had found their proper vocations , and they are bliss ? fully happy . The disturbing factor is that Harold 's social position is not pleasant . I-lis men friends rather despise him , they call him Margaret 's " wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of grafter . ' Whereas , the truth is that he is a hard working and contributing member of the partner ' ship . If Margaret were giving up her life to mak ' ing him happy , and herself miserable , everybody would approve . But because he stays at home and plays what is usually the woman 's part , no one elx ' cept Margaret really appreciates him . And she 15 so happy that he is satisfied to go on , proud , in ? ' certain way , that he can do so much for her . I wonder if Edward 's situation and Harold 's are not typical of others . It may be that all over the country , men in offices , in factories , and perhaps no business at all , are unhappy and unfitted for life outside of the home . Tradition forces their keep on , of course , just as many a woman with he ' talents suppressed by dish-washing and cooking foregoes a longed-for business or December 14 , 1921 THE NEW career . With women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Society concedes them the right to engage in almost any occupation from arctic exploration to making steel bolts . Their ad ? justments are now chiefly personal . But men , poor souls , have not exactly been forced out of the home . They have never been let into it , on equal terms , and it may require strenuous campaigning to give any of them the right to stay in it . It would be strange , would n't it , if men had to struggle to get into the home , as women did to get out of it ! Perhaps , after a long period of pioneers like Edward and Harold , an enlightened and determined man will feel a call to leadership . He Will form clubs where men can talk over their Wrongs and tell their experiences trying to gain a foothold in the home . One can picture how , after a while , members of these clubs would decide to have a big campaign , and there would be speakers at the street corners and mass meetings . And one clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongs , there would be a great parade . One can see them , marching thousands strong , wearing white suits and sashes of blue or yellow , while women stand along the curb shouting en ? couraging words and cheering them along . They Will have banners , with all kinds of legends . " We Vote . Let Us Decide How We Shall Work , " ' Japanese Men Cook . Why not American Men ? " " We Demand a Place in the Home . " There will be sections , too , composed of men already in home ? making occupations , housekeepers , cooks , day 's workers . And floats will have tableaux showing ? len in simple household tasks like making grape Jelly , or putting laundry to soak or peeling Potatoes . Naturally , some men will object to opening up the home to their brothers . Because they prefer to be out in the world , they will insist that all men do the same thing . Probably there will be Anti societies eager to prove that it is contrary to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfathers had no such notions . People will begin to write Pamphlets on the sphere and duties of men , and everybody will be debating the subject and taking sides . Then , of course , there will be women who resent any infringement upon their traditional activities , and this may lead to the formation of a political party , which women may not join , Pledged to defeat all women candidates for office Who refuse to consider the justice of men 's de It seems almost certain to me that the next great Movement will be Albertism . Victorianism has Passed but there will not be true equality in the World until Albertism comes in . It is strange that Queen Victoria , whose name suggests all that is clinging and dependent in women , should herself have given the historic precedent for a new attitude toward men . Her history affords an almost com ? plete program of masculinism . Albertism begins with a man 's right to be wooed . In royal circles this has always been conceded . No woman 's magazine has ever debated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have to hang back modestly , offering only such gifts as books , flowers and an occasional box of candy . After she has cast an appraising eye over the whole masculine world , she says , " I 'll take this one , " and she does . If , as the French sociologist Tarde says , customs pass down from the higher to the lower walks of life , the privileges always ac ? corded to queens may ultimately be granted to Mary and Jane . Of course there must be , in fact we know there are , many men in the world too timid to take the initiative in mating , men who would gladly be wooed but who have n't the egotism or courage to do it for themselves . What a relief for them to wait quietly , knowing that some day a woman will come to them and say , " You are mine ! " After Albert was won by Victoria , there was no question of her giving up a career . His place was in the home , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for keeping his place . He was not ex ? pected to be a wage earner , either . Instead , he was given a generous allowance . There seemed to be some difficulty about what he should be called . Mr. Wettin would not do , apparently . After this was settled and he was established as Prince Con ? sort , he proved his ability to make Victoria happy by a long and honored service to the royal home , their children and England . If Monsieur Tarde is right , and customs do come down from the aristocracy , Albertism will one day be permitted in the ordinary walks of life . Men , as well as women will follow their temperaments and abilities , rather than some traditional idea of what they ought to do . If they are shy , retiring and domestic , no one will blame them if they stay in the home , provided they make good in home ? making , and can bring up children , cook and sew . Instead of belittling their talents , as we do today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In such a time , schools will be established where men may study the arts of the household . And we shall make no social discrimination against them . Under Albertism , a man with domestic in ? clinations will not have to slink along through life with the apologetic air of a man in a woman 's club .
