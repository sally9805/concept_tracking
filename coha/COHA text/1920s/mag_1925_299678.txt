THE NEWER SPIRIT-V . F. Calverton - Boni , Liveright ( $2.50 ) . This author applies to contemporary letters a new theory of criticism . The approach is sociological , the method scientific . " Revolutions in aesthetics , " he says , " are due to revolutions in ideas , but every revolution in ideas is due to a revolution in the social structure . " It was the invention of the steam-engine that made people interested in the tragedies of factory girls , the amours of merchants , when only those of monarchs had before satisfied them . His attack is directed chiefly against those critics who subscribe to Stuart P. Sherman 's affecting doctrine that " beauty has a heart full of service . " Analysis serves , he says . He hails Sherwood Anderson , " the voice of the proletariat , " denounces H. L. Mencken , " vaudeville critic , " assails " the Great Man illusion , " asserts that geniuses can be made in the laboratory by sensitizing the perceptions of infants .
