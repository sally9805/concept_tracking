txt 0N THE wall of my workroom in the great city of ' Baltimore , metropolis of the Maryland Free state , there is a brass sconce or wall light , and in front of ? It , to protect me from its glare , there is an oval shade of so-called parchment . In the ceziter of this shade is pasted a round , multi-colored label from ' a bottle of Panianerbrilu , one of the eminent brews of Munich . The light shining through the label gives it the effect of stained glass , and I often suspend my struggles to enrich the national literature long enough to gaze at it flea.santly , the while my mind dredges up memories of happy nights in the HoibrItuhaus , or In the Platzl dump across the street , with charming and noble companions across the table , some of them now dead and in hell . ? ? It is , as I say , an agreeable diversion from the harsh business of swell letters to gaze upon this label . It is not only charged with lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait of a Bavarian monk upon It and being perfectly circular in contour . But the other night , when my eyes wandered to the underlying shade , I was suddenly aware that there was something unpleasant about it , and then I began to remember that I had noticed the fact before . In other words , I liked the label , but not the shade . So I left my work and began to examine it more closely , and then to toy with it . As it stood , the long axis of the ellipse ran up and down . In the course jof my monkeyings I turned it around , so that it ran . hori4ontally . At once I noticed a great improvement . The beer label was substantially as before , though the monk was now stretched out on his face instead of standing up . But the oval shade was much better . What had beenvaguely irritating now became soothing , * This change in the effect of the shade naturally puzzled me , and I abandoned my literary endeavors forthwith and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided by fasting and , prayer . On the morning of the third day , Just at dawn , when the mind is abnormally clear , I hit upon the explanation  --  or , at all events , upon what has since seemed to me to be the explanation . The bad effect of the shade in its original position , I decided , was purely physical , and the good effect of turning it was also purely physical . The secret of the whole phenomenon , though superficially it seem to be esthetic and hence psychological , lay in the way the muscles ere arranged that move the human eye . Try to swing your eyes front side to side : you will find that you can move them without noticeable discomfort through an are of almost ninety degrees . But now try to swing them up and down : you will find that it is uncomfortable to move them more than forty or fifty degrees . Now return to my shade . What is the effect of the light behind it ? ' Obviously the effect is to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to follow it , as it follows all conspicuous outlines . When the shade is upright this following is disagreeable , for the eye muscles are compelled to move the eye up and down , which is difficult and hence painful , further than they have to move it sidewise , which is easy . But when the shade is turned the other way the eye muscles are at their case , for their longest swing Is then their easiest swing . This discovery , which is probably a commonplace to those physiologists who have actually studied physiology , was new to me , and so it delighted rte . More , it caused me to meditate further , and out of that meditation grew a simple and highly plausible theory of esthetics . So far I have found no holes In it , and I therefore pass it on . In brief , it is this : that beauty is an effect of muscular comfort , or , more broadly , of sensory comfort . A beautiful object is simply one thaii , in the process of impressing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning of the body . An ugly object is one that interrupts that current , ) or runs against it . * re , . * ; This theory , it seems to me , offers a ready explanation for many phenomena that have hitherto subjected the professors of ' esthetics to copious night sweats and left them vague and , incoherent in the morning . Why are two tones struck in harmony pleasant to the ear , and two tones that make a discord disagreeable ? For the plain reason that harmonious tones make smaller demands upon the hdaring apparatus . COnfronted by them , it has to do with vibrations that fall into regular patterns , and are thus  --  apprehended with relatively little effort . But when it is confronted by a discord it has to deal with tones that reach it in complicated and irregular patterns , and thus put a heavy burden upon it , just as a rough path nuts a heavy burden upon the muscles of the legs and feet . The phenomena of clang-tint resolve themselves in the same way . The clang-tint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not agreeable in itself . The instrument may be played so badly that its sound becomes almost unbearable . The reason is not far to seek . When it is played well , its tone is clear and regular . The overtones take their Proper ' places in the natural series , without any one of them being forced to abnormal intensity , and the unavoidable noises ? of the bow scraping the string , the violinist grunting , his knuckles cracking , etc. ? are reduced to a minimum . Thus the ear is soothed by sounds that come in relatively simple and plausible patterns , and is so made comfortable , and its comfort is to the mind . But when the violin is played badly it has to deal with sounds that come in irrational and widely disparate groups , and so it suffers from overwork , and the brain translates that suffering into a Freudian wish that the sheriff would rush in with a warrant for the violinist . The professors of esthetics try to account for these effects in purely psychological terms . Soule of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a notion which , applied to music , instantly becomes far-fetched and nonsensical . Others argue that there is a mysterious craw ing for harmony in the human mind , and some of them , letting words mislead them , relate It vaguely to the alleged human desire to be at harmony with Cod . There are many other such theories , all of them of a gaudy complexity . But it is no more necessary to resort to them than it is to resort to psychology to account for the unpleasantness of a tough beefsteak . The sufferings of the gums and of the muscles of the jaw are quite sufficient . * There is , of course , a psychological content in beauty , at least as ' beauty is practically encountered . Music , if it be familiar , pleases by awakening- agreeable memories , and even when it is not familiar it may awaken such memories by association . But the pleasure thus evoked is not . necessarily ' esthetic in the strict sense , for it may be evoked , as every one knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only defectively beautiful , or even not beautiful at all . There is surely little beauty in such a song , say , as " A Bicycle Built for Two . " Yet I have seen- it , at a political Convention , wring teats from lady politicians weighing sixteen stone . ? In , poetry the  --  psychological or ideational content is still more important . Poetry is a mellifluous statement of the obviously not true : its object is to make life more bearable by conjuring up imagei of an ideal and superior world in which all women are , lovely and amiable , all trees are green , all soldiers die willingly , and gladly , and all dreams come true . But the fact that the statement must be mellifluous is not to be overlooked . To Put it into plain prose , without any regard to the color and sough of words , would be very lumardous : nine poems out of ten , indeed , including the ' greatest , would evoke only hoots if so translated . What is important is the agreeable concord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ear , not in the soul . The late Charles Algernon Swinburne , a man of consider . able humor , though also a  --  poet , was well aware of the fact . He wrote poems that had no logical content at all . One Could not make out , reading them , what he was for and what he Was against . As statements of ideas they were exactly on all fours with so many revival sermons or college yells . But the words in them were melodious and beautiful , and they were arranged in neat and charming patterns , and so the poems greatly tickled the inner ear of the English speaking race , and Are highly Weaned to this day .
