At the Quai d'Orsay ( French Foreign Office ) met the Finance Ministers and representatives of the Allied and Associated Powers. ** Their task was to decide how the proceeds from the Experts ' Plan are to be paid . <P> According to the Spa Agreement ( June , 1920 ) , division of moneys extracted from Germany was to have been made as follows : <P> France 52% <P> Britain 22% <P> Italy 10% <P> Belgium 8% <P> Others ( excluding the U. S. ) 8% <P> Along came the U. S. , however , to demand payment of $250,000,000 for the cost of maintaining a Rhine Army and $350,000,000 for War damages . <P> Britain claimed that the U. S. had no legal claim to share in the proceeds of the Experts ' Plan , because it had signed a separate peace with Germany . Britain also claimed that the U. S. had not even a claim in equity , because it was not charging property sequestered from Germany against its War claims .

S. and Germany ) those rights which it would have had had it signed the Treaty of Versailles . <P> The next most important agendum was the division of reparations so far received , a matter complicated by profits derived from the Ruhr occupation , seizures made , deliveries in kind received , etc . <P> The net results of a series of private conferences and the preliminary sessions of the main Conference was that an agreement was reached between the U. S. and Britain , whereby the former will receive as payment for the Rhine Army costs about $13,750,000 annually for about 17 years , instead of $20,000,000 for twelve years as settled in the so-called Wadsworth Agreement ( TIME , June 18 , 1923 ) . On the War damages claim the U. S. was awarded a 2% share of the total payments which are to stretch over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay through the Experts ' Plan to the Allies at least $625,000,000 annually , with subsequent increases according to an index of prosperity , the minimum share of the U. S. will amount to $14,062,500 per annum for about 25 years . <P> Much satisfaction was evinced in Europe over the settlement of the U. S. claims . The U. S. , thought Europeans , had become " one of the contracting parties to the Experts ' Plan and the general reparations questions . " <P> The Conference continued . <P> ** Representing the U.
