txt An injunction and accounting suit filed yesterday in the . Federal Court is based on the contention that the privilege given to a producer to use copyrighted material for a silent motion picture does not give him the right to use the material in a sound br- talking picture . It was said that this is the first time in this jurisdiction that the sound picture device has figured in litigation . The complainants are Johnston McCulley , an author , and the Frank A. Munsey Company , which publishes the All-Story Weekly . The defendants are Warner Brothers Pictures , Inc. ; Douglas Fairbanks and Douglas Fairbanks Pictures Corporation . In Aiigtist and September , 1919 , the AllStory Weekly ran a copyrighted serial by Mr. McCulley under the title " The Curse of Capistrano . " In May , 1920 , Mr. Fairbanks obtained the right to make a motion picture of the story . The complaint explains that when this contract was made there existed a potential art for the reproduction of the human voice which was later developed and improved . It asserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any one else the right to convert the story into a picture carrying the reproduction of spoken words and that all rights relative to this method were retained by the plaintiffs . It is asserted on information and belief that Mr. Fairbanks and his company used Mr. McCulley 's story in making the picture play " The Mark of Zorro , ! ' which was produced in November , 1920 .. At first this was a , silent picture , but later it reproduced the human voice . It is alleged that this constituted a violation of copyright . At the office of Peaslee , Brigham and Gennert , counsel for the plaintiffs , it was said that out of the litigation would probably come a definite designation of the talking picture which is now " neither drama nor film , but something between the two . " It was suggested that if the present suit were successful . many similar actions would be instituted .
