A barricade of sandbags and barbed wire was erected last week by perspiring young French Royalists outside the Paris office of their obstreperous news organ , L'Action Franaise . Parisians stopped to loiter , to tip one another the wink , to shrug and pass on . They knew that fiery , effervescent Royalist Editor Leon Daudet must be preparing with dramatic Daudeterie to resist arrest . A sentence of five months in jail " for defaming the police " has hung over him these two years ; and only a fortnight ago he refused once more to set a time convenient to himself to serve his sentence ( TIME , June 13 ) . Therefore last week the authorities announced that they would arrest M. Daudet , that very day at 1 p. m. , would remove him to jail . <P> Editor Daudet , who recognizes no political authority save that of the " King of France , " * immediately called out last week his " Camelots du Roi " a band of young Royalists thus derisively nicknamed " The King 's Hawkers " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L'Action Franaise . With sandbags , barbed wire , and 100 " Camelots " to defend him , . Editor Daudet felt safe in his office , announced that he would reside there indefinitely in a self-proclaimed state of siege . To reporters he cried : " My house , my stable and my inkpot are henceforth here ! My Leaguers " Camelots " ) will not allow me to go to prison . Let the Prosecutor General dare to try to arrest me ! He is mistaken if he believes , as he says , that I will have to bear the expenses of his proceedings . I am within my right and I shall not move ! I am ready for anything and will do whatever circumstances or my fancy dictate . Tell that to the Prosecutor General . . . . With me " this is a question of Honor . I owe it to the memory of my son . No one has any finer cause than mine ! " <P> The " memory " to which M. Daudet referred was the suicide ( according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while riding in a taxicab , allegedly shot himself ( 1923 ) . Editor Daudet has always charged that the police " murdered " his son , and for this " defamation " he was sentenced , 18 months ago , to serve five months in jail . As the hour of 1 p. m. approached last week , tout Paris kept an eager ear for news that policemen had swarmed over sandbags and barbed wire , rushed the " Camelots " and dragged a plump , irate editor to jail . Instead it was a group of Communists who first molested the Royalist premises . <P> The Communists , perhaps 100 strong , gathered outside the office of L'Action Franaise , shouting : " Down with Daudet ! To jail with him ! " <P> " Vive le Roi ! " answered the young " Camelots , " " Vive Daudet ! Vive la France ! " <P> Soon a Royalist-Communist free fight with canes and hurtled rocks began . Because the office of L'Action Franaise is near the Station St. Lazare , many an arriving tourist thought that revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated the combatants-though not until some 20 civilians and 10 policemen had received major bruises . All the while Editor Daudet stood at the window of his office , cheering on the " Camelots " hurling such epithets as " Pig-men ! Assassins ! Red-Snouters ! Bandits ! Jelly-Bellies ! " at the Communists .
