Nine men let themselves down rather hopelessly into nine leather chairs around a table at the State Department . One was a Secretary of State with two assistants . One was a Secretary of War with one assistant . One was a Secretary of the Navy with two assistants . Into the ninth chair slid the slight frame of Hugh Gibson , Ambassador to Belgium and his country 's most inveterate limitation-of-arms conferee . <P> The nine were sitting to complete a U.S. program for the preparatory conference on the limitation of armaments to meet in Geneva April 15 . Thither Mr. Gibson will lead a U.S. delegation , hoping for much , expecting nothing . <P> The preparatory conference is to deal with land armaments , beginning with Russia 's proposition for an unarmed world , descending toward practicability . In reduction of land forces the U.S. has no interest , leaving that question to Europe . Still it could not go to a disarmament conference without a disarmament program , no matter how negative , so one was prepared last week . <P> If Mr. Gibson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide humorous mouth succeeded in diplomatically concealing his feelings . He has been attending arms conferences for the last four years . First it was the 1925 " Traffic-in-Arms " conference , then the 1926-27 preparatory arms commission and finally the ill-starred 1927 conference on naval armaments , of which he was chairman . He has heard all the polite haggling of open and closed diplomacy . He has seen admirals and generals mix a sour brew of national honor , strategy and armament statistics . And he sums his observations thus : <P> " Disarmament has become a problem of hogs , fogs and bogs . " <P> A Californian by birth , a Frenchman by education , a cosmopolite by diplomatic service , Mr. Gibson was last week the guest of President Hoover at the White House . For six months after the war he was on duty with Mr. Hoover in European relief work . <P> The Gibson career began at the foot of the foreign service ladder , at Tegucigalpa , Honduras , in 1908 . It took him ten years to reach Paris . Woodrow Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge transferred his ministerial duties to Switzerland and finally , in 1927 , elevated him to the rank of U.S. Ambassador at Brussels . <P> The failure to bring about an agreement on naval arms with Great Britain at Geneva in 1927 may or may not be laid at Mr. Gibson 's door . In Foreign Affairs , for April , John William Davis , onetime ( 1918-1921 ) Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's undertook to explain this diplomatic breakdown , to minimize Anglo-American differences , to suggest a policy under which naval limitations could be accomplished . Attracting wide attention in Washington , Mr. Davis wrote : <P> " ... The three-power disarmament conference failed because the ground had not been prepared . . . . The cardinal weakness of that conference was that questions of naval strategy were always to the fore and emphasis on strategy always deflects policy . ... It is policy which ought first to be determined . ... If indications are given from responsible sources that in the event of constabulary action against a Kellogg-Briand covenant-breaking state , the navies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict is greatly reduced .
