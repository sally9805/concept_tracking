NEITHER Hingham nor neighboring Boston could have been laid out by bees . I have heard said that Boston was dragged from the harbor by a yoke of oxen ; though others say that the town only followed an incipient ox about the pasture till both the calf and the state of mind were lost . Many an American town between . Boston and Santa Barbara shows this same ruminant beginning . Santa Barbara itself , though nothing like so ancient a city as Boston , was surveyed , an early settler tells me , after a classic example with a bull's-hide chain , a measure which was fresh every morning and new every evening ( lengthwise ) even in California 's equable climate ; so that now the streets of Santa Barbara are somewhat this way and somewhat that way , though plenty true enough by the compass for living purposes . Cities of the future will be built for business only . It is the village and the open country which we must devote to life and the making of homes . Quite the reverse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live in the city and do business in the country , like the valley folk of Utah . The Utah settlers took counsel of the bees , sending out repeated swarms which clustered here and there in the valleys , built village-hives and , dividing the outlying lands , planted cherry orchards and fields of beets and peas and alfalfa , and in the very fields set up the sugar mill and cannery , keeping the village-hive a home . The bees are true village folk in work , but city folk in matter of numbers and government , some of my strongest colonies approaching the hundredthousand mark . They are rural people concerned with agriculture , field workers , harvesters with ranging wings , nectarsaving sacks , and thighs for carrying pollen ? bodies and beings one with the wild flowers . They are children of the air and of the blossoming fields and yet a people of the close-walled hive . They are intensely social insects for whom a single day or hour of enforced separation means almost certain death . There are solitary bees like bombes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can wrap the loneliness of ranch and homestead and plantation about them for a mantle to shut out the cold ; but most of us would freeze . We are both solitary and social , needing the freedom of the fields , loving the warm close contacts of the hive ; dreading nothing so much as darkness and silence and space , the remote unspoken spaces , unpeopled and strange . The Mormons have been our wisest settlers with their village-farms . The hive bees are dreamers and idealists ; but no people on earth are harder headed or harder hearted , more careful , more practical than they . Hingham has no such builders , no such villageplanning board as they . The bees are not imaginative . They have as small a place for beauty in either their philosophy or their building plans as the people of Hingham , and make as little of an appropriation to that end as our annual town meeting . Time and nature have touched the streets of Hingham with sweet dignity and an assured serene repose . Hingham is old and gentle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America there is a street more soaringly arched , more softly , sweetly shaded than Main Street of a summer afternoon . There is many a lovely doorway in Hingham , many an old-fashioned garden of sheer delight ; but nothing from the hand of man could be uglier than the public library , the post office , the railroad station , the stores , the town hall , and some of the schools . Defter builders than the bees I know not , or wiser ; and there is a serious beauty , intellectual rather than aesthetic , showing in all of their work . Nowhere in nature is there an absence of this beauty of adaptation , the poetry we call fitness , which measures every line from means to end , though seldom is it so purely an intellectual expression as among the bees . Euclid so expressed it , and carried it far beyond the applied science of the hive . But the bees are a small and a hard-pressed people , who have no world of abstract signs and symbols for their dwelling . They dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of short , uncertain seasons , watching the fickle harvests and listening to incessant clamoring needs in the hive , and they must build their mathematics quickly into comb . Plan and purpose in the bee city answer to each other so perfectly that it is hard to say which is cause and which effect . Here is an empty hive , a white pine box , close to a foot high , a trifle more than a foot wide , and nearly two feet long , raised by an inch from the ground on a cleated bottom board , allowing an entrance across the front of the hive between it and the bottom . Let the walls he thus squared , of clean sweet pine , or columnar and fluted , the classic pillar of some ample village porch , or the hoary rind of some crooked forest tree , and the engineers will create a habitation in either place to challenge the admiration of the world . The dovetailed hive on the stand before us , the standardized , patented hive of American apiaries , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur nished with ten narrow wooden " frames " hanging on small shelves inside at the front and back ? most exact frames , seventeen and five-eighth inches long by nine and one-eighth inches deep , each one holding a thin sheet of wax stamped on both sides with bossed impressions of worker cells for the bees to " draw out " into worker comb . Taking his hints and his measurements from the bees themselves , the maker of this hive , allowing half an inch for " bee space , " has proportioned it within ? length and breadth and depth and every piece of its furniture ? so that all of the room shall be occupied by either bees or comb ; quarter-inch passageways where only one bee needs to go , and half-inch ways between the hanging combs where two bees must work and move past each other on opposite walls . All of this furniture and nice interior decoration is quite gratuitous . It is very good business , however , and wholly in 11 keeping with the theory and practice of the bees themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most original of modern beekeepers , observed their plans and applied their measurements to the American hive . It was Father Langstroth who invented the hanging or " movable frame " which fills the hive ? a frame with its comb of honey , or eggs and brood , which can he lifted out of the chamber , independent of the other frames and without disturbing the brood nest ? a simple detail , but revolutionary , the result of experimentation of all the beekeepers of the world since long before Tut-ankhamen tasted honey . I have done to this hive all that I know how to do or that the bees can accept , giving them but little more than the outer walls and the site for their city . They must invest the walls with life and law , must establish their government , create a society , achieve a population of fifty thousand souls by the end of the short summer if they would be safe ; they must erect houses , lay out streets , build vats and bins , install sanitary and ventilation systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prospectors to go afield , harvesters , water-carriers , masons , pitch-pickers , breeze-makers for tempering and purifying the draughtless air , evaporators for curing the unripe nectar coming from the blooms ; they must train scouts and guards to keep the gates and protect the stores ? these things and more they must do , for they will have to set up and officer all the machinery which is essential for a great people under a highly organized society dwelling in a walled city incredibly crowded with population and supplies . Now in front of the hive , hard upon the ground , let me shake a clustered swarm of bees . Here is the place to begin our study . Few things in nature look less organized than this inchoate heap . It lacks all semblance of order . No law would seem to apply to the pile . The fingers of the wind on the drifting sand of the desert are not without design ; but what touch of molding hand , or hint of purpose or form or plan or meaning can be detected in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , they are not as so much wreckage ; nor are they a mob , or even a jostling crowd before the theater doors ; but rather like a great company behind the scenes , none out of place , no single bee without her cue , or failing of her part as she hurries toward the stage . It is a breathless moment , one almost of revelation , as suddenly a single mind , a single will , a single purpose animates the insect multitude and covers them with glory like a cloud . No solitary bee among them , no minute hair upon her velvet corselet. but answers like the seven seas to sure design and , like their tides , is true to law ; appointed to its place within the infinite scheme , if we would see the scheme complete ? the comet 's course outlined ; how far shall slide the ocean 's floor ; what pollens may be kneaded by the bee ; and just how many of the starry grains she may carry in the hollow of her thigh . Twice my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! when I take off a loaded super , every comb capped snowy white , the last cell sealed ; and full to running over when I watch a shaken swarm melt down and creep with all their airy wings , sensibly like reasoning creatures , into the proffered hive ! Creep ? They fairly run . But not as living creatures run . They flow more like a stream or more as moves a weaving fabric through the loom . The spilled heap in front of the hive is so much wool before the carder ; and thinning out . as through invisible reeds , with warp and woof in play , is drawn across the entrance into a pattern ? a people , a civilization . The clustered swarm , driven by Lhe passion of its mad escape back the whole length of its social life , returns , and , caught at the threshold by the machinery of the hive , is instantly rewoven into the colony , into a society , the best organized , the most daring in doctrine and practice of all we know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new hive is perpetually interesting to me ; and , old beekeeper as I am , and trouble enough as I have had with swarming , still I can not resist the desire to lay thy ear to the cover of the hive or to look for just a moment inside to know if the new colony is already at work on the foundations of the new city and has come to stay . Newer than Cleveland or Oklahoma City , the city is to follow lines laid out long before the streets of Babylon were plotted ? a replica of the oldest city and yet so modern that the newest boom town in our oily West is ancient by comparison . Slowly , street by street , story by story , from the rude single cell of solitary bee , prosopis , this city of the social bees has been evolved across the ages , no doubt to outlast any pile of steel and stone which we are erecting on our rocky coast or lake shore or in the broad bosom of our maternal plains . Not that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having firmly grasped the truth at the heart of the social world , they have the logic to build by it and the courage to live by it ? in an everlasting city whose true maker and builder is God . The core of this social truth is sacrifice , and the physical expression of it in the building of the bees , the head of the corner of their whole structure , is the six-sided cell . The first work in the new hive is a cell . Here the bees start from the bottom to build ; and here from the bottom our study might start , as here , in wonder and defeat and faith , it shall end ? earth and much of heaven compassed within these narrow hexagonal walls . Who shall measure the meaning , the length and breadth , the height and depth of this angled , six-walled , waxen cell ? Sweeter than honey is the honeycomb . From being a drowsy , inert , almost drugged mass sagging heavily from some bent or broken limb , the cluster , when shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open gates as if it had been running all the way from the City of Destruction , so suddenly eager to get in ! This instant activity , this complete consciousness out of the lethargy of the cluster is almost startling to the beholder , for plainly the creatures are not walking in their sleep . Every bee is awake . The stupefaction following the orgy of the swarm is-gone , and the colony is seized with a new madness : to settle now , where an hour before it was to swarm ; to build , to store a new city and secure it against want and everimpending winter . Should the new home suit the fancy of the bees ? " fancy " is the only term ? and usually it does , then , if their queen is with them they crowd inside , glati again to feel safe walls about them , and begin at once to work . A few scouts or hangers-on or curious followers from neighboring hives may be seen about the entrance ; but the swarm to the last bee is inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its orders and sanctions , and already disposing of it ? self so as to form a living furnace for the puddling and rolling of wax plates out of which to fabricate the comb . Comb is the pressing need . They must have comb at once for brood and bread and honey , or life can not go on . Whether for this end or in mischief , as some observers claim , or out of fear for the immediate consequences of their folly , each bee left the old hive with her sack full of honey . It is inside of her -- stored , not eaten ? and can for days he carried far as subsistence if the swarm wanders a long way without finding a home . If I catch them early with a hive which they like , then out of their distended sacks they pour into the furnace , and the working of the wax begins . At no moment in its history is the colony so perfectly conscious of its solidarity , so acutely aware that its center and fate is the queen . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fear can round a herd of cattle on the plains as if a. single swinging lariat had roped them ; the eye can not follow the instant alarm in a veering flock of shore larks ; but quicker still , as if by galvanic shock , spreads the alarm of the lost queen . The swarm may be myriads strong but , lacking ltei ? her alone ? it is weaker than water . The bees intend not to leave the home hive without her , but she may not be able to follow ; and once in the air , so wild , so sweet the madness of the swirl , they forget her for a moment , fail to miss her , when , as if smitten by a bolt , the dance stops and back to the hive swoops the swarm in wild alarm . The queen , poor thing , may be hopping about pathetically with a clipped wing in front of the old hive . ( Would a poet clip those royal wings ? ) The swarm will come to her and stay with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , their author , their projector , the sole hope of their life . Lacking her , no hive could hold them , though I might rub it with hyssop and curtain its clean new walls with snowy honeyoozing comb overflowing from every well . Many a time I have picked up the distressed queen and slipped her into a tiny cage while her swarm was still whirling , unconscious of her absence , in the humming air . I have watched the ecstatic flight now shimmering like a gossamer film in the sunlight , now dark as a puff of smoke against the sky , the wild joy of the singing wings filling the garden like the passing of a fleet of airplanes infinitely far in the blue . Then all was still . Nothing now but the workaday hum in the garden , that busy drone which knows no clock if only the sun will shine and the nectar flow . Then suddenly a rushing wind ! The whir of distant wings ! And yonder in the air a gathering cloud of storm as , sweeping back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descends the frightened swarm . Back to the old hive the daughters swirl in a golden smother and , pouring in , find the precious captive where I have pushed her , well within the entrance of the hive . They shout , they sing , they crowd rejoicing round about her , for they are one and whole again . Nor do they care that this is not their old home , but a new hive in its place , which I quickly put here while they were awing ! No matter , new or old , they have their queen . All , all is theirsto-day and for the never-ending tomorrow ! Oh , boundless joy ! Oh , sweet , sweet life , and sweeter work ! Where is it , the-thing-to-be-done ? And they pitch upon the new comb with such quenchless zeal that soon the empty hive is hung with sculptured alabaster walls of fragile cells beyond the mother-queen to cover , or all of the working field force , were the daughters of Danaiis helping , to overtake and , *fill . The queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing wings . She coasted heaven on them once and could never go or even desire to go again . The close , cradled walls of the hive are her portion now , where there is no space to spread a wing . Yet mine is no brave deed . Trouble and shame assail me at sight of her creeping maimed across the combs . My heart always trembles a little , like my bare hands when , seizing her between my giant thumb and forefinger , I feel with the monstrous scissors after her fine-veined wings . She would escape , but she never stings , nor do her excited children sting , though sometimes they flock upon my bare hands . Is it the part of a lover to treat her so ? Or am I only a honey farmer , a merchant , like Chaucer 's " Sowynge alway thencrees of his wynning ? " Partly merchant , partly savage perhaps , as if I were Caliban pinching off the crabs ' blue legs in petty spite . I clip the queen 's wings to punish the truant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crop . She suffers no pain and very little fright , and I shall give her more than I deprive her of in this new hive furnished to a queen 's taste . So , with gear ready I await the departure of the foolish swarm and , catching her hopping lamely about the grass in front of her old home , I slip her quickly into a tiny cage , set aside the old hive , in its place put the new one , and leave her in the new doorway in her cage . Then I sit down while the bees hold revelry in the sky , and like Caliban hold my sides , thinking with joy of their swift fright and watching with sweetest satisfaction for their headlong plunge down to reality and their queen . What insects mortals be ! But you should hear the clamor , the happy hubbub when they meet , and you should feel the zest with which the throng disperses itself about the frames and wails and sets its house in order ! As soon as the excitement subsides I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melt into the bosom of her swarm . We could see better what goes forward HMV were this a house of glass instead of one with wooden walls ; the gain , however , would be offset by loss resulting from the bee 's distaste for staring eyes . She forages in the open , loving high noon and garnering only the golden hours ; but she draws a curtain of deep dusk about the privacies of the hive . This is partly out of fear . Let a seam open or a weathered crack appear and it is quickly chinked with propolis to block the passage of any sneaking foe and stay the wind ; but quite as much to keep the light from prying , as if within the hive some sorrow brooded or there were some nameless reason why this portion of her virgin life must he a secret and all its nunlike service shrouded with a veil . However thick and opaque the walls , we see the whole colony first concerned with comb . The queen is heavy with eggs and in her extremity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare walls of the hive . Cradles can scarcely be provided fast enough for her . Before to-morrow 's noon she can mother a living circuit of three thousand cells , leaving secure in each deep bottom a fertile egg . What with the three short days before the young shall begin to cry for food , and the imminent need of stores of honey and bee bread ? now a very wolf at the door ? there is but one passion , one purpose in the heart of the swarm . Hardly have the last stragglers crept across the portal of the new abode when the clamor begins to die away , a stillness falls upon the multitude and the sweating of the wax begins . Tread softly as we pass within the mystic circle . Over this weird ceremony hangs a quiet almost as deep as death . No wings seem to stir ; no cooling airs move the curtain ; the bees have almost ceased from breathing that the fire may burn . If now we slowly lift the cover of the hive we shall drag into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undersurface of the cover , its apex a changing point where , as pulled candy , it was drawn out of the ropy mass filling all the chamber like yeasty dough . If brood frames occupy the space , then in between them , quilted fold on fold or , more like plates within a storage battery , hang the bees , generating and charging the whole body with their eheinic heat . Put back the cover . Only in the buried fires of the closed and superheated hive can this mysterious stuff be forged . The liquid honey in the live abdominal sacks , as if in boiling caldrons , is being reduced twenty times in weight and transformed into a different product , a wax , a fat which , made in certain ducts , passes out to the body walls , comes through upon the flattened plates beneath the abdomen and hardens ? the lumber , fragrant as rived sandalwood , for the building of the city . We say the process is by osmosis ? as if it were thus explained . We can count the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , the fourth , and the fifth abdominal rings ; we can see the glands leading from them which secrete the wax and pour it out upon the anvil plates . We men of science are most wise . There is nothing in this more wonderful than in the process of digestion and assimilation constantly building up our bodias , except that the honey in the sack of the bee , nay , her very body seems hers by absolute prerogative . She can consume this honey if she like ; she can regurgitate it and store it in some uncapped cell ; she can make it into royal jelly , mingling it with chyle , and mouth to mouth can feed it to some nursling bee or give it to the queen ; or , uniting with her sisters in a strange embrace , as if the multitude must join their wills and have one single mighty mind , she can flow the metal from the furnace of her body and cold roll it into a marvelous fabric fitter for comb than plates of steel . These wax scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clustered ; and as if in further proof that they may form without the worker 's conscious will , we sometimes see them protruding half way from the wax plates on bees 1 at labor in the field . If there is a heavy I honey flow , the nectar more than the force can handle , it seems to stimulate the wax organs , or very possibly stimulates the easily excited greed of the gleaner who , with her sack nigh to bursting and the cup before her still at the brim , fans the wax fires just to consume it , just to allow her to gather , gather , though she drop the costly scales in her flight to the hive , scattering what she had gathered , wasting what she was more eager to hoard than to save . The swarm in the new hive I have given them is not long stirless ; their fever is breaking quickly into waxen sweat , All through the quilted layers between the frames , single bees are detaching themselves from the ropy tangle and are crawling toward the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grind the wafers which , mixed with an acid secretion in the saliva , are being thoroughly masticated and made soft for shaping to the cell . On the posterior leg of the worker bee , in the concave surface of the tibia and first tarsus , is the pollen basket or corbicula ; and where tibia and tarsus hinge the joint is curiously fashioned into a pair of pincers , like blacksmith 's tongs , for the express purpose of picking up the delicate wax scales from their anvils and transferring them to the anterior claws , whence they are carried to the mouth to be kneaded by the wax jaws with saliva and worked up with old wax From the walls into the plastic mortar For the comb . Here is a circuit as lovely as the raindrop 's and as magnificent as the sun 's . The beauty of all creation is over it . Not only are the hairs of our heads num ) ered ; so also are the hairs on this articulated leg of the honey bee ; and . , ach is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose her ; olor , the stars their courses , the strings if David 's harp their soothing sound . ) nly the sum of all the parts is equal to he whole ; but what we are prone to , verlook is the perfection of the whole irefigured in every fragmentary part . I have already supplied the swarm vith sheets of pure , thin beeswax for midribs to their combs , sheets from man 's nicest machines , cunningly embossed with lines and corners for the pyramidal base and six surrounding walls . This is my contribution , besides the hive , as consulting engineer to a swifter , larger , more populous city laid out by rule four-square on practical American lines . Nor shall I lament , as British beekeepers do , these hard Yankee lines . They are not so lovely as a wild tree in the timber . But who can afford a forest of bee trees for an apiary ? This practical American hive is not so poetic as the old straw skep . But this is the next thing for us to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve of beauty . I am not a great beekeeper ; yet my market is one for honey , not poetry . If mine were a market for Georgics only , then I could give this swarm a quaint domed but of braided straw or leave them free to find some hamadryad 's hollow , abandoned since the Puritan with texts and halters scared all of those sweet dear witches from these Hingham groves . While not needing either my hive or any of my help , the bees take gladly all I offer , and because of it build better than they know . Approaching the highest ridge of the stamped sheet of wax , and , near to the middle , the little masons begin to draw out their geometric walls . They gnaw down the ridges on the foundation which I have given them and , mixing that wax with their own , thin out the embossed lines and on them build off the delicate wells to their proper depth . As fast as one mason lays on her trowel of wax , measures and angles and plumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute load to the moistened edge , troweling the spicy mortar into a structure which for mechanical accuracy and architectural wisdom is still the unchallenged admiration of the world . There is no form of container , no method of using storage space so economical as the honeycomb . But the cells must serve for cradles as well as for containers and be adapted to the peculiar shape of the young bee . The problem confronting the builders of the city is one of finding a type of structure yielding the maximum of nursery and storage room , requiring the least material , and having the greatest strength ; of what lumber to build it and what the principle of its support : whether on a foundation upward , or to build from overhead down . If this problem were put to our greatest engineer and he were as free as the bees to choose . his answer would be a hanging honeycomb . Human skill and ingenuity , transcending that of the bees in so many matters , stands theoretically matched and actually beaten in the architecture of the hive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wayside , except that we can more easily dispose of our wonder in the flower by attributing it , root and all , to Nature or to God ; whereas in the comb of the bee we have no choice except to blink the truth , mumbling about blind instinct or , in open-eyed amazement , see and accept the manifest working of a reason as clear and as true as our own . Running water is an artisan . It cut the Grand Canyon of the Colorado but it never carved a thing so cunning as the honeycomb . Soap bubbles pressing on one another , and boiled peas in a bottle , will take on the semblance of hexagonal walls . And so for fear of God both Science and Theology would work out a theory of the honeycomb and build it cell by cell , round like a pea , or a bubble , or a barrel and , piling barrel on barrel , heap them until by pressure of their own weight the hoops bend , the bulging staves give way and all flatten into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws as crystals ! So we are plunged from mystery into misery , from order into confusion ; from faith into despair . Soaked peas in a bottle might assume hexagonal sides , but not pyramidal bases ? each of three diamond planes or rhombs , and so placed with reference tothe bases of the opposite cells that each plane of the base forms a third part of the bases of two cells , each whole pyramid contributing to three pyramids interlocking with it on the opposite side of the comb . These hexagonal walls and these pyramidal interlocking bases of the midrib ; this double-tiered , suspended , vertical comb ? each several cell as perfect as a multiplied crystal , was not built a cell at a time by a single bee , but many cells together on both sides of the comb , by many bees together ; and not as ends in themselves , like crystals , but as beds for sleeping bees and wells for liquid nectar ; and all worked out with reference to economy in a measured space . And human science , surveying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or builder . Science , by taking thought , can neither strengthen nor beautify nor increase by one tittle the capacity of the honeycomb ; but Science and Religion can , or ought to add , to our capacity for wonder at the honeycomb . But a piece of comb is not beyond error , which only adds to its perfection . That the bees eau fail and do fail is only another proof that they are kin to us rather than to the crystals . This is a slowly perfecting world . The bee builds nothing blindly . The first cells against the roof are not perfect hexagons but only as close to norm as possible . And when she shifts from worker cell onefifth of an inch across , to drone cell onequarter of an inch across and one-eighth of an inch deeper , she readjusts the cells between from their bases up to make the transition with a minimum of distortions in the comb . And when a queen cell is needed , what then ? What happens then to blind instinct and the theory of the crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory to the winds , turning economy out of doors and disregarding care , she tears down the measured walls , destroys the lovely fabric of the worker cell and , digging back to the midrib , hollows out a rough space and in it builds a massive , lavish chamber for the queen . No architect has planned this . It is the rude , roomy house of the primitive honeybee before she was a society , or had a city , or ever felt the pressure ) f narrow spaces , crowded streets , teeming populations and their needs . A simple elemental art marks the strange house ; but nothing of the conscious artisan , adapting , economizing , cramping . Spun of mixed porous silk and wax , it has neither interlocking pyramidal base nor hexagonal walls abutting endless other walls , but stands above , thrust into ample space , a rude log cabin in the open square , guest house to Life , to whom will be given the keys of the city . And when she wants a passage through the combs she cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with thick " brace combs " in which there may be honey cells or only shadowy pits . She works by plan , not by rote ; with thought , not impulse , geared to some central sun . Free to interpret and adapt , the bee brings a mind to the handling of her cell , as slowly through the ages she has intelligently evolved this cell to fit into a slowly evolving society . So , too , with mind and something more than mind she has brought her body and her being into bondage to its terrible and beautiful walls . When was the pyramidal base of the first cell laid out ? How long worked the builders on the plan before it was perfected ? But first tell us this : Shall we men also build the hexagonal cell for the worker ? And , if so , then what shall we build for the queen ? So all-determining is the cell in the hive that the life of the bee , both physical and social , seems to spring from its precise rhombed base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The economic theory , the political constitution , the biology of the bees is written in its exact science .

When they want life abundantly ? untrammeled , elemental life , without political horizon or social consequence ? they break away from angled wall and focused point of hexagon and pyramid to the free , unfettered sweep of line which cradles and girdles the sun . Forgetting all that she has learned , casting aside as naught the slowly builtup structure of her social life , its customs and conventions , its sacrifices and rewards ? the reasoning creature , yielding all that she has won , returning to exactly what she was , embraces life and builds him no mean abode of six imprisoning walls but rears a palace for him , an indeterminate natal chamber , neither square nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the age-long problem of her city plan ? how to use , save , make , eliminate room .
