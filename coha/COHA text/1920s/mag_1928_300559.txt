It was largely to attract conventions that a $10,000,000 town auditorium was constructed on Cleveland 's lakefront . Not without pride do the managers of Hotels Statler , Hollenden , Winton and even the Van Sweringen Brothers ' dignified Hotel Cleveland , recall what fine times they have had with visiting swarms of Elks or Engineers . A Cleveland climax was the G. O. P. convention of 1924 . <P> Last week Cleveland found itself the scene of another convention . Policeman Frank Osowski , patrolling near the Hotel Statler , watched the delegates arrive . Many a convention delegate had Officer Osowski seen before but never like these . They looked too sophisticated to be Elks or Moose . Their diamond rings and stickpins , their healthy paunches , their burly necks , made it apparent that theirs was no Christian Endeavor . They had no strange banners or playful uniforms , they slapped no backs , yowled no songs , threw no bottles or pillows out the windows , so they could not be Grottoists . Officer Osowski thought their opulent luggage , silk shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told headquarters , which sent a squad , which interviewed some of the delegates and sent for reinforcements . Then the Hotel Statler underwent the embarrassment of a police and Federal raid . The delegates , 27 strong , were a " mob " of gunmen from Chicago , Gary , St. Louis , Newark , Brooklyn , Tampa . Their convention seemed to be about corn-sugar , chief ingredient of Cleveland 's well-established moonshine industry . <P> Corn-sugar is not handled by many merchants . An underworld ring is supposed to operate two of the country 's few corn-sugar refineries , somewhere in Illinois . Some brothers Lonardo of Cleveland obtained a local monopoly of the product , but were murdered last year by rivals . A police theory of last week 's convention in Cleveland was that the Lonardos ' heirs had sent for help to solve an industrial crisis . All the delegates , who were arrested in their rooms and suites in various stages of matutinal disarray , were found to be well equipped with money and - lethal weapons . One man was identified as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> There was , of course , no definitely incriminating evidence . One does not carry a sample case when taking orders for Canadian brews . One can not be arrested on suspicion of selling corn-sugar for local ' leggers to distill into " corn likker " and sell to honest householders , who then age it in charred barrels and serve it loudly as Bourbon whiskey . It is a misdemeanor , not a crime , to carry a " rod " ( pistol ) without a permit-until it is proven you have shot someone . Nevertheless Safety Director Barry of Cleveland and Deputy Prohibition Administrator G. J. Simons , who recognized several of the delegates as racketeers he had known in Chicago , detained the whole unconventional convention for close questioning .
