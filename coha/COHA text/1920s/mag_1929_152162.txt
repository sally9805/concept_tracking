James Cruze of Hollywood directed The Covered Wagon , one of the great cinemas . He has directed many far less great . One of 23 children of Mormon parents , he is brawny , untutored , looks like an Indian . <P> He is married to Cinemactress Betty Compson , who calls him " the Great Dane . " He has more drive than any other director in Hollywood . <P> Director Cruze thinks of money in big terms . For a long time his Paramount salary was $1,000 a day-whether he worked or not . Last week he sued John Decker , artist , for $200,000 damages . <P> Artist Decker had been commissioned to do a Cruze portrait . Long a caricaturist , he tried to impart significant character rather than flattering graces to the canvas . Sensing something prisoned about Director Cruze-perhaps the restriction of raw , vital Cruze talents by the commercial requirements of cinemaland-he painted Director Cruze behind bars . Said Mr. Cruze : " I was the most surprised man in the world when I saw it . Mouth like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like an Apache or something worse . I told Decker I would n't accept it . I told him I wanted a portrait , not a funny picture . . . . " <P> Artist Decker then displayed the portrait in a Hollywood art store window with the legend : ' ' James Cruze-in Prison for Debt . " The Cruze suit followed . Said Artist Decker : " When a man employs an artist to paint a portrait , it is up to the artist to do his worst , as he sees best . If Cruze wanted some wishy-washy , sloppy , sentimental portrait of himself , he could have had a photograph taken or hired a two-bit painter to do it . I gave him a work of interpretative art . " <P> Hollywood heard that the suit would be settled out of court .
