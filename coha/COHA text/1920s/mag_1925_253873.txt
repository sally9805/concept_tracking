Honor among thieves exists only when it is enforced by the menace of mutual guilt . Righteousness among thieves , on the other hand , is chiefly conspicuous when one cutpurse can better himself by loudly proclaiming the iniquity of his rival or accomplice . This inversion , found among the practitioners of many trades , was illustrated last week by a scuffle between two Manhattan sheetlets-the Danly Mirror and The New York Evening Graphic . <P> The Mirror , seeing the illimitable controversial possibilities in the rumor of the engagement of a millionaire Hebrew songwriter to the daughter of a Roman Catholic " rich man , " made this rumor a fact , announced the engagement of Miss Ellin Mackay , daughter of Charles H. Mackay , to Composer Irving Berlin . It added that the Pope had granted his dispensation . <P> Thereupon the unsullied Graphic blazed like another Galahad to the defense of Truth , stated that " creating a sensation out of backstairs gossip . . . dragging in one of New York 's leading citizens and his daughter " is not the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fighting for the Truth . " With this jobation appeared a cartoon in which a youth in neglige , mounted on an ice-horse , scored the legend NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH on the boarding of an empty lot . It was entitled " Our Motto . " <P> The Mirror retaliated by printing a cable from Rome which substantiated its first announcement , described how , " in the morning Mr. Berlin motored to the estate of a wealthy Long Island friend . Miss Mackay joined him there for lunchtime . Later in the day , the couple were seen strolling hand in hand . . . . " <P> Next day , in the Graphic appeared the head : A FAKE NAILED TO THE MAST . Under it was a United Press cable denying that the Pope had granted , or been petitioned for , any dispensation for Mr. Berlin , Miss Mackay . Said the Graphic : " The Jews are a great people and the Catholic Church has the respect of the world . Any newspaper which uses its columns to stir up strife between Jews and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair on its door . This country is beyond cellar journalism . " <P> Said Mr. Mackay : " His Holiness Pope Pius has never been asked to sanction a marriage between any daughter of mine and the person referred to . . . . I have never sought nor held an interview with that gentleman , nor have I ever seen him . . . . " <P> Said Mr. Berlin : " The story of our engagement seems to be based on my writing What 'll I do ? and All Alone . . . . It has always been assumed , after I have written a ballad , that I have been through some heart-breaking experience . But the real reason is that the public would rather buy tears than smiles . . . . There is only one I ever wrote about my own experience . . . . I am not engaged to anybody except Sam Harris . . <P> <P> * When I Lost You , a ballad written in 1913 after the death of his wife , Dorothy Goetz . Berlin was then 25. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
