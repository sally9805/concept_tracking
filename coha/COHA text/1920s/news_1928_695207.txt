txt With the meeting of the Democratic National Committee to pick a new National Chairman only a few hours off , United States Senator Peter Goelet Gerry of Rhode Island still appeared last night to have the best prospect of being selected . Tammany men , however , were carrying on a quiet propaganda among incoming members of the committee in favor of the selection of " a business man " whose identity they would not disclose . Among close friends of Governor Smith the belief persisted that Senator Gerry would be the man , although it was admitted that an eleventh-hour shift was not out of the question . Mrs. Nellie Tayloe Ross , exGovernor of Wyoming , who was one of the seconders of Governor Smith 's nomination at the Houston Convention , is slated for one of the Vice Chairmanships . In all probability this will carry with it leadership in the fight to corral the woman vote for the Governor and his running mate , Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas . Large Attendance Expected . There is every prospect that the meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aside from selecting a Chairman , or , to be more exact , ratifying the choice of Governor Smith fqr that position , the meeting will discuss campaign plans and formally launch the fight . The prospect last night was that few of the Democratic National Committee members would ? be represented by proxies . All the incoming Democratic National Committee members who flocked to Smith headquarters at the Hotel Biltmore appeared to be enthusiastic . Predictions of victory were heard on all sides and assurances were made that many States held to be safely Republican would be found in the Democratic column on election day . Governor Smith , who had spent the day at Bear Mountain , arrived in the city by motor last night , but went into seclusion and was not in evidence about the hotel , where many members of the new National Committee were waiting to see him , offer their felicitations at his nomination and convey to him the glad news from their respective States , of which they all appeared to be bearers . Senator James A. Reed of Missouri . who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor 's invitation , arrived at the Hotel Biltmore early in the evening . Senator Reed said that he did not know what the Governor wanted to discuss with him but assumed that their talk would be with reference to campaign matters and his own part in the campaign . " It goes beyond question that I will help in every way I can in the fight to elect a Democratic President and Vice President of the United States , " Senator Reed said . " The Governor already must be aware of that , although I have talked with him only briefly over the telephone . " Silent on Southern Base . Clem Shaver , who is to be superseded by the man selected today to lead the new National Committee , arrived in the city early yesterday and last night came to the Biltmore to confer with Public Service Commissioner George R. Van Namee , who had charge of Governor Smith 's pre-convention campaign . Mr. Shaver was asked what he thought of a suggestion made earlier in the day by United States Senator Joseph T. Robinson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic National Committee establish at least one fighting base in the South for the conduct of operations in that section to overcome op. position to Governor Smith on religious grounds and on grounds related to his stand on prohibition and prohibition enforcement . " I am no longer at the helm , " Mr. Shaver said . " I have no comment to make on the suggestion made by the Senator from Arkansas . It will be for the men who take over management of the campaign at the meeting tomorrow to determine . " The meeting of the new National Committee , which is to be followed by a luncheon , will be held at the National Democratic Club in Madison Avenue . It Is understood the proceedings will be in the open and that Governor Smith will deliver the principal address . Governor to Seek Data . Governor Smith , it was said last night , would improve the opportunity afforded by the gathering of so many leaders of his party in this city , to get a general survey of the Democratic outlook f " Iroughout the coun- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discussed in more detail after the new National Chairman has been selected and has pica ' ed his Executive Committee . It will probably be the only occasion before the election is held when so many party men in important positions win be assembled in one place . While the Governor will be in no hurry about beginning his own speaking campaign , he is said to be extremely anxious to have the work of organization begun with the least possible delay . The tentative plan involves the division ' of the country into several zones , each with a regional headquarters from which to facilitate more intensive work to organize and get out the vote . It is expected that the Governor who , if he functions in a national fight as he ha in the several State campaigns that have gone before , will be the chief strategist of his own fight , will be guided largely by what he is told by members of the new National Committee in plotting out the zones and the campaign set-up generally . One important question of that character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson when in his statement earlier in the day he suggested a separate campaign organization to enable the Democrats to carry their fight aggressively across the Mason and Dixon line , into territory where the Democrats never have fired a gun in a national campaign since Reconstruction days at least . Bust of Governor Ready . When Governor Smith walks into the National Democratic Club , 231 Madison Avenue , he will be faced , as he enters the main door , by a bust of himself placed on - exhibition yesterday . It is the work of . i.N1rne . Marie Atel , an English sculptress , of : 124 Waverly Place , , who completed it hurriedly so as to have it in position for Governor Smith to see today . Mr. Smith has had no opportunity to see it previously , since he did not pose for it . Mme. Atel went . to Albany last March to study the Governor as he appeared at a hearing . Mme.
