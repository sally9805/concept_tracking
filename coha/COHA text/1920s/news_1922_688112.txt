txt Clarence Owens , head of the International Trade Commission of the Southern Commercial Congress , which is conducting its first European investigation since the war . has just spent three busy days in Holland . Speaking to THE NEW YORK Times correspondent , he said : " Before going into the work of the present commission I would point out that a similar commission directed by the Southern Commercial Congress made an extensive survey of Etiropean economic conditions in 1913 , which resulted in the Federal Farm Loan act . Under this law America now has twelve great banks and 4,000 farm loan associations which have lent more than half a billion dollars to American farmers . Loans are made for thirty-four and a half years at 311 per cent. , 1 per cent . being added to amortize the loan . It was this law that made America prepared to finance agriculture during the period of the World War . " The Congress commission is now in Holland on another but belated mission , the object being to promote direct commercial and financial relations between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rotterdam and Amsterdam municipalities and Chambers of Commerce , have inspected ports and have held conferences with Dutch bankers and eommercial leaders . The members of the commission were also guests of the American Legation at a formal reception attended by about .100 Dutch Government officials , bankers , business men , importers and exporters from all over the country . " We visited the International Air Exhibit at Rotterdam , and the members have had an opportunity to make flights in the latest Fokker model similar to those being built for America/ . We were greatly impressed , and also conferred with officials interested in the development of air freight lines , offering our co-operation in the prosecution of their plans , recognizing the importance of air freight for future commerce . " Aside from questions of trade and finance , the commission has made an extensive report on the subject of the reclamation of land and wisnes to present to the United States Congress a memorandum setting forth the genius of Holland in reclaiming lands and building up . rational prosperity . This memorandum will be in support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has ** acres of swamps and overflowed lands , chiefly in the Southern States , this area alone being ten times the area of Holland . " With the members of the commis ! ion I went to the Zuyder Zee to inspect the enormous reclamation project of draining that area , just commenced . , America must exhibit genius as great as that of Holland in the development of her native resources . " We found peculiar conditions in Holland regarding trade relations , since the Netherlands were war neutrals and while affected by the World War and the problems of reconstruction , they have not the same problems as the former belligerent nations . It appears that with the World War over Holland looks to her hinterland for the return of normal commercial and financial activities . Germany being her hinterland , they frankly say that if Germany fails Holland will fail and if prosperity returns to Germany Holland will follow . " The opportunity for direct trade relations and for the promotion and extension of these relations hangs upon , first , the settlement of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly , furthering the provision for reciprocal trade relations through the adoption on the part of the United States tariff schedules that will encourage an easy flow of commerce . " The commission has pursued its work from Belgium to Holland and leaves for Germany today . it will also work in Switzerland , Italy , France and England . " Mr. Owen said that the commission could not announce its conclusions until the survey was completed , but that a Complete report would be submitted to the Southern Commercial Congress to he convened in Chicago , Nov. 22 , and would be presented to the American Congress in December . He added that the work of the commission had been expedited by diplomatic and consular oficers and commercial attaches of the United StateS and the Shipping Board . ' Under the command of Captain Griswold the Shipping Board organized a trip through the canals of Holland and the Rhine on an American boat . The commission , at a session here , unanimously adopted a resolution providing that Americans be warned as to indiscriminate relief work being promoted cad organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official sources discloses the fact , it is declared , that much of the money sent from America has been dissipated . It has been popular to respond to appeals for Belgium , but it is asserted that there is no poverty in Belgium now , that its per capita wealth is greater than that a the United States , and that funds being sent are not needed . This word of warning is given for the purpose of saving for Americans In rge contributions that might he turned to other account In the United States . The commission recognized that a great and efficacious work had been done in the past , but held that the time had come to divert these funds to home uses or relief measures that have the complete approval of official representatives of the united States . Representative Belgians appearing before the coinMission confirmed reports of these conditions . it was stated that no public account had been made of large sums rorwarded from America .                    @
