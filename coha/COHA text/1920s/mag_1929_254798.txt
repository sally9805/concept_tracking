To the large brick " common jail , " on the banks of the Anacostia in Washington must go Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair for three months . The U. S. Supreme Count so ruled last week . His crime was contempt of the Senate . <P> In March 1924 , when the oil scandals were white-hot , Oilman Sinclair was called before the Senate Public Lands Committee . Ten questions were put to him . One question was whether he had given money to Albert Bacon Fall , whilom Secretary of the Interior . Oilman Sinclair , on advice of counsel , Martin Wilie Littleton , refused to answer every question . <P> He was indicted , tried , sentenced in the District of Columbia Supreme Court two years ago . His appeal to the Supreme Court was on the ground that the Senate 's questions pried illegally into his private affairs , that he was already threatened with court action on the subject-matter of these questions , were not pertinent to the legislation . <P> These contentions the Supreme Court swept aside as without merit . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal from a six-month jail sentence , imposed upon him for contempt of court , for jury-tampering in October , 1927 . These two offenses were by-products of the larger charge of conspiracy to defraud the U. S. in the leasing of the Teapot Dome naval oil reserves , on which Oilman Sinclair was acquitted last year .
