IT is astounding to look back and re-I- fleet that only eight years ago women went on hunger strikes , families were parted , windows broken , pictures ; lashed , the whole world of women was dilaze with revolt and rebellion , and . ven received actual wounds in battle .

" Ca n't you get . over your inferiority complex ? I thought all that ended when you got the vote . " It did seem ended a few years ago when one surveyed the wreckage of feminist organizations and the gropings of women's-rights leaders . While conceding the interest of vast women 's organizations in cultural and civic affairs , one felt the preoccupation to be that of bystanders . I almost agreed with the ungenerous critics who denounced woman suffrage as a failure in actual performance , and yet my heart belonged with the women whose earnest , devoted , and sometimes heartbreaking efforts to enlarge the horizons of women , in the face of the apathy of the women themselves , I had so often seen in the course of my work .

One sees the self-consciousness , the awkwardness , the failure , and does not realize that these are only symptoms of a aliveness underneath . Only a few years have passed since feminists as groups disintegrated . There was the fascinating and extremely shrewd suffrage general who said , " I 'm through . I 'm going home now to teach my little girl French and to get a gloss on my nails and hair again . " There was the breaking up of the ultra-feminist club . One heard its able and masculineminded leader praise a young woman who waited on her husband 's uncertain habits instead of asserting her rights .

Girls who had been extremists left their dramatic roles in street processions , jails , etc. , and went their simple human ways as wives and writers and interior decorators and actresses and reformers and press agents . They wanted no more drama of causes capitalized , and saw their future simple , direct , and untroubled . " The old war horse told me we were the torchbearers of the future ' , " one of them said , laughing . The girls around the table laughed with her . Torchbearers of what , and where ? They had done their bit . Elsie , for instance , who refused to hand down the sacred flame , wanted fame as a writer and love and a home and children .

Yet it is the sort of thing which is undertaken by women every day . This girl will deny her maternal instinct since she feels she must save something from the destruction of her personality . She compromises . She will love John and maintain his home , but she divorces herself from the care and love of children and so gains a certain amount of time and freedom to do her own work . That she is only cutting herself off from her richest fulfillment does n't occur to her . There is a beautiful girl I know who has a husband , a home , and a fine baby ; and who , instead of sitting at home and basking in her happiness , struggles with cooking recipes as sub-editor of a magazine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one week I can make enough to keep a better cook a whole month ? " The feminist formula has n't worked out so well for her . Before she married she had studied to he a. concert pianist . Marriage somehow put an end to that . The poignancy , the imperious necessity for self-expression somehow tones down in the mild warmth of the happy domestic hearth . Her job does n't give her the necessary stimulus so she takes it out in being psychoanalyzed , and resigns herself to her half-world of tempered happiness and regret . Then there is the girl , highly successful in her profession , with a beautiful apartment , and owing nothing to anybody , who confesses an intense longing for a " home . " She is one of thousands of professional women who are willing to lead lonely lives rather than make a compromise with the spirit within them .

Attractive enough , the modern girl denies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing some of the old , dishonest female tricks . But her compensation is a. rarer form of happiness ? the happiness of an incomplete poet . The woman who is a complete artist also has this dualism of her nature to face . We went into the Grand Due in Paris one night last summer to hear Buddy play his drums . The only other persons in the tiny fashionable cabaret were a woman ? manifestly aristocratic , with real emeralds and real pearls against her carefully prepared skin ? accompanied by Iwo handsome men : dominant and bored and English , splendid in the large spaces of their evening black-and-white . A negress , magnificent in her orange-brown skin and her abundant sensuous body , ablaze with animalism , arose and sang a too coarsely questionable song , and danced ? danced a denial of everything civilized , a. denial of everything the jeweled lady of station and her forbears stood for .

But they 're too spirited and intelligent to spend a lifetime petting one stupid man . " The women he mentioned one a poet , the other a writer of exquisite prose , well-known on both sides the Atlantic ? have both paid dearly for their integrity ; and whenever a woman does so she becomes as they are : tender toward all women and conscious of the high price women pay for a soul . Many professors and Dominant Males think that submerging women in their maternity is the only answer to this restlessness and sex-consciousness . It is not possible for a woman to have children in numbers patriarchal enough to stifle completely her hunger to be a person in her own right . It is not that she has not enough mother love in her .

But , objects the Typical Male , ear ? ing through the whole of this self ! xpressionistic program makes women oo strong . And strong women make nen weak . Well , a little weakness ( or L little acknowledgment of the weakiess in them ) will not hurt the masculine ontingent . History is choked with the ? ictories of men beset by doubt and sin nd weakness . It is only the conquerors , lie Napoleons , who are stupid and who a the end see themselves and their vorks destroyed . If a man has a job that is bad for him ; lie is doing his work under conditions hat are galling ? is n't it vastly better hat he be free to take another chance , ccause his wife can carry the family long on her earnings ?

The problems of to-day 's feminism pproa eh more nearly the problems of rtists than they do those of the average tan conquering and working in material alms . The average man is not con:Tried with his soul , nor is he suffering . om soul-sickness . His problem , by lid large , is concerned with making etter and more matches than any other Ian ; with having a bigger and better tr and a bigger and better home and tinily than his neighbor . It is not from le man who does the world 's practical to-day or in the past , that the rtist or the poet or the religious martyr as received sympathy and help . It has ways been from rather weak men , and om women , that the radiance of underanding has come . Behind every great an there stands a shadowy figureime woman who saw , beyond and ; ainst all reason , the spiritual power of the man who drew his energies from her love . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like artists , are absolute creators : creators of flesh and blood , carriers of the divine spirit . Every creator who wishes to approach perfection has a Hound of Heaven dogging his footsteps . The artist ( who , with rare exception , must struggle to attain this clarity of the soul ) is prepared to sacrifice material things because material things are not essential to his success . But a woman must work her success through human beings , as well as through a pure spirit , and her transition and adaptation to her task is heartbreaking . She longs for a home , a husband , and children . She longs to give herself completely to her chosen work . She is a human being and has the right ; more , it is her duty to society to develop herself in all her capacities . Too often she can not have both her love life and her career . She shrinks from choosing her career and going on alone . There are enough women who are lonely through inescapable circumstance . But if she takes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner forces , she must go where they lead ? alone . Every woman who has been of value to the world has had to End her way for herself and establish her own realities . There are no signposts for her . She must put them up for other women . As she does this she makes a change in the conduct of women , and it is a change for the better . It is a change from accepted acquiescences and sometimes slaveries , which are hoary with the praises of men , into a clear and a controlled freedom that pays for what it gets . She is not really a new woman , fundamentally . Earning her living for the most part , unwilling to take life except on the most absolute terms of honesty , she is simply the old woman come out into the open world . A woman can not change her morals overnight just because she stands on her own feet financially ; but financial independence enables her to do the things she thinks right , even if she has to fly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic morals spring out of her interests and her emotions ; they come with her into life . If she is an honest , sensitive person ? and strong shepays for what she takes out of the world : pays in service to the individuals she loves , pays in her work through the exercise of a vision broadened by experience , compassion , and knowledge . The feminist who thinks of herself as a conscious factor in this changing process of customs and conduct will make mistakes , sometimes frightful ones . But the error that is done through love and through honesty is not an error in the end . It is a path explored . It is enriching to all human life because it is a finding the way to the truth . I know of one such feminist who wanted to be self-sufficing to such an extent that she had a child without the blessings of church or state and refused , on principle , to let the father take any responsibility toward his child . She has a small income so that it was possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror of the poor girls who are daily turned out of public institutions , with no home , no work , and the hate of society to make their life a living hell . Indeed , she moved in an aura of sympathy and praise from her friends . She had taken no risks . It did not occur to her , evidently , that to have a child without an acknowledged and permanent obligation to its father is satisfying her ego at a sacrifice of the rights and feelings of the father and the child . Some day , being honest , circumstances will bring her to realize that her child is paying for her present excess of individuality . Who shall say to what an extent a father shapes his young ? Who shall say to what extent he is necessary in the psychic development of his child ? If psycho-analysis is proof positive , this girl may be storing up a lot of trouble for her young . Ile may pay all his life for her sense of freedom and power through a distorted and perverted psyche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be used as ammunition in a war . It is not that children in themselves are an end . Any woman who has sunli herself in her children , if she strip herself of her emotional attitudes anc answers from the depths of her heart knows that at the last they elude her At last they elude her love and het anxiety . At last they leave her and gc their strange ways and she is left , lonely her vicarious fulfillment snatched fron her when she needed it most . So that in the life of every woman ? she whc despises the feminist idea ? there come a time when she mourns the loss of he ; individuality . One such was a grand oh woman who with courage only and lov , had come to a strange land , reared he : children , and served their children turn ? helping the young into the world nursing them through childhood , bury ing the dead ; old and feeble she became but serving , serving always . Her deares son died and a granddaughter , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orphaned little half-sisters. " 11 : daughter , take no more burdens on you shoulders than you must . Childrei bring their own fate into the world will them . Somehow life will take care o them . " A profound nihilism out of thi unending well of love ? a soul confronter by itself , alone at last , alone and wearied knowing that the flesh has its ow urgencies and will survive . No one is self-conscious without hein. solemn . We may be feminists , but con sciously our job is just the job of tryin to be human beings . We are no pioneers . Life and a modern industriz world has pushed women on to whet ; we can with comparative economi safety maintain attitudes of social c anti-social conduct which women woul not have dared a generation or two age Our spiritual and aesthetic content i no greater than was our grandmother for th " ir day . The machine age , h needing us to feed it , has given women the chance to express themselves . The little tradition-bedeviled farmer 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems , wishing she were as modern as the young people who dash up and down the road . But if she could listen to them she would hear the same old talk of ensnaring the man . So the young feminist who thinks she is finding new modes of conduct is only keeping abreast of her times . As such she is more significant , more a part of the real life about her than was a real rebel like George Sand . She smoked cigars because she liked cigars ; yet there are thousands of women who with a singular sameness of taste have ventured only as far as the cigarette ? we wo n't talk of the pipe . She wore men 's trousers because that seemed a logical expression for her rebellion . She explored the whole range of a woman 's . ! motions without fear and against an Lmazed world , because that was her orotest against the degraded emotional condition of the women of her class in marriage . In her necessity to be an ndividual she broke out from the most saditional society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers are always Lristocratic . She belonged to that group ( few and rare and precious ) which n every generation , besieged by the late and the indifference and the fear ) f the entrenched multitudes , rejects he banal , sees new truths , feels new ) eauties , and somehow lives past prej'dice and persecution Lo be honored by he generations which follow . Yet even such a tradition-breaker and trtist found her complete happiness when , through with her youth of trial Lnd error and achievement , she sank mck into the age-old institution of amily life . Staying up all night to dress doll for her grandchild was a bliss . the busied herself with a thousand little domestic happenings : with flowers and ) irths and sickness and other human kings . And with all this womanly ripeless she sang her little song because she must ( so she wrote Flaubert ) caring little whether the world would stop to listen , so happy , so content was she at last . We women too shall drop our awkwardness and learn to sing our little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not caring whether the world listens or not and we too shall bathe in the love and service of our families . Feminism is no answer to life . It is no answer to the struggle of doubt and faith that we must go through to find , for each of us , an individual answer . Feminism is an attitude of courage , a positive attitude ? an attitude of going forward . No sensitive woman who wishes to live to the full the possibilities of her nature will admit the defeat to which Madame Lombroso resigns women . For Madame Lombroso , the anti-feminist , there is only one way out : and that is going backward , admitting inferiority and accepting it , hugging old traditions and making the most of them . It is giving too much honor to the past and too little honor to ourselves . We too have something to give to life . We too may , nay must , make our contribution to the sum of rich experience which is all that civilization is . We can not cripple ourselves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties are insurmountable . They are not insurmountable and every honest woman who takes her life in her hands and determines to use it bravely and sacredly , to love and to love abundantly , to serve and to serve abundantly , and to do her own work in the world to the limit of her powers ? that woman has done a great deed . For herself and for those she loves and for the women to come she has made life a more free , a more noble thing . Not in retreat is there an answer for the soul-sickness which troubles intelligent women to-day , but in an advance ? carrying the pack of love on erect shoulders , past feminism , past sex-consciousness , and out into the open valleys and pitfalls and mountains of plain human maturity .
