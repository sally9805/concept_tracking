Salvation by Conference CAUTIOUSLY , step by step , but with evident assurance of purpose the administration is unfolding its foreign policy . The President and his Secretary of State propose and are seeking available methods of using the economic power and political prestige , of the United States for the benefit of appeasement and recovery in all parts of the world , but for many reasons they are obliged to go slow . American public opinion is still reluctant to take many risks or to assume many responsibilities abroad , particularly in Europe ; and in certain parts of the world the malady is so unmanageable that at present an outside physician can do no more than offer pious advice which the patient is too sick to accept . The administration began with naval disarmament as the immediate object and the Far East as the first subject of its political healing . Navies and China were matters in which the American people were directly interested and in relation to which American leadership had a good chance of being accepted , but the President never intended to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he were successful in substituting conference for war as an agency of Far Eastern legislation , to extend the method to other problems and regions . He has intended for many months ultimately to call a general conference . But the announcement of this intention on November 23rd , instead of at the end of the present Conference as was originally intended , is rendered possible by the appearance of one new condition in the complex of international politics and it is rendered extremely desirable by the intrusion of another . It is rendered possible by the fact that the administration considers the success , from its point of view , of the present Conference practically assured . It would not dare to launch the new ambitious project , if there was any danger of the foundering of the first more modest vessel of its own contrivance . But even though the prosperity of its first project seems assured , it would still have possessed sound reasons for delaying the announcement until its success was publicly admitted and confirmed , were it not for another less agreeable piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval armaments and in introducing a little order into the Far East has intensified the political malady of Europe . France , in the person of M. Briancl , declared that she preferred isolation to the taking of any share in the limitation of land armaments . Great Britain , in the person of Mr. Curzon , warned France that the preference for isolation might involve disaster . The long smouldering hostility between the two countries jumped to the surface , and it threatened to render a larger conference which would deal with land armament and the problem of Europe abortive before it started . If the project were to have any chance of success , the administration had to announce its intention unequivocally and without further delay . The significance of proposing a new association of nations at the very moment when France insisted on disassociating herself from the movement towards appeasement is clear enough . In a less offensive but more emphatic way the American government repeated the British Foreign Minister 's warning to France . It declared its intention of trying to substitute conference for armament and war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Far East , of including the defeated as well as the victorious nations within the embrace of conference and its beneficent authority . If its proposal should succeed what would be the result ? It would bring into existence an association of nations whose unanimous decisions , even though they were not backed up by military force , would possess overwhelming moral authority . Any nation which would not conform and whose nonconformlity was based upon a belief in armament rather than conference as an agency of international legislation , would do so at its peril . Its isolation would be ignoble and dangerous . It would become something like a moral outcast . All the imponderable weapons in international politics which the Allies mobilized so effectively against Germany would be brought into play against it . The new association of nations proposed by Messrs . Harding and Hughes will possess one enormous and decisive advantage over the League of Nations . The League of Nations is still bound hand and foot by the instrument , the Treaty of Versailles , which created it . It can not succeedin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the Treaty of Versailles derives its sanction not from consent but from force . The chief business of any vital association of nations will not be to execute the Treaty of Versailles but to discover and work out the most available and least costly means of revising it . Such obviously is bound to be the chief business of the association of nations proposed by the American goverment . It will begin to repair a grievous wrong and to start a genuine process of reconciliation by summoning Germany as an equal to the council tables of the nations . It will be driven by the same logic eventually to issue a similar invitation to Russia . It will then consider what it can do infallibly to check the landslide of economic and social disintegration which is threatening European civilization . Its deliberations can reach only one conclusion . The European nations must agree to disarm or perish . They must finally substitute anew settlement for that of Versailles , because the present legal basis of political order in Europe derives its authority exclusively from armaments and the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoroughgoing disarmament is inconceivable . The calling of Germany and Russia into conference is a necessary means of obtaining their consent and assistance in substituting a new settlement for that of Versailles . A satisfactory or even a semi-satisfactory revision of the Treaty is a task of colossal difficulty . It may be impossible as long as the temper and the power of the French nation remains anything like what it is . France will probably pursue , at least for a while , the perilous and arrogant path of national egotism and try to block the work of creating a concert of Europe based upon certain general principles of national development and international comity . But we do not believe France will either desire or be able indefinitely to obstruct the work of recovery . The French are stoutly and angrily rowing the boat of French policy against the rising tide of world feeling , opinion and need , and in the end the tide will rise too high and run too strong . It will swing them back . It has risen steadily since the Senate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratify it . When at that time the New Republic first suggested the calling of a new conference in order to revise the Treaty and lay a solid foundation for international cooperation , the suggestion was characterized , by well-informed men like Mr. Hoover as preposterous . It appeared at that time to be sufficiently remote and dubious . But it was not preposterous . For one truth about it was clear to anyone who was willing to face the facts . Not only was conference the only possible existing substitute for armaments and war but the Treaty of Versailles stood in the way of calling the substitute into real existence . The " preposterous " suggestion is now adopted in substance by the American government . The United States in cooperation with such governments as Great Britain , Italy , Germany , Austria , Hungary and others will try it out . The first trial may well fail . But they will try it again and again until they obtain a sufficient measure of success . They must and they will .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
