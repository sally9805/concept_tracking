The government can not settle it for you . It will force no man to work against his free will . It will force no men to employ men against the free exercise of an employer 's rights . The government will not be partisan , and the government is concerned with coal production sufficient to meet the industrial and transportation requirements of the country , and at the same time against a fuel famine when winter comes again , and it is desired to have production resumed at once .

It is that simple form of adjusting disputes which answers the call of good conscience and a just civilization . When two great forces do not agree , there must he a peaceful way to adjustment , and such an arbitration opens the way . " I do not expect reply with clue consideration . Please take the proposal to separate conferences . I wish you to appraise the situation , weigh your responsibilities/and then answer this proposal as you wish , to be appraised by American public opinion . I am speaking first of all for the public interest , but I am likewise mindful of the rights of both workers and operators . You are also an inseparable part of that public interest . With due regard for all concerned , it ought to be easy to find a way to resumed activities and command the approval of the American public . "                   @ @
