Last week 's news from the Vatican announced that His Holiness had bestowed The Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great upon Nicholas Frederic <P> Brady , Manhattan financier . Mr. &; Mrs. Brady have been in Italy , and their U. S. friends could only cable them their applause , for it was most fitting that of the handful of papal knightly orders that of St. Gregory the Great go to Mr. Brady . Pope Gregory XVI ( 1765-1846 ) created the order in 1831 and put it under the patronage of that first and greater Gregory ( c. 540-604 ) - to reward the civil and military virtues of the subjects of the Papal States . But now , when the Papal domain is only a patch of land at Rome , the knightly requirements have been loosed by the Popes and made applicable to all the adherents of their spiritual hegemony . Nicholas Frederic Brady , Grand Cross Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great does not become , by the investiture , a citizen of the Pope 's Roman temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately rewarded spiritually for his great charities to Roman Catholic institutions , for his great courtesies to Roman Catholic dignitaries . <P> Only two knightly orders of the Papal court surpass Mr. Brady 's Order of St. Gregory the Great . They are : <P> 1 ) Supreme Order of Christ instituted in 1319 as an active religious order for Portuguese knights and preserved today only as a titular papal honor . Though no U. S. personage holds the cross of this order , others honored with it include onetime ( 1919-22 ) President Dr. Epitacio Pessoa of Brazil and Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma , Consort of Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg ( TIME , April 23 ) . <P> 2 ) Order of Pins IX intended fittingly to reward noble and conspicuous deeds meritorious before the Church and stimulating in their effect upon society ; conferred also upon non-Catholics . Sole U. S. member is James Joseph Phelan of Boston , created Knight Commander in 1926 . <P> Lesser Orders are : <P> 1 ) Order of St. Sylvester , reputedly the oldest and once most prized honor , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pius XI created His Excellency the Hon. Charles Dunbar Burgess King , President of the Negro Republic of Liberia , Knight Grand Cross of the Order . <P> 2 ) Order of the Golden Militia ( also called the Golden Spur ) limited to a world membership of 100 knights . In the U. S. no holder ; in Great Britain the Marquess of Bute , lord of more than 117,000 acres . <P> 3 ) Order of the Holy Sepulchre , reputedly founded by Charlemagne . Edward Hearn , past national president of the Knights of Columbus , now living in Italy , and Frederic Kenkel of St. Louis are U. S. holders . <P> For Roman Catholics who can not attain the eminence of the orders , there are three medals of recognition .
