John Gilbert Winant , onetime ( 1925-26 ) Governor of New Hampshire , bought for his private collection the famed Edgehill portrait of Thomas Jefferson , painted by Gilbert Stuart . He bought it from Francis Burton Harrison , great-great-nephew of Thomas Jefferson , onetime ( 1913-21 ) Governor General of the Philippine Islands , now resident of Scotland . Never until now has this portrait , by many , regarded as the finest ever made by famed Gilbert Stuart , valued at $100,000 , belonged to a person in no way related to famed Thomas Jefferson . <P> Edsel Ford last week purchased Gilbert Stuart 's portrait of Major-General Henry Dearborn from the Enrich Galleries in Manhattan . He had the picture hung in the office of the Ford Motor Co. , at Dearborn , Mich , where he works . <P> More than a hundred portraits of women were hung up last week in the Grand Central Galleries , Manhattan . The portraits-by Sargent , Zuloaga , Poole , Bellows , Orpen , Sorine , Zorne and many another-had in frequent case never been exhibited before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillman , Mrs. Oliver Harriman , Mrs. W. R. Hearst , and many another such-had in most cases been flattered by their imagists . There was , however , one room which had been made into a fold for old portraits of women , by Reynolds , Romney , Stuart , West et al . The exhibit was notable for the excellent paintings which it contained ; also because no art gallery has ever before held an exhibition of the portraits of Women without men .
