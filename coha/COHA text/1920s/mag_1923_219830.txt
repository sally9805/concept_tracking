Pride . The French , one remembers , are a gay and polite people , fond of dancing and light wines . Perhaps if they saw more of the English and American plays that are written about them they would be neither so polite nor so gay . At any rate , in most American drama , the French male character who is old enough to have a crpe-beard has , in general , the choice between just two roles . He is always noble , and if he does not display his noblesse oblige by pursuing the chaste young heroine around and around the room with the scarlet curtains , he devotes himself to lamenting the vanished glories of his ancestral chateau . <P> The Duc de Valmont , in Pride , by Thompson Buchanan , is of the latter or " Zem were ze grand old days " variety . His past was bright mauve - his manners impeccable-as Kipling puts it , " He was wild and he was woolly , and his pride was inordinate . " Moreover , he and the Duchess , ex-Susie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's accouchement , 20 years ago . She loved him-but he was a rou-oh such a rou ! - so she took her millions and their daughter ( his little daughtaire ' e ' ad not seen ' ardly at all ) and came to America , intent upon marrying daughter to a nice , clean-cut , young American millionaire , sans blue blood or indiscriminately amorous proclivities . <P> Well , that was all right , but what did the Duc do but turn up , broke , at the very hotel where everybody else in the cast was stopping , and start earning an honest living there as a waiter under the name of Henri Dupont ? And what did little daughter do but feel strangely drawn at once to the elegant waiter who reminded her so of the papa she loved ? And then , of course , there were two more acts , all full of complications . The Duc lied about himself like a French gentleman , and said he was n't the Duc-and the millionaire 's relatives cried : " Aha , our boy must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ! " - and there were scenes and lalas and all sorts of complications-and everything was about to come out on the front page of The Journal . Till the happy ending arrived , and the angel child joined her parents ' hands with " You mus ' each be good to ze othaire " and the young millionaire kissed papa on both cheeks and everything was jake . <P> This old-fashioned dramatic rocking-chair is creaky , conventional and labored , though some of its upholstery is not ineffective . Hilda Spong , Juliette Day and Fred Tiden , in particular , do their best with it-but they can not succeed in galvanizing the body more than momentarily . The French accents employed by the cast vary from the Swiss to the purely Chicagoan . The critics in general have received it tepidly- what praise they have accorded being rather for the work of individual actors than for the piece itself .
