Grossly Unfair <P> Sirs : <P> My subscription to TIME recently ran out . I do not wish to continue receiving your magazine . <P> Your treatment of the Democratic side of the present political campaign is to my mind grossly unfair . All Democratic leaders are referred to as bosses , and that elevated and altruistic gentleman , William S. Vare , is respectfully designated Senator . . . . <P> Further you seem to have a religious complex . The fact that Mrs. Nicholas F. Brady is a Roman Catholic has little or nothing to do with her qualifications as head of the Girl Scouts of the Nation . . . . <P> JOHN M. FLYNN , 2nd . <P> Philadelphia , Pa . <P> <P> " Yes " <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME of July 16 , a correspondent from Ohio says : " I wonder if Hoover has always held to the teachings of his Quaker fathers during all these years with the British . " Yes . <P> During his enforced residence abroad he was first and foremost a stalwart American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was an example . <P> It was my privilege to enter his service in August 1914 , to continue that work in England and in France for a number of years ; perhaps as long an association as any American woman . <P> He was exacting , in that he expected and demanded results . If one could produce them he never forgot it . <P> Is this not the same calibre of man that inspired his Quaker fathers to build their monuments ? <P> Thousands of my fellow countrywomen at home , and in France could not have accomplished our work had it not been for Mr. Hoover 's advice . It is with great pleasure that I can now offer him my thanks . <P> ISABEL STEVENS LATHROP <P> President of the American Fund for <P> French Wounded , 1915-1920 <P> London <P> Coward ? <P> Sirs : <P> While I am not a subscriber to your magazine , which I find very interesting except when it becomes flippant with religion , I often buy it at newsstands and have been impressed with your " inside " information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has perplexed me for some time . Unless my memory has failed me , it is ten or fifteen years since the Rev. William ( " Billy " ) Sunday , the famous evangelist , has been in New York . Now I think this would be a fine time for him to come to New York , because of the prohibition raids on " night clubs " and the presidential campaign . Can it be that he is afraid to come to New York , as I have heard ? I do not like to think that " Billy " Sunday would be afraid to meet the devil in his stamping-ground , New York , and yet it has been so long since he has been here that I would like to know the reason he has stayed away . It would be a good idea to have him debate with Al Smith and if he said he would , he would , not like Dr. John Roach Straton whom I previously admired . . . . <P> I will appreciate your answer to this question . <P> CARL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
