WHAT WE all feared is be- ginning to happen . The other day a man insouciantly driving a truck through Fifty-ninth Street suddenly found himself and his truck sinking through the pavement . Investigation brought to light the fact that that part of the island had been entirely excavated away and that the city had begun to cave in . We have consulted pessimists , who give us all about two weeks more to live . THE age-long struggle to make life more complicated than it already is has received another new impetus , this time from . Saks ' excellent store . The crafty managers , having discovered that for some years people have pursued the habit of saying " Hello " when answering a telephone , have determined to root out the evil . Anyone calling up the Fifth Avenue store is now greeted with " This is Saks &; Co. , Fifth Avenue . Good afternoon " ? or morning if it is earlier than 12 mt . OURSELF not a person of much account , we find balm in the reception accorded us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get us to our seat . At the door , a person dressed as Prince Nicholas or better took the tickets and said : " The available seats are to be found upstairs . " At the mezzanine , a pink youth in a wing collar smiled and metioned gracefully to continue climbing . At the top of - the stairs , in the dark , we heard : " The usher to the left will take care of you . " He did . He took the very best care of us the whole perilous journey . And when , a moment later , another sweet-smelling fellow leaned over and whispered : " Would you mind moving over one seat , please ? " it was more than we could bear  --  we handed him a five-dollar banknote and asked him , to send it immediately to the Rivoli box office with our compliments . OF COURSE one can not expect Justice and The Law to vary with every whim of fashion , but surely it is a sensible suggestion that our courts keep up , with progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Halls-Mills court-house holds about three hundred spectators , some two hundred and fifty of whom have paes , and fifty of whom either go to their seats at five o'clock in the morning or have a pull . So long as we have promoters and Madison Square Gardens aching to turn an honest million or so , it seems outrageous that the Stevens family can not be made a source of profit and pleasure while it is being judged . THE DECISION of that ingeni-ous divine , Dr. Straton , to help mankind along the thorny path by interpreting the trial for the Graphic is a sound one . It can not but awaken the respect of all who believe that the one thing this clergyman needs is cheap publicity and lots of it . GRADUALLY the working woman is selling herself to the business executive , and the old-fashioned employer who would " rather have a man any day " is fading out of the picture . They are doing it in different ways , it seems . One old-timer confessed to us that he had become converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we asked . " Well , " he said , " when I learned that the working girls ' home across the street from my house serves a seventy-five-cent dinner plus a twenty-five-cent gin fund tax I knew that women were n't what I thought they were . " InC omf ort NOVEMBER is a gay month in the life of our college clubs , more particularly in their great lounge rooms . Here any Saturday in November four or five hundred enthusiasts sit choking in their own smoke , listening to the rasping of a much amplified radio , shouting themselves hoarse when a mad young warrior runs a whole five yards in a stadium a hundred miles away . It is a colorful scene , so many well-shaven faces , THE NEW YORKER so many ' well-fed complexions , so many hearty voices telling each other why each could not get away to " go up . " Boys trot in and out bearing the trays which formerly supported the real thing , but now come with the accessories  --  seltzer , lemon and orange-juice , ice . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one more play before they are off . As the ball on the brilliantly lighted board gets near and nearer one end , the hum of the conversation rises , grows angry , roars . Nearer and nearer ... suddenly everyone is on his feet , the storm has broken , pandemonium , drowning the harsh magnavox . Then the ball jerks back to the middle , the storm subsides . The attendants are busier than ever . Everyone is made comfortable again . The announcer says that it 's beastly cold in the stands  --  and again the old grads start in telling each other why they could n't get away " today . " Majeste RR OYALTY 'S stock having soared of late , a certain titled lady in the city decided she would trade on her own rank one evening recently . She was bound for the theatre and found the dining-room in her hotel full . A venerable man with a young lad had just taken the only empty table . The lady swept up imperiously , paused beside the table and said regally , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter , the Princess P . Kindly allow us to take your table , as we really are in a frightful hurry . " " Certainly , Madame , " replied the gentleman , rising , " But allow me to introduce myself . I am God Almighty , and this is my son . Come , Adam " Rodeo THE RODEO , pronounced by Westerners and cowboys to rhyme with " toady 0 , " and by local intellectuals who want to be Mexican at all costs to rhyme with " today 0 , " has been filling Madison Square Garden with a healthy smell of tan bark , steers , calves , horses , and cowboys . What it is , is a wild west show with certain important differences , the most important of which is that the participants are amateurs . They are professional cowboys , right enough , but they are not professional showmen . Taken by and large the spectacle is not unlike the spectacle Colonel Cody used to give us , years ago , only more men risk their lives to accomplish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty seconds ; steers are wrestled with and thrown in less than twelve ; and bucking horses are stayed-on for indefinite periods . The scheme is a competitive one . After roundups in the Woolly West , the cowboys have the quaint custom of getting together and seeing who can do certain dangerous things in the shortest time ; and this is one of those gettings-together on a grand scale . People who know the cowboys personally tell us that there 's not much to choose between them in the matter of expertness ; all qualify . The difference lies in the horses they ride and the steers they bulldog , some of which are more cussed than others . The audience , which for the most part has been profoundly ignorant of life on the plains , has been highly diverted , less by the show at times than by the things that were n't in the show ; by the steer that refused to be driven out of the exit , the cowboy who got his trousers ripped , the incredibly conscientious brass band that kept playing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were meant to . In its genial way New York accepts the Rodeo without caring much what it is , so long as it is entertaining  --  which it always is , and which wild west shows always have been ever since Annie Oakley , the great lady sharpshooter , began contributing to their color . ANNIE OAKLEY , by the way , died in Greenville , Ohio , just as this present Rodeo was about to open . She was sixty-six years old . Her memory will live long among those who move in what was once her world . Her very name has become a part of New York 's vocabulary . A free ticket to anything is always called an Annie Oakley . Just why , no one knows . Some say it is because one day during the height of her fame she walked up to the old Garden without a ticket and , slopped by the gateman , said proudly , " But I am Annie Oakley ! " THE NEW YORKER and walked in . Others say it is because of the holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as though they might have been put there by bullets from Annie Oakley 's pistol . Silver Spoons THIS IS the time of year when all conscientious fall brides are doing their shopping , and we were not surprised to learn that one young couple requiring such mundane things as kitchen pots and pans decided to try Altman 's . The fact that asking for pots and pans in Altman 's is a good deal like asking for Camels at Dunhill 's has nothing to do with the story . The pair walked down the Avenue , turned in at a gray stone pile , walked through wide aisles where they noticed that the numbet of clerks outnumbered the buyers and were bowed into an elevator by a uniformed figure . Ascending , the conductor turned to them and murmured : " May I ask your floor , please ? " Brightly , the young couple announced in unison : " Kitchen utensils . " The elevator came to an abrupt stop , mid-floor . The custodian turned towards them haughtily . " This , " he announced , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Grand Opera Company that functions at Thirty-ninth Street and Broadway puts on as good an opera as one can find anywhere in the world at the present time . The organization is unfazable ; half the audience may be asleep  --  it does n't matter in the least . The Opera is much as it has ever been . There are certain subtle changes , of course . For one thing there is no more a gaping crowd of proletarians at the Thirty-ninth Street entrance , where society draws up in its limousine . There is now no parade to watch between the acts . There is no glamorous coming and going of swains among the boxes , no betweenthe-acts visits from handsome men in uniform , no light laughter and tapping of fans in recognition of witty sayings . Society , after coming in late for the sake of obscurity , sits somewhat heavily in its row of boxes and sneaks out again before the final curtain in order to avoid the rush . The swarming Opera House as a whole seems to belong to a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all want to listen to Opera or can stand listening to it , and that they have recently been washed and neatly dressed . THERE ARE people , however , THER have a more technical interest in the opera season , and their talk , it appears , centers around the new members of the company . For instance , this season , Miss Lerch , a pupil of Mme. Sembrich , is the singer who is most likely to be Talleyed if any Talleying is done . We hear that her voice is exceptionally " long " ? that is , she can sing high and low with equal ease  --  and Pennsylvania , as well as the Curtis Institute of Music , is behind her . Incidentally , she made her debut in last Sunday night 's concert . Not many of the other eleven new artists announced , however , will be blazoned in the Talley manner . Plans for the new sopranos are indefinite . Mine . Attwood , formerly a recital and oratorio soprano , has been singing in Italy and was heard last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wagnerian Opera Company of mixed memories , and has sung on the road with Mr. Hinshaw 's Mozart companies , and in light opera at the Irving Place Theatre . She also sang briefly in the movies . The predictions are that with her large repertoire of Italian and German roles , Mine . Fleischer will be the busiest of the new sopranos . Mine . Vittori , from St. Louis , did a good job with Mr. Gallo 's troupe awhile ago , and probably will be a Sawuzza this season . The only new leading tenor is Walter Kirchhoff , a Wagnerian of long experience in Central Europe and Spain , where , by the way , Wagnerian opera is always a best seller . He is not to come until the second part of the season , and it is always dangerous to venture predictions about German tenors anyway . Alfio Tedesco joins the tenor contingent for second business , and among the new baritones and basses are Messrs . Cehanovsky , Ludikar , Macpherson and Pinza . Signor Pinza is the most eminent and is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan . His age is somewhere around twenty-seven . Although Mardones is - " Home Tames , and do n't spare the horses . " 20 THE NEW YORKER rot retiring , Pinza will undoubtedly be given many of Mardones ' roles this year . United Hunts WHEN the seventh race was finished at a little before five o'clock on Saturday at the little Belmont track , the racing season came to a close in this neighborhood , and amateur and professional touts turned their faces south towards the isle of Cuba . It is extraordinary that there can exist within thirty minutes of Thirty-fourth Street as charming a spot as the track at Belmont Park terminal . The Great American Public has somehow overlooked it . The entire crowd on Saturday numbered but a few thousands , but it was big enough to fill the grandstand and adjacent areas to overflowing , to spread gaily up and down the track , and to cavort in charming fashion over the turf that stretches from the stand to the woods on the western boundary . A greater crowd would have spoiled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule ; at no time during the afternoon did cops appear and bellow in their inimitable manner . Hot dogs were sold informally in a tent , and there was a refreshing absence of restricted areas and special privileges . The fifth race , the twenty-eighth running of the 11eleadowbrook cup , was the race in which the majority were interested , though , of course , the professional bettors came for the fiat races , steeple-chasing being too uncertain a sport forr their palates . And it was a good race with a good finish , Mr. Sahota riding Burgoright strongly with plenty , to spare . Boxes were full , and celebrities had their pictures taken ; everbody wore fancy clothes , from Mr. Bowman , head of the United Hunts Association , but better known for his hotels , to Ambrose Clark . ? IT WAS such a blow to the vener- able members who witnessed the entry of a chorus girl into the Century Club the other day , that they were speechless and paralyzed until the young lady had got all the way in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get them , we understand , even though she had walked the first quarter-mile and had her fifteen cents . Esthetic Vandals NO DOUBT the vogue for American Antiques came before the opening of the Metropolitan American Wing ; but certainly the opening of that wing gave the fashion amazing strength . The rage overlooks nothing , and one of the bright spots it has discovered  --  and many enthusiasts are wending thither at present  --  is the warehouse of the Southard Wrecking Company on Ninth Avenue just north of Greenwich Village . Here these professional destroyers of landmarks have a large building in which they display the gems of architecture which they have gouged from various houses about the city  --  and one can go to these pleasant-appearing huns and buy genuine old mantels , doorways , bric-a-brac , panelling , flooring , and so on . From what we hear , we judge that none of the other wrecking companies bother to keep such a warehouse of antiques . As a rule the valuable portions of doomed houses are sold on the job , but this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with them . Among other things , they wrecked the old Stock Exchange , the downtown section of the old Astor House , the Colonial Sanford Mansion in Flushing , the Rockaway Beach Hotel , and the interiors of Bernie Baruch 's house , the William T. Leeds house on 11 East Fifty-sixth Street , the house of Canfield , the gambler , Mrs. Hamilton Fish 's house , and No. 1 Fifth Avenue  --  which seems to indicate that they are deviating from their original job of tearing down houses toward the more refined one of simply gouging the treasures from the insides of houses . The No. 1 Fifth Avenue crime was committed last year , and the old doorway with the number still on it reposes ghostlike against a pillar on the floor of the warehouse we speak of . King Edward VII , by the way , was entertained in that house when he visited us as the Prince of Wales , and the mantel-piece against which he leaned with his cup of English breakfast tea is among the relics that have been recently sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem , but prices of mantels range from fifty to fifteen hundred dollars . THE ENTRANCE to the South- " . ard place is impressive . Visitors are led back through piles of old lumber into an antique old wooden building . The dust of this and the last century lies on the floor . You go in the door and upstairs into a vast silent room filled with mantel-pieces , almost all of them genuine colonial . They are all that remains of a fast vanishing city . They are very beautiful and very depressing . Upstairs are the doorways and trim : the hideous mahogany cupids of Can-field 's gambling rooms lean against the exquisite pilasters of some old and obscure and vanished-forever Washington Square living room . It is a jumble worth visitinr . And on the word of those who say they know , it is an excellent place to buy your mantels if you are one of those sanguine individuals who bother to build themselves private houses in this transitory age . Solitaire /THIS same Canfield , by the way I ? or his legend  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We hear it said that an intimate of his , on being quizzed , declared that the solitaire game called " Canfield " had no connection with him . Canfield is said to have stated that to his knowledge there had never been a game of " Canfield " played in his house . The legend was that the player paid fifty-two dollars for the deck , receiving five hundred for winning the game ? and five dollars for each card out . " Tommyrot ! " Canfield is said to have said . " The salary of the men to watch the players would more than eat up the percentage for the house . " Soft Answer THERE IS , it seems , a young woman writer of promise whose services the Hearst periodicals are angling for . Efforts to converse with the young woman at her office were unavailing on a certain day last week , so the suave and courtly editor of the Cosmopolitan called her house on the telephone . Her mother answered . " Who is it ? " she asked . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truthful owner of the voice . " Oh , " said the mother , " we do n't want to subscribe to any more magazines . Good-bye . " Two Dollars Up WITH laboratories springing up above and behind half the drugstores in town , and signs in all the pharmacies advertising alcohol analysis at from $2 up , analytical chemistry may he said to be a booming business . We have been to a reputable chemist for information on the subject . He is a $10 chemist and it must , therefore , be presumed that he speaks with more authority than a $5 chemist . He explains that he has established the $10 ? fee because he considers the business " questionable , " and he provides the following information : Proper analysis consists of actual distillation , takes at least two hours and a half , and requires four ounces or more as a sample for test . Very seldom are anything but synthetic products submitted , apparently , so that many laboratories have become lax in their methods , often analysing the samples only by Tralle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity and may register 100 per cent , whereas the sample may actually contain only 30 per cent alcohol . On the other hand , the laboratories we patronize tell us that very few of the samples they receive contain any very serious toxic poisons . Occasionally small percentages of acetone have been found  --  probably due to redistillation of denatured alcohol  --  but even in those few cases the amount was not in dangerous quantities . Fifty-five per cent of the submitted samples in most laboratories is synthetic gin  --  a few drops of lemon juice , a few of oil of juniper , and cut alcohol . Soda pop , ginger ale and Pluto water bottles are the favorite containers in which samples are presented , we are told . AN AMUSING story we have ry heard seems to bear out our guess that many laboratories arc lax in - their methods . The chief owner of a large freight line plying between New York and Central America  --  straight through the rum belt  --  was presented with three jugs of Bacardi by one of his captains . Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful , and sent a sample to a leading chemist for analysis . What was his surprise to have the report announce : " Sample contains no Scotch Whiskey . It is entirely a mixture of alcohol , water , sugar , caramel color and Scotch ' extract . ' It does not contain any poisonous ingredients , but we do not recommend it as an internal medicament . " Furious , he confronted the offending captain with the report , but the latter 's indignation matched his so genuinely that he sent another sample to a more expensive chemist and for a fee of $15 was finally told that it was " an excellent quality natural Bacardi . " The last heard of the irate ship-owner , he was headed for the first laboratory with rum-shot eyes .
