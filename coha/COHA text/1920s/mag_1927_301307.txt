When wealthy city people move to the country for the summer , their homes , though usually closed , do not remain untenanted . The furniture may be clothed in white muslin dust suits ; only the window-buzzing of imprisoned flies may break the silence of the shaded rooms ; but in the vacant dwellings a host of people and personages continue their existence without regard to season-smiling the same smiles , making the same gestures , staring perennially in fixed directions . <P> To bring such a host of permanent residents to Fifth Avenue , Manhattan , has cost millions of dollars . There the " objects of art " in paint , marble , bronze , tapestry , are mostly by world-famed masters . Their owners go off summering comforted by thought of the heavy insurance policies , faithful watchmen , alert elevator attendants provided to protect the expensive stay-behinds . <P> Last week an interior decorator went to the Fifth Avenue triplex apartment of C. Bai Lihme , retired Danish-American zinc man . He was commissioned to remove some 16th Century Flemish tapestries which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class decorator , he knew he would see even finer things than tapestries at Mr. Lihme 's . He knew that in the Lihme drawing-room was the $50,000 " Portrait of an Old Man " which Peter Paul Rubens painted some 300 years ago , a patrician subject whose disdainful brow , thin smile and scornfully intelligent eye must have been a relief to the painter after his usual run of exuberantly plump females and amorous burlies . On the west wall of the same room would be a large canvas by Rubens ' sensitive pupil , Anthony van Dyck , showing the Marchesa Lommelini , a 17th Century Genoese beauty , and her two infants , piously gowned , posed beside a statuette of Christ . <P> The Rubens came to Fifth Avenue via the salons of princes and potentates . The Van Dyck , worth perhaps $200,000 , was one of a set of eight that were , until 1906 , the pride of the Palazzo Cattaneo ( Genoa ) for three centuries . <P> The decorator made known his errand at the Lihme apartment building to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalwart doorman ; and was formally admitted . He ascended to the Lihme floor , entered the apartment , halted , gazed awestruck . Gulping with astonishment he called back the elevator man , who summoned blue arms of the law , who brought detectives and newsgatherers in their train . Soon the Lihme apartment-once imposing , now dismaying-was filled with a buzz of talk , excited , threatening , incredulous , ominous . With the aid of stalwart Doorman Healy whose front changed from polite surprise to bitter penitence , the time was shifted back several days , the scene remaining the same . . . . <P> Doorman John Healy comes to work Sunday morning bringing a partly finished bottle of whiskey . He greets his colleague , George Tiernan , nightman , with the suggestion that they " kill the quart " before Mr. Tiernan goes home . They are bosom friends and two hours pass pleasantly while they rehash what has been their favorite conversational topic since the Lihmes left town , namely , the stinginess of " The Old Swede 's " ( Mr. Lihme 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two fine Irish elevator men to get an increase in pay .
