Smartest Parisians of the cercle du Ritz Bar were titillated and intrigued , last week , by news from Manhattan that General and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt seemed finally reconciled not only with their lanky ex-publisher son Cornelius Jr. , but also with their cherub-faced and rumpus-raising nephew Erskine Gwynne . <P> Son Cornelius Jr . is scarcely famed in Paris-having chosen California as his place to toil and go bankrupt publishing tabloid news organs . Therefore announcements that General Cornelius Vanderbilt had made available $2,257,000 to pay the California tabloid creditors ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) , were of relatively slight interest to such typical Paris tycoons as M. Henri Letellier , publisher of the world 's third largest newspaper , Le Journal . It was M. Letellier who employed , as his confidential and executive secretary until recently , the cherubic Erskine Gwynne . But tout Paris took keen interest , last week , at reports that Nephew Gwynne had actually completed a whole fortnight 's visit in Manhattan without doing anything outrageous , and had been received as persona grata by General and Mrs. Vanderbilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated publisher of The Boulevardier , a Paris smart-chart resembling Manhattan 's New Yorker . <P> Both Son Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr . and Nephew Erskine Gwynne have now repented their original sin of writing for the lurid , gumchewerish Hearst Sunday Magazine . It was son Cornelius Jr . ' s indiscretions in this blatant field which for years estranged his parents . Simultaneously Nephew Gwynne was writing from Paris a series which Hearst editors published as : " The Memoirs of Mrs. Jean Nash , by The Best Dressed and Most Extravagant Woman in the World . " <P> Prior to perpetrating such pap for gullibles , young Erskine Gwynne , son of the late famed international polo player Edward Gwynne , reamed high explosive shells in a French munition factory ( 1915-17 ) , soldiered in the A. E. F. ( 1917-18 ) , and worked his way around the world on cargo boats ( 1919-22 ) . Returning to Paris he found a berth with exquisite yet potent Henri Letellier . Of this Croesus among Paris publishers it is said on intimate authority that he owns 1,260 suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor cars , favoring Voisins . Le , tellier has been Mayor of Deauville ( which he launched as a smart resort with Eugene Cornuche ) , owns his own marque of champagne , keeps a smart racing stable , and draws most of his immense income from real estate scattered throughout Europe and South America , from oil fields in Mexico , and from Le Journal . <P> As secretary to Henri Letellier and occasional pinch-hitting director of Le Journal in his absence , Erskine Gwynne naturally acquired the bibulous intimacy with Le Monde Mondain which has enabled him to found and float The Boulevardier . Today he claims 7,000 subscribers , and a larger Paris circulation than the international Paris Comet , a rival smart-chart published simultaneously in Paris , London , and Manhattan . <P> Prior to sailing from Manhattan for Paris , last week , Nephew Gwynne said :
