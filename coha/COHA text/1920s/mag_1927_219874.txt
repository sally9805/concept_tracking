THE CABINET <P> Premier Raymond Poincar cabled Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon that France would like to pay the U. S. $10,000,000 on its War debt account . Mr. Mellon cabled back that the U. S. would be pleased to accept the handout . The payment will be made on June 15 , without prejudice to the ratification of the Berenger-Mellon debt-funding agreement which neither the French Parliament nor the U. S. Senate has yet approved . <P> The $10,000,000 will be France 's first payment on the War borrowings , although she is paying the U. S. $20,000,000 annually for the purchase of surplus War materials . The total amount of the French funded debt to the U. S. is $4,025,000,000.
