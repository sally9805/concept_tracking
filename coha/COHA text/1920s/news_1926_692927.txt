txt Following up his declaration yesterday that the Interborough 's suit against the Striking motormen and switchmen was intended to be " another Danbury hatters case , " with the company intent on seizing all bank accounts and property of the.sixty-two defendants , James L. Quackenbush , general counsel for the InterboroUgh , announced that the first step in the case was the impounding yesterday of the ten days ' , pay due the defendants amounting to about $2,500 . Mr. Quackenbush denied that the $239,000 suit against the new union was an effort to intimidate the strikers . He admitted that so far as he knew the action was the first of its kind brought by a public utility against a union and remarked that it would " set some precedents . " Reporters asked Mr. Quackenbush what the company expected to get out of the suit and whether it was not " a case of getting blood out of a stone . " " No , it 's a case of getting a farm out Of a fanner , " he replied , adding that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that others were engaged in business " on the side " and that some had bank accounts . Company to Seek Rights . " Will the company attempt to take the man 's farm from him ? " Mr. Quackenbush was asked . " Certainly it will , " he replied . When it was suggested that such a course might not gain much support in the way of public sympathy , Mr. Quackenbush said he saw no reason for sentiment in the case , that the sti " : ers had withdrawn the service they owed to millions of passengers ' and that the loss to the company precluded the possibility of a fund being established in the near future for a general.increase in wages . " The last time something like this happened , we sent 730 men to jail , " he , said , referring to the 1916 strike . " This time I 'll give them a little variety . I purpose in this matter to enforce every legal right the company has . This is not an idle gesture . The suit is not vindictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will let the law take its course and if they misbehave the law will be enforced against them . If the Amalgamated Union sticks its head up around New York some members will go to jail . Perhaps that accounts for their quiescence . " The suit has been brought to protect the rights of the public , which must come first under the contract made by the company and its men . " May Try to Bar Meetings . In this connection Mr. Quackenbush recalled the famous Danbury hatters case , in which the union lost its treasury and members lost their homes after ten years of litigation . He added that he might ask the court foe a temporary injunction to restrain all strike activities , including the holding of meetings . The Strike Committee declared they were not frightened by the suit and pointed out that the Interborough 's announcement that three strikers of the 698 who were dropped on Tuesday returned yesterday supported their claims that the great body of strikers would hold out even though they lost their jobs . " The suit is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement . " It shows , coming as it does on the heels of the ultimatum , to which we paid no attention , that the company must have these motorrah and powerhouse men back in order to work its road . " These motormen and powerhouse men would have returned to the company at any time In the past week if the company had recognized the new union , with a provision for arbitrating wage demands . The company knew that from the first . It realizes now , perhaps for the first time , that the men who went on strike are sincere in their belief that none of them will return to the I. R. T. so long as the brotherhood exists . " At the meeting of strikers at the Itlanhattan Casino last night . Edward P. Lavin. one of the I  --  aders told the gathering of 500 men that the suit of the I. R. T. was a " colossal bluff. - It was also made known at the Meeting that the strikers expected to have the services of " prominent legal talent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of the " legal talent " was not revealed . Lavin also announced that the strikers would establish a relief committee ? this morning . He said that outside financial aid had already been obtained but did not say whence it had come .

The vote , which was recorded on ballots distributed to transit workers all over the city , stood 7.685 in favor of the submission to 178 against , according to the announcement . Labor Head Sees Fight . Publication of news of the suit yesterday caused a flurry of excitement In labor union circles which had hitherto not been interested sufficiently to take part in the controversy . Joseph Ryan , President of the Central Trades and Labor Council , said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This suit is a notice to labor that It must push its fight to limit the Tights of the courts in injunction matters in industrial disputes . The right to a jury trial on all issues in a case like this ought to be and must be assured . " " It looks like a silly and transparent gesture , " said Samuel lIntermeyer in commenting on the injunction , " I do n't believe they can get that in ' junction , " said Henry P. Hunt , counsel for , labor unions . " Men on strike are entitled to persuade others to join them and they can not be held for damages . " Yesterday was pay day at the Interborough . Many of the strikers had pay for ten days awaiting them and called for it . No announcement of the extension of the Brooklyn service is expected from the Interborough for a day or two .
