txt A contest is on in the affairs of the Boston &; Maine pertaining to the proposed readjustment of the road 's financial structure . At the request of the voting trustees  --  representing 85,000 shares of common and preferred  --  a committee has been organized representing large Boston savings banks , insurance companies . leading banking interests together with a director of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad " to serve without compensation as a general committee representing bondholders and stockholders of the Boston &; Maine Railroad to decide upon and carry out a plan for the readjustment of the finances of the road. ? The so-called Loring plan has met with decided opposition from several quarters . A group of investment houses has sent out a circular to the savings banks requesting that before they commit themselves with respect to their holdings of Boston &; Maine bonds they communicate with them . These bond houses have for many years made a specialty of Boston &; Maine bonds , having sold millions of them to savings banks and investors , and take the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of the $87,000,000 bonds of the Boston &; ' Maine proper and for which it is responsible  --  outside of the $48,000,000 held by the government  --  are owned by savings banks . The protestants among the bondholders take the ground that they are asked to make a needless sacrifice , that those who have devised the plan are not giving due weight to the inherent rights poisessed by these bonds , and that the finances of the road are not sufficiently desperate to call - for any such drastic action ; that the road has heretofore surmounted difficulties involved in meeting : maturing indebtedness and that there is abundant reason to believe that with an improving business outlook , similar successful efforts can be made in the future to meet maturities . In 1920 the road took care of $8,200,000 maturing 4% bonds by getting the holders thereof to accept 50% in cash ( secured from the government ) and ' 50% in a new 6% bond . - Now , they say , it is proposed to - meet maturity difficulties by scaling down the interest of bonds paying in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not better than 6% , and at the same time asking such bondholders to consent to placing a prior lien ahead of them . It is not to be assumed that these protesting bondholders are opposed to all phases of the Loring plan . They . see much in it that is constructive zed courageous ; they Approve of the cutting off of unprofitable mileage so far as this can be done toward the benefit of the whole system . They appreciate that the road stands in need of improvement funds and a stronger credit position , but are as yet unconvinced that as holders of the prior lien they should be called upon to accept any sacrifice .
