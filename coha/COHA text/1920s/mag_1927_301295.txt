The interest of Spaniards in matters of sport follows the King . Therefore , last week , the presence of King Alfonso at Wimbledon was almost equivalent to a royal cheering section f r the great Spanish net star Seorita Lilli de Alvarez . His Majesty did not cheer , but he watched , animated . She , warmly beautiful , vivacious , and compellingly feminine , came up , last week , in the women 's singles finals against Miss Helen Wills . The contrast was between darting flames and scintillating ice . Serious , studious , book-writing , sketch-drawing Helen Wills seemed , in her stiff , skeletonized cap merely efficient . Seorita de Alvarez came out onto the court in . a brilliant red sweater and turban , took off the sweater , changed the scarlet turban to one of bottle green . If she won the match the world would have another Suzanne Lenglen , tempestuous , temperamental , a little spoiled , quite regal . <P> They played the first set without either young woman ever coming within 20 feet of the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed to have regained and even surpassed the magnificent speed and rallying power which she possessed before her operation for appendicitis . <P> During the second set Seorita de Alvarez suddenly switched from backcourt play to a furious storming of the net which had about it the flavor of a battle cry : " For King and Country ! " Soon Miss Wills had lost the third game , the fourth , the sixth , the seventh . Seorita de Alvarez led by one game and fairly scintillated pleasure . Throughout she had shown the full gamut of emotion whenever a point went for or against her . Europeans in the gallery warmed to approval of her frank spontaneity . Anglo-Saxons beamed pridefully upon the correct , emotionless , orthodox sportswomanship of Miss Wills . <P> Putting her strokes like pistol shots , Miss Wills took the eighth game , the ninth , the tenth . Then she was women 's singles champion at Wimbledon-and , by popular consent , women 's singles champion of the world . Not since Miss May Sutton ( now Mrs. Bundy ) won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. woman worn this supreme tennis crown . <P> As Miss Wills and Seorita de Alvarez walked off the court , the new champion chanced to be a step behind at the gate . Seorita Lilli de Alvarez smiled in friendly fashion , stepped aside , and gestured for Miss Wills to pass . " Queens first ! " she said . <P> <P> Tilden 's Loss . Famed William T. Tilden II , said after the Wills-de Alvarez match : " The last set was the greatest ever played between two women . " <P> Three days before , Mr. Tilden had watched Henri Cochet ( France ) defeat Francis Hunter ( U. S. ) in the men 's singles by 3-6 , 3-6 , 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-3 . " Precious few in the tennis world , " said Tilden , " could have beaten Cochet today . ... It was a glorious defeat for Frank . " <P> Two days later Cochet defeated <P> Tilden in the semifinals , 2-6 , 4-6 , 7-5 , 6-4 , 6-3 . Said Mr. Tilden : " Age , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of match myself . But are we downhearted ? No . " <P> Tilden is 34 . <P> Next day , Cochet took the championship by defeating his countryman , Jean Borotra , 4-6 , 4-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 , 7-5.
