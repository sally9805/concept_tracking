His Holiness Meletios Metataxis , Patriarch of Constantinople , has commended a movement for the adoption of the western Gregorian calendar for all civil purposes , and the kingdom of Greece has just instituted this notable reform , according to Greek papers from Constantinople , Alexandria and Athens . Strangely enough , Patriarch Meletios is willing that the Church remain behind the State in this matter , for he still recommends the Julian calendar for ecclesiastical purposes . ( The All Russian Church Council has just adopted the Gregorian calendar of the west . ) There is now a difference of 13 days between the two calendars . The Julian calendar , started under Julius Caesar , 46 B. C. , is 11 minutes slow each year . It was used by all Christendom , however , until 1582 , when Pope Gregory XIII abolished it and substituted the Gregorian calendar , which we now use . Protestant countries were slow to adopt the calendar because of hatred for Rome , Sweden being the last to adopt it , in 1753 . <P> Well-bearded Metataxis is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fondness for a good story and careful in his selection of cigarettes , the Patriarch is continually confronted with politico-ecclesiastical difficulties which make his exalted position none too secure . <P> One result of the fall of King Constantine , and the return of Venizelos to Greece has apparently been to enhance the prestige of Patriarch Metataxis in that country .
