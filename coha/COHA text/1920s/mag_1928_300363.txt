Affluent indeed would be a community where out of 20,000 Jews not one was poor . When last fortnight the municipal council of the little Polish town of Bydgoszcz claimed such prosperity , rejected a $100,000 legacy left to the town 's poor jews because there were no poor Jews , the potent , ubiquitous Jewish telegraphic agency sent a correspondent , investigated . <P> Interviewed was chief Rabbi Doctor Sonnenschein . He said that , alas , there were poor Jews , that the home for the aged was overcrowded , that $100,000 would bring sunshine ( which is what Doctor Sonnenschein 's name means ) to many an unhappy soul . Perhaps there was a trace of anti-Semitism in the municipal council ? But since the council 's word was evidently legally final , it seemed last week that no Jew , rich or poor , would enjoy part of the $100,000.
