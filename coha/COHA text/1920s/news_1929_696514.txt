txt Jewelry valued at ; 250,000 was stolen early today from Syditha Terrace , the West Beach Summer home of Mr. and Mrs. Sydney E. Hutchinson at Beverly Farms . The robbery was perpetrated by one man , obviously a professional and a connoisseur of Hems . The police believe it was the work of Arthur Barry of Worcester , a former member of the " Boston Billy " Williams gang , who was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison for stealing $86.000 worth of jewelry from the Long Island home of Jesse L. Livermore and escaped from Auburn Prison two weeks ago during the prison riots there . A general alarm for Barry 's arrest has been sent through Massachusetts and adjoining States . Just after 4 o'clock this morning Mrs. Hutchinson , who was formerly Edith Stotesbury , daughter of Mr. and Mrs. : Edward T. Stotesbury of Philadelphia , was awakened by the gleam of a flashlight in her eyes and scraping of a bureau drawer in her room . Looking toward the bureau , she saw a man rummaging among the contents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Mrs. Hutchinson was so frightened ' she could not utter a sound . Then she screamed at the top of her lungs . The sman fled . Mr. Hutchinson , hearing his wife 's screams , rushed into her room . His son , Edward S. Hutchinson ; his daughter , Frances Stotesbury Hutchinson , and his son-in-law , - John L. Tyson , joined him . In a few words Mrs. Hutchinson explained what had occurred . They ran out into the hallway to look for the burglar , but could find no trace of him . Neither could they discover how he had left the house . Mrs. Hutchinson 's jewel case lay open on the bureau , and while she hegan checking up on her gems Mr. 7-Tutchinson telephoned the police . it was found that the burglar had shown flawless judgment . He had taken only the best pieces , rejecting those of minor importance . His loot included a string of 139 matched pearls , each pearl ' of which was said to be worth $1,000 ; a blacelet valued at $13,000 , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robber . Not only did the thief show rare presence of mind in the manner in which he stood at the foot of Mrs. Hutchinson 's bed , selecting and appraising her gems. but he also i emoved a rifle which Mr. Hutchinson kept in the closet of his dressing room . After . taking out the cartridges , he placed the rifle upon a bed in a spare room . As soon as Chief of Police John S. Welsh of Beverly arrived he caused a thorough search to be made of the estate grounds . The police investigators found that the burglar had entered the house by climbing a waterspout to the top of a porch . proceeding thence through open French windows leading into Miss Hutchinson 's , room on the second floor . Patrolman Harold Marley , fingerprint expert at Beverly , obtained fingerprints from the waterspout and from the French windows . Hitt the prints were smudged and looked as if the thief had worn cotton gloves . A better time could not have been chosen for the robber 's purpose . A heavy fog blanketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the water to the edge of the estate and enabling a possible escape by boat . Necklace Worn at Yacht Party . The pearl necklace and other jewels , which Mrs. Hutchinson had worn to a dinner party , last Friday night aboard the yacht Aztec of Mr. and Mrs. A. C : Burrage off Manchester . were in a jewel case in one of the drawers of Mrs. Hutchinson 's ? bureau . The police believe that the ' robber knew Mrs. Hutchinson was going to the dinner and that during her absence he gained entrance to the house and laid plans ' for the robbery . . The house itself is a ' large one and one of the show places of the Beverly Farms district . After entering Miss Hutchinson 's room and ransacking it , the thief moved on to Mrs. Tyson 's chamber . There he took a diamondstudded watch and a diamond clasp pin . Mrs. Tyson was asleep at the time . but did not wake up . A dog lying at her feet also failed to waken . Going next to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin . But he overlooked $700 in bank notes lying in one of the bureau drawers . Mrs. Hutchinson had been asleep but a short time when the thief got to her room . Being a light sleeper . she awakened the instant the light flashed and the bureau drawer scraped . But in the dim rays of the flashlight she did not get a good look at the burglar and could give only a meager description of him . ' Unable to Check by Barry Picture . When shown a picture of Barry she was unable to identify it , saying she had seen only the robber 's back , with a momentary glimpse of his profile . The police believe the robber entered the Hutchinson estate from the water . This theory was borne out later today when Captain Fred Nelsbn of the Hutchinson yacht Cintra , anchored off the estate . reported that an outboard motorboat had passed . the yacht just after 4 A. M. , and said that he had felt the wash of the wake against the Cintra 's side . The similarity - of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the - Livermore robbery convinced police that it was the work of Barry . They learned . too . that a man answering Barry 's description had been seen in the vicinity for two or three days prior to the robbery. , Sees " Folly " In Valuable Gems . " How silly this all is. " said Mrs. Hutchinson tonight . " All this money in jewels that might as well have been paste . I am only thankful that nobody was ? killed or wounded by the prowler . I see only the folly in having such valuable jewels . " If my pearls had been paste nobody would have known the difference . That is. nobody except the burglar . He seemed to have the eye of an expert. ? He took only what was genuine and valuable and left all the rest . I ' am sure that nobody else could have discerned the difference . " The only piece I regret losing Is my engagement ring . Mr. Hutchinson gave- it to me twenty-five years ago , and for my twenty-fifth anniversary be had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one diamond for . every year we were married . -I sha n't Miss the rest of the jewelry much . ? : - " As a matter of fact , I seldom wear jewels . The last time I wore them was to a dinner on ? the Burrage yacht . Fortunately most of my jewels are in Philadelphia . All . in fact , except the-few pieces I brought here Ind ? expected to wear while summering here . " One instance of how , carefully the thief . Selected what he wanted is a watch I wear while shooting . It is just an ordinary man 's watch . ' and I carry it in my pocket . The thief absolutely ' ignored that . But he took my . blue . enamel watch , which was much more ' valuable . " It was a dreadful feeling to awake and see that man bending over my dressing table only five feet away from me . He was playing his flashlight over the dresser , and it reflected back from the - mirror so that I. could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head- is shaped .
