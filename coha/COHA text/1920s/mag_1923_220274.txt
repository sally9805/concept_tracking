The second Herrin trial is on . The witnesses for the prosecution and the defense have assembled , the jury is chosen and the judge has made his opening statement . Again the lines of battle in the class war are sharply drawn ; the zero hour is about to strike , and once more the nation will listen to the citizens of Herrin-farmers , strikebreakers , tradesmen , victims of the mob , union miners-as they reconstruct the massacre in which 22 strikebreakers and mine guards lost their lives . <P> It is mid-June in the mining town of Herrin , Illinois . There is a coal strike on and all the mines are shut down . It is peaceable , good-natured , loafing summer strike , with none of the strife and bitterness of the cold weather conflicts in the coal industry . At the Lester strip mine all is quiet . Then one day strangers begin to appear in the town . They come in motor trucks and by train . They are armed and wear police badges . Others follow them , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a day or two nothing happens , and then the mine guards begin to patrol the highways . They search passersby , they frighten women , they boast and are hardboiled , as professional scabs and company detectives usually are . <P> Suddenly there is great activity at the United Mine Workers ' Local . The miners see their strike jeopardized by the scabs , and the community terrorized by the mine guards . Fresh arrogance by the invading company detectives fans the flames to hatred . The miners begin to arm , a group of them ambush a truck full of guards coming from Carbondale and kill three . It is the overt act of class warfare . <P> Before the sun is down the miners have organized and surrounded the Lester strip mine . They fire hundreds of shots into the company sheds and freight cars , where the strike breakers and guards have intrenched themselves . But the beleaguered defenders are equipped with machine guns and three union miners are riddled early in the action . Night falls and the besiegers creep closer-to within forty yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown up by a steam-shovel and wait for daylight to finish their bloody work . <P> Meanwhile Colonel Sam Hunter from the Adjutant General 's office in Springfield comes to town . He gets in touch with Hugh Willis , official of the Mine Workers ' Local , and tries to arrange an honorable surrender with immunity . Willis replies evasively , but " thinks it can be arranged . " The defenders are telephoned and told to wait for a " white flag and a union official motor car . " They wait until sunup , but neither flag or motor appear . So they raise their own white flag , and trusting the shouts of the union miners promising them immunity , surrender in a body-45 strikebreakers and 25 mine guards . Down the dusty road they march , prisoners , promised immunity according to the ethics of war . <P> But class war has ethics of its own , it seems . One Otis Clark harangues the mob . He calls for the death of every scab , prisoner or not , to " stamp out the breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle he leads away McDowell , the one-legged superintendent of the mine into the woods . McDowell 's mutilated body is found hours later .
