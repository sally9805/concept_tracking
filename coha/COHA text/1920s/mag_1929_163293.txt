Since last winter Curtiss Flying Service , as sales agents for Curtiss , Curtiss-Robertson , Cessna , Ireland , Command-aire and Sikorsky planes , has been advertising with confident emphasis : <P> Sikorsky Amphibian-the world 's safest airplane . <P> Over half a million miles-and still flying . <P> Lindbergh on schedule to the minute . <P> It is the safest airplane in the world . <P> <P> The plane with a distinguished waiting list . <P> The unprecedented demand for the Sikorsky Amphibian forces us to announce regretfully our inability to fill new orders for . . . months . <P> Financier Clement Melville Keys , who controls Curtiss Flying Service , has been trying to buy Sikorsky Aviation Corp . for some time , to merge it with what has become Curtiss-Wright Corp . <P> Inventor Igor I. Sikorsky , vice president of the company , has tried to sell to Flying-Publishers Robert Rutherford Mc-Cormick and Joseph Medill Patterson . <P> Businessman Arnold Gushing Dickinson , president of the company , did sell it last week-to United Aircraft &; Transport Corp . President Gordon Sohn Rentschler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Frederick B. Rentschler of United Aircraft &; Transport , had outbid Mr. Keys and others . The price was about $2,500,000 in United stock . <P> For United the deal looked wise . It lines up one of the best planes in the world with other United subsidiaries-Boeing , Vought , Hamilton Metalplane , Pratt &; Whitney motors , Pacific Air Transport , Boeing Air Transport , Stout Airlines. * Whether Curtiss Flying Service , a subsidiary of United 's competitor Curtiss-Wright Corp. , will continue to sell Sikorsky planes was last week unannounced . <P> Inventor Igor I. Sikorsky was in Europe , last week when the deal was announced . If any one had told him six years ago when , a Russian immigrant , he founded his U. S. company , that in 1929 it would bring $2,500,000 , he would have believed it . He has never lacked self-confidence . In Tsarist days he was his country 's foremost aeronautical engineer . He designed the world 's first successful multimotored plane ( a four-motor job , 1913 ) , flew the first multimotored seaplane ( his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the first heavy air bombardments of the War . <P> Founding a Sikorsky company in the U. S. was to him a matter of course and selfesteem . He wants no anonymity of accomplishment . But he does not like business details . He is primarily an engineer . Many a Sikorsky order , many a deal , has been delayed by Inventor Sikorsky 's futile enthusiasm for improvement , remodeling . He is almost the last of the big independent designers to succumb to the industry 's merger movement . <P> <P> * Sikorsky 's preferred spelling . Amphibian is more generally used . <P> * Pacific operates along the Pacific Coast , Boeing from San Francisco to Chicago , Stout from Chicago to Cleveland . United intends this autumn to extend its transcontinental passenger service to New York , creating a San Francisco-New York fly of 30 hours .
