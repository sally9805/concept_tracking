txt The Army football team which found its power in the rough and tumble tie game with Harvard last week and the Yale team which has yet to make a similar discovery , will meet in the Yale bowl . Saturday afternoon , carrying on a pleasant feud which began some years before any of the present combatants were born . inis Will De /110 , 111111y . Yale game since 1593 . The general supposition is that the Army will win for the sixth time because the cadets , in the latter half of their game , Pushed the sturdy Harvard chaps resolutely out of their way . The Army line is composed of six foot soldiers in ' all positions but one , the exception being Loren Hillsinger of Syracuse . N. ie. , at right guard , who parts his hair only five feet ten inches above the ground . He is also the lightest man on the front , weighing 175 pounds . and this array of virility from end to end is held in great respect in these parts at this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reputation . Walsh Coaches Yale Line . The altitude of the Yale line dips under six feet in three positions of the starting lineup , but the average weight of these boys Is about 187 pounds , only one pound less than the ' average weight of the Army line . But up to this time they have Inspired no noticeable awe in this football Qom . ' inanity , notwithstanding the diligentil coaching of Adam Walsh . the great Notre Dame center of recent fame . Yale 's line was the weakness of the team throughout the unhappy season of 1928 , and for all the boys have shown to the contrary thus far this year time their weakness now . Moreover , their coach , Mr. Mal Ste- , earn the way of them . In fact , it ? has been reported that Mr. Stevens finally despaired of teaching his lads Mr. Warner 's shrewd shams and feints and ' returned to the simple , guileless style of onslaught for which Yale hazy been famous , one way or another , according to varying fortunes for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explaining that the boys merely learned to do these tricks so well that they no longer falter or ponder in the doing , running them off so fluently that the observers have been deceived , Predict Loose Game . , Ho even states that , far from re. , calling his Wing backs , he has taught the lads still more confusing movements to be exectued from the wing back formation ; also one hears from other sources in New Haven this evening that Yale will flip the ball from hand to hand , forward , backward , and laterally , ln  --  an ' exceedingly loose and elusive manner , Saturday afternoon . Yale has really had only two games thus far , losing to Georgia , 15 to 0 , and winning from Brown last Saturday , 14 to 6 . There had been a sort of game with Vermont to start the season , but Yale won , 89 to 0 , and for Purposes of criticism , rating or analysis , this one was no contest . Booth Triple Threat Man . Albert Booth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chris Cagle , the captain of the Army team , as one of the three most elusive young men playing in the east , will not take the field at the start of the game , but undoubtedly will replace Charles Snead before long . lie can kick , throw , pass and drift through scattered tacklers with a halting stride , but thus far in his throwing the ball too often has gone to spots where no one from Yale happened to be , like a letter addressed to " Anybody , Esq. , Somewhere , U. S. A. ? The three regular backs on the Army side are durable , audacious , and crowded with energy . ' Cagle not only runs and passes , but has been scything down the tacklers on interference for Murrell and O'Keefe . O'Keefo carries the ball only often enough to require surveillance , and put in most of his time on the offense dropping himself into the enemy line where he seems to go off like a bomb . with Murrell hammering after him for gains .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
