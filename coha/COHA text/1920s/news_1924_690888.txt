txt Uncle Sam as the spendthrift heir ruefully contemplating his alienated ancestral acres is a familiar picture . It is not , however , the picture which emerges from Professor B. H. HIBBARD 'S . " A History Of the Public Land Policies " ( Macmillan ) . There has been no one policy or line of policy . The alienation of our vast public domain has been carried out under the sway of a vague idea modified by expediency . The dominant thought has ' been that the land was there for the use of the people , and that " free land " was conducive to democracy by promoting the wide distribution of property . Our historic two-dollars-per-acre was only in minor part a desire for revenue . The chief pui-pose was to make land speculation harder . Up to a generation ago . the standing theory was that land existed to be occupied and exploited , and virtually the only method contemplated was through private enterprise . " Conservation " is a newcomer . The great estate has not been wholly " squandered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1853 Uncle Sam acquired 1,400,000,000 acres . He has today about 270,000,000 acres . ' We have 161,030,000 acres in the forest reserve , 41,000,000 in mineral reserve , 35,000 in Indian reservations , 15,500,000 in reclamation reserve , more than 7,000,000 in national parks and 2,500,0000 in wate-miower sites . Virtually this public domain is included within ten mountain and coast States , with barren Nevada counting for little . The public lands would comprise about one-third of the area of these ten States , and would exceed by twenty thousand square miles the combined area of France and Germany . In the fifty years after 1873 the Government sold 603,000,000 acres of coal ; it retains nearly 35,000,000 . . The oil reserves are 6,417,000 acres . Agriculture is possible , and may some day be desirable , within the forest area ; and reclamation , though somewhat unpopular at the present moment under the new philosophy of crop limitation and high prices , is by no means doomed . About one-sixth of the domain , therefore , remains ; and for this considerable remnant a policy is emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that settled the Great West . Public utilization with a view to the needs of the country as a whole , and the long-distance needs as opposed to the immediate demand , makes up the new principle . It is from this new standpoint that criticism is usually directed against our earlier land policies as a story of waste and fraud . WILLI ... pit ALLEN WHITE has ' had a good deal to say about the ' buccaneers " Who followed in the wake of the pioneers . Professor HIBBARD is more restrained . The railway land grants were " sadly mixed with fraud . " Perhaps we could have got on without the land grants . Yet " we have tile railroads , " and the farmers have most of the de " sizable railroad land , having paid little " more for it than they would have paid " other speculators . " Not so much can be said for the forests which have gone mainly into private hands , though the remaining quarter of a million square miles of timber land is being wisely administered . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreed . The question is whether the buccaneer should be described as following in the wake of the pioneer or as . being part - and.parcel of the . pioneering movement , an unavoidable element in the conquest of a half continent . Professor HIBBARD 'S book is dedicated to FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER of Harvard , discoverer of the American Frontier . Could the frontier have exercised its extraordinary influence on our national history if it had failed to be precisely a blue-printed , regulated conquest , but a helter-skelter , rough , instinctive occupation marked by much waste , much violence , ? a good deal of fraud and a vast individual energy ? BOONE , JACKSON , LINCOLN and ' the Argonauts do not quite fit into a picture of Conservation . But the frontier is gone and with it the policies inevitable in a border civilization . America has- grown up and should Conserve where once it spent lavishly . Pioneer ethics are no longer tolerable in a settled community . For the oil leases of today we must demand a higher moral standard than for the land grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
