How it Came About . Not until late last week was it clear " what caused the strike " ( TIME , May 10 ) in the sense that the assassination at Serajevo may be said to have " caused " the World War . <P> It appears that when the Government coal subsidy expired a fortnight ago , the Coal Owners ' Mining Association pasted up notices which , in legal sense , were no more than offers of employment to miners at a reduced wage scale . The Coal Miners ' Federation interpreted these " offers " as " lockout notices " - presumably on the theory that , since the miners had announced that they would not work for less than the wage in force under the subsidy , they were automatically " locked out " by the offer of a lesser wage . On this basis , the Miners ' Federation ordered the " coal strike , " as distinguished from the " general strike . " <P> Meanwhile the British Trade Union Council announced plans for a " general strike , " to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockout " notices-the purport of the Council 's manifesto being , of course , a threat to strike unless employment was offered to miners at a higher rate . <P> At this point the emotional tension was rising , and both workers and employers were exasperated by the attempts of their adversaries to put an interpretation on the " notices " which would win public sympathy to themselves . For the moment , however , Premier Baldwin was still so hopeful of a peaceable settlement that he personally wrote out a memorandum of suggested peace terms , and left it with the Labor leaders while he conferred in a nearby room with his Cabinet . <P> Into the Cabinet session was brought news that the printers employed by the Daily Mail had struck rather than print an anti-labor editorial ( TIME , May 10 ) , thus attacking a " right " which most Englishmen consider fundamental : " freedom of the press . " The Cabinet decided , on the basis of such evidence as was at its disposal ( naturally an unguessable quantity to outsiders ) , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the instigation or with the approval of the Trade Union Council . Upon this premise , a further decision was made and announced : that negotiations would not be resumed with the Labor leaders until they withdrew their general strike program . <P> The Cabinet then left its council room . The door was locked . When members of the Trade Union Council subsequently sought admission , " the lights were out and no one was within , " according to the statement of J. H. Thomas , conservative and well-to-do Labor leader . Rebuffed , the Trade Union Council proceeded with the " general strike , " denied that it had ordered the Daily Mail strike . <P> Muddling Through . So complete was the paralysis of the English press as a result of the general strike , that many London firms with branches in the U. S. were kept informed of what was happening in England by cablegrams from Manhattan summarizing the newspaper accounts published in the U. S. <P> The British Government issued an official four-page daily , the British Gazette , priced at a penny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . In the first issue of the Gazette , the public read :
