Rembrandt 's wonderful light has been revealed glowing beneath the dust of centuries , a famous panel lost for nearly 400 years . It was part of a sale at auction in Prague , and was discovered by Dr. Gustav Weil , collector , through an obscure Persian inscription and a signature almost buried in grime . The " light that never was on land or sea " was painted by Rembrandt , if by any one . His pictures glow with a peculiar mellow intensity that can hardly have existed in the actual scene before him . While the light from Rembrandt 's brush falls on them , they are people in a dream , creatures of imagination as much as Hamlet , Pickwick , Lear . If the light were turned out there would remain only burgomasters , doctors , old women paring their nails , painted with marvelous , sometimes brutal , truthfulness to actual life in 17th century Holland . In the panel recently discovered , which represents the marriage of Alexander the Great with Roxane , five sources of light are introduced- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evening sun from an invisible window to the left fall on Roxane and the court ladies . Daylight enters at a door and an open window above . Lamps glow dimly in the background . A sacrificial fire , tended by priests , flares duskily at the right . Rembrandt van Rijn ( 1606-1669 ) , greatest of the Dutch School , was born to wealth , married to an adored wife , Saskia , but ended in the bankruptcy court , a widower . The charming Saskia was the subject of countless pictures . A new art center , which will contain no school of instruction , will be established in Paris , as a gathering place for American artists in France . The site will be the Hotel de Lausun , a large and fine building on the He St. Louis , in the Seine . The purchase will be arranged by the National Academy of Design . In the opinion of Edwin M.
