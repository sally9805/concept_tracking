Michigan is a state that has voted dry by substantial majorities several times since 1916 . Previous to that it was rapidly becoming dry by local option . Senator Couzens virtually threw his gauntlet in the face of this sentiment by declaring that 5% beer was neither worse nor more intoxicating than tea or coffee . <P> Senator Couzens , Canadian by birth , a former business associate of Henry Ford , a former Mayor of Detroit on a reform platform , has enough money to be independent of " ward " politics-and has the reputation of exercising that independence . Governor Groesbeck appointed him a few months ago to succeed to the mud-beslung seat of former Senator Newberry . If Senator Couzens hopes to continue in office he must stand for re-election next year . <P> Yet he dared to tell his dry state that he believed : <P> 1 ) That beer of from 21/2 to 5% alcoholic content is not intoxicating . <P> 2 ) That no more attention should be paid to the Anti-Saloon League than to " any other group of lobbyists blindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> 3 ) That he is glad that the saloon is gone , and he has no desire " to violate the 18th Amendment or to let down on law enforcement . " <P> 4 ) But that the Anti-Saloon League is " going far afield " when it attempts to say that any beverage with over one-half of one per cent , alcoholic content is intoxicating . <P> The Anti-Saloon League replied by declaring that the Senator had " abused " it , and by intimating that he was " interested in the return of booze . " " I will go sled length in showing up the kind of men who are running the League While I have not exactly made up my mind to run next year , the attitude of the Anti-Saloon League has pushed me a long way toward an affirmative decision . ... The Anti-Saloon League is a powerful organization . It raises hundreds of millions of dollars to bulldoze Representatives and Senators into carrying out their will . The Devil also has a big organization ... "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
