txt The Citizens ' Committee of One Thousand , the formation of which was announced on Wednesday by Lewis E. Pierson , President of the Merchants ' Association , began yesterday its work of getting signatures to a. petition to the Board of Estimate to break the deadlock between that body and the Transit Commission and begin the construction of new subways . The committee opened headquarters at 280 Broadway with six rooms in.its suite of offices , and Frank D. Waterman . President of the Waterman Pen Company . its Chairman , announced that 18,000 petitions had been sent out , and that ten of these bearing about 200 signatures each , had already been returned . The first signer of the first petition to be returned was Ernest Twyeffort of Twyeffort , Inc. , tailors , of 580 Fifth Avenue . Mayor Hylan , announcing in advance that . he would refuse to be driven by " a specious petition to accede to the demand of the traction interests , " attacked the Merchants ' Association as a propagandist of the " traction manipulators " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He inveighed against Mr. Pierson , and asked why the latter had not tried to get the transit companies to put on more trains to relieve the crush , or had not supported the Mayor 's demand to ' get ' a sPeCial session of the Legislature in .... an:attOrnpbto get power for the city to run its own bus system .. . Asks nylon to " Cut Out the Bunk . " Mr. Waterman declined . to get into an argument with the Mayor . and declared that the trouble with the whole transit situation was that there had been too much mud-slinging and too little action . He quoted a speech made by Mr. Hylan in 1913 , before he became Mayor , advocating immediate construction of the Brooklyn crosstown subway . He urged the Mayor to " cut out the bunk , " co-operate with the Transit Commission and build new subways . Earlier in the day Mr. Waterman issued a statement announcing his acceptance of the chairmanship of the Citizens ' Committee of One Thousand , which he said really ought to number one million . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does n't get them in a hurry it wo n't be a fit place to live or work or do business in , " he said . " The only reason that I can think of why I was asked to be the Chairman of the committee is the fact that I lodged an individual protest against the delay in building subways as long ago as last March . After the Merchants ' Association put out Its report on the transit situation last winter I wrote to the President of the association and told him that it was n't enough to issue reports . " The people of this city do n't need any charts or statistics to tell them that they arse being herded like cattle in the subways , and I suggested that the Merchants ' Association do something to crystallize public opinion to start the construction of new subways . " At present I have n't any clear idea as to who may be responsible for the long delay in giving the city the new subways that it needs , but I do know that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for approval two routes which will relieve the present crowding when they are built . If the Board of Estimate approves those routes plans can be worked out at once and digging started . Appeals to Every Subway Eider . I want every subway rider in the city who feels as I do to join me In petitioning the Board of Estimate to give that approval , not next month or next year , but right away . The only way we 'll ever get new subways is for all of us to stand up and shout for them . " No other- town or city in the country would put up with the crowding that we New Yorkers are forced to face twice a day in our subways . If this was a question of buying a new trolley for Toonerville there would be a town meeting , the townsfolk would . cuss out the service , vote for another ' ear " and settle the whole question then and there . Here in New York we have been fussing around for ten years and while we have heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new subway authorized since 1913 . " The Committee of One Thousand is sending petitions out today all over the city , with room for twenty people to sign on each petition . We shall send these petitions to every office , every facunionevery city . church and every labor in the " We 'll send these petitions to any man or woman . in New York who wants to do a little missionary work of their own and get their neighbors to sign . We are being . very careful - not to get into any side-issues . In this petition we do n't ask the Board of Estimate to decide any questions of policy except . the one question of getting subway digging started at once . ' The , petition is addressed to the members of the Board of Estimate and asks them to take steps for the construction of the proposed Brooklyn crosstown and Washington Heights subways at once . Text of the Petition . The petition reads : - . , " We respectfully urge that yea* sut , Once meet , approve and vote the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' new Brooklyn crosstown subway and the extension of the Broadway subway in : . Nia.nhattan from Fifty-ninth Street north to Washington Heights and the ' Bronx . " By relieving present subways of ' part of their load , these new lines will reduce crowding in every other subway . " We understand that you and the Transit Commission are practically agreed that these two lines should be constructed to afford relief , but that differences of opinion have caused you to withhold approval and funds . ? " We do not express ourselves at this time for or against the idea of turning the operation of the subways over to the city . " That question can be decided while the new lines are being built . " We asa , in justice to a suffering public , that you start the digging of now subways at once . " " The way to get anything in the world is to ask for it . " Mr. Waterman said . " and the more people who ask the Board of Estimate to start digging subways the quicker the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Estimate has approved these routes , the Transit Commission delays preparing Its plans , the Committee of One Thousand will then get after the Transit ' Commission . " The Committee of One Thousand wants the help of every clergyman and every rabbi who believes that the indecent crowding in the subways is bad for . the morals of the aammtinitY . " It wants the help of tracry physician in the city who believes that subway crowding spreads sickness and disease . It also wants the hell ) of the labor lead , ers of New York , because this is a movement to help the men and women who must travel to work in the rush hours . " Hylan Attacks the Movement . ' Mayor Hylan , in his statement commenting upon the formation of the Citizens ' Committee of One Thousand , said : " The New York World and other traction newspapers have given much space this morning to the latest manoeuvres of the traction interests appearing in the form of a petition to be circulated by Lewis E. Pierson of the : Merchants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagandists of the traction manipulators and which has always stood with ears cocked to receive and carry out the orders of the traction interests . " Mr. Pierson is employing a weatherbeaten smoke-screen to camouflage the people when he asks the abused traveling public of this city to sign petitions to build the crosstown subway in Brooklyn and the subway in Washington Heights . Mr. Pierson knows that both these proposed routes are in the Board of Estimate 's plan , and he has full knowledge that the State Transit Commission-has come around to the city 's way of thinking as - to the necessity of these routes , and that a committee of the Board of Estimate and Transit Commission Is now giving consideration to their establishment . " Every member of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment is for subway construction , but will not permit anynew subway construction to be seized by the tentacles of the traction octopus . The Brooklyn crosstown and Washington Heights routes are now being worked out , but their completion would take at least three to four years , There is no need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of this city . The adoption of two simple expedients will furnish that relief . Mayor Attacks Subway Schedules . " Mr. Pierson knows that one of these expedients is the rearrangement of the existing traffic schedules on the subway . These schedules at present deprive nine-tenths of the riders of a seat almost throughout the entire day . The subway operators take off cars and sometimes whole trains , crowding the people in a most deplorable manner . until the traveling public has reached a point of exasperation where it is ready to swear vengeance against anybody . Mr. Pierson of the Merchants ' Association , who is in sympathy ik'ith the traction interests , is now going to ask these peeale , made desperate by the jamming , Iteraing and crushing due to the cur-. i , alled operation of trains . to sign petitions to do something that is already being considered . This is all a camouflage to prevent the doing of something that can be done without delay , namely , a proper rearrangement of train schedules and the installation of an adequate system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief to the people . Why does Mr. Pierson not devote his efforts to urging the Trailer , commission to order the subway operators to put on additional cars earlier in the day , retain additional service throughout the day , and not take off trains of cars a few moments after the peak loads of the rush hours have passed ? The frightful congestion created by the traffic schedules on our subways increases the private profits of the subway operators , and toward this end the Merchants ' Association has never hesitated to lend its assistance . " Mr. Pierson also knows that the suta face transit requirements of the people of this city can be relieved within thirty days if the Legislature will permit the municipal ownership and operation of a , city-wide bus system , which will make Possible decent and adequate surface transportation at a 5-cent fare . " Did anybody hear Pierson or his Merchants ' Association utter a whisper when the courts decided to stop the operation of the bus lines ? Did anybody hear Pierson or his Merchants ' Association raise its voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people buses , made necessary by that court action ? " I refuse to be driven by Mr. Pierson through the instrumentality of a specious petition or otherwise to accede to the demands of the traction interests with which he and his associates sympathize . No more franchises , and in particular the *50,000,000 bus franchises , are going to be wrested from the people of this city so long as I have the official power to prevent such a robbery . " Waterman Ignores Bus Issue . The bus question and the subway question are two entirely different matters , " Mr. Waterman said . " I should hate to think that the Mayor Is trying to confuse the people of the ** by giving them the idea that there is any connection between the question of providing more buses and the question of providing more subways . " The trouble with the whole proposition is that there has been too much political argument and too much mudslinging , and too little action . I am not going to debate and I am not going to sling mud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of One Thousand I am going to keep asking Mayor Hylan every day to start digging subways . In his statement , the Mayor intimates that there Is an agreement between the Board of Estimate and the Transit Commission on the two new subways which he wants them to dig ; but the Mayor does not say in his statement that he will give his approval irn mediately and start the shovels going . " I am not a politician , or a traction magnate , or a plutocrat , but a plain , ordinary , everyday merchant of New York City ; and looking back over the record , I want to say to the Mayor that , like hundreds of thousands of my fellow-citizens , I am getting awfully tired of promises of relief that never comes , Quotes Hylan in 1913 . " Back in 1913 , Mayor Hylan was doing Just what I am trying to do now . He was tryingato get more subways for his fellow-citizens . " On Oct. 8 , 1913 , Judge Hylan , representing the Allied Boards of Trade of Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing at City Hall and asked them to build the Brooklyn crosstown subway which we are now asking Mayor Hylan to do . Here is what Judge Hylan said , and l am quoting exactly from the official record : Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the commission : There is little need of my taking up the time on the needs for a crosstown subway . I have talked about it for the last two or three years and we are pleased to note that the commission as now constituted , with Commissioner McCall as Chairman , are recognizing the necessity of the Eastern District and the Greenpoint section . The people of Greenpoint and the Eastern District will be glad when this subway is built . We hope that the commission will not alone put it on the map , but that as soon as possible the work will be started , because there is no other line in Brooklyn that will be of ? more importance or of greater benefit to the people of Brooklyn than the crosstown subway line , and I wish at this time to commend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crosstown subway applause , as well as all the other people that have been interested in it . We hope that the commission will go right along and in . the very near future that the people of Greenpoint and the Eastern District section , Astoria , and those other sections so much in need of transit will have the privilege of riding on a subway line . ' Applause . " Mayor Hylan has been Mayor more than five years . He has had the power for more than five years to get work started on the Brooklyn crosstown subway . And we are not any nearer to that Brooklyn crosstown subway than we were ten years ago when Judge Hylan made this plea before the then Transit Commission . " -I always believe.in giving other men the benefit of every doubt , and I am going to assume that Mayor Hylan is a friend of the people , because he says he I. " in his statement . he said that he did not want to turn the new subways over to the big traction interests ( whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is delaying the construction of new subways . " He also said in that very statemen that it would take three or four years to build these new subways . " Let me , then , ask Mayor Hylan. as man to man , why he can not start digging these subways now and settle the question of how the subways shall be operated while they are being built . It is n't a friendly act to the people of New York to make them wait two or three years longer than necessary for ' their new subways . " All the various questions of policy can be decided at the same time the subways are being dug . The new subways will have to be built , whether they are operated by the city or whether they are operated by private , companies . " Mayor Hylan also says that present conditions can be improved by running more trains in the subways during the rush hours . At the present moment I do n't know whether this is true or ' not , although I do n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the subway trains in New York in the rush hours operate on a shorter headway than any other railway in the world and that if we put any more trains Into the subways in the rush hours they will bump each other . However , I am writing a letter today to the head of the Interborough Subway and the head of the B. R. T. and to the Transit Commission and asking them whether there is any way to get more trains into present subways . If there is , the Committee of One Thousand will ask the companies and the Transit Commission to provide these extra trains just as earnestly as it now asks the Mayor to dig more subways . " I think it is possible for the Mayor and myself to get together as man-toman and cut out the bunk , and I can promise him that the Committee of One Thousand will work with him just as quickly as it will work with any one else who is willing to help the people of this city get some relief from the unbearable conditions in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine men until this morning to decide whether they would serve on the executive Committee and would announce the members of the Executive Committee after its meeting at eleven o'clock . Frank . Presbrey , who has accepted the vice-chairmanship of the Committee of One Thousand , declared that every adult in the city should sign the petitions . " It is appalling to think that , in spite of the present rush hour conditions , a year from today at least 150 , - 000 more passengers will be carried in the subways than are carried in them now , " he said . " That increase will be more than duplicated each year during the five years that must elapse before we can bring new subways into operation . In five years from now each day will see the subways of New York City carrying from 750,000 to 1.000,000 more passengers than they are carrying now . " In replying to the Mayor , Mr. Waterman said that the committee would not be drawn into any political or personal discussion with the Mayor , ana would not permit public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Board of Estimate now have the power to give the people more subways.
