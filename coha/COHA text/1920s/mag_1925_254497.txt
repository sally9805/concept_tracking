Evidences of public disapproval of the so-called " third degree " multiply . In Vermont , Governor Billings has just signed a bill which provides that the " third degree " shall not be " administered " to a person suspected of having committed a crime until he has had an opportunity to consult counsel . It is further provided that a copy of this statute shall be placed in each cell of all penal institutions so that prisoners may be aware of their rights . <P> The " third degree " is the name popularly given to the extortion by the police of information from prisoners by means of protracted questioning combined with lack of sleep and starvation . The " first degree " is the arrest , and the " second degree " the taking of a prisoners to a place of confinement . <P> The police , as a body of officials , and some lawyers , as trained estimators of evidence , hold that the public criticism of " third degree " is unfounded . Said Major Sylvester , President of the American Associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made after a prisoner has been cautioned that what he states may be used against him are all that there is to the so-called ' third degree ' . " And Professor John H. Wigmore of Northwestern University , probably the greatest living authority on the law of evidence , has written : " The attempts , legislative and judicial , to exclude confessions obtained by police questioning of persons arrested and in seclusion represent simply a misguided solution of the problem . " <P> The suggestion in a well-reasoned article in the New Republic by Prof. Zechariah Chafee , Jr. , of the Harvard Law School , is that " if interrogation before trial is essential to the proper discovery of crime , " it should be " expressly recognized by the law and surrounded by proper safeguards .
