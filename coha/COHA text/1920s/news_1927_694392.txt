txt The French Cabinet voted today to make what Paris regards as a great concession to America on the tariff issue , and this concession has been embodied in a note which was completed tonight and will be handed to the United States Embassy tomorrow . morning . The note is a highly interesting document and the most important yet written in the pending controversy . The concession which the Poincare Government regards as so important is this : As a temporary arrangement during the negotiations Paris agrees to revert to the status quo ante for American imports . This means that American imports will be put back on the basis prior to the ediction of the new rates on Sept. 6 . It is believed that this will be accepted by the Americans . The action does not amount to giving America most-favored-nation treatment in principle , because there remains a distinction between the minimum rates that Germany enjoys and the rates the Americans enjoyed prior to Sept. 6 . However . materially speaking , the difference is very small . France Holds to Principles . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany ; ' in some cases , not so good . What the French regard as important is their refraining from giving most-favored nation treatment in principle during the negotiations . ' Another important point is that the French note , begins by reiteration of the French stand of being willing to negotiate a commercial treaty with the United States only on the basis of reciprocity , and it repeats the French denial of America 's claim to most-favored-nation treatment as a matter of right . It is understood that the new note also makes it plain that France expects a modicum of concessions by America in establishing the temporary regime . Thus it becomes apparent that the issue must be fought out as a contest between America 's claim to the right of most-favored-nation treatment and Europe 's reciprocal tariff system . What the French seek to have the Americans understand is that there Is at issue not only the FrancoAmerican commercial relations but also the European tariff system . The French law of 1892 specifies in Article 1 that the French Government may- give most-favored-nation treatment only to countries which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect today . Poses Europe 's Position as Whole . Not only that , it is argued here , but the whole European tariff sys. tem is based on reciprocity arrangements , which- system would fall , of its own weight were France to accord the best treatment to America without concessions . And that , perhaps , is why the new French note , it is said , makes plain to America what concessions the French would like to obtain . One hears it also pointed out in Paris that France hag no more discriminated against the United States in her new tariffs than against numerous European nations , including three of her allies , Belgium , Poland land Czechoslovakia . Furthermore , it is asked , if America condemns all special treatment , how does Washington explain the special treatment it has enjoyed in Brazil and now enjoys in Chile ? What should be borne in mind is that the French expect the ' coming negotiations to cover not ' only the 21k per cent . of , American exports to France affected by the Sept. 6 rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and French trade with ' America . The , French have been planning for two Years to revise their whole tariff system , . and thus the American negotiators will face problems arising from a possible general increase in the rates on American exports to France . Claudel to Conduct'Negotiitions . It is not to be forgotten that when the - French , ? rates were tripled in 1921 America was exempted , largely because that course enabled France to oppose the German dumping danger , which no longer exists in view of the new commercial treaty with the Reich . It is - understood- that the French are willing that the negotiations shall take place in Washington , with Ambassador Claudel heading the French representation . While the French make it plain that the new proposed regime should be only temporary , and . contingent upon successful negotiations ; . there would be no surprise in Paris if the conversations extended beyond the period of the coming American Presidential campaign .                    @
