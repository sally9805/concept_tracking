One Harry Gray , American , arrived in Prague , capital of Czecho-Slovakia . Harry was received politely . He announced modestly that he was the reconstructor of Czecho-Slovakia , offered enormous dollar credits to banks , municipalities and industrial concerns . The Czechs began to receive him with enthusiasm . He then wooed and won wealthy Widow Lederer , became head of the largest grain business in the country . Harry was then accepted by the Czechs and Slovaks as one of them , was consulted by eminent financiers , concluded millions of dollars ' worth of business , became well established , had his praises sung by all and sundry . One fine morning as the sun winked at the spires of Prague , Mrs. Gray noted that her spouse had not returned from the cabaret around the corner . At high noon , Harry was still absent . Enquiries were made . People became anxious . More than one man of money toyed nervously with the crowns in his trousers pocket . Some scanned their ledgers with much anxiety , noted that large sums of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value was due and had not been received . <P> When the sun had kissed the grand old Hradsany good night , Harry had not returned for similar caresses from his anxious wife . The dawn of another morning confirmed the fears of dozens of business men : Harry had fled . Mrs. Gray , ruminating upon her pillow , remembered that she was poorer . Investigation showed that she was bankrupt .
