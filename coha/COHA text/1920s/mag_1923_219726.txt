The campaign against diabetes mellitus continues unabated , and new light on its treatment is revealed with surprising frequency . Why the disease is engaging the attention of so many medical men may be surmised from some figures just published in the Statistical Bulletin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company . The general tendency of diabetes mortality has been upward for fully 20 years . Since 1919 the rise has been still faster . The highest death-rates are found in New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , the lowest in the southern and western states , largely because Negroes are less susceptible than whites , while Jews and Irish are more so than other white races . The rate also rises rapidly with advancing age and is higher among females than males . In New York State it now hovers around 22 per 100,000 , which is higher than measles or diphtheria . " Insulin , " perhaps the most widely heralded medical discovery of the past year , continues to show promise , though its originators claim only that it has alleviated some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Announcement has just been made of the " cure " of an apparently hopeless case of diabetes . A New York mathematics teacher and former athlete , Joseph Corbett , became ill in 1917 , grew progressively worse , was pronounced incurable by physicians , and last October , after a breakdown , lingered on a starvation diet , too weak to turn in bed . His wife had bought a cemetery plot for him . He began a regular dosage of insulin on February 2 . The 9% sugar in his blood has now been reduced to normal , less than 1% , he has gained 50 pounds , is able to eat a generous diet , and takes vigorous exercise . Insulin was evolved by Drs . J. J. R. Macleod and F. G. Banting , of the physiological department , University of Toronto . It is extracted from the pancreas glands of sheep or beeves , and is named from the " islands of Langerhans " - little spots of vascular tissue through which the internal secretion of the pancreas passes into the blood . In normal health this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Production of insulin on a large scale is difficult and expensive . Its manufacture is strictly safeguarded under patents held by the University of Toronto , and it is made by only one firm in the United States . It is administered hypodermically . Cambridge University biochemists , L. B. Winter and W. Smith , are developing an extract of yeast , very similar in composition to insulin , but much cheaper to manufacture , and of less dangerous toxic qualities . This may prove a satisfactory substitute . Dr. James C. Irvine , Principal and Vice Chancellor of St. Andrew 's University , Scotland , one of the world 's greatest authorities on blood sugar , asserts that no complete cure of diabetes has yet been found , though he recognizes the value of insulin . There are eleven forms of sugar glucose , he says , of which the body can utilize only a few . If these so-called " gamma " compounds can be isolated from glucose and the diet limited to them , it is certain that diabetes can be cured . But the world 's present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface .
