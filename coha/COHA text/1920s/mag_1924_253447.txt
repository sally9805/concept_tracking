" Ignorance ! " summarizes in one word the findings of a commission which investigated theological seminaries ( Protestant ) in the U. S. and Canada . The findings were recorded by Robert L. Kelly , ex-President of Earlham College , and were published by the Institute of Social and Religious Research under the auspices of such men as John R. Mott , Chairman , Raymond B. Fosdick , President Faunce of Brown <P> Many a seminary , says the report , is untouched by the progress of science . Libraries were found locked and barred . Lectures were often nothing more than " rhetorical , rambling , hortatory sermons . " <P> Less than half the 7,500 students whose records were investigated had college degrees . Some seminaries did not require even high school education . <P> As to numbers-the commission found students aplenty . There are 9,000 prospective ministers-one for every 2,600 church members . But knowledge was scarce .
