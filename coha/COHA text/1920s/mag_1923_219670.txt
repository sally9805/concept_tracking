There was a law in the District of Columbia prohibiting the employment of women at less than $16.50 per week ( $858 per year ) . Passed by Congress , signed by the President , the law was thrown out as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in what was virtually a 5-4 decision . <P> It is already clear that a large majority of the nation condemns the decision and distrusts the reasoning which supports it . <P> It is argued that the decision courageously upholds freedom-of-contract . But many are inclined to condemn the Court for " upholding the freedom to starve . " <P> Justice Sutherland , who wrote the decision , questioned the economic soundness of the law . But it has never been the province of the Court to question the wisdom of legislation . <P> The point is made that since women have the vote , there should not be special legislation for women . But , as Mr. Taft said in dissenting from the decision , the Nineteenth Amendment did not abolish the physical inequalities of women . <P> The layman seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of this Minimum Wage Law for Mr. Taft , there is enough for him .
