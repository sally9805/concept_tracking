txt Herbert Hoover had a luncheon conference with Senator William E. Borah of Idaho today , following which the Senator declared that unless Congress , at the coming session in December passed farm relief legislation , the subject should be considered at an extraordinary session to be held next Spring . While Senator Borah did ' - not say that Mr. Hoover had favored his plan for dealing with farm relief in a special session in case Congress failed to act this Winter , the inference was drawn that the subject was under discussion at the conference and that Mr. Hoover knew Mr. Borah was going to make a statement embodying his proposal . In his speeches in the West in September and those recently made in the South and Border States , Senator Borah stressed farm relief . Western leaders urged him to present to Mr. Hoover the need for some utterance that would give assurance that the latter would act promptly on the question in the event of his election in November . Urges Speedy Legislation . " Unless the short session this Win ? ter takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , I am thoroughly in favor of an extra session of Congress , " stated Senator Borah . " I would like to see the session called at once . And , first , pass a tariff bill with a special view of'increasing duties upon farm products ; second , pass a marketing bill establishing a more satisfactory marketing system , so as to enable the farmers to market their products without being put to the enormous expense which is now necessarily incurred  --  a bill of this nature is now pending in the Senate ; third , create a farm board with ample authority and with an ample revolving fund to assist the farmer in marketing his surplus in accordance with sound business principles . " I think there are three propositions in the question of farm relief which ' can be covered by a special session , so as to enable the farmer to get the benefit of legislation for the next year 's crop . As I see it , he ought to have better protection for l his products ; he ought to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm board with authority and with funds to cooperate in disposing of his surplus . " The campaign has developed this question and these issues , so that there need not be any unnecessary delay and agriculture would get the benefit of it for the coming year . There is every reason for a special session and to my mind no sound reason against it . " To Stump North Carolina Again . Senator Borah , who came to Washington fresh from his speaking tour in the Southern and Border States , told Mr. Hoover that the anti-Smith movement had attained formidable proportions in North Carolina , Texas , Tenneszee and other near-by States , and that he regarded the prospects in North Carolina as distinctly favorable to the Republican ticket . He reported that Kentucky and Missouri were reasonably safe for Hoover and that Tennessee was still debatable territcry . Mr. Hoover was so impressed with the Senator 's report on the prospects in North Carolina that he quickly concurred in the expressed wish of the Senator to make another trip into that State . Senator Borah will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that night . The following night he will speak at Raleigh , the home town of Josephus Daniels , former Secretary of the Navy . On Oct. 31 he will speak at Baltimore and on Nov. 2 at Boston . On Nov. 3 he will make what may be his final speech of the campaign at Utica , N. Y. It is possible , however , that his itinerary may be extended to other cities along the Atlantic seaboard . Denies Deserting Progressives . Replying to assertions that his campaigning in behalf of Mr. Hoover marked his departure from the ... ranks of Progressive Republicans in the Senate , Senator Borah asserted that in his speeches for the Republican nominee he had not compromised on the doctrines he has been preaching for years . Mr. Hoover 's , stand on prohibition was in harmony with his own . He was likewise convinced that Mr. Hoover would approach the agricultural question in a spirit of sympathy for the farmers . " I have a very definite idea as to where Mr. Hoover stands in his attitude toward South America , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I do not undertake to speak for him on this question , but I am convinced that if entrusted with the office of President he will deal with the other republics in a spirit of liberality . " The Senator said he was in harmony with the statement of Mr. Hoover that Government operation of Muscle Shoals was advisable and said he had been informed by supporters of the Boulder Dam project that the nominee favored Government operation of that plant . He was informed that Governor Smith advocated Government ownership of such enterprises but believed that current should be distributed by private agencies under contracts stipulating prices . " My opinion is that divided responsibility , as proposed by Governor Smith . would not be successful , " he said . " The Government should distribute the current produced at all plants that it builds and owns . " Holds Dry Issue Outstanding . He regarded prohibition as an outstanding issue and it was on this ground principally that he justified his country-wide tour for Mr. Hoover . He so declared himself by way Of comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover , which he had not done for either of the Republican nominees in 1920 and 1924 , he could no longer continue his affiliations with the Progressive " bloc " in the Senate . Before the Kansas City convention , the Senator explained , he talked over farm relief and prohibition with Mr. Hoover , found that the views of both coincided , made a fight on both propositions at Kansas City and won . Accordingly , he construed himself to be committed to the platform and the nominee . Senator Borah declined to comment on the announcement that Senator Norris will formally endorse Governor Smith at Omaha tomorrow , but he may have something to say after the Nebraska Sileator has stated his position . Speaking to Mrs. Raymond Robins f the Industrial Division of the Women 's Division of the Republican National Committee , and Miss Elizaeth Christman , representing the 3loveworkers ' Union , Mr , Hoover expressed today his sTinpa thy with efforts to obtain legislation beneficial to women workers . " I am absolutely with you , " Mr Hoover said , " in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation establishes standards for industry which , although they already exist by voluntary agreement between many employers and the organized workers , must be written into law to bring up the lapgards of industry . " On this subject I have not altered my opinion as expressed in 1920 . If women in industrial occupations are to be protected equally with men they must have safeguards additional to those provided for men . I favor especially the laws limiting hours of labor , with progressively . higher standards in accordance with the purposes of organized working women . I should deplore any weakening of the existing regulations or any interference with their extension . " Miss Christman told Mr. Hoover women were asking for the eighthour law for women in all industries , regardless of whether such laws applied to men . Told of Bail Workers ' Support . Frederick H. Fljozdal , President of the Brotherhood of Railway Maintenance of Way Employes , and Arthur J. Lovell , Vice President of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen , told Mr. Hoover that a majority of railroad workers would vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were for Mr. Hoover because in their opinion his experience and training in Government had better equipped him for the Presidency than had the career of Governor Smith . " When the present mediation act was under consideration Mr. Jewell , Mr. Robertson and other leaders of the bro ! - hood anizat ions visited Mr. Hoover and obtained from him a number of helpful ideas . Every official of our organization appreciates Mr. Hoover 's broad grasp of labor questions and his ability to deal fairly with them if he should be elected . " A group calling themselves representatives of the Bryan Democratic League , the membership of which , they said , consisted of thousands of admirers of the late William J. Bryan , sent a memorial to Mr. Hoover , pledging the support of the organization to him and setting forth that it found in Mr. Hoover 's words and record " many tokens " of the essential conceptions held by Bryan . W. B. I-hinter , Secretary of the league , transmitted the memorial ,           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
