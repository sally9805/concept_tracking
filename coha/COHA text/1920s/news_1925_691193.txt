txt Nothing could have Only One been further Merit the intention to as Denied . disW parage the game of chess in any remarks made about that game in this column . What E. H. JOHNSTONE of Clemson College , in a particularly in.tercsting letter printed on this page Saturday , took for disparagement was Inerely a protest against giving to chess credit for a merit which is not among the many it Possesses  --  that of training the mind for other pursuits and activities than chess itself . That , of course , is a debatable point on which opposite opinions honestly can be held . The available evidence , however , is against the contention that to possess or gain superiority in chess is preparation for other sorts of intellectual work . Mr. JoirNsros:s admitted that not one of the men really great at chess  --  the " masters " , ? ever has demonstrated in other fields the value of the qualities which he thinks are shown in their play . He explained that by saying that the masters devoted too much time to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others did not give it the time required for the attainment of real proficiency . But that comes near to giving his wholi case away . With . his high praise of chess as a game there can and must be entire agreement by everybody who once has been subjected to its charm . It is a game never turned into an instrument for gambling , its interest for practically all votaries being sufficient to hold them without the help of any stake , but Mr. JOHNSTONE would find more ? than difficulty in maintaining his contention that from the game of chess the element of chance is eliminated entirely . Between players ? of fairly like competence the result of any game is beyond prediction at its beginning , and what in each instance determines the victory can be called chance in the sense that it la unknown . Everybody knows that One Class for the rich there is no Out " h o u s g problem . " in the Cold . They can pay for what they want and it is provided for them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the groups that get high wages , almost always can get adequate shelter in surroundings which they find at least tolerable . There is. in between these two classes . another , much larger than the first , and not much smaller than the second , which deserves far more attention than it has received in the psCst , and the fact that it is beginning to get some consideration in real estate circles is a matter of satisfaction . This class consists of the so-called " Intellectuals , " such as teachers , artists , literary workers and other professionals , and of the army of beginners in business  --  the possessors of the " white-collar " jobs . Few indeed of these have any accumulated capital and almost as few have salaries or wages or incomes that are commensurate with the rents charged in parts of the city where they can have the comforts and refinements which are practically the necessaries of existence for themselves and their families . It is these folk for whom " housing " is a real and even terrible " problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even been talked about by anybody except themselves ? by anybody with the means and the inclination to provide them with roof and shelter adjusted to their resources and their tastes . They are as yet the victims of a combined desire and ability on the part . of most landlords to get from their property all that anybody will pay , and that at present happens to be more than the class under consideration is able to pay except at sacrifices in other lines that are distinctly painful . It is the belief of experts in real estate values that even here in the city ? on Its outskirts , of course  --  apartment houses could be built that at rents of from $10 to $15 or $18 a room would bring in a return of from 0 to 8 per cent . Nobody would dare , even Too Much if anybody desired , to say Can a word against thrift and . Savedeconomy , especially in the Be expenditure of public money . Therefore it passed , properly enough , as good news when the papers announced last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut down the outlay there . That 3ras all right , ' but reading over readin list of skimpings and parings somehow did not give much of a thrill , and not a few who did read it must have had a feeling that the residence and offices of this large country 's Chief Executive should be notable , not for extravagance of expenditure on luxuries , of course , but for the maintenance of styles and customs better adjusted to the nation 's resources and dignity than is the diminution of the number of towels supplied or the substitution of thick glass tumblers for paper cups at the sources of drinking water . And It was not pleasant , a little later , to read that when the President found that he was wasting time by using a worn-out knife eraser and asked that a new one be brought . he was told that there was none and no fund for the purchase of more . In this latter episode it is fairly safe to suspect somebody of a crafty machination to let the President know that economy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well to save money , and not to waste it , but it also is well not to carry thrift to its not very remote other end or side , which is penuriousness and meanness . It is the grayest of the virtues , anyhow , and while It may be respected by all , It has the love of not many . There is nothing Such Advice surprising or to be Is discouraged about in . Familiarthe discovery that a Very large fraction of the teachers . in our public schools . when asked for advice by those thinking of joining their profession , promptly say : " Do n't ! " The same advice could be had in plenty from the practitioners of nearly every other art , trade and profession , for they all have their hardships and drudgeries and unpleasantnesses. well known to those who have experienced them and looming much larger than those not experienced in other activities . The material rewards of teaching never have been large and never will be . It is hard work , and , for those without a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hard work . None the less , it has its attractions , and probably those who do not feel the attractions will not be much missed from the schools when they go elsewhere . They are by no means necessarily of higher ability  --  for teaching .
