Babbitt . The great American legion that calls George Follansbee Babbitt friend will hardly recognize his familiar figure as a skeleton , stripped of most of the flesh and blood wherewith Sinclair Lewis endowed him , strung about with a few chunks of cinematic laughter-bait , dangled rakishly by Director Beaumont inside the standard triangle frame . Corporeal flesh the producers could and did obtain , in the not unconvincing shape of fat Willard Louis , hitherto unknown . But of spiritual tegument the scenario had none . For obvious reasons , Tanis Judique , middle aged and harmless in the novel , was sent to the boudoir and brought out a sleek , home-wrecking creature ( Carmel Myers ) . Mary Alden , the Babbitt wife , has played frumpy parts until they are second nature to her . <P> The Arab . The locale of The Arab is Northern Africa and thither Rex Ingram moved his company . In view of this effort one is somewhat disappointed not to find a more unusual picture . <P> The theme , rather antique , deals with a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a native son for the Missionary 's daughter . <P> Ramon Navarro in the title role is more roguish than ever before . One is grateful for the absence of " Sheikery . " While the Arab 's desert-tribe does gallop across the hot sands to the rescue of the Mission at the crucial moment , Rex Ingram has not handled this in the absurd way which often causes the spectators to reach for their hats and march out . <P> For Sale . A woman , of course , and in this case Claire Windsor , daughter of socially prominent Manhattanites disporting on the edge of bankruptcy . Her impecunious suitor is discarded and a wealthy one selected . Returning from a party at which the engagement was announced , the plutocratic fiance is killed in an automobile wreck . This opens the field for Adolphe Menjou-wealthy , socially ambitious . Claire 's father has misappropriated money entrusted to him for investment by Menjou . <P> A crude sprinkling of society functions , jazz-parties and glimpses into Apache-dens of Paris fail to help this mediocre picture .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
