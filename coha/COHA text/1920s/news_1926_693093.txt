txt The world 's English Channel swimming record , held within five weeks by ar . American for twenty-four days and by a German for eleven , flitted to France today when . Georges Michel , doughty Paris baker , kneaded his way across " La Manche " ( the Sleeve ) , as the French call the Channel , in 11 hours 5 minutes . His time was just half that of Captain Webb who , in 1875 , was the first swimmer to cross the Chan ' nel . Georges Michel apparently caught and rode ( to change and mix metaphors in midstream ) that Channel eipress tide long sought by the experts . which , taken at flood , leads on to England without a stop . He made the swim according to his own time table . made out before he started from Cape Gris  --  Nez . When he left there at 8:27 o'clock last night he expected to reach England at 7:30 o'clock this morning . He landed from St. Margaret 's Bay only two miniftes late . " I have beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of watchers who welcomed him as he waded up the beach . Two Frenchmen , in his party from pure excess of joy lied leaped with their clothes on into the water and were flapping , about enthusiastically , crowing and chattering . For , them it was a victory of France over Germany , of the franc over the pound , and it looked as if they were going to sing the " Marseillaise . " Drinks a Double Whisky . The greased champion , however , did not stop to celebrate , but slipped through the crowd and into a near-by inn , where he ordered and quaffed a double whisky . M. Michel 's achievement restores tile balance between man and woman . When Miss Ederle and Mrs. Corson swam the Channel the feminists declared that woman had become the b stroner and man the weaker , but Ernst Vierkoetter , the German baker . broke the back of Miss Ederle 's record and now a Frenchman has broken , Vierkoetter 's record . M. Michel beat the record briefly held by Herr Vierkoetter by an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three hours . However , America may take ' the lead tomorrow , for tonight Louis Timson , American Legion swimmer , is going over the top with the intention of kicking all records into the limbo of lost victories . - Georges Michel is the ninth person to swim the Channel , two men and two women having crossed this Summer and five men having done so in previous years . When the Michel party was seen nearing the shore at St. Margaret 's Bay early this morning an English girl swimmer went out to escort him in . Afterward M. Michel said she had proved of great encouragement . When he landed another feminine admirer thrust a white rose into his hands . But M. Michel did not stop . He knew that the eye of his wife was upon him . She had i. , ccompanied him on a fishing smack . Seized by Cramps and Sickness . After his double whisky the French champion told of the troubles that had crossed his path of glory . Seized by cramp . he succeeded in throwing it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but succeeded ! in throwing that off , too . According to a Londoner who was on the beach when Georges Michel a*.r- rived , the swimmer received vociferous encouragement during his ordeal from his trainc- ? . " I and a. friend , " said this man , " had our nets out among tue rocks when , about 7 o'clock we saw a French fishing smack and a rowboat approaching . " The old boatman near me exclaimed , ' shiver my timbers if there is n't another of those Channel swimmers . ' " The fishing smack could not come close to shore , but the rowboat came on with several men in it . Then I saw a swimmer . " As he neared the shore his trainer became greatly excited . He seemed afraid that he might fail in the last few yards and kept shouting : ' Think of your mother ! Think of your father ! Think of your wife ! ' " The swimmer , who was thinking of that double whisky , swam on steadily and seemed to have plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . as he stepped ashore . As soon as he had cleared the water I went up and shook hands with him . " In their enthusiasm two of the Frenchmen , meantime , had leaped into the water fully dressed and a friend carried one of them ashore on his back . " Michel Tells His Story . At the bar of the ' little inn in St. Margaret 's , Georges Michel told in ? broken English the story of his swim . " This was my tenth attempt to swim the Channel . and last night , when 1 entered the water and saw conditions were favorable , I was absolutely certain I was going to do it , " he said . " I have failed so many times that I was determined to succeed , and in record time . " " I am very much pleased not only because of m : self , but for the sake of my country . The French people can now say that a Frenchman holds the record . I am the first Frenchman to accomplish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less time than Vierkoetter . I am now the holder of two world 's records  --  today 's swim and the French international marathon . " Asked what he ate during the swim M. Michel said : " Weak coffee and lumps of sugar soaked in brandy . At 1 o'clock this morning I had an attack of sea sickness , but kept on any way . At 3 o'clock , although feeling in no way fatigued , I met with a handicap . I suddenly had a severe attack of cramp . It was a very bad attack , and for a moment I was anxious about myself , but by little more vigorous movement I managed to ward it off . " I never nad , any idea of giving up the swim , because I could see the lights of the English coast calling me on . When I landed I felt in no way fatigued and even now 1 feel very fit , although naturally somewhat tired . " A member of M. Michel 's party said that once during the swim they lost him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a white helmet to help ' Co keep him in sight . At length he heard their halloos and swam back to the boat . When M. Michel had finished his breakfast and left the hotel he was surrounded by a crowd of admirers , many of whom were women . Many of them had him sign his name in their autograph books . He then motored to Folkestone to the French Consulate where , because of difficulties about his passport , he described himself as practically a " prisoner of war . " Georges Michel is a powerfully built man of 36 years of age . He employs the breast and over-arm stroke alternately . He is a. pupil of Burgess , the veteran English swimming instructor . M. Michel made an attempt to swim the Channel several days ago , but gave up almost immediately because conditions became unfavorable . In an attempt several weeks before he got within three miles of the English coast before being compelled to surrender to the Channel .               @ @ @ @ @ @
