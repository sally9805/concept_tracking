M. Raymond Poincar has been called the greatest of French militarists . There are those who have even dubbed him the arch plotter of the World War. + There is no question that it was he , as Premier ( 1922-24 ) , who sent French troops to occupy the Ruhr . Yet last week M. Poincare , once again created Premier ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) , began to clip and prune the French Army , in the interest of national economy to save the franc . <P> By a Cabinet order 2,700 officers were retired , bringing the number of officers on active service down to 28,800 as compared with 35,000 in 1914 . Some 17,000 cavalry horses were ordered sold , and 170 military establishments , barracks , training grounds , etc. , will be converted to other uses . Further economies were announced through the immediate consolidation of the army and navy ordinance departments . <P> <P> +Cf .
