txt The battle for the world 's heavyweight Crown between Jack Dempsey , the champion , and Georges Carpentier , Eu.ropean title-holder , for which Promoters Charles B. Cochran of England and William A. Brady and G. L. ( Tex ) Rickard of this country , offered the enormous purse of $300,000 , is definitely off . Failure of the principals to deposit forfeit moneys , as was provided in the contract sighed by the promoters , boxers and their managers , led to the cancellation of what promised to be the most stupendous boxing enterprise in the history of the sport . Under the terms of the contract for the bout , the promoters collectively agreed to deposit the sum of $100,000 , as a guarantee of good faith . This sum was to be deposited with the Central Union Trust Company on or before Nov. 20 , 1920 . The managers of the respective boxers agreed to deposit each $30,000 , Francois Descamps for Carpentier and Jack Kearns for Dempsey . Tire boxers ' deposits , like that of the promoters , were to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its equivalent in marketable securities , or in the form of a bond on or before Nov. 20 last .. Cochran 's Deposit Only , Ono Made . As yet but one deposit has been made of the guarantees contracted for . Charles B. Cochran , the British pro. ; motor who was largely instrumental in , effecting the match , is the only party to the contract who has deposited the money stipulated in the contract . Mr. Cochran , before he left this country for London in November , left his check for , his part of the promoters ' deposit with his American representative , Mr. Brady . This check , for $33,333.33 , it has deVeloped , was sent to Europe and cashed , the money being deposited according to contract by Nov. 20 , with the Central Union Trust Company . This was the sole deposit made . Manager Descamps , on behalf of Carpentier , posted a check for $30,000 in France , upon his arrival there after arranging the . match in this country , but the money has never been forwarded here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit the withdrawal of such a sum from the country , in view of the stringent ' financial conditicns in the ' French Republic . RI the strict technical sense , therefore , Car ' , cutler 's money lies never been deposited according to contract . It develops that no deposit was ever made by Manager Kearns on behalf of the champion . Nor has there been any time extension granted Dempsey in which to make the stipulated deposit . Huge Purse Gone for Good . For these reasons the match has been ? abandoned , temporarily , at least , as far as the promoters are concerned , and kermanently , in so far as the distribution of the enormous purse provided in tee original contract is concerned . Under the terms of this document Dempsey , as champion , was guaranteed the sum of poomo for defending his title against the French challenger , while Carpentier Was guaranteed $200,000 . The guarantees were unconditional and were to be paid en the basis of " win , lose or draw , " in each instance . The contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1921 , or between May 29 , 1921 , and July 4 , 1921 , at a place to be designated by the promoters . The contest was to be " for not more than fifteen rounds , and not less than ten rounds , " according to the contract . It was stipulated that it was optional with the promoters to arrange for the conduct of the battle in the United States , Canada , Mexico or Cuba , This provision was inserted to guarantee against a romovel of the bout to Europe . Any possibility of legal entanglements preventing the promoters from abandoning the bout , even though the promoters ' complete $100,000 had not been deposited , was removed , It was said , through th-. ' aecers ' failure to deposit their money ? . -s was stipulated . Part of the promoters ' deposit has been made . ? as represented hr the money of Promuter Cochran , it V.-a:3 pointed out , but there has been no deposit , as is : provided in the contract , on behalf of either Dempsey or Carpentier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bout it was agreed that the promoters were to notify the principals and their managers by registered mall , not later than Jan. 1 , 1921 , if the contest was to be held in March . If it was decided to hold the match between May and July the promoters agreed to notify the boxers or their managers by March 1 . The boxers were bound to an agreement to bo on the battleground : a training forty days prior =e - . Le day of the match . While the failure to adhere to the deposit stipuleeeens of the contract Is the alleged compelling force in dictating an abandonment of the battle , there are other elements of almost equal significance which enter into the situation . Not the least-of these is the action of the National Boxing Association of the United States , designed to control and supervise the sport throughout the country , in adopting a maximum price of $15 for admission to bouts in which titles are involved . This price limit was first adopted in this State , and subsequentiy was installed throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting , practically , as an automatic prohibition on the Dempsey-Carpentler bout as arranged , since under the price limit there could be an infinitesimal chance of success for an enterprise involving such a financial expenditure . Conditions in boxing over the country have experienced a decided change since the men were matched , which provides another handicap against the conduct of the bout as scheduled . In particular has there been a change in the attitude of the American boxing public toward this match . At first heralded as the greatest boxing bout in ring history , because of the remarkable prowess of the champion and the war and ring record of the challenger , talk of the match has gradually diminished until it is now almost forgotten . Existing conditions , too , have affected the proposed return meeting between Dempsey and Jess Willard , former holder of the title . The men were originally matched by Promoter Rickard to clash at Madison Square Garden in a fifteenround bout . March 17 , but it is understood this match , too , has been canceled because of the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether Dempsey and Carpentier will again be signed for a championship bout remains to be seen . The authority for the information that the original match is off , advanced the information that the boxers certainly would not be signed tinder similar financial terms for a bout in this country . It was said , in fact , that it was extremely doubtful whether the.match would be held here under any circumstances , the prospect being that if another contract was signed between promoters and boxers it would be for a battle In London . On this point , however , there was no positive information to be had . Kearns Denies Match Is Off . SAN FRANCISCO . Jan. 1S. ? Jack Kearns , manager for Jack Dempsey , heavyweight champion of the world , denied tonight that the match with Carpottier was off . He said forfeits had been posted both for Dempsey and Car-pentier , " My check for $50,000 was deposited in a New York bank three days after the same amount had been posted by Cowpentlera manager .
