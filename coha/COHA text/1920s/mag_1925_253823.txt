The Department of Agriculture came out of a brown study and announced its June estimates for 1925 grain crops . The most interest was displayed in the wheat estimate , for the emissaries of agriculture traveling through the wheat belt had found the winter wheat , which constitutes about two thirds of the wheat produced in this country , short of stalk , thin in stand+ , short of head- , with heads not well filled or empty . <P> The estimated crop was : <P> <P> Winter wheat 407,000,000 bushels <P> Spring wheat 254,000,000 " <P> Total wheat crop . .661,000,000 bushels <P> What does this mean ? It means the smallest wheat crop in eight years . It means a wheat crop so small that it should just about equal our wheat consumption-perhaps fall slightly below it , leaving no surplus for export . It means that , even if wheat prices are low abroad , they will be high here . It means that farmers will get good prices for their wheat-even if they have not a great deal to sell . <P> How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor weather conditions . The number of acres planted in wheat is less than half of one per cent below last year 's acreage , but the expected crop is more than 24% less . The estimated yield ( number of bushels per acre ) is very low . For winter wheat , it is only 12.4 bushels-less than it has been in 20 years . A cool , dry May was largely responsible . <P> How will it affect politics ? It will probably lessen the political pressure to institute a grain-exporting corporation with governmental capital to dispose of our wheat surplus abroad . This year there will be no wheat surplus . <P> All this follows : " If the June estimate is correct . " <P> The forecast for the following crops also indicated smaller production this year than last ( but not so striking as in wheat ) : Oats , rye , hay , peaches , pears . <P> One crop showed an increase : Barley . <P> <P> * " Winter wheat " is planted in the late fall and allowed to lie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring . <P> +The " stand " refers to the density of stalks in a field , as " a thin stand , " " a heavy stand . " <P> **The " head " is , of course , the enlargement at the top of the stalk common to all the " grasses , " in which the kernels develop .
