This is a record perhaps without equal or precedent , and it is still incomplete , for Mr. KESSINGER remains an important and active participant in the management of The Sentinel . That fact made it difficult for his associates to do what they wanted to do in the way of paying a tribute to their chief , for he , like most newspaper men , though a giver of publicity to others , avoids it for himself . It required a good deal of skillful plotting on their part , therefore , to conczal from him the fact that they were going to make Wednesday 's issue of his paper in large part a presentation of his own life and achievements , and to add thereto a large number of congratulatory messages and letters . The difficulties were overcome , however , and The Sentinel asserts that until Mr. KESSINGER read his paper that morning he did not know that he himself was to be its leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safer testation of capital Than punishment , KATHTheir Victims . LEEN NORRIS says that if its abolition thus could be brought about she would be one of ten women to go to the electric chair . It is impossible to see how the ten women could bring upon themselves that fate without committing ten particularly atrocious murders , for nothing less ever would make our juries send a woman to the chair . Anyhow , this is not a good time to preach lenience for the takers of life . They long have had it , as a matter of fact , and it does not seem to be working well . The truth is that both life imprisonment and capital punishment already are so nearly abolished in practice among us that , to make the abolition complete does not give riuch promise of improvement .

The work is to be done by a committee of the American Society of Engineers , and the plan Is to find out just what injuries noises cause , what noises can be prevented and what measures should be taken to minimize them . That is a worthy ambition , and it behooves engineers , especially , to achieve it if they can , for noise invariably means waste of energy .

For a year or more that strange organization gained recruits rapidly among the islanders in the smaller towns and the villages . They belonged in large part to the classes which , while approving in principle of the Klan 's avowed objects , also found in its mysteries a welcome mitigation of rustic monotonies , and a still more welcome sense of importance .

Few of the Republican leaders admit affiliation with the now discredited order .

Almost every one of them has a garage on the lot . He added : If the ' new allotments and extensions of the suburbs ' had waited , as they must have in earlier years , for the building of new street-car lines , many of them would not have been developed . An interesting study would be the " financing " of the motor vehicle industry . It is perhaps the best proof that the credit of the country is built on firm foundations .
