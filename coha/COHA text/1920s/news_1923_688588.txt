txt A tentative agreement for the funding of the British war time obligations to the United States was completed late today by the American Debt Funding Commission and Sir Auckland Geddes , representing the British Government , and was transmitted to President Harding . It is the understanding that the President will either appear before Congress or send a special message , early next week , asking for an amendment to the present law on the subject so that the tentative agreement may be ratified . If Congress Consents to this program , the British debt problem will have been solved . At the White House it was made known that the President was in full accord with the terms ' of the proposed agreement and will do everything within his power to obtain congressional sanction . It is probable that the President will appear in person and read the special messa.ge , , , i , : aetting-foith-:in detail . the great benefits which he believes will result to the world by the funding ar : . rangement . The President , it was said at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while that it should go through with a whirl in the present Congress , and that it was unbelievable that politics would be permitted to play a part in defeating final ratification . He is opPosed strongly to any course which would at this time involve soldier bonus payments with the debt funding . Bond Payment Privilege . An interesting feature of the tentative agreement was the provision thatany payment of interest or principal might be made in any United States Government bonds issued since April 6. 1917 , such bonds to be accepted by the American Government at par and acorued interest . This provision was inserted because it was intimated that the British Government in accumulating exchange to make payments might wish to enter the American market and buy up Liberty bonds or other Government issues . . An Administration official , in discussing this feature of the terms , said that the result of such a step by the British Government probably would have a stabilizing effect upon the American issues and also prove a profitable procedure for the British Government . The extent to which the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine just what the effect would be . The governmental theory was that any of the Liberty bonds turned in by the British Government in payment of interest or principal would be applied to reduction of the national debt . If the amounts involved were large the procedure would aid in the effort to reduce taxation . One official estimated that-the turnover of Government bonds in the open market probably approximated from $600,000,000 to $700,000,000 annually . It was apparent , he felt , that if the British purchased not more than $100 , - 000,000 annually the effect would be to strengthen the position of the American issues . Several of the American Government bonds at the present market can be purchased at a yield above 4 per cent . and up to 4.50 per cent . if held to maturity . It is believed , however , that the time is not far away when practically all of the issues will be quoted in the open market at par or better . Will Stabilize Exchange .

It went up 1% cents today , and has risen 4% since jilonday . Principal and Interest Payments . The announcement by the American Commission showed that in practically Sill other details the facts concerning the terries of the tentative agreement which have been published , were correct Interest would be figured at 4 per cent . from the date the debts were contracted to Dec- 15 , 1922 .

Payments on principal would begin at the rate of one-half of one per cent . for the first year and would increase in stated amounts each year until at the - end of sixty-two years the total of such payments would have retired the amount of the debt . The payments an Principal are to be made annually unless the British wish to take advantage of a provision which would permit them to make such settlements at three year periods . On ninety days ' notice , also , the British would be permitted to make larger payments on the principal than are contemplated in the arrangement . A feature of the tentative agreement Which has not been published is that the British would be permitted to defer half of the payment for the first five years , this amount to be added to the principal , and bonds issued accordingly .

Interest payments are to be made on June 15 and December 15 of each year , beginning nett June . At the White House it was said that President Harding felt confident the tentative agreement would be accepted by Congress , and that the President , since the negotiations began with the British representatives , had talked with several Senators and Representatives who thought that even more lenient terms would be acceptable . The President . it also was said . had not determined upon the nature or the request he would make for legislative action . Personally , he favored an amendment to the funding law which would make it fit with the terms of the tentative agreement , and he thought that this could be done without long discussion . It was to be assumed , also , the President felt , that other debtor nations would be asked to arrange for funding on the same basis as that suggested to the British . If different terms were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , additional legislation could be requested . The main thing the President had in mind was that the British problem should be settled on the terms arrived at by the American Commission and the British Gov. -. - nment , and if an amendment of the zmaing law appeared not to - be the wise ueurse a resolution approving the terms of the tentative agreement with the British would be acceptable . Opposes Link with Bonus . One point that the President was reported to have stressed was that in his opinion it would be unseemly to mix the resolution of a soldier bonus with the British debt settlement at this time . It was said at the White House that the President felt that it would be the proper course to reach an agreement simply on the merits of the case and not involve other issues . It was apparent that the President Was opposed to any move to attach a rider to funding legislation which would provide that interest payments Would be used to pay a soldier bonus . The White House , it was said , felt that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the stability of the world financial and economic situation . The matter was of such vast importance , It was felt . ' that it would find its reflection in the money markets of the world and help to lower interest rates which the American , British and other Governments . would be called upon to pay for bond issues . It Is probable that the President in his message to Congress will go in - Some detail into his beliefs as to the Importance of the debt funding arrangeanent on world affairs at a time when there is so much confusion on the continent of Europe . Burton Defends the Terms . Representative Theodore E. Burton of Ohio , a member of the Debt Funding Commission , issued a formal statement explaining the terms of the agreement land its advantages . He said : " The proposed settlement must have ' the approval of both the President and the Congress . It is to be noted that the rate of interest is lower and the term ' longer than that fixed by the statute creating the commission . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan outlined , for the following reasons : " First , in fairness to Great Britain : England is the only country which has come forward with a proposition looking to an immediate settlement of its debt incurred to this country during the . e ar . Also it is the sole country of Europe which is providing for current expenditures by taxation . In order to do this it has been necessary for her to impose a burden of taxation Car heavier than , any of the leading nations has ever imposed in time of peace . A commendable pride in her credit stimulates a desire to meet all her obligations . " In this connection it must be said that Trifle the debts of the various nations of Europe to us should not be cancelled , a considerate  --  yes , a generousPolluY should be adopted in the terms imposed . It must be recognized that all of our allies 1n the late war made sacrifices far in excess of those suffered by the United States , however great our own may have been . Each is carrying a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the - wealth they possess accumulated through centuries . " Universal bankruptcy is threatened in all of them unless conditions improve . The ability to pay their obligations must be based upon faith in the future . " Second . as a practical matter the rates of interest , although lower than those now prevailing , are not lower than in normal times . The average rate of return on English consols for More than fifty years prior to 1914 was - less than 3 per cent . The rate reached a minimum of 2 4-10 per cent . In 1897 and was less than 3 per cent . , until 1909 . " There is every reason to believe that , notwithstanding the unfavorable situation created by the vast amount of national debts and the loss of resources by- reason of the war . there will be a marked decrease in interest rates in the-next ten years . Since the peak in 1920 there has been a fall varying from 1 to 2 per cent . in the return upon investments and the rate at which new securities can be floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued securities at 7 3-10 per cent . also A per cent . payable In gold . There was a Very marked fall soon after the close of the war . " Third , there Is a financial advantage - Which can hardly be measured , which inures to the people of the United States do case rates of exchange become more favorable to our debtors . This would - mean . greatly increased purchases from us , especially in cotton and meats and all the varied products of agriculture . A crushing weight of taxation in any country will seriously diminish its purchasing power and better industry . " In conclusion it is scarcely necessary to mention the stabilizing effect in finance and trade which a settlement of this debt would accomplish . Quite as important as anything is the good-will which would be promoted by a settlement of debts which so long as they remain unliquidated are sure to promote controversy and ill feeling .
