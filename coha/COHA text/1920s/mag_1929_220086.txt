When two major revolutions broke out in Mexico last week on the very day before U S. President Hoover 's Inauguration , correspondents heard a flustered official of the U S State Department exclaim that Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow , on his recent visit to Washington , certainly did not give Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg any reason to think that Mexico was on the brink of revolution . Curiously enough , the only U. S. daily which let this indiscreet admission into cold type was New York 's arch-Republican Herald-Tribune . <P> The twin revolutions occurred respectively A ) In the great gulf port of Vera Cruz State of Vera Cruz , 200 miles east of Mexico City and B ) In Nogales , State of Sonora , famed drink &; divorce boomtown on the U. S. Border , 1,000 miles northwest of Mexico City . <P> " Revolution A " was led by General Jesus Maria Aguirre and his brother General Manuel Aguirre ; " Revolution B by General Francisco Manzo and Governor Fausto Topete of the State of Sonora , renowned for fierce Yaqui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A " and " B " revolts were synchronous , and the high officials concerned have in common that they are all old associates of the late assassinated President-Elect Alvaro Obregon ( TIME , July 30 ) , and are a supporters of presidential candidate General Gilberto Valenzuela , called by his enemies el Capitan de los Cristeros , a nickname implying he is the military chief of embattled Mexican Roman Catholics . <P> Both revolutions were at first entirely bloodless . The soldiers of the garrisons at Vera Cruz and Nogales simply obeyed their Generals-previously trusted servants of the state-when ordered to declare against the government of Mexican President Emilio Fortes Gil , ruthless suppressor of Catholics . <P> The President moved against the revolutionaries by asking onetime President Plutarco Elias Calles ( 1924-28 ) to emerge from his civilian retirement and defend the state as Minister of War . Responding instantly , General Calles ordered swift mobilization , scoffed at reports that six states had joined Sonora and Vera Cruz in revolt clapped on an iron censorship . <P> The hesitant attitude of the armed forces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican fleet off Vera Cruz fired at the revolutionaries in the city a few shots which must have been blanks , since they did no damage . Thus should the government win , the fleet would have " fired " in its defense , and , should the revolution triumph , Mexico 's swarthy sea-dogs would have deserved well . <P> Since Nogales is a twin city , partly in Mexico and partly in Arizona , General Manuel Aguirre of the Nogales , Sonora , revolutionaries was soon called upon by Col Arthur M. Shipp , commander of the Nogales , Ariz. , 25th U. S , . Infantry border patrol . Later , Col. Shipp said : <P> " I do not expect any serious trouble . Information given me leads to the belief that a great economic change without bloodshed is in progress . "
