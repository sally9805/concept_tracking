" TIME Brings All Things " <P> Depoka <P> In Manhattan , one Barney Depoka wobbled along the streets for 20 days , seeking a job . On the twentieth day , he wobbled to a window on Times Square wherein he saw a female cook flopping pancakes . As he watched the brown pancakes going up in the air , turning over once , flopping back on warm griddle , Barney Depoka nodded his head slowly . At last , with a melancholy sigh , he flopped down on the sidewalk . An ambulance surgeon looked at Barney Depoka and pronounced him starved . <P> <P> Crucified <P> In Berlin , railroad employes with hammers and crowbars removed the body of Reinhold Uelmer from the wall of a third-class compartment . His feet had been nailed to the woodwork , his hands made fast with chains . He , morose , an actor out of a job , had accomplished the crucifixion without aid . But he did not die . <P> <P> Salesman <P> In southern France , a traveling salesman walked into a small hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no vacant rooms , the manager told the salesman whose name was Pierre Prothus , that he would have to go somewhere else . Pierre Prothus loudly refused , frightening the manager with his insistence . At last he was led into a neat bed chamber . " Sleep there , " said the manager . <P> Hoping perhaps that at midnight he would be disturbed by the proper occupant of the room , some young and beautiful girl , Pierre Prothus closed his eyes with pleasure . In the morning he awoke , surveyed the room with disappointment and reached under the bed for his slippers . Instead of his slippers , under the bed Pierre Prothus found a grisly corpse . <P> Now thoroughly enraged , Pierre Prothus rushed to court , instigated suit against the hotel . The manager explained that the corpse belonged to a roomer who had died the day before Pierre Prothus arrived . He had left the corpse under the bed because he had not known where else to put it .

But Bruce McQuillan had a cork leg and this prevented him from sinking . He was rescued . <P> <P> Grease <P> Vain and sticky , thousands of U. S. youths grease their hair before they brush it . In Cedar Rapids , Iowa , last week , one Joe Coparil oiled his hair and went in swimming . Soon he began to drown . A life guard , heeding his cries , swam out and twice tried to grasp him by the hair . This was too slippery to hold , so Joe Coparil sank , drowned . <P> <P> Leg <P> In Eton , many years ago , Geoffrey Winthrop Young read Whymper 's Scrambles . Years later he lost a leg . Last week he told how he climbed the Matterhorn , famed Alp . Difficult for youthful , healthy mountaineers , the Matterhorn is an almost incredible ascent for a 52-year-old cripple such as Geoffrey Winthrop Young .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
