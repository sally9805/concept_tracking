FAREWELL TO YOUTH-Storm Jameson - Knopf ( $2.50 ) . Anyone who writes as acutely of women and their " new freedom " as does Author Jameson in Three Kingdoms , has no time to concern herself with men like the naive hero of the present volume . Nat Grimshaw , charming enough in his way , takes himself so seriously that his growing pains alternate dull with exasperating . Knowing nothing of women , Nat is tricked into marrying one of the worst ; then goes off to war ( the Great War again ) . When he got home his wife announced herself unfaithful , and wanting a divorce soon-but not till convenient for her lover . Meanwhile she proposed to satisfy her husband 's immediate desire of her , and spineless Nat accepted the situation , complete with carnal favors . Happily , none of the main characters is convincing-not even Cousin ( by marriage ) Ann who comes to Nat 's rescue .
