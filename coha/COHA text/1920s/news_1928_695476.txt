txt MR . HUGHES ON THE STUMP .. A Question of Propriety in the Case of a Judge . To the Editor of The Now York Times : The announcement of the Republican - National Committee that Mr .. Hughes will speak in the East and West for , Mr. Hoover was made at almost the same moment that twenty ... six foreign countries united in electing ' Mr. Hughes to the Permanent Court of International Justice to succeed John .

Mr. Hughes having been elected . to and . taken his place on the court as a distinguished citizen of the United States regardless of party , the propriety of his taking the stump in ' favor of Mr. ' Hoover may well be questioned . Mr. Hughes as a Judge of the Per-. ma , nent Court ' stumping the country as a partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Administration , . as a private- citizen engaged in the practice of ? law , stumping the country in favor of his own policies adopted by Mr. Hoover . After his , nomination as a member of the ' Supreme Court of the United States and before he took his seat Mr. Hughes acquiesced in the tradition of that court and refrained. from active participation in partisan politics . Is it not fair to suggest that the same proprieties be observed by a Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice ? It may be urged that Mr. Hughes does . not represent the United States on the court ; that he is there because of distinguished service as a public servant . Will his taking the stump at this time in behalf of the candidate of the party which has recognized him so signally be understood abroad in many places where we have had and still have great difficulty in being understood ?
