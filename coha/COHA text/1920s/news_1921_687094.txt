txt Mr. Lannard departed from his usual custom of spending the afternoon playing bridge at the club and hurried home to find his wife and daughter in a highly wrought state of emotion . Muriel was accusing her mother of having offended Harry Bacon so outrageously that he was practically driven from the house . " Nonsense , child ! I simply repeated what you have told him yourself  --  that you had no intention of marrying him . " Then turning abruptly she asked : " What does it mean , Edward ? The bank says his cheek is good . How does it happen that he has money enough to give such a large sum to a charity ? " " It 's quite mystIfyirs , " answered Mr. Lannard . " I talked with Virden the president of the bank , 110 merely said the check was good , but when I tried to get further details he froze up . Bank ethics , you know . " " Has he been speculating successfully or " ? here she shot a glance at her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother ! How can you say such a thing ? You know Harry has never done a thing that warrants you in making such an insinuation . " Mr. Lannard interposed . " He 's evidently all right . Virden 's attitude convinced me of that . He 's probably made a successful stock deal of some sort , although where he got thb money to margin it is beyond me . " " Well , If he got-it said . Mrs.-Lannard , " he wo n't have it long . I 'm going Out now . " She paused in the doorWay as a thought-struck her . " Perhaps , Muriel , you would feel better if you talked with the young man . " " But , mother , he wo n't come back after the way you treated him . " " 0 , yes , he will . Blame it on me if you wish . Tell him I was suffering from a severe headache . I have no doubt he will tell you all about his financial windfall ? If you go about it cleverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serene in the belief that Bacon would be camped on the doorstep when she returned . Muriel acted quickly . She at once called up the office where he was employed . A quiet voice reported that Mr. Bacon had resigned several days before and had not visited the office since . At the house where he roomed a less quiet voice reported that Mr. Bacon had given up his room and had left no forwarding address . It was all most mysterious. , After an ' agitated half hour at the telephone she - had exhatisted every avenue of communication .. He had vanished completely . This realization brought her a poignant sense of loss . Her vanity also suffered . If Harry Bacon had been there at that moment his suit would have Prospered . Instead he was seated in the private ofilce of one of the trustees of his estate . For several days he had spent similar hours being initiated Into the ramifications of what had been his uncle 's property . While thus engaged he encountered In the long list of . holdings a name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that ? " he exclaimed . ? " Your uncle made considerable investments in steel properties , " answered the trustee , " but , with the exception-of this holding , all have been converted into other securities . " , " Why did he retain this ? " " Since the period of war prosperity it has declined so much in market value that he was unwilling to sell until better prices prevailed . Mr. Lannard formerly gave his personal attention to the property . Of late he has delegated the management to others and has spent his time here in the city , largely engrossed in social pursuits . The property has suffered . There is bitter discontent among his workmen and , consequently , constant labor difficulties , " " How many shares of stock are there in all ? " asked Bacon . " One hundred thousand , of which Mr. and Mrs. Lannerd hold 51,000 , unless they have been obliged to let some of them go . " Bacon thought for a moment . " I wish you would endeavor to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said quietly . " And do it in a way that my name does not appear in the transaction . " " It can be done by the estate , " said the trustee , " but you would do well to avoid getting deeper in a property that is on the down grade . " " I believe in steel , " answered Harry , " hod the time to buy Is when the stock is down . A steel company that is well run is bound to prosper  --  or else this country will go broke .
