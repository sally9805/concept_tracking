txt The meeting in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in behalf of the suffering Jews in Eastern Europe is without known precedent . It was the first time , so far as Bishop MANNING is aware , that a meeting has been held in any Christian cathedral specifically in behalf of the Jewish people . The very fact that Catholic and Protestant came together with the Jew in support of this cause must have an effect that will reach across Europe to the Urals and be felt especially In the land where above all others the spirit which was shown in this meeting should have the fullest expression . It is an example that should be followed in every community in America , where the Jews have always been , as General PcrisniNa said , " in the forefront of charitable works , " for , whatever the amounts contributed may be , it Is the exemplication of the Christian spirit that will most mightily work toward the release of the Jew from the restrictions and persecutions to which even today he is still subject in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral , which so finely illustrated its mission as " a house of prayer for all people , " was as " a city set upon a hill that can not be hid . " What this event signifies is not alone food for the starving , relief for physical suffering , saving the lives of children ; it proclaims on the part of our foremost citizens and churches of all denominations a freedom from the prejudice which has followed a race for centuries . The words which Dr. CADMAN spoke as a message to the world from the " mother church , " as he called it , will be gratefully heard wherever that race feeling still lingers ; and with that message will also be heard the stirring sympathetic words of the two great soldiers , Gen ? eral PERSHING , of Methodist bringing up , and General O'RYAN , one of the foremost laymen of the Catholic Church in America . These words will be listened to in many languages and like the utterances at Pentecost will be understood of all . They will tell not alone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prejudice , as expressed not only in the addresses of the distinguished speakers but also by the very presence of such an assembly in spite of the storm . The call from these five million suffering starving men , women and children is one that must in humanity 's name be answered . They are " fed with the same food , " " subject to the same diseases , " " healed by the same means , " frozen by the same cold , with the not oft mankinat ondi by the same token , if treated by their fel. low-beings with sympathy and kindness . they " will better the instruction . " This gathering , said General PEasmITO , should be " the beginning of an era of good-will , " and one may add no better beginning could have been made than here in New York and in this great cathedral , where men of different faiths met and understood one another and united to spread a gospel of good-will in the earth , as well as to minister to suffering millions .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
