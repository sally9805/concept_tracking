The closing sessions of the meeting of the Anti-Saloon League in Chicago were brilliant with oratory . Examples : <P> Dr. L. C. Branscomb of Anniston , Ala. , regarding the possibility of the Democrats ' nominating a wet for the Presidency : " My grandfather and my father were Democrats , and if I should vote the Republican ticket they might turn in their graves , but I would do it if the northern Democrats should betray the cause for which we have suffered ! " <P> Edwin H. Hughes , Methodist Bishop of Chicago : " My great-grandfather was taught alcohol was a food , my grandfather was taught it was a beverage , my father was taught it was a stimulant , but I was taught alcohol was a poison . It is time we taught our children that intoxicating liquor was born in Hell and we mean to keep it there . " <P> William David Upshaw , Congressman from Georgia , sitting on a piano stool , holding his crutches : " Mr. Chairman and fellow booze fighters-I am opposed to a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a campaign of law observance on the part of officialdom . <P> " The press of America-every publisher , editor and reporter , must be put on the water wagon . I have a high respect for these men and their mission , and I speak not in bitterness but in sorrow . If the newspapers of this country were all on the water wagon we would be grandly on our way to accomplish our goal . <P> " The second great step is to put all politicians on the water wagon . The personnel of Congress is overwhelmingly dry , both in practice and in precept . But I am in favor of a vigorous policy from the White House down that will break every bottle in official America and send unpatriotic and dangerous politicians to the scrap heap .
