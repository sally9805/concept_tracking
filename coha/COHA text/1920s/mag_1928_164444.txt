Over the Ohio River at Madison , Ind. , there is use for a bridge ; over the Missouri at Hermann , Mo . and Courtney , Mo . are similar uses ; and at all three places public authorities , too poor to build bridges at common expense , recently authorized private individuals to build toll bridges . <P> Last week J. G. White &; Co. , world-famed engineers and financiers , advertised that they would sell stock in the National Toll Bridge Co. , just incorporated especially to finance those three bridges . <P> That advertisement followed by a fortnight the advertisement of H. M. Byllesby &; Co. and the Federal Securities Corp . to sell debenture bonds in a railroad and highway toll bridge over the Mississippi at Vicksburg , Miss . <P> Between the appearance of the two advertisements Governor Smith of New York vetoed legislative measures to enfranchise toll bridges across the St. Lawrence at the Thousand Islands , and across the Niagara River at both Tonawanda and Niagara Falls , N. Y. <P> Governor Smith gave five sharp and sane reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at lower cost than private ; 2 ) bridges are public and the public should own them ; 3 ) privately owned toll bridges are as old-fashioned as privately owned toll roads ; 4 ) the particular New York franchises sought were practically perpetual ; 5 ) if private corporations can make money on the construction of toll bridges , the government can . <P> Nonetheless toll bridges have been built and will be built privately . At the beginning of this year , the U. S. Bureau of Public roads reports , 233 toll bridges were in operation in the U. S. Private organizations owned 191 of them . Under construction were 29 new toll bridges , 20 being private . Proposed were 163 more , 100 of which were to be privately financed . <P> At least six good reasons exist for private capital to build toll bridges : 1 ) motor travelers are willing to pay tolls to shorten their journeys ; 2 ) local authorities derive a certain , if trifling , indirect income ; 3 ) government authorities are often too lethargic to construct needed bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the engineering friends of officeholders get the construction jobs and profits ; 5 ) sale of bridge bonds and stocks provides work and profits for banking houses ; 6 ) bridge bonds and stocks are investment opportunities for people with idle money . <P> Such being the case , the soundness of investments in toll bridges depends very largely upon the integrity of the banking house , checked up in every case by the personal banker of the investor who underwrites the bridge bonds .
