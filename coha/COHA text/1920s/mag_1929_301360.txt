Wiping three tears out of one eye , Harry Evans sat down at his desk , in the time-honored office of Life , and wrote , last week , under the caption The Movies , the following wan preamble : " With head uncovered I bow reverently and take my pen in hand to write this column , formerly edited by the dean of all moving picture critics , Robert E. Sherwood . . . . " <P> Two of the three tears Critic Evans shed were crocodile tears . After all he had kept his job , nay , got a better one . Many of the funnymen who have been engaged the last few years in making Life comical were looking for new markets for their quips and quiddities . Among them was Robert Sherwood himself , who , in addition to reviewing the movies , had been editor of the magazine for four years , associate editor for four years before that . <P> For some time , it would seem , the publishers of Life have been getting most of their fun out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifelong rival , Judge . Life itself did n't seem half so funny as it ought to be . So eventually they beguiled Norman Hume Anthony , editor of Judge , to come over and take Sherwood 's place . <P> Ever since 1920 Norman Anthony had been with Judge . He was not educated primarily to be a humorist . On the contrary he went to art school in his native Buffalo and later in New York , and learned to paint compositions of fish and bananas in new and thoughtful poses . His sense of humor could not be stifled , and in 1910 , when he was 21 and very free , he eloped with a Buffalo girl . This prank turned out well . Mr. &; Mrs. Anthony had two children and Mr. Anthony became a comedian in earnest . After ten years of free-lancing with cartoons and covers he joined the staff of Judge and in 1922 became editor . <P> Last week the first issue of Life under Norman Anthony 's editorship appeared . As far as it resembled the Life of 1928 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Life and Life . No picture could be half so dismal as that of the office of a humorous magazine where the staff feels that it is n't considered funny enough . Hollow with chagrin , wild with despair , sounded the laughter in the studios of Life as the old staff prepared their swan-song for the presses . A shadow seemed to lie all through that final number , with its reprint of favorite drawings from the spent twelvemonth . <P> When the new Life came out the full extent of the casualties was seen . The editorial page heretofore conducted by Elmer Davis was gone ; it will not be revived for anyone else . <P> Baird Leonard 's " Mrs. Pep 's Diary " was discontinued . <P> Walter Winchell 's " Along the Main Stem " was out . <P> Percy L. Crosby 's " Skippy " letter was missing , although Skippy may appear in the future as an occasional feature . There were other changes . <P> Chief among the novelties celebrating the accession of Editor Anthony was a short story contest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during 1929 . They are to be very short-not more than 700 words . The judges are to be Ray Long , editor of Cosmopolitan ; Merle Crowell , editor of American Magazine ; and Robert Benchley , who survived the avalanche as associate editor of Life . <P> Frank Sullivan set the pace for the short-story writers with one entitled " The Cub Reporter , or The Scoop , or A Slice of Life , or Zaza.
