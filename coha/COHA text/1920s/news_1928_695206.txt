txt Demands came from two sources yesterday for action by the City Administration to break up the private gang warfare which has caused several murders in New York streets recently . District Attorney Maieenan or the Bronx called upon the police to drive the gangste:z out of the Bronx . He promised them his support and obtained a pledge from the Bronx County Grand Jury to back up the police in an offensive against the gangs . W. J. L. Banham , President of the New York Board of Trade and Transportation , wrote a letter to Mayor Walker asking what had been done to arrest the gang murderers , and protesting against the failure of the police to prevent the gangs from using the public streets as battlefields . Demands Action . District Attorney made public the following statement : " Judging from press reports a new governmetis springing up in America  --  gang'vernment . It selects its leaders , rules its territories , rewards its friends and executes its enemies . Its existence is a challenge to the Police Department of lawful civil government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York shows a long list of victories over the small gangs who have heretofore swaggered through our streets and destroyed the liberties and happiness of our people . The police have always waged a defensive warfare with offensive methods . They have prevented crime boldly and forcefully . It is the only way to deal with gang government . Smash the gang and their government is smashed . " I suggest that we call a convention of the police departments of America , analyze the problem , adopt a platform , arm our forces and smash this gang government . " Every day three or four men are flung from flying automobiles , shot through their backs . Every day some new chieftain is caught before the muzzle of a machine gun . People often say , ' Well , these gangsters are only killing gangsters . Maybe if we encourage them they will all be dead soon . ' But we can not pass the problem off so easily . Give the gangster a permit to wage armed warfare in the public streets against his enemy gangster and he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over for sacking any legitimate industry and for vengeance any protesting citizen . He has become so bold as to attempt to kill a police officer assigned to run down the murderers of a gangster . In this country only one government can exist . That is a government of law and order . Any other government is an enemy within . It must be smashed . Praises the Bronx Police . " The police in Bronx County have had an enviable record . I praise them without reservation for their splendid work . I tell them now I shall support them in a defensive warfare against gangdom waged by offensive methods . Find the gangster , drive him out . ' This Summer will see millions of people . seeking recreation in the Bronx . They will crowd the highways , the parks and fill all transportation facilities . These people are our wards , as well as our masters . Cruising gangsters , armed racketeers are their enemies . Let us organize ' now to win any battles with gangdom in the homes and headquarters of the gangsters before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man , this morning , pledged themselves to support the police in their warfare on the gangster . " I concede that the problem is national in scope . It needs a national movement to cope with it . But as it crops up in the Bronx let us do our part to win the war on the enemy field . We will quit fighting when gang government hauls down its flag . " Asks Mayor What Has Been Done , Mr. Banham 's letter follows : Hon. James J. Walker , Mayor , City of New York , City Hall , New York City . Dear Sir : At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the New York Board of Trade and Transportation , held July 10 , I was requested to write to you the following letter . Has the condition commonly described as a " Crime Wave " returned ? What is being done officially to apprehend and bring to trial persons who commit murder in the most open and high-handed manner , e'en in the densely congested business sections of our city ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary for the citizens of New York to organize and raise a huge sum of money , as was done in Chicago , to restore law and order ? I refer to recent murders reported in the newspapers alleged to have been committed as a result of a war between rival gangs engaged in unlawful businesses . The New York Board of Trade and Transportation , one organization of the City reflecting public opinion , must protest against the conditions that permit our thoroughfares to be used as a battleground by these groups endangering the lives and property of peaceful citizens , and violating all sense of law and order . The public is not concerned with the issues at stake between the contesting parties . There is , however , a keen feeling of disappointment that the offenders are still at large , and other murders of this character have been threatened and might readily occur . May we respectfully inquire if the police have the situation under control , and if steps have been taken to protect the public against a recurrence ? Very truly yours , W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang leader 's protection . They believe he knows who killed Uale and why , but that he , like others of Uale 's gang , prefers to seek revenge in his own way without recourse to the law . Periani is the last man known to have talked with Uale before he was killed . Periani was arrested ostensibly on a burglary charge . This was only an excuse to hold him for questioning . Magistrate Rudich in the Coney Island Court discharged him for lack of evidence on the burglary charge yesterday . Julian V. Carabba of Brooklyn , attorney for Mrs. Mary Uale , the gang leader 's first wife , announced yesterday she would press her claim for dower rights in her husband 's es tate on the ground that her interlocutory decree of divorce had not been made final at the time he was killed . She has been unable so far to discover the large sums of money Uale is alleged to have hidden in safe deposit boxes . The killing of two Porto Ricans and the wounding of two others in the Red Hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no connection with the gang wars . The police arrested Neil Cerata , a chauffeur , 25 years old , of 20 Third Place , Brooklyn , charging him with homicide and asserting that he was one of a group of Italians who attempted to flirt with a Porto Rican woman . Mrs. Mary Perris of 172 Columbia Street , Brooklyn , a Porto Rican , told the police that Cerata was one of four Italians who accosted her on the street early Monday evening in front of her home . She called her husband , Jose , who came with several friends . There was a fist fight , in which the Italians were driven away . About 9 o'clock , she said , she saw Cerata and several others drive by in a green sedan . At Sackett and Van Brunt Streets several men in a green sedan fired a fusilade of shots at four Porto Ricans standing on the corner . Golitto Marrero , 22 years old , of 90 Atlantic Avenue , and Florentino Just , 19 , of 13 Columbia Street , were killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Isaac Garcia , 18 , of 92 DeGraw Street , were wounded . The murderers escaped in their automobile . Cerata , when arrested , denied that he had anything to do with the shooting . EX-WIFE OF KANOWITZ UP . Held in Narcotics Case , She Is Questioned for Clue in His Murder . The fact that Mrs. Lillian Meltzer , 22 years old , who is awaiting trial in the Federal court on a charge of acting with others in placing narcotics in a safety deposit box of the Fordham branch of the Colonial Bank , is the former wife of Benjamin Kanowitz has spurred Assistant District Attorney Ryan of the Homicide Bureau to learn whether she can furnish a clue to the identity of persons who killed Kanowitz on July 1 by putting a bomb under his car in front of his home at 611 West 171st Street . Mr. Ryan was in the Federal Building last Monday when the woman , who is 22 years old , pleaded not guilty to the narcotic charge and , was released by Federal Judge Cava- 11 nah in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her arraignment and said yesterday that he would continue the questioning this week when she is brought to his office . It was reported that Federal and local authorities investigating the slaying of Kanowitz and Frankie Cale , or Yale , the Brooklyn gang chief , had learned that both men had been asked to furnish bail for the woman . Kanowitz was understood to have declined , while Uale , it was said , was endeavoring to arrange for bail when he was killed by gunmen . Mrs. Meltzer was released in $5,000 bail soon after her arrest . A few weeks later she suffered a stroke of paralysis , which delayed her arraignment in the Federal court until last Monday . She had to be carried into court on a stretcher . Inasmuch as bail was furnished for her at the time of her arrest and again was furnished on her appearance in the Federal court yesterday , detectives who are investigating both killings were unable to understand why a request for bail should have been made to Kanowitz and Uale . HOPEFUL IN UALE MURDER . Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phone Call . The police failed to make r ay further progress yesterday toward clear ing up the murder of Francesco Uale , known in the underworld as Frankie Yale , a week ago Sunday afternoon , but said they expected an important development in the near future . It is believed that detectives have a line on the man who telephoned the gang leader and lured him to his death in a Brooklyn street . This man was a trusted associate of Uale in the alcohol " racket , " and is said to have been forced by Uale 's enemites at pistol point to call him up and make an appointment at a place where gunmen were waiting to kill him . Giuseppe Periani , called " the Clutching Hand " because his left hand had been crippled in a knife battle , was released yesterday afte : refusing to tell the police anything about Uale 's death during twentyfour hours ' questioning . The police say that Periani , an ex-convict , wile has been arrested several times for killings , was a member of Uale 's crang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
