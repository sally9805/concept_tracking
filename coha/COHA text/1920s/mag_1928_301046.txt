How might a glib varlet , lacking the nerve lo be an out- &-out; racketeer , make money out ' of Prohibition at small personal risk and outlay ? One way might be to impersonate a U.S. revenue agent and frighten hush money out of unsophisticated speakeasy proprietors . So thought one Thomas Harris , alias James Marshall , of Brooklyn . His technique : enter speakeasy , consume drinks , ask pointed questions , drop dark hints , increase hints to threats if necessary , pretend to " telephone headquarters " and show a fake revolver ( cigaret case ) if absolutely necessary . If threatened in return or asked to show a badge , leave discreetly . The underworld name for this whole act is " shake-down . " <P> Some 150 Manhattan speakeasies paid Down-Shaker Harris some $25,000 over a period of several weeks . He played the game at both ends , often telephoning to local Prohibition headquarters to " squeal " on proprietors he had found obdurate . <P> Last week , Down-Shaker Harris was arrested for impersonating an officer and for extortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain that they had already paid their protection fees and did not want to be further imposed upon .
