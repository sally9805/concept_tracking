txt District Attorney Edward Swann last night announced that he would request Francis G. Caffey , United States Attorney for this district , to prosecute the officers of the Sheffield Farms Company , milk distributers , for violating the Lever Wartime Food Conservation act . He declared his belief that in ordering the manager of the company 's plant at Franklinville , N. Y .. to urge dairymen in the section not to increase their supply of milk , and if possible to decrease it , the officers of the company violated a provision of the Lever lair against diminishing supplies of foodstuffs . The Lever act still is in effect , he said . ' ? The Lever act carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine of *10,000 . It declares it to lawful for any person " to restrict the supply of any necessaries ; to prevent , limit or lessen the manufacture and production of any necessaries in order to enhance the price thereof , " or " to aid or abet in any acts made unlawful " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Kings County Court . urged members of the Grand Jury to investigate the milk situation in Brooklyn , and to ferret out all profiteers in foodstuffs .

The District Attorney said the Federal and State laws applicable to the distribution of milk in this city had been carefully studied and that ? it was concluded that the Lever act had been violated by the officials of the Sheffield Farms Company in issuing the order to its manager at Franklinville. - He said he had discussed the company 's order with James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides being a representative of the Department of Justice , also is Federal Fair Price Commissioner in this State .

Horton also said that he did not see the order , which was posted on the door of the company 's plant at Franklinville by order of the director , but-that he could see nothing wrong in it . " I learned today that the young director who sent that order to the plant at Franklinville was Leroy A. Von Bomel , who lives at 870 Riverside Drive , and who is a director of the Sheffield By-Products Company , a subsidiary of the Sheffield Farms Company .

It is my belief it should be continued permanently on the statute books , as it has many features which State laws can not deal with . " It was explained by Mr. Talley that the Lever act has another important trend in dealing with the furnishing of milk to this city . He said that . dairies controlled by the large milk distributing companies in the city . are scattered through Maine , New Hasupshire , Vermont .
