txt // Home Economics I. ( First Year ) First Half Year . Selection of Clothing The emphasis should be placed during this half year on the wise choice of materials and clothing , whether home-made or readymade . This should include a study of textiles , their prices , kinds and adaptation to use , also inexpensive substitutes , adulteration of materials and information in relation to conservation and care of materials in the home and laundering of textiles . Darning , patching , and care of dress accessories are very important . Some lessons should be devoted to the study of the hygiene of clothing ; its daily use , care , and storage , as a phase of conservation of health and materials . A study of materials , color , line , style in costume as illustrative of a high school or college girl 's clothing , in adaptation to her uses . Placing the emphasis on the selection of clothing as indicated above does not mean the omission of the making of garments . Some construction of clothing should be offered , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be expected that she will become very expert in the making of garments , but that the preparation of even a single garment will give her some knowledge of the use of patterns , the sewing machine and the fundamental principles in the making of garments .

This series of lessons of eighty hours or twenty weeks of four hours per week might be arranged in four groups or units within the series , of twenty hours of instruction in each . Units I and II in this series might be devoted to the making of a simple shirtwaist dress , by machine , with the topics outlined in the above paragraph controlling the construction .

Home Economics I. ( First Year ) Second Half Year . Selection of Food The emphasis should be placed during this half year on the wise choice of food and instruction in food values , through the preparation of meals . The high school and college girl must often take some of her meals , at least , away from home and she should learn how to select wisely , within her means , that food which will furnish the nutritive values for healthful daily living . A course of lessons outlined so as to treat of the preparation of foods in the order of building a fire , washing dishes , cooking meat , fish , making batters , doughs , salads , desserts , will never accomplish this kind of instruction . This type of course is fast disappearing , but still remains in the less progressive schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its adaptation to the field of home economics studies . The studies during this half year should be so arranged that the girl will be given a knowledge of food values in relation to health . She should understand what quantity and kind of foods are necessary for a growing girl and should be taught how to select a balanced ration for a certain period of time . The care of foods in relation to health , the ice-box and its care , the proper handling of foods at home and in the market are important in their bearing on the large topic of selection of food . This does not mean that lessons in food preparation are to be omitted . Preparation of foods in relation to the meal as a whole should be offered , because it will give the girl a fuller appreciation of how to select and combine her foods . If she has made white sauce and realizes how essential it is that the starch should be cooked , she will be a better judge of such foods as she selects and will discover perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will be able to judge be132 TEACHING HOME ECONOMICS tween foods poorly prepared and those which are suitable to eat , and will avoid the places where the preparation of foods is not conducive to health . This half year of study should emphasize also the conservation of food supplies and the wise use of substitutes in relation to the health of all members of the family . Simple dietetics should be studied in relation to selection . This series of lessons of eighty hours or twenty weeks of four hours per week might be arranged in four groups or units within the series , with twenty hours of instruction in each . Units I and II in this series might be devoted to the preparation and serving of simple dishes for luncheons , breakfasts , and dinners with the emphasis as suggested above . Unit III might treat of conservation and the use of food substitutes through their preparation in addition to such subject matter as presented in Units I and II , with emphasis on the purchasing of food materials and the study of food industries . Unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their care in the home , suggestions for prevention of waste and additional consideration of food values . Home Economics II . ( Second Year ) First Half Year . " Applied Economics Studies " Earning money , spending it wisely , and learning to save are topics in which all high school and college girls should be interested . Many girls would pilot their ships through different channels if their attention were called to the many lines of opportunity for work and service which are open to girls and women . The high school girl is eager to learn about the necessary qualifications for these various opportunities . She wishes to know about the training for them and where and how to obtain it and the future outlook in the various fields . Somewhere in the high school course , time should be given to just such subject matter because it is so vital to the girl . She needs also to learn about her own budget . She may or may not have her own allowance , but at least she can estimate how much she is costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // the personal budget leads naturally to the discussion of the family income and its division , which is so important . The high school and the college girl need to understand in these days especially the necessity for thrift . She should also understand the customs , laws , and rules of savings banks and insurance companies , and the opportunities offered for saving . She ; should know how to keep accounts , and she should understand the use of bank checks and the principles of simple banking . This instruction may or may not be offered in some other courses or departments of the high school . The essential thing is to see that the high school girl going to college gets this information , and from the point of view , if possible , of the home and its requirements . This series . of lessons of eighty hours might also he arranged in groups or units of four series of twenty hours of instruction in each . Unit I might be devoted to the study of various opportunities for wage-earning open to girls and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high school or by the teacher of Home Economics if she will prepare herself . Bulletins and information may be obtained from the Intercollegiate Bureaus of Occupation , from the Federal Vocational Bureaus of the Department of Labor , located in about fifteen cities of the United States , from the Department of Research , Woman 's Educational and Industrial Union , Boston . These sources will suggest literature and other places to obtain information . ( See also bibliography , this book , page 420 . ) The girl in high school wishes information about the following points in relation to each vocation , and the talks might well be organized around these as a basis for discussion . Such talks , followed by conference hours , when the girls may consult the special vocational adviser or the teacher of Home Economics if this task fall to her , will be found of inestimable value to the high school girl seeking light along these lines , and will help her to plan her high school studies in a more intelligent way and tend to keep her in school for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit of twenty hours might be given to the discussion of the girl 's own budget . She may or may not have an allowance . Estimates can be made of the division if she has , or of the cost to her parents for certain items . The budget of an unknown girl with an allowance of $5 or $10 per week might be studied . The division for charity or church , for self , for others , for savings , might form the topics for discussion . This study would include also the clothing budget . It would lead to many interesting discussions of ideals , standards , appropriateness , con-servation , healthful living , simple pleasures , and the use of leisure time . This unit or series would lead up to the next one , Unit III , the family income . A discussion of the allowance for rent , food , clothing , operating expenses , and other expenses will be of value to the girl in enabling her to see her needs in relation to the needs of the family group , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The right division of income makes for happiness of the family group and the wrong division for misery . // Mr. Micawber in David Copperfield expresses in a proverbial way the agony of the difference between income and outgo , when the income does not equal the expenditures . Thrift is a necessary lesson to be emphasized , especially during these days of readjustment . The fourth unit of twenty hours of this series might be devoted to practical banking instruction , drawing checks , balancing checkbook ; savings ; insurance ; simple methods of accounts , etc . Every girl needs this knowledge for use either while away at school or at home . Home Economics II . ( Second Year ) Second Half Year . The Home , Its Care and Management This group of studies is especially interesting to the high school or college girl . At this period of her life she is interested in her own room and how to make it pretty . This may well be the avenue of approach to any study of home decoration and of furnishing . The care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of personal hygiene , are of great interest at this time . The questions of daily living and personal care are closely akin . Recreation , use of leisure hours , hospitality , and kinds of amusement within and without the home are all vitally important to her , and need to be discussed in order that the girl may plan her days most healthfully . The studies arranged for this half year may be divided into four groups of twenty hours each . Unit I might be planned so as to take up the principles of house decoration and furnishing , either in relation to the girl 's own room at college or at home , or in the discussion of the furnishings of a small house or apartment , where a limited sum is allowed for furnishings . In this connection , if a real house or apartment can be used the work will be much more vital and interesting . If this is not possible , a corner of a large room might be utilized and furnishings borrowed from a local department store . If no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned for discussion , with clippings from maga136 TEACHING HOME ECONOMICS zines used to illustrate them . Unit II might be devoted to the sanitation problems , cleaning the various rooms , laundering of household furnishings , repairs , cleaning of metals , glass , etc. , system of work in the home . The third unit might well be devoted to discussion of problems of personal hygiene , the care of the feet , body , hair , teeth , nails ; proper bathing , proper clothing , proper food , air , and sunshine , proper exercise and water , in relation to daily health . Questions of control , the emotions , anger , fear , hate , jealousy , and their effect on the health of the individual might also be discussed . The fourth unit might take up for discussion plans for daily healthful living . Recreation , hospitality in the home , entertaining in a simple way , amusements in the home , reading , music , knitting , and sewing should be considered ; amusements outside the home , concerts , movies , theaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , etc. , might be discussed with profit . Daily exercise should be suggested , such as tennis , hiking , and other simple pleasures . The relation of the individual to the community , the giving of service , the opportunities in relation to organized societies , groups , churches , settlements , home service work through the Red Cross , should be discussed . There are many opportunities to show the girl her social responsibility outside the home . 2 . Home economics studies for the girl in the four-year high school preparing for teaching . ? In many states the normal schools are unable to furnish sufficient teachers to meet the demands of the one room rural schools of the state . In Texas , for instance , 6000 teachers are employed in rural districts and in Iowa 12,500 annually . There are about 200 public normal schools in the United States doing teacher-training work , but they are entirely inadequate to the needs . Only seventy-two of these have rural departments . However , 22 states provide for the training of teachers in high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home economics training , their influence would have been valuable in developing home economics in rural schools . The high school graduate either with or without professional instruction often finds her way into the rural school . In the state of Illinois alone 4000 // schools are taught by young people who have had no professional training whatever . Two thirds of this group are not even high school graduates . As a rule they must teach all studies , and in some states the present laws require that they must teach some home economics studies , in addition to all of the other studies . The problem then of training this young teacher is a very serious one . The pity is that it is necessary to furnish teachers for our rural schools who have had so little general education . Nevertheless the training in the high school of the rural school-teacher has latent possibilities . In Minnesota to-day 121 high schools are training their seniors or high school graduates for this rural work . As the problem must be met , let us study it in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to this high school girl , who will so soon in turn teach them to girls and often to boys in the rural schools . In the first place , the work should be so planned and arranged during these four years that it is of help to the girl herself ; and in the second place , it must be so organized and presented to her in some course or courses that she will get suggestions and help in relation to the type of subject matter to be presented to rural children and certain methods of presenting it . In view of the fact that many teachers in rural and small town communities enter the teaching field immediately after graduation from high school , and that there is a growing demand for Home Economics as part of the regular grade work , it is necessary to provide for such students a normal training course during the upper years of the high school . During the first and second years of the high school course , it is possible in many high schools for the girl taking the general course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elect , either as work in science or in Home Economics , some of the studies relating to the home . It is often possible for her to elect from two to four units of work along these lines during the first and second years of her course in high school . This work should be so organized as to be of particular interest and value to her in daily living . The subject matter offered during these two years might // be outlined as suggested on page 129 and give her a general sur vey and a feeling for the significance of these home studies as a whole . This survey course would be equivalent to but one unit of credit , and might be offered in the first year with particular adaptations made for this girl and her problem . Other units of work might follow during the first or second year , as , for example , a more detailed course in food preparation and food values and a more detailed course in clothing and textiles , either as half or full units of credit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to five units are required for what is called normal training or peda gogy in addition to other high school studies . This usually includes the following studies , with approximately this division of time . The arrangement of these normal studies varies in different high schools , but this is approximately the amount of time devoted to them where the work is offered during two years ( 3d and 4th ) . The relation of the normal training work in Home Economics to the normal training for teaching the general elementary studies in the rural school must be arranged . The psychology and prin ciples of teaching with observation of teaching in the third year or junior year would lead up to a course in the fourth or senior year // in methods of teaching Home Economics . This must necessarily be brief . It would seem wise to offer this work in methods of teaching Home Economics in relation to a practical course in subject matter in home economics studies in this final or fourth high school year , and to have it accompanied by at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases of Home Economies during a full semester , probably the second half year , as a part of the practice teaching work in general elementary studies . One day a week for about twenty weeks with criticism would be very helpful . The practice teaching in this year should have been preceded by observation in the third high school year of lessons in this field of work . A demonstration school and a " teacherage " if available will serve as equipment of inestimable value in this practice teaching , in rural community work in Home Economics . ( For suggestions in relation to lesson plans , use of illustrative material , and classroom management , see page 269 , Part III . ) This particular combination of subject matter and methods course during the first semester should be planned to give subject matter and methods of teaching each subject along the following lines for sixth , seventh , and eighth grade classes : 1 . Food . ? The planning and preparing of meals . This should be actual preparation of the school lunch and dishes suitable for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plans for getting supplies and cooperation with the homes should be discussed . Demonstrations of presentation of such lesson by the teacher in charge , with discussion of method , lesson plans , questioning , etc . Use of illustrative materials , plans for getting equipment , its wise use and care should also be discussed . 2 . Personal hygiene and appearance , social customs in our homes . ? This work might be given in relation to the preparation and serving of the school lunch , table customs in passing food and in table conduct ; eating properly , observance of common courtesy customs at table ; simple lessons in personal hygiene , as care of teeth , mouth , hair , body , nails ; personal appearance , lessons in relation to cleanliness and neatness of clothing , correct carriage , position in walking , breathing properly , etc . Such lessons are often // very much needed by children , and should be given with illustrations and practical demonstrations of the right ways of doing things , followed by practice in actual doing . A few lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home will prove necessary and helpful . 3 . Sanitation of the schoolroom , the school-yard , the various rooms of the home , the outbuildings of the farm . ? This series of lessons might start with actual cleaning of the schoolroom , making it attractive with plants and curtains and clean windows and floors . The care of the school-yards and outbuildings and care of the various rooms of the home with credit for home work . This would follow discussions and cleaning of schoolroom . Also sanitation of the farm , location of buildings , care , disposal of waste , care of toilets , cellars , barns . Milk , its care and protection , and labor-saving devices in the farm home . 4 . Study of clothing , with emphasis on the care and repair of clothing in addition to the making of simple articles and garments . ? Actual articles should be made by the class , adapted to children in rural schools , in grades 6 , 7 , 8 . Simple articles should be made , such as dish-towels , bags , holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches , principles , and processes in both hand and machine sewing . Lessons in care and repair of clothing are most important , and the utilization of all kinds of scraps both old and new . Discussions should accompany the work which will give these normal students ideas in relation to equipment , how to supply it , and cost . Demonstrations should be given which will show how to present these stitches and processes , the use of illustrative material and discussion of lesson plans . During the period that garments for refugees are needed in Europe , these may well be substituted for personal garment construction problems . The subject matter in laundering , patching , care , and conservation of clothing materials may well form a part of all such courses of study . It is possible to teach all the necessary stitches , principles , and processes on these as on personal articles ; and the children are always intensely interested in this work or in working for others , either at home or abroad . // This methods course should also help the students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sixth , seventh , and eighth grades which will be based on other industrial studies of the preceding years , and should teach them how to arrange a course which will introduce studies of value to the children along these various lines suggested , so that some unity of thought and purpose in this study may be maintained ( see suggestions for courses for elementary schools , page 91 ) . To sum up , then : The normal training course in Home Economics should be taught in such a way as : ( a ) To indicate the scope of the subject matter without loss of thoroughness in the teaching of fundamental principles . ( b ) To enable the student to select from the types of material presented the theory and practice best adapted to the needs of the children to be taught . ( c ) To show the importance of unifying rather than differentiating the various phases of Home Economics . ( d ) To emphasize the opportunities for correlation with other subjects in the curriculum and with the interests of the homes and the communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of live problems as the basis for organizing the course . 3 . Home economics studies for the girl choosing the general course in high school . Many girls proceed from elementary to high school with a very vague idea of the meaning of a high school course or the desirability of one . They often think they may or may not proceed to college . With this uncertainty of purpose parents and advisers are apt to suggest the rather general type of high school course for these girls . It is a " trying out " time , for this girl and her interests and " dominant purposes " may emerge rather slowly . The high school courses should be flexible enough in their arrangement to permit her to change her objective when necessary . Such general courses as outlined by many high schools of the United States are given various titles , such as the general course , // the home economics course , the manual arts course , etc . This general type of course does not as a rule aim to prepare for college entrance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many girls who can not afford higher education and who leave school at the end of this period , many to remain at home , either their own or their parents ' , and others to pursue industrial or commercial occupations of various kinds . Occasionally the general course in high school leads to normal school training . As a rule English , history , and a modern language are required in such a course with some of the sciences . The electives suggested are usually in the field of mathematics , art , and the practical arts . This makes possible rather an extensive program in the home economics studies , which a girl so interested might pursue during the four years of her high school course . In other so-called general courses offered in high school , the home economics studies are required at least during three years . From 6 to 15 periods a week in home economics studies , including drawing , are offered , and in addition the related sciences , general science , physics , chemistry , biology , physiology with hygiene , and mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addenda will be seen a typical program of this type . The problems confronting those interested in the organization of the home economics courses for the girl choosing this rather general type of course are very simple compared with the organization of such studies for the girl who has a more limited amount of time in which to pursue this work . This education in Home Economics should enable the girl to share the home responsibilities intelligently and to take her place in community life as a promoter of its welfare . What studies does this girl need to enable her to render this service to home and community is the problem confronting the organizer of such a program for girls . The responsibility of choosing these studies rests with the organizer , as the worth and value of all of the home economics studies are weighed in relation to this girl 's needs . Suggestive sequence of home economics studies for the four years of this general type of high school course : // Time . 6 to 10 periods per week . First year . ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become adjusted to what might almost be called a university system of work . She feels lost , as it were , and must find her place and relationships . One of the most helpful things that can be done at this time is to present to her suggestions for possible avenues of study . She is beginning to formulate plans for the future , and begins to think about choice of studies , courses , and particular objectives for life work and service . Such a series of lessons might be outlined as part of one of the home economics courses in the first year , or presented at the regular assembly hour to the whole school . It might be given to the girls of the first year only by the vocational adviser of the school or the home economics teacher , if she is prepared to offer such assistance because of her interest in vocational opportunities through home economics work . This guidance will be of inestimable value to the girl and save time and energy as she plans her high school course . Suggestions have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in outlining this unit or series of lessons , whether it be offered as a part of the home economics work or in some other way . It should suggest not only the possible avenues and fields of opportunity open to the high school girl trained in Home Economics , but various possibilities of an industrial , agricultural , commercial , and homemaking kind for which the high school may prepare . It might also suggest the particular introductory courses in high school which will prepare for further training after the high school period , in technical fields such as nursing , or business , normal training , etc . Some of the studies of the first half year may be devoted to garment construction and textile study . Garments for children , for day nursery use , asylums , homes for the aged , may offer opportunities for practice in stitches , processes , use of sewing machine , patterns , etc. , depending on the previous training and experience of the girls in sewing and textile study in the elementary school . Even though no previous work may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for instruction , // either new or supplementary , in this aspect of the home economies work . During the second half of this first year a general survey course in Home Economics may be offered to advantage . This might be arranged so as to cover some of the topics discussed on pages 130 and 132 , IIomc Economics I and II . This survey should give the girl an idea of this field of study as a whole which she will take up more in detail in succeeding years . Should she be unable to continue her high school course she will at least have had the elements in this field of work and perhaps an incentive for further study . If she has had little home economics work in the elementary school , this will serve as a review and an introduction to what is to follow . This survey course , with the vocational guidance work offered during the first half year , should start her on her high school career in a more intelligent way than most high school girls begin . Second year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half may be profitably devoted to work in food preparation . This should be based on the introductory manipulative work of the grades , and the general science course of the first high school year . The high school work in foods , however , should be closely correlated with the sciences being taught , and the home economics teacher should be so familiar with the studies offered in the related courses in science that she will " tie up " the particular information given in her classes with that offered in the science laboratories , as the science teachers should with the subject matter being offered in the home economics laboratory . The meal should form the basis for work during this half year , and the food preparation , while similar to that offered in the elementary school or in the survey course , should be more closely tied up wit h t he sciences . The number of foods prepared may be more extensive and include many new dishes for breakfast , luncheon , and dinner . Suggestions for serving should also form a part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship to the art course iii choice of dishes , simplicity of table decorations , color schemes , etc . Marketing , care of food , conservation of // foods with use of substitutes in food preparation , and nutritive values should all be introduced from lesson to lesson in a natural way , as there is need and motive for so doing . During the second half of the second year more detailed work in clothing may be offered . This should be closely related to the design courses and should have as its aim to teach the girl how to dress attractively and suitably for all occasions , keeping in mind the conservation and economical use of clothing materials . This course should include construction of personal garments , such as kimonos , middy waists , shirt waists , simple one-piece cotton dresses , wool skirts , etc . Whenever possible the use of made-over materials should be encouraged . Darning of stockings , patch ing and mending of clothing and household linens , such as gloves , underwear , table linen , etc. , may be provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once or twice a month , when such problems may be discussed and the necessary instruction given . Running parallel with the laboratory classes in construction of garments may be offered a course of at least one period a week in discussion and study of textiles , their kind , use , cost , and con servation . Whenever possible the home economics teacher should cooperate with the art teacher , and the sequence of problems should be dis cussed so that foresight may be exercised and the designs and patterns for the garment problems discussed in the art classes . Third year . ? During the third year it is possible to offer to advantage a course on the home , its selection , furnishing , care , and management . The home economics work of this year may be devoted to this study , with a discussion period running parallel to the laboratory classes throughout the year . The girls are pre-pared by this time to take an interest in the conduct and manage ment of an apartment or practice house . If possible such equip ment should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course . The following lines of thought may be introduced in such a course , the discussion work being planned for during the single period , and the laboratory practice running parallel to it during the double periods . // // This course could be worked out in two parts of three units each half year . The first half might be devoted to the study of the selection , furnishing , and sanitation of the home , and the second half to the management of the house and care of the members of the family . The girls should be made to feel that they can // contribute at once to the welfare and happiness of the family group , and that it is not necessary to wait until they have homes of their own to utilize the knowledge learned in this course . If a system of credit for home work along the various lines of housewifery and management can be arranged it will be found an advantageous way of checking up the knowledge gained in the school laboratory . In the home-life high schools of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance and board near the schools , it is possible to work out a series of practice houses which will afford opportunities for all of the home-work outlined to be put into daily practice . Care must be taken , however , that the teacher in charge of the home economics studies at the school does not have the double duty of teacher by day and matron and manager of the practice houses at night . It is impossible for one woman to do both well . Care must also be exercised in planning the work of the students , as it is impossible for a girl to attend to all of her school studies and at the same time to the home duties for a group . If a system of work is planned , it will be possible during one term of the third or fourth year for each girl to carry a somewhat lighter program at school in order to have time for the household work . School credit should be given for this work . Fourth Year . ? By the time the girl reaches her fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sciences and the home economics studies for a more detailed course in dietetics as related to the home . If this can be offered in relation to a real problem in living in a practice house , so much the better .

This course should include he feeding of children through the various stages of growth , planning of dietaries based on the 100-calorie portions , with calculation of the caloric value of foods and food combination . Type dishes can 1w prepared suitable for diet in certain common diseases . During the last half of the fourth year a course in " Home Problems " can be worked out which will offer the girls further practice in the studies which have been taken during the first three years . This half year may be divided into three units . In planning // the studies for this general course in high school , at least seven hours per week should be devoted to the home economics studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making the following suggestions : Unit I.

Trimming of old hats , remaking , use of old materials in cutting down and making of garments for chil dren , use of old shirts , stockings , underwear for small garments or household mops , dishcloths , holders , etc . Choice may be made of one of the following units during the last third of the year , if the staff is large enough to permit the several lines of study to be offered . Unit III .

Unit IV . Making the Graduation Gown Five weeks of ten hours per week . In this course opportunity should be offered to the girl who wishes to make her own gradua150 TEACHING HOME ECONOMICS tion dress to do so . Simplicity should be the keynote , ? simple design , simple decoration , simple , inexpensive materials .

The girls should plan designs , purchase , and execute this work , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of a test of ability and conducted under the direction of the teacher . Unit V. The Home and Citizenship Five weeks of ten hours per week . This course should show the girl her relationship to community and civic interests . Field work should be arranged . It should be based on the discussions of the third year and her study of civics and economics . She should be led to see the relationship of the home to national welfare through discussion of the economic problems of the community , state , and nation . There are many good courses in home economics being offered in all parts of the United States which fall within the general classification offered at the beginning of this discussion , as general in character . The home-craft course offered at the Wadleigh High School , New York , is rather typical , as is also the course at Hollywood High School , Los Angeles , California ; the general course of the Springfield High School , Springfield , Massachusetts ; Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , home economics course , and others in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the girl choosing any one of the technical or vocational courses in high school : ( a ) Vocational commercial course . ?

This course usually includes filing , office practice , and the regular studies of stenography , typewriting , and bookkeeping , in addition to the prescribed academic studies , with penmanship , commercial arithmetic , etc. // In some high schools girls choosing the commercial course elect the field of salesmanship as the business course , instead of stenography . This field of work is increasing in popularity , as is illustrated in Boston , where 475 were graduated last year from the salesmanship department of the high school . This course includes , in addition to academic studies , training in department store work , business principles , and practice in various stores in selling goods . The girls are made to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it is so often counted . The store work is no longer routine , but the girls see the relationship of this work to a larger life in all directions . In these various phases of commercial work , the girl choosing one of these lines of specialization has as her major interest stenography or salesmanship ? a business career . She takes the academic studies because they enable her to do her work more efficiently and they are directly related to her needs . The girl has other needs just as vital , as for instance how to live wisely and healthfully , what to eat in order to be most efficient in business life , how to clothe herself appropriately as a business girl , and how to divide her income most wisely and effectively in order to secure the greatest satisfaction . The commercial high school course should provide also for this need of the business girl , and should offer such units in home economics studies as will be adapted to her needs and interests . On page 129 suggestions are made for certain units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial girl should be so arranged that some time during her three or four years of high school study it is possible for her to take at least three of these units . The units as suggested on page 129 were planned for the girl preparing for college who has a limited amount of time for the work . The commercial girl is preparing for business and also has a limited amount of time which can be devoted to home economics studies . In both cases it would be well if the work could be a definitely prescribed part of both courses . While the time of girls in both of these groups is limited , their interests differ . Both groups of girls might be taught in the same sections of the suggested units if the high school is not large enough // to permit of differentiation in relation to the interests of two groups ; but the applications of work should be suggested according to the needs of the girl going to college and the girl entering business life , in relation to the selection of food , clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) Vocational agricultural courses ( see page 209 , Courses of study for rural schools ) . ( c ) Vocational home-making course . ? The vocation of homemaking is a complex occupation and includes many duties . If one stops to analyze the tasks practiced by the wife and mother in the home they are very numerous . She is cook , seamstress , house decorator , manager , financier , counselor , nurse . The duties include the care of the sick , the training of children , the purchase of foods and their preparation into meals , the purchase , care , and repair and often making of clothing , the furnishing of the home , the plans for spending the family income , ? in fact hers has been called an " undifferentiated job , " and one which requires all the patience of Job . The vocational home-making course in high school has , then , as its aim the training of girls in these many duties as practiced by the wife and mother in the home . The home-making course will be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending the regular vocational home-making course of four years , in short units , either during the day or at night , and will be taken by the older women and young married women as well as by high school girls . Both elementary courses and those advanced in character will be offered in order to meet the needs of those attending . The high school of the future will offer to girls who expect to be married soon an intensive one-year course of training in home-making . The discussion here deals with the vocational home-making course as offered to the girl in the four-year high school . The girl who will choose this course does so very often because she is domestically inclined or because she knows she does not care to continue her studies beyond the high school period . Many high schools of the United States have offered courses in Home Economics which have included the many studies outlined for this training in home-making . // In fact the high school course elected by the girl as the general , and often called the general course or home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches . The varia-tion made in the new type of vocational home-making course is that it will offer not only a greater differentiation of courses but more opportunity for practice in the use of the knowledge gained . It is true that in many high schools the major , called the home economics course , has included some practice in managing a home in a practice cottage or apartment ; but it is quite certain that in the vocational home-making course in the high schools of the future this will be a very important and distinctive Feature . The girls choosing this course will reside in the practice house for a certain period of time and have opportunity to practice the knowledge gained in the laboratory courses . This is being ( lone to-day in some of the farm-life schools of the South and in certain localities in Minnesota and Wisconsin . The homes of the high school girls offer a natural laboratory for practice , and if plans and arrangements can be made for sufficient supervision by the teaching staff , a system of work in the homes with school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February , 1917 , provides for training in vocational home-making . According to the terms of that bill , in cities of 25,000 or over , those choosing the vocational home-making course should devote one half of the day to the voca-tional subjects , such as The other half day must be given to the non-vocational and related subjects : // in home-making although given in a so-called trade school for girls . A practice cottage is conducted in connection with this course and all the work of the years is so planned that after completion of four years the graduate will be able to enter wage-earning occupations which are outgrowths of Home Economics if she does not at once become a home-maker or work in the home of her parents or others . ( d ) Vocational industrial courses . ? Each recurring census shows an increasing number of women in wage-earning occupations . In Part I , page 60 , some of the statistics are given . The war has undoubtedly opened some fields of work to women which have been closed in the past . Industry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many have left school attracted by the high wages or have been forced into industry through the necessity of the home because wage-contributing brothers have been called to the service . Teachers of all subjects should take it upon themselves as a special duty to persuade girls whenever possible to complete a full high school course . This is especially vital because the women of to-morrow will have many new problems of reorganization to meet and must be educationally equipped to handle them . The majority of girls can not remain for a full high school course and avail themselves of training which will prepare for wageearning . The high schools of the future will offer short courses of one or two years of intensive training in preparation for wageearning in industrial pursuits as well as short courses in preparation for commercial business life . It . should be borne in mind that " more education pays . " The following page from Pamphlet 270 , January , 1917 , published by the National Child Labor Committee , 105 E. 22d St. , New York City , shows this value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues for industrial training in school for those who are so inclined and expect soon to enter wage-earning industries because it is impossible for them to pursue a long school course . The illustration portrays graphically the advantages to be gained . // IT PAYS TO STAY IN SCHOOL Vocational industrial education for girls between the ages of 14 and 18 may be of various kinds , such as training for the art industries , in metal , wood , textile and costume design , and illus tration ; training for skilled machine operating , novelty work , and industrial work in connection with food preparation , and the clothing industries of dressmaking , millinery , and others . This // text is concerned only with the discussion of those vocational industrial courses in high school which are the outgrowth of the home economics studies ; they are briefly those industries which are concerned with the manufacture of clothing and food materials into articles of greater value . The following four points should be borne in mind in planning any type of vocational industrial course in high school , whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which grow out of home economics studies . 1 . That all girls entering industry , no matter what line of specialization may be chosen , need some instruction in the home economics studies , and provision should be made for these in their courses as well as for English , arithmetic , civics , and other studies . It is true that but a limited amount of time can be given to Home Economics as such , when the goal is industry , but it should not be omitted . It can be touched indirectly through other studies , as personal hygiene and care of children , through the physical training classes ; study of the budget and textile study through the mathematics and English courses ; and some study of foods through assistance given in the school lunch room , supplemented by instruction during special periods or even in the English class in composition . This means close cooperation on the part of teachers . 2 . That no matter what special vocation of an industrial nature may be chosen in high school , opportunity should be offered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenues investigated by their instructors for the use of the knowledge gained . This may be possible in " in and out " work in the third or fourth years when part of their time is spent in school and part in industry . This may be the plan also for opportunities for shop work in dressmaking or in catering where food is produced in large quantities for sale in a school shop or for lunch room use . 3 . That all girls need some studies for their " spiritual as well as material advancement . " When the high school vocational industrial course of three or four years is chosen other studies besides the industrial should be prescribed , although it must be kept constantly in mind in making plans for industrial courses that the // girl has a fixed goal of preparation for wage-earning in a particular industry . 4 . That no vocational course should be offered unless there is a community demand and a place in industry where girls can find employment after completing this course . A good illustration of a survey made of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school courses to meet those needs may be found in the Minneapolis Survey , or that for a state , in the Indiana Survey . ' The following suggestions are made for all girls choosing the vocational industrial courses in high school without regard to specialization . On page 129 will be found outlined certain units of study in Home Economics . While these were outlined for the girl preparing for college they are suggestive and capable of adaptation to the needs of the girl who stays three or four years in high school but who will proceed to business in some line of industry . It is such units of work which all girls going into industry need , and the work out-lined , while brief , will give the girl going to business a good founda tion for future study and an intelligent understanding of home problems . They will also be of help to her in daily living in choosing her food , clothing , and living place , and in the wise spend ing of her income . Suggestions for specialization in : Vocational Industrial Courses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Interests It is true that the general home economics training given in the elementary school or in the first high school year may have aroused interest in a special line of wage-earning connected with this study , and that this is often pursued later in high school . It is suggested that when a vocational industrial course is chosen in high school at least half of the school time should be de160 TEACFIING HOME ECONOMICS voted to the technical line of specialization chosen . Those industrial studies which have grown out of the home economics work are connected closely with either foods or clothing . The needle trades have been largely taken from the home . The food industries have passed from the home more slowly than the clothing . There are many high schools of the country offering good vocational industrial courses in clothing and a few which are considering the vocational aspects of the food studies for high school girls . This specialized study should not begin before the second or third year and during the first two years opportunities should be given the students to try several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to give them a view of some of the various opportunities and to make it reasonably sure that the work chosen is the best suited to the needs and capabilities of each particular student . The equipment should duplicate that to be found in any wellequipped workroom representative of each of the several industries ? power machines for dressmaking , steam tables and hotel ranges for cooking , power washing machines and electric irons for the laundry . The courses offered should duplicate as far as possible trade conditions , such as repetition of processes for skill , speed , quality of workmanship , hours of work , etc . Some of these vocational courses are practicable only in the large city high school , but adaptations can be made to meet local conditions in the smaller cities . In all of these courses business management and business method should be taught . Opportunities for practice should be furnished during a part of the course in the school laboratories , but ( luring the last year other opportunities outside the schoolroom in actual establishments should be provided , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the best vocational schools of to-day . The greatest problem in establishing vocational industrial courses is to find the proper teacher . It is difficult to find one who is // equipped with the necessary practical experience and who at the same time has sound educational principles to guide her in the teaching of her subject and her pupils . " Whether it would be better to put a trained teacher into a shop or lunch room , or a woman with practical experience into a training school is an open question , and so , as always , we turn to the ideal teacher as the only solution of the problem before us . Home Economies will not have its full vocational value until the teacher has a scientific foundation , practical efficiency , and good teaching method , and is heartily supported by the school boards of the land . " A. Clothing Courses : The vocational course which has been more highly developed than any other in high school is dressmaking . At least half of the school day should be devoted to this work . Attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Los Angeles High School ; the Worcester Trade School courses of four years in dress-making ; and the Boston High School of Practical Arts . The Washington Irving High School of New York City offers a three-year technical course in dressmaking where opportunity is " of fered for shop practice in certain near-by dressmaking establish ments . " The aim of most high school courses has been to train the girl for home dressmaking and as a rule no shop facilities for practice have been offered . It is highly desirable that practice either in a school shop where orders may be taken for faculty or parents , or opportunity for pupils to work in near-by dressmaking establish ments should be provided by the school . The following general suggestions are made for courses offered to girls choosing the vocational industrial courses in dressmaking or millinery : First year . ? In addition to the academic studies of English , history , general science , etc. , some units of study in Home Eco nomics as suggested on pages 129 to 136 should be offered . These are of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such units to choose her special line of vocational work more intelligently and she will get ideas in relation to general house162 TEACHING HOME ECONOMICS wifery , cooking , sewing , earning , and spending money which will be of value to her throughout her course . When the course covers four years , specialization in any one line of industrial work is not advisable until the second or third year . Other three years . ? Dressmaking or millinery at least 10 hours with supplementary art of 4 hours in color design , etc. , and 1 hour of related textile study . a . Dressmaking . Second year . ? By this time the girl should have as a basis for work all the stitches and processes which are used in the construction of such garments as underwear , aprons , clothing for children , kimonos , etc . The use of the sewing machine and commercial patterns should be reviewed and if necessary taught with practice on the above articles during the first half of this year . The need for garments for the poor presents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent practice . The second half year may be used for dressmaking of a preparatory nature such as simple dresses and uniforms of cotton materials , plain shirt waists , skirts , and middy blouses . A little drafting should be introduced here in order that the girl may learn to interpret patterns and may see more clearly the relationship of the lines of the pattern to the human figure . This study of interpretation and relationship to figure leads naturally to the free making and use of patterns in drafting and draping . Third year . ? The aim should be to make the girl useful as an assistant in a dressmaking shop . Custom work on orders should be done if possible on such articles or garments as were made during the second year . Visits to shops on opening days with discussions of styles as studied in their origin in the costume history and design course will prepare the way for the fourth year of work . In addition work on skirts of wool , woolen or silk dresses may be undertaken wit Ii the making of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern-making and change of patterns should be given . Remodeling of garments brought in by pupils or others , with mending , laundering , renovating , and repairing , should form a part of this year 's work . The related textile work // should introduce the repair and renovation in the study presented of weaves , prices , kinds of materials , and the effect of hot water , etc. , on silk and wool in laundering . Fourth year . ? Aim to prepare the girl to work more freely so that she may have sufficient confidence in herself and enough initiative to work as visiting dressmaker or to work at dressmaking for customers at home if she does not wish to enter the dressmaking establishments of others . Work in shop practice should be offered with opportunity for simple cutting , fitting , draping , and making of patterns ; at least half of this year should be devoted to shop practice . b . Millinery . Millinery is a short-season trade and any girl choosing this course because of talent or particular aptitude and liking for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that during the slack seasons she may not be out of employment . The trade offers many attractions for those with artistic impulse for this work . To be successful a combination of art and skill is desirable and almost necessary . The making and trimming of hats includes many mechanical processes and good technique is required , but neither avails unless an artistic hand contributes to the result . At the Boston High School of Practical Arts the pupils who specialize in millinery are permitted to elect two periods in salesmanship as a complementary major during the second , third , and fourth years . This enables the girl to fill stock or selling positions in the store during slack seasons in the millinery workroom . A study is made of textiles which will enable the girl to sell them intelligently and which will acquaint her with the problems of labor , marketing , and transportation in manufacture . The department store is studied and its organization and system taken up , so that girls are prepared for the positions of stock girls , cashiers , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are discussed and subjects are introduced such as minimum wage , Consumers ' League , etc. , which awaken in the girl a new attitude of mind towards such work . // As millinery is based on simple sewing it is wise to offer also in the second year a course suggested for the first half of the second year under dressmaking , as this may offer an avenue to the girl who does not care for salesmanship to gain employment during dull seasons , in shops where novelty sewing such as lamp shades , house furnishing work in making of slip covers , etc. , may be done . The survey of any locality will determine what should be the accompanying line of interest . Second year or third year . ? Practice in sewing as suggested under dressmaking , second year . The aim of the work in millinery during the second and third years should be to train the girl for the many lines of preparing which are required of a milliner 's assistant . The work of this year should include the making of bandeaux , frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on facings and bindings , making of ornaments of materials . The art and textile instruction should be closely related in their study of materials , kinds , prices and in color , line , and becomingness of hats to certain types of faces . Third year or fourth year . ? More practice in making and covering buckram and wire frames of various styles , for winter and spring . Study of shop practice and styles in class discussions . Remodeling of hats , renovation of materials based on the study of textiles , utilization of old materials and suggestions for conservation . Study of novelties in hat making as offered by the season . Fourth year . ? Work with fur , crepe or nun 's veiling and net , in making of winter and summer hats for motoring , garden hats of net , lingerie , etc . Discussion of cost , prices , computing value of the finished work , labor , overhead expenses , etc . Discussion of trimming by specialists brought to the school . Opportunity for practice in making bows , finishings , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year when practicable in large cities . Sketching , study of styles , etc. , in the art classes should run parallel with this work . // B. Food Courses and other vocational lines of study : It is only within the last five years that any attention has been given to what might be called the development of commercial cookery and housewifery in the vocational departments of high schools . Until recently there have been greater opportunities for girls in the fields of clothing than in that of foods , for high school girls have been considered too immature to undertake lunch room work or catering . However , the increasing number of small tea rooms and catering establishments has created a demand for trained assistants to tea room and lunch room managers and caterers ; and high school girls can be fitted for such positions . At times a decided taste and talent for some specialized form of food work is discovered , such as candy-making , jelly-making , or canning fruits and the pupil may be helped to develop this par-ticular interest . While these industrial pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are so closely related to them by reason of the subject matter and materials handled that they are sometimes considered as coming under the jurisdiction of the home economics department of work . Cater-ing , tea-room assisting , or some form of specialized food study as candy-making , specialization in housewifery branches as laundering , etc. , may also be considered here . For any of these types of occupations a strong basis in science is desirable but it should be the science applied directly to the ma-terials the pupils are using and to the needs of the industry they are studying . A knowledge of marketing and buying , the nutritive value of foods , the balanced menu , and other phases of dietetics , should form a part of the program for the girl whose occupation will grow out of the work in foods . Quantities prepared should be such as would be practicable in establishments of the type studied and skill , accuracy , and speed should be acquired . Fine laundry work such as the laundering of fine shirt waists , lingerie of all kinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be developed for this young girl . With very little equipment this occupation could be carried on in the girl 's own home , a decided advantage oftentimes . b // Art needlework , embroidery , crocheting , and knitting are special phases of home economics work that have proved profitable to many . A clever person who anticipates the needs and whims of fashion and fancy is well paid for her originality and skill . Gift shops in cities and summer places give ready sale for good work . This type of work may be combined with tea-room management and the two prove a source of good income . In certain large cities , major work in hand-sewing on fine lingerie may prove a profitable field for vocational training . The following general suggestions are made for courses offered to girls choosing the four-year vocational industrial courses in foods . First and second years same as suggested on pages 143 to 145 for the girl taking the general home economics course in high school . This includes in the first year practical sewing review , the survey course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the second year a food preparation course and the making of garments . With this general training the girl is ready for her specialization . Half of the school day should be devoted to this specialization during the third and fourth years . The aim of this course is to train assistants to tea room managers , or caterers , for private catering or specialization in preserving , candyor cake-making . The third and fourth years should offer opportunity for advanced cooking beyond that of the second year course as outlined with special attention to serving and preparation of attractive looking foods . Special attention should be given to proper and attractive combinations for formal and informal dinners , teas , breakfasts , suppers , evening parties . Cooking in large quantities with the use of labor-saving devices , institutional equipment , etc. , should be begun , either for sale in the school lunch room or in fulfillment of orders from patrons outside the school . A shop in connection with the school is possible where the products of cakes , pies , breads , puddings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has been done with success and school departments supported through the patronage of their own faculty and students or by // outside patrons . During this year it is possible , if the matter is advertised , for girls to go out for hourly service to prepare and serve dinners or evening suppers to families known to the school teacher or principal , but it should be understood that such service is not expert service , as the pupils are still in training . Parallel with this practical work should be given courses in canning and preserving , candy-making , and fancy cooking . The subjects of marketing , storage , and care of foods in large quantities should be taken up and the subject of dietetics studied in the fourth year . This should include the planning of dietaries , based on the 100-calorie portions with calculation of the caloric value of foods and certain food combinations . If it seems wise in certain localities a course in trade laundering for institutions might be offered . There are possibilities in the future for the girl with initiative and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ability and understand how to figure costs . Some college girls have done so with success and have even built up a special laundry business in their own homes , advertising the laundering of dainty waists , dresses , and children 's clothes . This has been remunerative and in a certain case led to the employment of help and development of a business . The , manager advertised that all was done under most hygienic conditions and the articles when returned to their owners were attractively boxed with colored tissue papers . In certain cities there is always a clientele which will be willing to pay good prices for hygienic , careful , and attractive handling of laundry work . Graduates of such a special course might take charge of a small laundry in a hospital or other institution or in private homes of the rich which are equipped with special laundry machinery . This course should include mending and sorting of clothes , removing stains preparatory to soaking ; washing of woolens , silks , colored materials , starching , bluing , etc. ; care of fine work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines such as drier , extractors , mangles , etc . If conditions warrant , this might run through the third and fourth years as a specialization . ICI // Section II I. Home economics studies in the junior high school : A. Organizatriorn of the junior high school . ? The number of junior high schools is increasing rapidly . In the report of the United States Commissioner of Education for 1914 , Dr. Thomas H. Briggs reported one hundred and ninety-three cities as having this form of organization . About two hundred other places were considering the plan . The report of the committee on the junior high school presented to the High School Masters ' Club of Massachusetts , March , 1917,1 will be found an interesting his tory of the development of this movement . It also contains a good bibliography for those who care to consider more fully the growth and development of this movement in schools . It has been shown that the mortality of the upper grades is very great and continues in the high school . The conclusions drawn by Drs . Thorndike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this period is that of one hundred children entering the first grade only about nine complete the high school course . It was due to this mortality that reorganization of studies was suggested for the upper grades , as it was found that interest and the attend ance remain rather constant through the fifth or sixth grade . The pupil , if normal , should by this time be in possession of the funda mentals of his education if he has been well taught . A junior high school has been defined in the following way : A junior high school means a grouping of grades seven and eight or of seven , eight , and nine to form a new educational unit in which there shall be some freedom in choice of studies by the pupils , a considerable change in the tradiiicmal content of the subjects and methods of instruction , de partmental teaching , promotion by subject , and prevocational work . It is not possible in this text to discuss the advantages to be gained from this form of organization , but merely to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . // The testimonies of many bear witness to its success and the advantages are fully discussed in the report referred to above . It should be kept in mind , however , that in this scheme of organization no loss of academic training is planned , but a better scheme of dovetailing subjects with vocational guidance and preparatory work in trade . This has been called the exploratory period and as such performs one of the leading functions of the junior high school . In the same report are written programs of study which are interesting in that they show what is being done and also the program of studies recommended by the Butte Survey Commission which suggests a certain organization . The program of studies recommended by the Committee of the High School Masters ' Club is full and suggestive in showing the time allowance for , although not the contents of , the home economics studies . It will be noticed that there is great freedom in the choice of electives . One argument offered for this form of organization is that at this particular period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and boys which begin to develop at about this time . B. The aim of home economics studies in the junior high school . ? In the following studies in home economics suggested for the junior high school it is aimed to give the girls during the 7th and 8th years an insight into the vocations related to the home in order that a particular bent may be disclosed . This will enable the girl to choose her later work more wisely as she will have opportunity to try out other lines of vocational work also in the 9th grade . If she must leave school at the end of the junior high school period , this study may aid her in judging the line of work she may wish to pursue . In the program of studies suggested by the Butte Commission it will be noticed that two courses are suggested for the 7th , 8th , and 9th grades . I. The General Course . Intended primarily for those intending to go to high school . II . Vocational Course . For those not intending to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of School Masters three courses are offered . I. Academic Curriculum . II . Commercial Curriculum . III . Industrial Arts Curriculum . In addition a General Curriculum is given which may be offered when the fuller specializations are not warranted . In the modern movement for the reorganization of the school system upon the 6 ? 3 ? 3 basis , there are naturally to be found two groups of girls in attendance at the junior high school , namely : 1 . Those girls who will continue their school work through the senior high school . 2 . Those girls whose school training will end with the work of the junior high school . Therefore , in planning the work in Home Economics for the junior high school , provision must be made for both groups ; and both groups should be handled in the same sections in the 7th and 8th years , before the girls or their parents are able to decide definitely the possibilities for further education . This work is as fundamental for girls as is the industrial arts work for all children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies in Home Economics are not desirable before the 9th grade . In discussing the home economics studies for the junior high school period it would be but repetition here to fully describe the possibilities for the 7th and 8th grades . They are outlined and suggested in Chapter VI under home economics studies in the elementary schools . All girls , whether they continue their education through high school or leave at the end of the junior high school period , need such studies in Home Economics as are suggested for the 7th and 8th grades of the elementary school . This study includes the subjects of food , clothing , and shelter in their relation to their daily use by the family . It is hoped during this period to give the girl an appreciation of the significance of a normal , well-regulated home with all its activities and the benefits it bestows , as well as the possible relationship of this home to the cornHOME // community of homes . The content should be based upon those interests and activities connected with the home which should enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such problems in their lives . The following discussion of the two aims of home economics studies ( luring this period may be suggestive to those organizing work for girls with these goals in mind . C. Home economics studies for seventh , eighth , and ninth years for girls who will proceed to senior high school . ? In planning a three years ' course in Home Economics for those girls in the junior high school who will proceed to the senior high school the sequence of subjects should be determined by : ( 1 ) The natural interests and powers of the girl in the various phases of the work . ( 2 ) The basis in art , science , and social studies which she has had or may be having upon which the home economics courses may build . For example , the girl in the 7th year is generally less interested in studying art in relation to herself than the girl of the 9th year ; and , furthermore , she has less understanding of the art principles which lie back of such a study than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped her to interpret and apply the effect of horizontal and vertical lines upon the human figure . In the study of foods and sanitation the 7th year girl will be interested in cooking and other household processes for their own sake ; but she is not normally so interested in considering the nutritive values of foods and the food requirements of individuals as the girl in the 9th year ; nor has she the scientific basis upon which to draw for principles underlying such a study until she has been carefully guided through a course which introduces her into the realm of chemistry and physics of everyday life , as an " introduction to science " course is designed to do . It seems desirable that at least two double periods per week and , when possible , three , be devoted to the laboratory work in Home Economics and that one or two single periods be provided for discussion ; the time to be distributed among the various phases according to the needs of the problems in hand . It is not the purpose of this book to outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year ; but merely to suggest the careful organization of a course for the 7th , ' 8th , and 9th years sufficiently broad in scope and of adequate intensity to render every girl capable of meeting her home problems with intelligence and a consciousness of power . Furthermore , the course in Home Economics in the junior high school should afford a basis for selecting the phase of work which the girl may wish to pursue in more advanced study in the senior high school . The teacher in the junior high school has as one of her responsibilities the task of discerning skill and special aptitude in her pupils ; and of guiding them in their choice of the senior high school courses , which , as will be seen , are designed to train the girls more intensively along the line of their major interest . As has been suggested , the opportunity for more intensive work in the 9th year along one special line will facilitate this choice of specialized work in the senior high school . In the organization of this period of work ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of girls who will take the work in a consecutive course for the purpose of general education , the suggestions offered on pages 114 to 122 , home economics studies in grades 7 and 8 of the elementary school , may be expanded and enriched to cover three years instead of two , with the introduction , as suggested above , of more advanced work in all phases based upon the contributing courses in science , art , and social studies . It sometimes happens that by the time a girl has finished two years of general home economics training , she shows particular aptitude for one line of work rather than another ; for the foods or for the textiles ? or such lack of interest in one or the other that to continue it would be a waste of time . If the school organization will permit , such girls may be allowed to elect the work of their greatest interest and continue it more intensively through the senior high school than would be possible if they elect both phases . This differentiated course should not begin until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not arrived at an age when she is capable of making wise choice , and may include one of the following phases of work : // 1 . Food and sanitation . ? Further application of the principles of cookery gained in the 7th and 8th grades and more specific science and economics through the preparation and service of wellbalanced , nutritious meals at varying costs ; general household management such as cleaning , laundering , etc. , through the care of rooms , furnishings , and equipment incidental to the service of these meals ; ideals of hospitality and the relations of hostess and guests through these school exercises . Practice in large quantity cookery may be given through the school lunch room , this being a possible outlet for surplus products as well as an incentive toward perfect results in the laboratory . It further offers opportunities for the study of costs , large and small quantity buying and efficient business methods . The time to be allowed for this should be at least two double periods for laboratory with one single period per week for discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age at which the girl is most subjective , when she takes greatest interest in her personal appearance , and which offers the richest opportunities for instilling right ideals toward dress and right principles and habits of health and hygiene as influenced by dress . The course then may start with the girl 's present interest in her own personal appearance , applying the art principles to costume design and the execution of garments from these designs , making a study of color through what is best for her to enhance her good points and subdue the poor , applying her textile study to the selection of materials and trimmings for these dresses from the point of view of adaptability , durability , and hygiene . The remodeling of old garments would give opportunity for the study of the economics of clothing and the proper cleansing of old fabrics , thus giving a place for the application of chemistry through a study of detergents and reagents . A comparison of the cost of ready-made and home-made garments would give opportunity for discussion of problems of wage-earners , the human cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the relations of the family to the day worker in the home , etc . D. Home economics studies for the 7 ? 8  --  9 years for the girl whu // must leave school to go to work .. ? For the girl who must go to work at the end of the junior high school period , some kind of specialized training should be possible during the 9th year . This may or may not be related to the home economics studies , although this book is concerned only with these . Such electives may be chosen as commercial courses in business practice , stenography , agriculture , etc . The home economics studies of the seventh and eighth grades for this group of girls who must go to work at the end of the ninth year should be pursued by all girls as has been suggested , regardless of the vocation chosen for special study in the 9th year , for every girl , no matter what line of work she may enter , should have an opportunity to become acquainted with at least this amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a woman . The need for home economics work for these two grades is perhaps of greater importance to the girl who leaves school at the end of the 9th grade than for her who may continue in school , for it is not likely that further opportunity will be easily available . The content of the course during these two years should be about the same as that outlined on pages 114 to 122 . Differentiation should begin in the 9th year . From 10 to 15 hours per week should then be devoted to the girls ' special line of study but the regular academic studies of the 9th year should be continued although the school day will have to be lengthened during this year . The academic studies should be related as far as possible during this year to the special field of interest , as this relationship tends very directly towards making the girl a more efficient person in her chosen field of work . The relation of her major subject to all other subjects studied should be clearly seen and felt and should leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . It is quite natural that the home economics studies in the 7th and Sth grades in food , clothing , and household management should open up possibilities of vocational interest to girls , which may be pursued intensively ( luring the 9th year . If the girl chooses during the 9th year , for vocational purposes , the vocational industrial // studies related to Home Economics , they may lead to special fields of work in the needle trades , as dressmaking , garment-making , millinery , machine-operating , etc. , or to vocational industrial occupations in foods if the course for this ninth year is wisely planned . The aim of the training during this ninth year is to prepare the girl directly for a special kind of work for " gainful purposes " in order that the girl shall qualify along some line so that the period of apprenticeship may be shortened . The work is in this sense vocational study , and may or may not be related to the home economics field . The vocation chosen may be that of stenographer , office assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may prefer to take this training of the 9th year in a trade or business school or in the vocational classes of a four-year high school if the work she wishes is offered . It must be remembered that the girl at the end of this period of training is not old enough to be more than an assistant or apprentice in any of these lines of work and must start at a low wage . Nevertheless she will have more of general education by the end of the 9th year and in addition the special training which will enable her to advance more rapidly than she would otherwise do in her chosen field of work . It is essential in this special work of the 9th year that the materials and equipment with which the girl works shall approximate industrial conditions as nearly as may be without duplicating its bad features , and that the student should be expected to qualify in speed and technique in such a manner as will make her a worthwhile assistant in the field of work which she enters . There will be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must leave school before completing the 9th year . It would often be advisable to permit such a group to follow some intensive vocational study which is being taken by 9th-year girls , but still pursue academic studies of a lower grade . This group will probably be small but provision should be made for it in order that the school may reach these girls , who often marry at an early age . // II . Home economics studies for the senior high school based upon the work of the junior high school : A. Home economics studies for liberal education . ? Training for liberal education in home economics studies has been fully discussed and content or courses suggested for the students of varying goals on pages 126 to 166 . In the senior high school of the 6-3-3 plan will be found students with similar goals , namely : 1 . The girl whose goal is the college . 2 . The girl who will teach in a rural school after completing her high school course . 3 . The girl who expects to remain at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commercial , or agricultural pursuits , but who needs some home economics studies as a part of her liberal education teaching her how to live while pursuing her main occupation . The courses suggested on pages 126 to 166 may be interpreted as covering the needs of the girl in the senior high school . The girl who expects to remain at home should be able to elect strong courses or units if she chooses , and the girl whose goal is an industrial , commercial , or agricultural pursuit , and the girl whose goal is the college should find in the senior high school courses or units in home economics for liberal education which should attract her on account of their intrinsic value for her . It is urged that an elastic system of courses or units be planned to meet these needs ; for example , opportunity should be offered to the girl who wishes to select courses or units during any one or all of the years in her high school course ; but , if only one year or its equivalent in units is elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounding out and summing up the best for the girl in the field of Home Economics at that stage of her development . If only one year can be added to the work of the junior high school , the eleventh or twelfth year is the wise time for such a final course , inasmuch as the girl has reached her greatest maturity and has the best background in science , art , and economics besides a broader outlook upon life than at any previous time . // If it is not possible to give the full time recommended , five periods per week , for the full year in the 11th or 12th years , and the unit system is adopted , it will be possible for the students to elect certain units in different years and in this way aspects of the work demanding more maturity and serious purpose , such as nutritive value of foods and dietetics , budgets , etc. , might be included in the 12th year . The course as suggested for the senior high school provides a very desirable basis for future specialized training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for nurses in the world to-day , the fitness of girls for this training should be carefully considered ; for it is often through the home economics course that girls may be led to an interest in nursing . The high school course may wisely be modified to meet the needs of such students . Such a program should emphasize academic subjects ; should he strong in science ( chemistry , physics , biology ) , and should include as much of the practical work of home economics as would be possible without sacrificing the general cultural and science courses . It should have good courses in cookery , nutrition , household management ( cleaning and furnishing , etc. ) , and household sanitation . Mathematics could be reduced to a minimum for such a student , but she should have a modern language and one year of Latin if possible . She needs the full work in English and history with emphasis on civics . B. Home economics studies for vocational training . ? The three years ' work of the senior high school in vocational train ing should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages 150 to 166 ( for the four years of high school ) , under home economics studies for the girl choosing any one of the vocational courses in high school . It is suggested that the adaptation of the 8-4 plan to the 6-3-3 plan be made in the 9th and 10th years ac-cording to the needs of the girl . In planning vocational programs or courses of study for the senior high school it is necessary to keep in mind girls with the following aims : // 1 . The girl who has as her goal vocational education in homemaking " as practiced by the wife and mother in the home . " 2 . The girl who is preparing in high school to be a teacher in a one-room rural school and must include in her program some home economics studies because she will have to teach them . 3 . The girl who chooses a vocational industrial course , ? an outgrowth of a home economics study . The following suggestions are made for adjusting the three years of the senior high school to the programs suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8-4 plan . 1 . Home economics studies for vocational training for the girl whose goal is distinctly home-making . The course outlined in preparation for home-making on pages 152 to 156 may be adapted to the senior high school . Because of additional food and clothing studies in the 9th year or junior high school , some of the technical work of the 9th and 10th years of the 4-year program may be omitted . It is suggested that the survey course as suggested for the 9th year of the 4-year plan be offered in the 10th year of the 3-year plan and also the vocational guidance course if this seems advisable . It is suggested that the plans for 11th and 12th years remain about the same with opportunity for practice as suggested . 2 . For the girl who is preparing in high school to be a teacher in a one-room rural school and must include in her program some home economics studies because she will have to teach them . For this type of student the plan suggested on pages 133 to 141 of the 8-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pursued are given in the last two years of high school and will not be affected by a difference in organization of the school . 3 . For the girl who chooses a vocational industrial course , an outgrowth of a home economics study . As suggested on pages 156 to 166 there are vocational industrial pursuits which are an outgrowth of some of the home economics studies . In the 8-4 plan of organization suggestions were made for the introduction of home economics studies and outlines given for the industrial courses which are the outgrowth of the home // activities . Adaptations of these can easily be made to the 3-year high school course omitting such technical work as may have been taken in the junior high school , 9th year . III . Home economics studies in the small high school . There are located in many of the villages and cities of the United States small high schools where only one or two teachers of the home economics studies are employed . It will not be found possible to work out in details some of the suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although many of them can be adapted to the needs and conditions of the varying communities . Some suggestions are offered below for this adaptation . The aims and ideals for introducing the home economics studies have been fully outlined in Part I of this book . The teacher in the small high school should have in mind her aims and ideals for the girls of her community and should plan the course of study with those ideals in mind . She should remember that she has a special privilege which should aid her in organizing the work , her close touch and relationships with the homes of the community which is not easy in large cities . It is possible for her to know the homes of the community and their particular needs through visiting them , and in this way to learn the resources of the community and local conditions , from the angles of many homes . The teacher who bases her course of study on the needs discovered will make the work of true value . In small communities the home economics teacher has an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys together in clubs for study of special problems of the community , which is not always feasible in large cities . Much civic pride can be awakened in this way and much good done as the teacher finds her place of usefulness outside the schoolroom as well as within it . In most small high schools the time allowed for the home economics studies averages about two periods a day for two years . The periods vary in length but it is advisable to have periods of at least 45 minutes , so that no laboratory class time is less than 90 minutes . When the periods are shorter there is loss of time in dis180 TEACHING HOME ECONOMICS tributing and collecting materials , lack of economy in presentation and neglect of certain class instruction , because discussion must often be omitted in order to accomplish a given project within the period of time . On pages 141 to 150 suggestions have been offered for the organization of home economics studies for the girl who takes the general home economics course in high school . She remains for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If only two years of work are possible for the girl in the small high school it is suggested that the following subjects be offered as given on pages 130 to 136 ; without the fuller differentiation as in the other outlines . First year. ? 1 . Sewing : study of stitches and processes applied to garments and textile study ( as suggested for first year of the general course , page 143 ) . 2 . Food preparation and serving : meal basis as suggested on pages 144 to 145 including study of marketing , cost ; food values , combinations , etc . Second year. ? Course on the home , its care and management . See pages 146 to 148 . This is made up of six units of work , all of which might be offered or as many as possible . If the home economics studies must be distributed over four years for administrative reasons , and the amount of time each year must be less , it is suggested that the course as outlined on pages 141 to 150 for the girl taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by year to the needs of the small high school . Lack of equipment is no excuse for poor work even in a small school , for here more than anywhere if tact is used , it is possible to go into the homes to give instruction , and to utilize the natural laboratories on every hand . There is splendid opportunity for cooperation and school credit for home work . Attention is called to the chapter on courses of study for rural schools and to suggestions for school lunches , lesson plans , and classroom and school management offered in the other parts of this book . // Section III I. Home economics studies in evening classes and continuation courses . In addition to the home economics courses offered in the all-day elementary and high schools one finds very often in the same buildings or in separate school buildings classes for those who can not attend school at all during the day because of home duties or employment . The latter are in some states compelled by law to attend school for from 4 to 10 hours per week between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school attendance makes necessary in some of our states part-time instruction in day schools for a certain number of hours each week . The home economics studies as introduced under these varying conditions should have rather different courses from those suggested for the regular high school . A. In evening classes . ? There are usually three types of women attending evening classes : 1 . The woman who wishes particular instruction along a certain line in order to increase her earning capacity . For example , she may wish a special course in draping of materials or in sleevemaking if she is a general dressmaker ; or to learn the use of a new machine if she is a machine operator . Such courses are often called trade extension courses . They are offered sometimes in the day trade school and workers attend during slack seasons . The day schools of the future will meet more fully the needs of this group , either in classes conducted in high school buildings or in separate vocational schools . There is also in this group the young woman who wishes to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade preparatory . One finds the trade preparatory course offered also in the day classes in the girls ' trade school , such as the Manhattan Trade School for Girls in New York City , or the Boston Trade School for Girls , and others . The courses are short , often only one year in length , and intensive training is offered along a particular line of trade specialization , such as power-machine operating , // dressmaking , millinery , novelty pasting , and other special lines with some related academic and art studies . 2 . One finds also in evening classes the young woman who comes for a social evening with a more or less serious attitude . She can be interested generally in almost any home economics study but she attends usually for relaxation , and will not care to pursue any subject too intensively . 3 . The third group consists of young women usually employed in some line of wage-earning during the day , or housewives who wish to add to their knowledge in home-making subjects . They wish to learn to make their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to learn to care for the baby if they are young married women , to study the elements of house decoration , etc . Because of the limited amount of time possible for attendance during any week or year in evening classes , it would seem wise to offer this work in short units . The pupil after completing one unit and receiving credit for it advances to the next unit , until in time she has completed the various subjects which make up the course . This course will naturally take longer to complete than attendance at the day school where full time would be given ; but each unit should be complete in itself and the instruction thorough . ' The unit is made up of a definite number of lessons . A unit may begin at any time , but pupils should not be permitted to enter except at the beginning of a unit . The following units of work might be offered in evening classes according to local need and would meet the demands of young women of the three types mentioned above . a . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several units if necessary ) . Plain hand and machine sewing . Undergarments such as lingerie , aprons , underwear , children 's garments , middy blouses , etc. ( 2 ) Elementary dressmaking ( offered in several units if necessary ) . Shirt waists , uniforms , simple one-piece dresses , etc . Short Unit Courses for Wage-Earners , Bulletin No. 159 , Department of Commerce and Labor , Washington , D. C. // The girl electing trade units may also be interested in some of the home-making units . The group on page 185 might be offered for her . b . Home-making units . ( A course of study might be outlined to include units also in the related studies in science and art , and upon completion of a certain number of units a certificate in home-making might be awarded. ) // // See also suggestions offered for short courses on pages 129 to 136 for the girl going to college . Adaptation of those to these aims can be easily made . See suggestions in the Addenda for short unit courses offered in Rochester , Worcester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 14 years of age who goes to work is often compelled by law to return to school for one or two years for a certain number of hours each week . The studies chosen by this girl may be along the line of elementary academic work in order to complete the studies for graduation from the ele mentary school . This type of continuation work leading to gradua tion is sometimes offered in department stores and factories as well as in school buildings . For example , B. Altman and Company , // New York , conduct such an elementary school in their own building taught by teachers supplied by the New York Board of Education . Altman and Company furnish room space and equipment . Graduation exercises are held each year and pupils receive diplomas for completion of the elementary school course . Such a course for girls usually includes the regular sewing or cooking or Home Economics required by the particular school system for graduation from a particular elementary school course . For the girl who is a graduate of the elementary school , continuation courses may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade or along the line of a possible trade if she knows she wishes to be a saleswoman ( salesmanship ) , an office girl ( filing , etc. ) , a stenographer , bookkeeper ( stenography , etc . ) . In addition the choice should be made of certain general and home-making studies . This girl , although she must be a wageearner , will probably be a home-maker at some time , and such units of home economics studies as suggested on pages 129 to 136 or on pages 183 to 185 will meet her needs . It must be kept in mind that training for citizenship is as important as training for a vocation and a girl should be interested in the community life of home , church , and city with its social activities in order to fully live and contribute her part . The work for continuation school pupils is sometimes offered in the elementary or the junior high school building , if pupils have not completed elementary school and in the high school if pupils are graduates . This depends on local administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should vary with the aims of the pupils and the local needs . They may be along two lines : 1 . Home-making courses . Such as units suggested for evening classes , pages 183 to 185. 2 . Special trade course . Which may be the outgrowth of certain interests aroused in the elementary school in Home Economics . Such units have been suggested on pages 182 to 183 . These may be of a trade-preparatory nature or of trade-extension type . // No mention has been made in this book of the various types of evening and continuation classes for girls in industry along other lines , as this book treats only of the home economics studies , and the trade subjects which are the outgrowth of certain home ac-tivities are the only trades here suggested for girls in industry . It must not be forgotten that there are many other lines of industry open to women and that these vary with the local needs and conditions . C. All-day vocational schools . ? The high schools of the future will offer short courses of one or two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to meet the needs of girls who can not remain in school because of economic or other reasons . This is being done to-day in some high schools , and in some states and large cities special vocational schools are organ-ized to meet this need . The courses vary from one to three years and some offer shorter courses of study which may be taken in units along a line of particular interest . The all-day vocational school aims to prepare in a relatively short time for a particular job . From the point of view of the home economics studies we are interested in these schools in three different ways . Because training for the vocation of home-making may be offered in the all-day vocational school . Because girls entering any line of industry or commercial or agricultural work need some of the home economics studies as a part of their general education for better living . Because some of the industrial vocations for women are out-growths of the home economics studies . The following suggestions are made for introducing the home economics studies into the all-day vocational school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vocation of home-making . ? This is a par-ticular job which is an undifferentiated task . It means many lines of study . Adaptation of the suggestions made for training for vocational home-making in high school may be made to the shorter course in the all-day vocational school ( see pages 152 to 156 ) , // or certain of the home-making units may be grouped for this major . ( See home-making units suggested for evening classes . ) In this type of school , time should be given also to related studies in science and art and in academic studies according to the length of time planned for the completion of this major . 2 . Girls entering any line of industrial , commercial , or agricultural work need some of the home economics studies as a part of their general education . For this group it is suggested that adaptation of the units suggested on pages 129 to 136 be made to meet the needs of such girls . The emphasis may well be placed in planning such courses on the thought of selection of proper clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending of her income . At the Manhattan Trade School for Girls the instruction in home economics studies is offered indirectly through other courses , while the girls major in the industrial vocations of machine operating , dressmaking , or novelty work . This is because the time is limited and the girls must go to work as soon as possible . The main goal to be attained in a short period of time is a certain proficiency in a particular vocation . Through the studies of English , arithmetic physical education , and art , the girls have instruction in personal hygiene , the personal and family budget , color in dress , and house decoration . Courses in textiles are also given because many of these girls will handle textiles in industry . Instruction in food is limited to the handling of it in the preparation for the noon-day lunch . 3 . The third reason for the interest of the home economics teacher in the all-day vocational school is that certain industrial vocations have grown out of home activities . a . Those related to clothing . L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majors in dressmaking , power-machine operating , millinery , cookery on a commercial basis , etc . The teacher of these industrial occupations which are the outgrowth of the home activities should be one who has had trade and shop experience . The home economics teacher sometimes // supplements her training with this experience but unless the exigencies of the occasion make it necessary for her to teach the trade classes she is not as a rule prepared to give trade instruction . Such schools as the Manhattan Trade School for Girls , New York City , the Milwaukee Trade School , the Boston Trade School , the Minneapolis Vocational High School for Girls offer majors in the home activities which have been taken over by industry . The reader is referred to the Addenda for the work offered by these schools and should consult the catalogues of these schools . Refer ence is also made to the full outline of aims of such schools in Vo cational Education of Girls and Women by Albert H. Leake . ' On pages 182 to 183 suggestions are made for trade-preparatory and trade-extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the all-day vocational schools , in majors in clothing or food and should be supplemented by academic and related subjects as time and need demand .
