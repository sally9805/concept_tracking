From South Africa to Fleet Street the Empire was piquantly all of a twitter , last week , over Dawn , the furiously contested cinemastory of the life &; execution of Edith Cavell ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) . At the nub of controversy jutted the fact that Great Britain has been " muddling through " without a legal system of film censorship . Therefore , last week , the interplay of moral suasion was untrammeled and magnificently British . Some felt , and some did not , that to project the story of Nurse Cavell once more upon the world would be to revive War mentality at its worst and embitter Anglo-German relations . Loud , therefore , were twitterers and twitterings : <P> Members of the Cabinet kept their fingers crossed and individually refused invitations to a preview of Dawn . Collectively they chose an anonymous &; mysterious " technical advisor " who reported , according to a Cabinet announcement , that the execution scene in Dawn unfolds as follows : <P> " One member of the German firing squad definitely refuses to level his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . The rest line up and at the order to fire each raises his rifle so that the bullets strike above the woman 's head . Nurse Cavell , however , falls down in a faint and an officer steps forward and despatches her with a pistol . " The pistol used in making the film was , by way of meticulous realism , a German Luger ( see photograph ) . <P> Commenting emotionally on the above terse report , Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain cried to the House of Commons : " I am speaking as an English gentleman upon what I think is an outrage on humanity . . . . I believe this film account of the execution to be fully apocryphal i. e. fictitious or spurious . I feel that it is an outrage upon a noble woman 's memory to turn to purposes of commercial profit so heroic a story . " <P> Sir Austen 's plea against Dawn was shortly described as " a lullaby to please the Germans " and roundly flayed by peppery Brigadier-General John Hartman Morgan who served as Vice-Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investigated and exaggerated " German atrocities . " Flinging the defunct Commission 's hat once more into the ring , General Morgan rehearsed the " judicial murder " of Edith Cavell and seemed to think it could not receive too much film publicity . <P> Straightway a former subordinate member of the Commission , Mr. Herbert F. Manisty , a practicing barrister , informed the press that , in his opinion , Miss Cavell was tried by a competent court and was convicted of the offense for which she was tried , namely " furnishing and supplying men to the enemy . " <P> Correspondents who had meanwhile viewed a pre-showing of Dawn reported that , as displayed to them , the execution of Nurse Cavell was not thrown on the screen at all , but was simply to be inferred from the agonized expression on the face of the German priest who administered last rites .
