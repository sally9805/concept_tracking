As they watched their flocks by night , certain Egyptian shepherds beheld , last week , a flaming portent . They saw the famed Luxor-Cairo de Luxe Express dash screeching through the night with two of its sleeping cars afire . For once the poor shepherds , shivering in their rags , were momentarily more fortunate than such de luxe travelers as George Eastman ( kodaks ) . He , clad in silken green pajamas , slumbered in one of the flaming cars . <P> The fire had started when an ill-greased axle grew hot and hotter , began to spew forth sparks , and finally set the wooden sleeping car afire . Flames danced in the corridor , awakened the attendant . With a bound he leaped for the nearest stop-signal cord , found it already useless , burned through . <P> From the engine , three cars ahead , came a merry hoot , as the unsuspecting engineer blew his whistle at a crossing and the moon . <P> Mr. Eastman has a faithful , attendant physician , Dr. Albert D. Kaiser . His sharp ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car attendant dashed past his door . " I arose , " said Dr. Kaiser afterward , " and found Eastman sleeping peacefully . ... I told him to fly . ... He grabbed for his clothes , but I shouted : ' Leave everything ! Not a second to lose ! ' " <P> Some few hours later rich Mr. Eastman arrived at Cairo wearing one slipper , one shoe , a pair of dress trousers and the jacket of his green pajamas . He told how the train was finally stopped , when the sleeping car attendant managed to climb , catlike , over the swaying luggage van and into the cab of an engineer who knew his trade too well to look behind . Other passengers , all safe , were chiefly irate because their luggage had been destroyed when the two flaming coaches , which could not be extinguished , were uncoupled and allowed to burn to the rails . <P> Not thus irate was Mr. Eastman . He had shipped virtually all his baggage by another train , and had remained at Luxor for an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by famed Egyptologist James Henry Breasted of the University of Chicago . With a contented smile , Mr. Eastman remarked that his unburned luggage contains a fine specimen of the nearly extinct white rhinoceros which he shot in the upper Nile region by special permission of the Egyptian Government .
