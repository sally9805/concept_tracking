Last week the story of a Protestant youth , Senor Haya de la Torre , was widely told in the sectarian press . <P> The story runs in this wise . A year ago the Archbishop of Lima , Peru , made proclamation : " We announce a great event which will be a source of much joy to all our people . The Republic of Peru , Catholic by conviction , by tradition , and by the constitution , will be officially consecrated to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus next month , and the image of this most sacred heart will be enthroned in the principal plaza of the capital . " <P> Embattled progressives rose in wrath . Led by students who were led by Seor de la Torre , they created such a stir that it became inexpedient to dedicate the country as contemplated . The ceremony was suspended , but young de la Torre was arrested , imprisoned , deported . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and is expected shortly in the U. S.
