Serbia was the traditional Land of Assassinations . Most famed : the shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Serajevo , the prelude to the World War . Most atrocious : the murder in their royal night clothes of King Alexander and Queen Draga of Serbia in 1903 by Serbian officers in the pay of Imperial Austria . Last week it seemed that although small Serbia no longer exists , having become large Jugoslavia , there has been a throwback to old-style Serbian assassination at Belgrade . <P> . . . <P> In the Skupshtina or Parliament of Jugoslavia at Belgrade last week the leader of the Opposition , famed Stefan Raditch , was directing a furious filibuster against the Government 's proposal to sign with Italy the Treaty of Nettuno ( TIME , June u ) . That document would facilitate the " peaceful penetration " by Italian colonists of Dalmatia , which is adjacent to Croatia , the part of Jugoslavia from which Stefan Raditch hails . For three years Croat Raditch has blocked the treaty , driving the Jugoslav government to their wit 's ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . <P> At the furious climax of the filibuster last week Croat Raditch paused , surveyed the government deputies with a blazing glance and roared : " You are not men ! YOU ARE SWINE ! ! " <P> Although " swine " is almost the favorite epithet bandied in Balkan parliaments , its use by squat , choleric Stefan Raditch for perhaps the one thousandth time in his life produced an astounding effect . <P> Up from a government bench leaped Deputy Punica Ratchitch , a nobody . Whipping out an automatic pistol , he leveled the blue-steel barrel at the leader of the opposition . " I 'm going to shoot Raditch , " he cried . " I 'll shoot anyone who tries to stop me ! " Instantly four ranking officials of the Croat Peasant Party rushed to fling themselves between the pistol and their leader . The secretary of the party stopped the assassin 's first bullet . The vice president of the party , a popular Croatian author , took the second . The third and fourth were stopped with no less honor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew of Stefan , who had been farthest from the carnage when it began . <P> Assassin Ratchitch , whom no government deputy had seized from behind , put his fifth bullet with crack marksmanship into the stomach of Stefan Raditch , who crumpled as though felled by an axe . <P> Of the wounded men , only two died last week , of whom one was Paul Raditch . The great Stefan Raditch lay in hospital , visited twice daily by King Alexander , and from Vienna flew famed Diabetic Specialist Dr. Gustav Singer-for Croat Raditch suffers from diabetes and a bullet in the stomach is poor medicine . After a thorough examination , Dr. Gustav Singer said that the patient might survive . <P>
