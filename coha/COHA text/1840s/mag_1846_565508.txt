txt a former article we proved , or claimed to have proved , as conclusively as if the words of the Constitution were express to that effect , that under the second Section of Article fourth , the citizens of each state have the right of free ingress into every other . We exposed the fallacies and absurdities involved in the proposition that a state may nevertheless in the exercise of her police power exclude from her territories persons , whether citizens or not , whose presence she considers dangerous to her peace ; and , commenting upon the allegation that examples of the actual exercise of such a power are furnished in the quarantine laws and in certain provisions of the poor laws , we showed in respect to the former that they are not at all in conflict with the Constitution , that they are in their nature and operation essentially different from a law of exclusion , and furnish therefore no analogy in support of such a law . And we had prepared an argument leading to a similar conclusion with respect to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspend , somewhat abruptly , our remarks , expecting to resunie them in the January numher . But we are anxious to close a discussion already extended far beyond our original ( Iesign , and as its continuity has been broken by so long an interruption , we have thought it best to leave untouched the argument to which we have referred , and condensing as much as possible what we had intended to say further upon the law of the case , to pass on to topics of a different nature , connected with the inquiry we have proposed . We have taken this course with less reluctance , because the allegation respecting the pauper laws , if we concede all it claims , has but a remote and indirect bearing upon our main position . A mere analogy can not overthrow a positive demonstration ; and that can hardly be called a constitutional argument which justifies one infraction of the Constitution by pointing out another which has been committed with impunity . There is another point , however , which we are unwilling to leave altogether unnoticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded to a case decided in the Supreme Court of the United States which has been supposed to favor those doctrines with respect to the police power on which reliance is piace ( I in justifying the laws of South Carolina . The Court in that case , * speak ing of the distribution of powers between the State and General Governments , took occasion to assert in strong language the complete authority of the States over all subjects within the range of mere municipal legislation or internal police ; and insisted that the power of legislation on these subjects had riot been transferred to Congress nor shared with it . But they expressly admitted that though the power of legislating was not given up , yet the states were subject to restraints in the manner of exerczsing it ; as they could riot but admit , unless they intended to assert that the states were competent to make any law *vhatsoever which should " concern the welkre of the state or any individual within it , and whose operation should he within the limits of the state , and upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are police laws accord ing to the definition of the court . The point decided was sim*dy this , that the law whose validity was in question was not a law asstimirv* to reoulite commerce ; if it had been it would have been void , whether in conflict with any existing law of Congress or not , for the reason that the power to legislate on that subject is exclusively in Congress ; * City of New York vs . Mime-h Pe* ter* , l3*t. // qwq ment of her colored population , " the infliction of arbitrary violence upon the citizens of other states , conceded to be rightfully within her territories . We have thought it therefore principally important in this discussion to show , what has generally and very properly l ) een assumed as too plain for proof , that among the privileges and immunities secured to the citizens of each state is included as the very first of them the right freely to enter and continue in any other state ; and that this right is placed by the Constitution beyond the control or reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting the impregnable strength of this position , we can not regard as misapplied the time employed in the discussion . We hold it therefore to have been proved that the law of South C*irolina which has occupied our attention is in conflict with the provisions of the second Section of Aiticle fourth in the Federal Constitution . We l ) roposed furthermore , in the outset of our inquiry , to consider whether it is not also in conflict witb that part of the Constitution which vests in Congress the power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states . " Upon this question we shall simply offer a few statements and suggestions , without attempting a formal and complete argument . Since the term commerce includes not merely traffic but also intercourse , it is held that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate navigation , the principal medium of commercial intercourse . The power to regulate is the power to prescribe the rule , and in whatever authority vested , is in its very nature exclusive ; implying full control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all others that would perform the same opcration on the same thing . By virtue of the power to regulate commerce , therefore , Congress holds and exercises exclusive power to prescribe the megulations , the rules and conditions , under which intercourse by means of shipping shall be carried on 1 ) etween different states of the Union . And its regulations necessarily exhaust the whole subject , covering not only what is prohibited and what is enjoined , but likewise what is left free ; so that a state is no more competent to impose on commerce restrictions which Congress has not imposed , than to dispense with those which Congress has imposed . Such , as we understand it , is the settled construction of this part of the Constitution . And the master of a vessel who has complied with all the requisitions of the national law , acquires under that paramount law a right , upon which no state authority is competent to act , to enter any American port , in the prosecution of his lawful business , with his vessel and its crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston , the state law meets him at its mouth , tells him that he will not he permitted to bring into the port seamen of a certain description , constituting a part or perhaps the whole of his crew , subjects him if he does to onerous fines or to imprisonment , seizes on the men and confines them in jail , and while it deprives him of their services , compels him to pay the expenses of their unwilling detention , arid to become responsible in heavy bonds for their leaving the state . If in all this , the state does not attempt to prescribe rules and conditions under which commercial privileges shall he enjoyed , to impose restrictions on the exercise of rights derived from a paramount law , and to set up its authority against that of Congress on a subject within the exc:usmve control of the latter , if in short its acts do not amount to a regulating of ' commnerce , then it is not easy to conceive what acts *vonld come within that description . The defense usually set up is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of police , and the case already alluded to , that of the City of // New York vs . Milne , * is cited as conclusive on that point . We forbear at this stage of the discussion to go into an examination of that and other cases bearing upon this issue . We look with regret , we must confess , on the departure which we think the reasoning in that case exhibits from the principles which governed the Supreme Court of the nation in the days of Marshall . But whatever else may be said of it , it certainly does not authorize , nay even does not permit us , to regard the South Carolina law as a mere regulation of internal police . We deny , under that very decision , that it is such a regulation . We take issue on that precise point , and , though by no means obliged to do so , would confidently rest upon it our whole case , so far as the present question is concerned . We should of course admit that the master an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they form a part of the population of any state , are bound to obey all valid laws which they find in force within the state for the government of that population . We go farther , and concede , under the decision to which appeaf is made , that laws acting upon them as a distinct portion of that poptilation and subjecting them to special impositions and restrictions , may be valid , ( not must be so ) as regulations of police and not of commerce , though they act upon the agents and instruments of commercial intercourse . But the South Carolina law can not be brought even within this category . It is not a law for the government of the population of that state , or of any part thereof , permanent or transient , black or white . It might perhaps be so regarded , if it merely provided for incarcerating or enslaving negroes , or putting white men under bonds , being within the state , for cause there arising ; hut so far as it is a law of exclusion , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing else than a law of internal *See page 132. police : It lacks the most essential element of such a law , even under the sweeping definition given in the case on which so much reliance is placed . Its operation is not " within the territorial limits of the state , arid upon persons or things under its jurisdiction . " The state in enacting it announces in express terms to l ) ersons out of its territories its determination to keep them out . In forbiddinr their entrance it does not extend its law over subjects , but opposes its force to strangers . We insist on the distinction here suggeste ( l , though we can not dwell upon it . It will we think be obvious , and it is. certainly decisive . An enactment to keep people out of a state is essentially a different thing from one to govern them in in ; and in the present instance , the keeping our , as we have seen , is everything . There is not a provision in the enactment that is not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole falls . The South Carolina law , in that it is a law of exclusion , is not a law of internal or municipal government or police , and is not protected by the decision in the case of the City of New York vs . Milmie ; and on the other hand , being a law of exclusion , it is to the extent of its operation a law of non-intercourse , a law assuming to re*ulate commerce , an ( l in fact , as far as it goes , to regulate it to its destruction . We are brought thus to the close of a discussion , the unexpected length of which can nOt possibly have been less pleasin* to our readers than to ourselves . We have been anxious however to do some measure of justice to the gravely important questions of constitutional right in issue between the contending states . No one clause in the Constitution has received so little attention and been so imperfectly understood , no one , we would say rather , so strangely misun ( lerstoo ( l , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been our main object therefore to // present , as the result of the most candid and thorough investigation which we could give it , a full and fair exoosition of that Article , which might challenge the entire confidence of our readers , even though in so doing we should draw largely on their patience and overdraw our own . We leave this part of our subject with a profound conviction , that on all the sul ) stantial grounds of her controversy , Massyich usetts is clearly and undeniably in the right ; and proceed to consider , in answer to the remaining questions proposed at the opening of the discussion , whether , being thus in the right , she has by any l ) art of her action in the premises put herself in the wrong . And this is the same as to inquire whether the aggression upon her rights is such as to require or justify her interferen ce , and if so , whether her interposition has been properly conducted . Let it not be supposed , because we have impeached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of exclusion , that we regard the attempted closing of her l ) orts against colored citizens as the head arid front of her ofl'ending . Our reasons for so framing our argument have been already stated . But the essential and intrinsic illegality , the cruel oppression , the odious tyranny , that mark each separate provision of that enactment , we have never for a moment intended to leave out of view or to under-estimate . The prohibition of entrance , though it gives character to the whole law , stamps it at once as unconstitution*J , and stol ) s all further inquiry as unavailing to save and needless to condemn it , is after all , practically , the least important part of it . Standing alone , it would still be invalid , but it would also be impotent ; for individuals would ( lisregard it with impunity . Against a mere bruturn fulmen , Massach usetts need not have interposed her megis. lt is not the assertion on parchment of power contrary to the Constitution , but power effectually usurped , exer cised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicting on her citizens gross and grievous injury , and invading personal rights most sacred arid most solemnly guarantied , that makes the gravarnen of the charge preferred against her sister state . Against every one of these acts she enters her protest , as in itself a distinct violation of the coristittitional guaranty . She goes further , and insists that independently of the restraints imposed by the Constitution , the state of South Carolina , in assuming jurisdiction over the ships of a friendly power , seeking tinder the protection merely of the law of nations the hospitalities of her shores , in seizing on such persons among their crews as may be obnoxious to her suspicions , taking them from their vessels and compelling tl'iem to enter her territory against their ill , there to be imprisoned , scourged or sold into slavery , and that too by the most summary proceed irig , without allegation of cause or crime , without hearing , trial or appeal , without even a suspicion except what is based on their color-in irrogating to herself such powers , and committing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christian communities as governing their peaceful intercourse , assumes an attitude of unprovoked hostility , and , as between sovereign and independent powers , makes it the indispensable duty of the injured state to interfere in behalf of her citizens , by force of arms if necessary , to obtain for them protection and redress . Such oc asion does Massachusetts profess to find in the enactments of South Carolina , for interposing by legal and peaceful means for the protection of her citizens . We can not think she states her case too strongly . It is not even pretended that those enactments are in their nature or operation any thing else than what she describes them to be . They speak for themselves as they stand on the statute book of the accused state , whose boast it is , that not one of them // remains or will be permitted to remain a dead letter upon its pages . Who can require her to submit , without a question , to such undisguised aggression ? Who can censure or complain of her , if obeying only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she endeavors by all appropriate means to bring these enactments to the test of the Constitution ? Certainly not the other party in the controversy . Of such a course , a state intending to square her laws by the Constitution would not be disposed , and any other would have no right1 to complain . But there may perhaps be something in the circumstances of the case , which should induce Massachusetts to forbear the prosecution of her conceded rights . Let us see . We may be told that these laws are absolutely necessary in the southern states , to l ) rotect their people from imminent peril ; that negroes from the north , mingling with the slave population of the southern cities are confessedly a dangerous element in their society , sowing the seeds of disaffection and insubordination , and even exposing them to the horrors of insurrection and servile war ; that such dangers must be guarded against at every hazard ; that the measures adopted for this purpose , though apparently harsh and oppressive , inflict but little practical evil ; that the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to them at most a mere convenience , and though it is one which the Constitution undoubtedly gives them a right to claim , yet that Massachusetts ought not to insist on that right when its exercise so manifestly endangers the peace of her sister states , and the lives and property of their people . Such is the argument , as we may suppose it might be addressed to the sober reason of Massachusetts , candidly seeking to decide on her own duties in the case , in view at once of the positive rights of her own citizens and the real necessities of other states . By southern orators it is urged in a tone by no means so deprecatory . Whether wholesale denunciation , threats and defiance , are calculated to give it more wei* ht in her estimation , it can not be necessary to say . We design to bestow on it a respectful consideration , because , whether , of force or not , it is the only one that is or can be urged ; because it is accepted as sufficient , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern men , even among those who can not be charged with any special subserviency to southern purposes ; and because we have no doubt it is urged in good faith by very many southern men , who would be sincerely ( lisposed to avoid infractions of the Constitution and collision among the states , if they had not learned , under the influence ofa sympathetic bntgronndless panic , to regard their perseverance in the aggressive policy as a matter of life arid death . We have then to tricet and answer , though in a new form , the old argument from the necessity of the case . But let it be observed that we have nothing to ( 10 with the necessity , to which men of the Calhoun stamp insist , on sacrificing the Constitution , the Union , the rights of the free states and of their citizens , the first principles of republican government and the highest claims of humanity ; the necessity ofrnaintaining against all the natural influences of the times the permanent and vigorous vitality of the ( lear domestic institulion . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigency of the case such that South Carolina may properly invoke the forbearance of Massachusetts to indulge her in the use of means , forbidden by the Constitution arid derogatory to the rights of individuals held under its guaranties , as being necessary to secure , not the permanency of her peculiar institutions , but the present safet ' *i of her I ) eophe tinder them , against immediate dangers ? We believe the laws in question to be as unnecessary as they are illegal , the alleged dangers to have been grossly exaggerated , and every legiti // mate object which they propose to be attainable by other means within the constitutional power of the states . We admit , without hesitation , that the presence among a slave population of ' negroes from the free states must in all cases be attended by some degree of danger . That it would be safe or prudent , while allowing them a free entrance into southern ports , to leave them entirely without regulation or restraint , is more than we claim or believe . We go further , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion , is likely to prove a perfect safeguard against every hazard . The very idea of freedom , however suggested to the mind of the slave , is always dangerous to the master . Every avenue by which it may gain access there , it is undoubtedly his policy to keep carefully dosed and guarded . Especially dangerous is it when suggested by the sight of one of his own color from a more favored land , a freeman and a citizen , with rights acknowledged and respected , pursuing his chosen employment , and master of himself , his earnings , his time , and his movements . The slave can not with safety be permitted thus to unlearn the great lesson of his life , that servitude or something worse is the inevitable and universal destiny of his race . He will become perhaps discontented , restless , unmanageable , valueless , dangerous . Such consequences may be to a greater or less extent unavoidable , but they are of a kind for which the state itself and its institutions are alone responsible . Against dangers of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no right to guard themselves , under any ordinary circumstances , at the expense of the free citizens of other states , and by the sacrifice of rights which the Constitution , and their own solemn covenants have secured to them . Other dan gers , indeed , there may be , against which , so far as they exist , it is proper they should be guarded by special enactments . No good citizen of Massachusetts or of any other state , wishes to see Charleston the scene of insurrection , or South Carolina desolated by the fires and carnage of a servile war . Against those , of whatever color , who may go there to plot and execute such direful mischief , or to instigate others to do it , that state has power , both of punishment and precaution , ample and unquestioned , and commensurate with any danger which may arise from their presence or approach . But the power she has actually exercised observes no such proportion . Crimes like these are the crimes of individuals , attempted , if at all , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permits us to impute them , even in intent , to one in a thousand of those who unceremoniously , and without an attempt at discrimination , are thrust out of the territories of the state , or subjected when within it to the treatment of convicted felons . The imagination of Carolinians would seem to be haunted by the idea , that colored seamen , in seeking admission to southern ports , are , one and all , bent on exciting insurrection , and that either of their own impulse , or as the agents of northern fanatics , they devote themselves to this work , as to their proper vocation ; and yet , so far as we have seen , there is but a single instance in which even the attempt has been made , with what success we shall presently consider , to fix the charge of such criminal agency upon that class of persons , or any of them . That their free intercourse with slaves may , in various ways , tend to aggravate the causes of disorder , always rife among such a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this danger arises from their overt acts , from any thing they may say or do to excite or ag // gravate insubordination , discontent , or uneasiness , the state may rightfully , and as we insist adequately guard against it , and by means entirely constitutional . What may be the actual extent of this danger , the nature of the case does not permit nor does our purpose require us to determine . It is sufficient to say that it is clearly within the reach of ordinary legislation ; not indeed entirely to remove or prevent it , but so far to reduce it as to leave no sort of excuse , if excuse is indeed ever possible , for that extra-ordinary legislation which punishes before crime is committed or even thought of . Whatever overt acts may be specified as dangerous , may be specified as unlawful ; and regulations are certainly possible which will leave those disposed to observe them at liberty to enjoy their rights with safety to the community , while they inflict the penalties of the law only on those who break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difficulty lies not in making , but in enforcing such regulations . If these persons are once received among us , we can not control them effectually by special laws-we can not distinguish between them and our own colored population , nor of the former between those who are willing to obey the laws and those who are not . We can not follow them wherever they may go , and watch them in whatever they may do . They may with impunity violate every law which may be imposed upon them . They may sow the seeds of mischief , to spring up after they are beyond our reach , and bear fruit to our destruction . Their dangerous influence is in its nature constant and secret , and can be guarded against only by their entire exclusion . " But we reply , you have at least at your command the means which you are at all times obliged to employ in guarding against internal dangers far more formidable . Nor shall we easily be persuaded that the " powers that be " in Charleston , would fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcing her present or any additional laws for the government of her colored population , whether permanent or transient . We bear willing testimony to the efficiency of that government . Charleston is literally a garrisoned city . The " peaceful and happy race " of which Governor Aiken tells us , are kept in order and subjection by a military police . Pass down Broad Street , and you see at all hours the armed sentinel pacing in front of the guard-house . Visit the market , and you find the negroes who congregate there kept in awe by a numerous guard . On the Sabbath , and on all public days , a horse patrol traverses every street in the city . Sheltered by an imposing structure on the upper part of the Parade Ground , a small specimen of a standing army still survives , or did a few years ago , to garrison the " Citadel , " which in the days of Nullification , was expected to defy the prowess of General Jackson . And when we turn to the laws of the state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this array of police is designed to enforce , and does enforce , upon the colored population , restricting in a hundred petty ways their movements and intercourse , we may be permitted to believe that the efficient regulation ' of the few free blacks who might at any time be in the city from abroad , would be attended with no difficulties which would not disappear under a system of supervision so thorough , extensive , and , generally speaking , so successful . A single provision of that system , extended to the case of foreign free blacks , would as it appears to us , sufficiently ensure their observance of all ordinary and all special police regulations . Every free male negro in the state , over fifteen years of age , must have his name registered , and find some white man , a freeholder , who as his guardian is willing to become responsible for his good character *rood behavior , and // correct habits ; if masters of vessels were compelled to become thus responsible for persons of color employed on board their vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such as could be safely trusted to obey the laws of the state and city . But for convincing proof of the necessity alleged , we are referred with an air of triumph to the circumstances in which these laws originated . " The history of her legislation , " says Governor Aiken , " is the best vindication of South Carolina . " To that history , then , we make our next appeal . The first in her series of laws directed specially against colored seamen , was enacted by South Carolina in December , 1822 . In the summer of that year , a conspiracy for an insurrection had been formed among the slaves in Charleston . It was detected , and a large number of persons concerned in it tried , condemned , and executed . " On investigation , " says Mr. Rhett , " it was found that it had its origin and instigation with the free colored people that came into our ports as cooks , stewards , and sailors on board northern vessels . " 5 Governor Aiken says : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color , who had seduced and corrupted the native free blacks and slaves . " And by Mr. Rayner , t we are further assured , " that the community had every reason to believe that these negro sailors were the agents of certain fanatics **-at the North , of course . As to the details of this transaction , we are left , so far as these authorities are concerned , entirely in the dark . The evidence given at the trial , we have been informed , for obvious reasons of policy , was never made public . How far it would in fact go to connect the cooks , stewards and mariners ' then in the harbor of Charleston , with that particular conspiracy , how many of them it would show to have been concerned in it , what proof it would afford of the efficient influence of fanatical promptings , or how far , on the other hand , it would prove that this , like all other attempts of the kind , sprung from internal causes , for the existence of which the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , from other sources . We may well suppose that in a matter now , after the lapse of more than twenty years , become almost traditionary , southern imagination , unrestrained by the literal record , has found ample room to exaggerate , and to ascribe certainty to details which at first were little better than suspicions . Making proper deductions on this account , we were still inclined at first to believe that the main facts , as to the criminal agency of foreign free blacks in that particular instance , might have been substantially as stated . But we have now before us the official statement of Governor Bennett , * made immediately after the close of the inquiries , giving an account of what had been discovered , naming the authors and leaders of the move . meat , their residence and condition in life , their motives , plans and measures . With all this fullness of detail , he says not a syllable , from first to last , of the agency of free negroes from the North ; and not only so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented , where there was any room for it . The whole scheme was obviously one of domestic origin , an offshoot , in the natural course of things , from the domestic institution . The language of this document throughout contrasts remarkably with that employed by later representatives of Niles ' Register , vol. xxiii , p. 10. * Pamphlet , on the Mass. and So . Ca. controversy : Washington , 1845. t Minority Report , on the subject of these taws , H. of H. , 1843. // the sovereigui state with reference to the same transaction . Mr. Rhett , for example , tells us that " the ringleaders escaped ; " in order , apparently , to carry out the idea that they were transient persons , of the description so often given , and able to get out of the way* Gov . Bennett says : " It can not be doubted that all who were actually concerned have been brought to justice . " Gov . Aiken plaintively represents the rank and file of the conspiracy as the victims offor*eign seduction ; we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slave of Mr. Gell , " " the most active and daring of the conspirators , " who " could read and write with facility , " who " employed with serious and imposing effect the speeches of the oppositionists in Congress to the admission of Missouri , " who " had an extraordinary and dangerous influence over his fellows , " and who " kept his artful and insidious delusions in perpetual exercise . " This man , it seems , supplied himself abundantly with " seditious pamphlets , brought into the state by equally culpable incendiaries , " - whether black or white , seamen or landsmen , from the North or from adjoining states , we are not told ; and " wrote a letter to Pres. Boyer for aid , " which he employed a negro from one of the northern states to get conveyed to him : the only statements in the whole account which can possibly be construed as even alluding to *breign agency or influence . Especially do the more recent views of the transaction as a whole , contrast with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public mind has been agitated by a great variety of rumors , calculated to produce great excitement and alarm ; " " that certainty had given place to exaggeration , and that the general impression sustained the rumor of a very extensive conspiracy ; " and , after completing his account , that he has " entered with reluctance on this detail , nor would it have been requisite , but to counteract the number of gross and idle rumors actively and extensively circulated , and producing general anxiety and alarm . " As to the necessity , in his opinion , for further legislation to prevent the recurrence of similar evils , we may judge from his closing remark ; in which , alluding to the patrol laws , he says : " The legislature has wisely provided the means of efficient protection . " - This was four months before the laws now in discussion came into existence . So much for the facts which were made the pretext for excluding from that time forward every colored citizen of the free North from the ports of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , to quiet apprehension , to guard against rash measures , were unsuccessful . Rumor got the start of Record , kept it , and has ever since been increasing her distance from it . The panic , at least in Charleston and its vicinity , had taken complete possession of the public mind . And to a great extent , no doubt , it was an honest , l3ona Jide panic . That the laws in question grew out of that panic , is the most charitable thing that can be said of them ; though that very statement raises a strong presumption that they went far beyond the real necessities of the case . But this is not the whole . The history of those laws discloses other influences , at least as potent in originating them , and without which they eertainly would not have found a place in the permanent legislation of the state . The country was just emerging from the excitement and alarm of the Missouri question ; and under the influence of that alarm , leading men in the southern states were beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom of the North and the slavery of the South . South Carolina , always and beyond all other states , far.sighted // and unscrupulous in the adoption of measures for the maintenance of this most peculiar institution , was prepared to lead the way in the attempt to clQse and guard every avenue by which the voice of that discussion , or any other , might reach the ears of the slave . Then , as now , there was danger in his learning , by whatever means , that any where in the wide world there was extant and efficient an active sympathy in his behalf . Moreover , the spirit of defiance to the authority of the Union , which a few years later broke out in the nullifying movement , was just then beginning to manifest itself in that state . In fact , the South Carolina Association , then recently formed and embodying that spirit , and which , if the truth were known , from first to last impelled and directed that movement , originated the very law of which we are speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Johnson , of the United States Court , writing the following year to the Secretary of State , says : " The law was passed under the influence of a memorial from the Association , who , I am informed , actually had it drawn up here " - in Charleston- " in pursuance of their own deliberations , in order to be submitted to the Legislature . It is emphatically their law . " Certain it is , that the duty of enforcing its execution was assumed by that body , and that the prosecutions under it , in its first stages at least , were conducted by the Solicitor of the Association , in what principles and in what spirit , the famous opinion of Judge Johnson , and his letter already quoted , give us striking proof and illustration . The policy , therefore , in its inception , was at least as much the offspring of disloyalty as of terror . But neither feeling had at that time taken complete possession of the state ; and accordingly the law in question encountered at the outset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . So strongly was Judge Johnson impressed with its injustice and illegality , that upon the failure of attempts to defeat its operation by the ordinary judicial proceedings , lie wrote to the Secretary of State the letter to which we have referred , requesting the interposition of the General Government by an official remonstrance to the State Executive . He says , among other noteworthy things , " I do not hesitate to express the opinion , that the whole of the alarm of 1822 was founded in causes that were infinitely exaggerated . A few timid and precipitate men managed to disseminate their fears and their feelings , and you know that popular panics spread with the expansive force of vapor . The rest of the state , I am persuaded , takes no interest in these measures , but rather yields them to the fears of the city representation , where their chief operation is felt , than adopts them from an opinion of their necessity or utility . " The obnoxious laws , however , under the active patronage of the South Carolina Association , continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without success to defeat them in the state courts , and wearied out with delays to which the nature of their business would not permit them to submit , found it probably easier and less expensive to submit to the unjust exaction , while the men , the principal sufferers , in the language of Judge Johnson , " without friends , without funds , and without time , could not resort to suits at law . " The laws thus became a part of the settled policy of the state . It is only within a few years that other states have adopted similar laws . It is not even pretended that they had had in the mean time any actual experience of their necessity , even such questionable experience as led to their adoption in South // Carolina ; or that the free negroes who all along had been freely admitted to the ports of Savannah , Mobile , and New Orleans , had occasioned any inconvenience against which ordinary regulations of police were not sufficient to guard . To shut them out of their harbors , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , is undoubtedly an easier and more summary way of " regulating " them , and the example of South Carolina had shown that it could be adopted with irnpunity ; this is as it appears to us in the whole account of the matter . In all confidence , therefore , we submit the question to the judgment of our readers , whether the attempt to justify on the plea of necessity , the adoption and maintenance of the South Carolina policy , by an appeal to history and experience , is not a signal failure ; whether the facts alleged , even if conceded , satisfy the exigencies of the argument ; whether the proof of them is not wholly inadequate ; whether citizens of other states have not been by that state proscribed and outlawed as the authors of evils for which she herself and her institutions are alone responsible ; and whether in view of the spirit in which her policy was conceived , matured and established , her claim for special sympathy is not rather upon slave.drivers and nullifiers , than upon the loyal friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history has yet another result . It can not escape our attention that from first to last there has been no trial of milder means , but that the violent and extreme measures which are justified as necessary , have been the first and immediate resort . Such being the facts , we insist that on the present issue , South Carolina is in no condition to avail herself of any plea of necessity . She is bound to prove upon that issue , not only that the dangers alleged are real , imminent and great , and threatening not merely her domestic policy , but the present safety of her people-not only that constitutional measures are inadequate to her protection  --  but that of all others , those she has chosen to adopt , are the mildest and least injurious that are adequate to that purpose . And this she has no right even to assert , in the face of her steady refusal from the outset to make trial of a more lenient policy . She can not claim that she has trespassed reluctantly and by compulsion on rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt . That salutary regulations for the government of foreign free blacks , in southern ports , which should be open to no constitutional objection , might have been adopted with at least a probability that they would prove adequate to the purpose , we have already sufficiently proved . But whatever may be said of other measures , there is one at least as to which there can be no doubt . The intermingling of free blacks from abroad with slaves , may be attended with any degree of danger ; to control them when once mixed up with that population , may be difficult even to impossibility ; but every source of danger is cut off and every difficulty obviated , by confining them to their vessels , by prohibiting and preventing their coming on shore . That such a measure is practicable and would be effectual , will hardly be questioned ; but if it is questioned , we appeal to the experience of South Carolina herself . For twenty-two years she has with safety admitted to her ports , free negroes on board certain vessels , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of 1823 , free persons of color on board national vessels of the United States or of friendly powers , are exempted from the operation of that law , " unless said free negroes shall be found on shore , after being warned by the sheriff or his deputy to keep on board their vessels . " There is no need of comment // on this significant fact . Such a law , rigidly enforced against the objects of it , might be justly regarded as a very harsh one ; there would be , to say the least , great doubt as to its constitutionality ; we do not admit that it could be justified by any necessity which has yet been proved to exist ; but , waiving all these considerations , we insist that no possible necessity can justify any thing more than this ; that this is the utmost limit to which South Carolina or any other state can go in trespassing on the rights of other slates or their citizens , and claim the forbearance of the injured parties ; and that every step taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly inexcusable . We have thus examined , with rather an excess of concession , the plea of necessity put in by the advocates of the South Carolina policy . We have shown that in its best estate it is a useless weapon in their hands ; in justice to the truth of the case , we ought now to show , more fully than time or space will permit , how effectively it might be turned against them . The necessity which really dictates the maintenance of these laws , is a very different thing from that which we have been contemplating . It is simply the necessity of upholding , at all hazards , and by any sacrifice whatever of right and justice , against all the causes which are tending to undermine or overthrow it , the supremacy of slavery and of the slaveholding interest . Obeying this necessity , the southern states have been gradually maturing a policy , the effect of which is to put down and keep down , below the level of the slaves themselves , that portion of the enslaved race who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions more revoltingly tyrannical , than those devised to carry out this policy . And of these there are none more terribly effective , than the laws of which the Act of South Carolina , " to prevent free negroes and other persons of color from entering the state , " is a specimen , and , if we mistake not , was the model . It is these laws , now enforced in nearly all the slavebolding states , that make the free negro , who ventures beyond the precinct in which his lot may be cast and where he is suffered to vegetate , in effect an outlaw . If , crossing the line of his native state , he is detained , by whatever necessity , beyond the short period of absence which the law may allow , he finds his return precluded - he is not permitted to remain where he is and acquire a doinicilthe adjoining states are closed against him-.  - -   - -  wherever he may turn , the law is his enemy , and be has no choice but to take refuge in the swamps , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state by the price of his liberty . It is to this policy , rather than to any special distrust of himself , though such distrust doubtless there is , that the colored citizen of Massachusetts falls a victim when he enters the harbor of Charleston . When therefore the Carolina legislator , appealing to our sympathies , protests that he is a most reluctant trespasserthat his sole object is , in the strictest self-defense* to ward off the firebrands which incendiary abolitionists , through the agency of colored seamen on board northern vessels , would scatter among their dwellings , we point to the whole law as it stands on his statute-book , and retort- ' But you do not stop with free negroes on board northern vessels , or any vessels ; the free negroes from Baltimore , from Norfolk , from the interior of North Carolina or Georgia , meet the same proscription ; you say , in so many words , " It shall not be lawful for any free negro or person of color , to migrate into this state , or be brought or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by land or water ; " and if any such are found there , you // say , they shall be imprisoned-they shall be whipped-they shall be sold as slaves . Your legislation would be just the same , if there were not a free state nor an abolitionist in the Union . It is the legislation which systematically sacrifices the free colored race to the growing exigencies of your cherished institution . Their presence and prosperity , you rightly judge , is always dangerous to that institution . In pursuing that system , you make it a capital point to prevent the increase of that class , either by emancipation , immigration , or temporary sojourn . And in like manner is it a capital point , if you find any of the race contravening that policy , however innocently , and can lay your hands on them , to treat them , not merely as offenders against a penal law , who yet have some rights , and whose punishment you seek in some measure to proportion to the intrinsic demerit of their acts , but as outlaws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and citizens , to acts of violence which if inflicted on the savage African in his native wilderness , would make you an object of abhorrence to the whole Christian world . ' In the necessity , therefore , which has dictated this oppressive legislation , in the policy which it is intended to subserve , there is not only nothing to palliate , but every thing to aggravate its intrinsic cruelty and injustice . In carrying out , by laws which abrogate the most essential conditions of the constitutional compact , a policy like this , the states which adopt it can claim and ought to receive from their sister states neither co-operation nor connivance . If they choose to enforce it upon their own and each other 's subjects , there is no help for it ; but there is or ought to be help for it , when citizens of other states become its victims , while in the peaceable and innocent exercise of rights , valuable to them , and guaranteed them by the Constitution and laws of the Union . And especially , when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which inflict the wrong are studiously so framed as to leave the injured citizen no remedy which he can himself apply , making it physically impossible for him either to resist their execution or test their validity , we hold it to be the solemn duty of his own state , a duty which Massachusetts , to her lasting honor , has been the first to recognize , to interpose in his behalf , and in all lawful ways to endeavor to resist the aggression , to right the wrong , and prevent its recurrence . Such ample cause has Massachusetts found for interfering in behalf of her citizens . We have proposed further to consider whether that interference has been properly conducted . A brief statement of the measures adopted will show that they were strictly appropriate , if not indeed the only ones which the nature of the case permitted . The first action of Massachusetts was by resolutions adopted in 1839 , in consequence of numerous petitions presented to the Legislature of that and preceding years . This declaration , premising that , " under the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visiting those states for purposes of business , or driven thither by misfortune , had often been and continued to be , though guiltless of crime , cast into prison , subjected to onerous fines , and in many instances sold into slavery ; " simply recognized the duty of the state to pro . tect her citizens in their rights , remonstrated against the laws in question as invading those rights , and authorized measures to be taken for the relief of the sufferers . " It denounced no one , insulted no one , threatened none . Respectful in language , and strictly defensive in its tone , it rested on the hope that something would yet be done by the voluntary act of the offending states to // remedy the grievances complained of . " But this remonstrance produced no effect ; and therefore , after waiting three years , and finding that citizens of the state still continued to suffer as before , the Legislature , in 1842 , passed other resolves , authorizing the Governor , on application in behalf of any citizen imprisoned under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures to cause such citizen to be discharged from his imprisonment , and the legality of such imprisonment to be tried and determined by the courts of the United States . " This measure it was found would not reach the case ; for the reason that the sufferers in prison could take no measures to avail themselves of the proffered assistance . In 1843 , therefore , the Governor was by resolution authorized to employ agents in the ports of Charleston and New Orleans , to institute suits in behalf of any such citizens , with the same purpose of testing the legality of their imprisonment . No lawyer , however , could be found in either of these cities to undertake the duty ; and therefore , as a last resort , the Legislature of 1844 authorized the Executive to employ as agents citizens of Massachusetts , whose duty it should be to proceed to those ports and there take the proper measures to promote an amicable appeal of the controversy to the highest tribunal of the Union . Under this resolve , an eminent citizen of Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proceeded to Charleston to exercise its duties . The result of this mission is well known . Mr. Hoar , attempt . ing in a manner perfectly respectful to perform the simple and peaceful duty assigned him , was prevented by the violence of a mob , and driven from the state , and the disgraceful outrage was immediately sanctioned by a special act of the Legislature of South Carolina . Such have been the proceedings of Massachusetts , in her efforts to obtain for her injured citizens protection and redress . Upon a review of them , we think she may well , in the language of her protest , " challenge the world to show that she has done any act in connection with this subject which it was not her indispensable duty to her citizens to do for their protection , or which any state has a just right to complain of her for doing . Neither has there been a word placed upon her statute book which she has occasion to regret . Her remonstrance has been grave , respectful , reasonable . Her measures have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of truth and peace . Let posterity decide whether South Carolina will be entitled , with any justice , to say as much . " The conduct of the latter state it can not be necessary for us to characterize . Her Act for the expulsion of Mr. Hoar , was followed by an Act making it a high misdemeanor , punishable with fine and imprisonment and banishment from the state , to call in question before any court the validity of the obnoxious laws , or to come into the state with that intent ; and in the very infatuation of despotism , as if to show how utterly unmeaning a term is freedom in a land of slavery , and to heap up odium and detestation on her own head , she proceeded to repeal , in respect to free persons of color imprisoned under her laws , the provisions of the " Habeas Corpus Act ; " not hesitating even to quote it by the title by which it has become venerable in the history of English liberty , as " An Act for the better securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond seas . " The controversy rests for the present upon the declaration adopted by Massachusetts , in which , addressing each of her sister states , she enters her earnest and solemn **o // TEST against the hostile acts of South Carolina . We regret that our limits will not permit us to do justice to this noble document  --  a document worthy of the best days of old Massachusetts and of her best men ; and one which , crowning the series of her acts , completes the contrast , from the first so striking , between her conduct and language and those of her antagonist ; the contrast between the spirit of Christianity and the spirit of chivalry . Disclaiming the purpose of retaliation , and acknowledging that patience undersuch gross and glaring wrong is the present duty of the state , not towards South Carolina , but towards the pacific states , she impressively protests against the commission of that wrong , adjures her sister states not to permit a case of injury to the rights of the people of any state to find no constitutional mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must inevitably ensue , if one state is thus permitted to assume and maintain the prerogative of setting up her own will or her own opinion as law , instead of or in opposition to the judgment of that high tribunal which the Supreme Law of the land has made the final arbiter in all cases of conflicting right arising under it . In opening the discussion now concluded , we expressed the hope and belief that this controversy would yet he decided upon its intrinsic merits . It is , indeed , hardly to be expected that upon the identical law out of which it has arisen the Supreme Court will very soon have an opportunity to pronounce ; but laws the same in principle are enforced in so many of the states , in some of which the friends of freedom and the right are becoming numerous and ardent , that we do confidently expect to see at an early day the great question , as to whether the Constitution does or does not recognize and protect the essential rights of the colored freeman , tried and decided before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no possible doubt as to what it will be , Massachusetts may be in a condition to renew the contest on the soil of South Carolina , and force that state to the alternative of admitting the rights of her citizens , or expressly annulling within her limits , not as of old a law of Congress , but the Constitution itself . In the mean time , we hope , though it is much to require of human nature , that she will continue to forbear from acts of mere retaliation ; and we know that she will continue to press , by every proper measure and in every proper place , her demand of justice for herself and her citizens . And especially , though we know how little is to be expected from Congress , absolutely controlled as it is by the slaveholding interest , yet , seeing that the Federal Judiciary is charged with the duty of protecting the ri0hts of citizens under the Federal Constitution ; that the power of resorting to that tribunal , to ascertain and enforce those rights , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has set herself to defeat that right , by making its exercise within her limits in certain cases a crime , and in other cases impossible ; that a case has thus arisen which the law organizing the Judiciary department did not contemplate and does not reach ; that it is the imperative duty of the Legislative department to enable the Judiciary to perform its functions and give effect to the positive enactments of the Constitution and that further legislation has become necessary for this purpose , and may accomplish it : we hope and trust that those who represent the state in Congress will be instructed to urge upon that body the enactment of such further laws , and that all the friends of the Constitution and of freedom , there and elsewhere , will co-operate with them in the work , as one of paramount importance and never to be abandoned.
