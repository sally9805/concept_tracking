Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : Sentiment I bring no gift of passion from Poems , in Flora 's interpreter ( 1847 ) I bring no gift of passion , I breathe no tone of love , But the freshness and the purity Of a feeling far above . I love to turn to thee , fair girl , As one within whose heart Earth had no stain of vanity , And fickleness no part .

Oh ! when the breath of flattery is warm upon thine ear , And manly brows are bending in humble homage near , May no dream of tenderness arise , which earth may not fulfil , And no fountain open in thy heart , which Time hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
