Enter Count Ruffenhoff , followed by Politz , L. H. Ruff . Count Ruffenhoff ( R. H. ) How say you , Politz , no intelligence of the fugitives ? Poli . Politz None , my lord , nor of their pursuers . Ruff . Count Ruffenhoff Perdition ! that they should have escaped ! Are these foreign serfs gifted with magic power , or am I served by traitors ? Poli . Politz Nay , my lord , doubt not the loyalty of your friends and servants , whose senses are confounded at this most wonderful escape ; and who all agree that it must have been affected by the ingenuity of that shrewd and singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count Ruffenhoff Ha ! that American ! that supposed fool , whom I now suspect to be a knave ; sent here perhaps with others of his insolent tribe to aid these accursed Poles in their audacious rebellion . Poli . Politz Aye ! and doubtless , my lord , while he entertained your highness ' ear by his tales and drolleries , and gained your indulgencies , he was planning not only his own escape , but also that of your noble and beauteous captive ! Ruff . Count Ruffenhoff Distraction and disappointment ! She , the richest , dearest trophy of our victory ; whose eyes still fire my soul with passion 's burning rage , and whom I hoped should bless  --  ( Paces stage. ) but hence despair ! My slaves dare not be false  --  they will retake her  --  she shall be mine ; and bending low within my firm grasp , repent her virtuous folly and her scorn : already have I given orders to trusty Blusterdoff to treble the reward set on them . Quick , Politz , my horse ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth in their pursuit  --  to-morrow 's dawn shall see them in my power ! She to meet my passion ! he his fitting doom . Exeunt R. H.

Rlust . Blusterdoff Aye  --  that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! Blust . Blusterdoff Silence ! I command it !

No. 1 , Rowina Poloski , daughter of the famous Polish rebel of that name ; she escaped from our fortress , everybody knows when , but nobody knows how ; if taken with her treasures the reward will be doubled . No. 2 , Calvin Cartwheel , a white-skinn 'd American Yankee savage  --  found beating the drum for the Polish rebels , and made beater of the great Brazen drum of the fortress ; escaped with our Brazen drum in the most brazen manner  --  nobody knows when , and the devil knows how !

Now , serfs , guards , and all the rest of you , you have heard the noble Count 's  --  that is , I mean , our decree , and  --  Enter Politz , hastily , L. H. Poli . Politz Blusterdoff , his highness  --  Blust . Blusterdoff Booh ! Blusterdoff ! nothing else ? Slave ! but what brings  --  that is , I mean , what means this unmannered , unceremonious haste  --  speak ? Poli . Politz The noble Count commands you to  --  Blust .

SCENE III .  --  A Rocky Cut Wood near the Sea Coast , touched with Snow , whish continues falling through the scene . ( Music hurry . ) Enter Nelson Murdale , L. U. E. Murdale . Nelson Murdale Alas ! all my hopes are vain ! for three long days a lone and friendless fugitive , have I wandered  --  hunted by the victorious , but heartless foes of Poland and freedom , till grim despair comes glaring near , eager to prey upon my soul . Throughout the morn I ve stood upon the rock that drives the dark sea back , and strained my eyes to meet the hoped-for aid , but all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! no sight , save that of desolation ! yet far more dreadful must be the lot of my Rowina  --  doomed in vile captivity to mourn her father 's wretched fate ; her country 's ruin , and her lover lost to her perhaps forever ! Oh , Heaven ! perhaps even now within the foul tyrant 's grasp , she vainly shrieks for aid and calls on death to save her from dishonor ! ( Calvin heard singing at a distance , R. U. E. ) Ah ! what sound is that ? Can it be a human voice , or is it but the snow-laden winds rushing through the trees ! ( Calvin again . ) Again ! Heavens ! ' t is the cry of man  --  doubtless the Russian tyrant and his minions in pursuit of me . What shall I do , fly , or surrender ? Can I longer exist in hunger and suspence ? Yes , Providence will befriend the patient  --  aid may yet come ; yes , to the cavern , and for one day more hope and liberty be mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin , Calvin Cartwheel R. U. E. , partially covered with snow , with the great Brazen drum on his back , singing the following : Bounaparte , he crossed the Alps , Thro ' ice and snow quite drear , sir ; But Washington he was the one That crossed the Delaware , sir . Cornstalks twist your hair , &c.; Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Well now , if I haint jist as good as crossed both the Alps and the Delaware this very day , then my legs are not of the true Cartwheel breed , that 's all . Now , poor Miss Rowina , I guess we 've got beyond the reach of them ' ere darned Russian Muscovy inan-bears , and I reckon I can unload my cart . Rowina . Rowina ( Within the drum . ) Quick ! kind Calvin , haste . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Guess I will , Miss , be as hasty as a Varmount puddin' ' . Takes the drum from his back , places it upright on the stage , opens a sort of door in the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very faint . Rowina . Rowina Kind noble soul , I am weak in voice and words , but believe me , for this most generous act , my heart is big with gratitude and thanks to you . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Thank ye , so am I. It 's nation strange  --  but , by the forewheel of old Phoebus ' cart , whenever I does any one a good turn , if my heart do n't wag about a leetle bit faster than a brown dog 's tail . But , I say , Miss , if that darn 'd black bear-faced Count Ruffenhoff , counted on keepin ' you , to make you jist anything he liked , he was jist as much mistaken , I kal'ate , as another wolf I recollect in Varmount , that thought he had one of our lambs , but when he grab 'd it , it wa n't there ! He thinks himself pretty sharp , and so am I. But I say , Miss , the old woman up stairs is pickin ' her geese , and as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon you 'd better back your cart into that ' ere drum out o ' the cold , while I look around for better quarters to put up at . Rowina . Rowina ( R. H. ) I fear not the storm , good Calvin , nor ought else , if I am secure from that rude monster 's power ; the bleakest winds that sweeps Smaratia 's hills can give my heart no chill so dread as Ruffenhoff 's foul touch  --  better that this snow should be my death-bed , shroud and grave , ' ere I be doom 'd to meet a tyrant 's fell embraces , or look with other eyes than those of scorn upon the desolator of poor Poland . Crosses to L. H. Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Bra-vo ! so am I  --  darn my wheelspokes , Miss , if you ai nt jist about as spunky a gal , as my Continental grandmother was in our Yankee Revolution war . Rowina . Rowina Still will I trust in Heaven ! and did I but know the fate of loved Murdale , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , Miss ; but at the same time I kal'ate you need n't fear but what they 're both somewheres , and a doing somethin ' to help me and you  --  for I jist heard ' em settle the whole bargain about that afore they parted . Rowina . Rowina Indeed ! how was it , speak , friend ? Cal . Calvin Cartwheel I ai nt no speaker , Miss , but at the same time , howsumdever , I 'll jist tell you the straight and downright truth o n't . You recollect , I reckon , that at the latter eend of the fight , the darned rough Russian Muscovies seized a holt upon you , and carted you off to that eternal infernal Count Roughenrough  --  I was beating my drum at the head on some patriots , but seein ' you , it beat me so , that darn me if I could beat a single solitary stroke  --  my cornstalk stalk was up , and I felt jist about as savage as a cross-cut saw , and a leetle bit sharper ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jist took hold on a gun with a prong at the eend o n't , and druv my way to Murdale . " Hellow , " says I , " Nelson , the darn 'd Muscovies are runnin ' off with your gal . " " Come , we 'll make the villains yield her , " says he ; so am I , said I , and away we druv . Well , we had n't got fur before we seen your brave old Dad , slashing away among a whole flock of Russians ; " Go it , Capting , " says I  --  and go it he did too , clar up to the pint and handle , about as slick as a Varmounter in corn cuttin ' time ; but seein ' there was too many for one to stand agin , me and Nelson walked into ' em  --  and by the forewheel of old Phoebus ' cart , if we did n't lay down sich a swarth of cutdown Muscovies , as Bonyparte never seed or heard on . Away the t'others skeeted  --  Yermanoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off about as sudden as a flock of quails , skeered by powder lightnin ' , and I reckon they did quail to the very tarnationest . Rowina . Rowina But my father  --  Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Well , we 've jist got to him  --  the old chap look 'd like a sugar-maple tree tapped all round , and the sap ' gin runnin ' out on him pretty considerable . Howsomdever , he was for huntin ' you out right off , but seein ' more Muscovies makin ' after us , Nelson tell 'd him we 'd take care of you , and got a couple o ' soldiers to cart your dad off to a vessel that was jist agoin ' to start off to fetch us a leetle more charcoal feed for these darned Muscovy ducks . Well , after that you know we tried to cart you off , when a hull flock of two-leg 'd Russian bears walk 'd into us , and went the hull entire swine tooth and all  --  they rooted up poor Nelson , but by old Samstrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their bristles , whiskers and fur fly like Varmount wild-cats in a scuffle , then I never seen nothin ' ; but how he got out of the scrape darn me if I can kal'ate  --  for I was goin ' it pretty considerable strong myself . Well , jist as I was gittin ' cart room , up druv two more chaps with their darned fighting scythes  --  by the forewheel of old Phoebus ' cart , if it did n't raise my cornstalk , and make me a leetle bit fiercer than a steam saw mill . Now , said I , you all-fired , rusty Russian thieves , this is none o'your ground anyhow , and if you begin mowing about me , darn me if you do n't cut up a bumble bee 's nest ; at me they come  --  at them I went with the prong o ' my gun , in regular pitchfork fashion , and I went the complete yaller jacket , sling and all ! I used one chap clean up , all but a bit of fur , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darned Muscovies trip 'd me , and carted me foot-foremost into their eternal , infernal black stone barn they call a fortress  --  that I suppose means a she fort ; but by old Samstrong , if I did n't kick a leetle bit wickeder than my uncle Caleb 's great colt the first time it was shod ! Lost everything but my Varmount cartwhip  --  and say , Miss , if it had n't been that I kal'ated I mought get a chance to help you , darn me if they 'd ever tuck this critter alive , no how . Rowina . Rowina Brave , noble heart ! but oh ! do not , I conjure you , deceive me ; tell me , do you really think Murdale and my father are alive and secure , and that we yet may meet again ? Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Yes , sartain  --  not the least bit a doubt o n't , I kal'ate !  --  And so  --  ( Looking in the snow . ) Hurrah ! hurrah ! Rowina . Rowina Ha ! what mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebus ' cart , if there ai nt the whole clear print of Murdale 's boot in the snow . Rowina . Rowina Great powers ! Can it be ? Cal . Calvin Cartwheel I reckon it can be , when it is ; why I 'd take my oath o n't it 's his boot  --  I know it , it 's the only regular square toe ' tween here and Boston . Rowina . Rowina Oh ! blessed hope ! perhaps he may be near us . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Yes , and jist as like as not , we 're near him . Now , Miss , you 're too weak to foller , so jist back your cart into that ' ere brass kittle , and stop here a bit , and I 'll track him jist about as slick as a Varmount fox-hound  --  do n't be afeared , I 'll jist look , and if it 's like to be a long chase , I 'll come back , and cart you along , brass kittle and all . Rowina . Rowina Faithful Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin Cartwheel Guess not  --  " short metre , " as our parson says at home  --  would n't run the chance of loosin ' you , no how ; so back in . ( Music .  --  He puts her into the drum , and takes an old cartwhip from under his dress . ) Come out here , old relic of Varmount . ( Looks round the stage as following the track . ) Now then , my English fox , I guess I 'm after you , and ready to streak it equal to the hull clear genuine four-footed quadruped . He cracks his whip and runs off L. S. E. Rowina . Rowina ( As he goes off . ) Heaven be his guide ! Retires , partially closing door of the drum . Enter Politz , Serfitz , and Blusterdoff , R. H. Poli . Politz Now , Blusterdoff , here 'll be a great flurry and a terrible fury , and all on account of your delay  --  the Count and his party have gone on before us , and we 've got upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ! Booh ! do I not know it , sir ; ( points R. ) the right track is that way . Poli . Politz How ? Blust . Blusterdoff That is , I mean , the back track  --  so let 's track back . Going . Poli . Politz Pshaw ! Serf . Serfitz ( Seeing the drum . ) Ah ! look , Politz , what have we here ? Poli . Politz By my life , it 's the Brazen drum of our fortress . Blust . Blusterdoff Let me examine  --  ( goes up fearfully ) by St. Nicholas , I was right , it is the Brazen drum . I 'm Governor of the fortress , my fortune 's made . Poli &; Serf . Politz , Serfitz Your fortune ? Blust . Blusterdoff That is , I mean  --  our diligence shall be rewarded ! Bring it down lads . Music  --  As they bend to take hold of drum they see tracks in the snow . Serf . Serfitz Ah ! see ! here are the foot-prints of a man . Poli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Come , this way , follow ! the 500 rubies are ours . Blust . Blusterdoff Yes , but I say , lads you know  --  that is I mean , these tracks may lead to the devil knows where ; so let 's content ourselves for the present , with capturing the Brazen drum . Poli . Politz I do n't mean that we three are able to take them , but I 'll bet my two pistols against your costly dagger , that I 'll discover them in fifteen minutes . Blust . Blusterdoff Agreed ! there 's my dagger . ( Throws it on the head of the drum .  --  Aside . ) I can remain here  --  get half the rubles and none of the trouble , Poli . Politz And there are my pistols . Throws them on he drum . Blust . Blusterdoff But I say , fellows  --  that is , I mean , friends . Poli . &; Serf . Politz , Serfitz What ? Coming down . Blust . Blusterdoff ( Musleriously . ) Do you know that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have most profoundly suspected that there is something horribly bad about that drum . Poli . &; Serf . Politz , Serfitz Indeed ! Poli . Politz Well ; there is something bass about it . Blust . Blusterdoff Right , right ! that is , I mean base . Serf . Serfitz Well , but how ? Blust . Blusterdoff Something most marvellously  --  mysteriously  --  damnably mischievous . Poli . &; Serf . Politz , Serfitz No ! Blust . Blusterdoff Yes , I 'll tell you  --  at the same time keep your eyes about :  --  one night in the guard-room of the fortress , at about ten minutes before twelve o'clock  --  that is , I mean near midnight  --  mind that  --  midnight , when Calvin the brazen beater , and all were lock 'd up in the room , and lock 'd in sleep  --  Mrs. Blusterdoff slipt to me from the Countess ' table , a most plump and splendid barbacued duck  --  sent by the Countess of course ; well I placed it on the head of the drum , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly the drum gave a most deep and hollow bang ! I turned round , and by St. Nicholas , the duck was gone . Both . Nelson Murdale , Rowina Gone ! Music .  --  Here Rowina , who has been watching an opportunity , is seen to take the pistols and dagger from the head of the drum  --  she looks at the priming  --  she is about to depart , but hearing voices outside , retires . Blust . Blusterdoff Yes , gone ! that is , I mean , it was not there . Here all turn towards drum , and start in astonishment at seeing their weapons are gone . Poli . Politz Blow me , if my pistols are there ! Blust . Blusterdoff Damn me , if my dagger 's there ! Here Rowina , in her alarm , strikes head of the drum with one of the pistols within .  --  Chord . Blust . Blusterdoff The devil 's in the drum ! I 'll plunge my  --  that is , I mean , Politz thrust your sword into it . Music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Blusterdoff stands trembling ; as they are about to thrust their swords into the head of the drum , Rowina darts out , holding a pistol in each hand , which she levels at them  --  they retreat a few steps . Blust . Blusterdoff St. Nicholas ! behold , Rowina , the captive ! Rowina . Rowina Coward slave ! ' t is false ! Rowina 's no captive while she can grasp a weapon to pierce the heart of a tyrant 's minion . Blust . Blusterdoff Officers , seize her ! Rowina . Rowina Aye  --  dare but to move ! my hands are firm as my purpose  --  and a single motion seals my freedom , and your doom ! Come on , which is the cur will die to serve a tyrant-master  --  an oppressor of the innocent ! Do you fear ? Then depart , cowards , or die this instant .

Mur . Nelson Murdale Come , comrade , partake of our rude meal . Cal .

Calvin Cartwheel Now wa n't I rather fix 'd out for a journey  --  that 's only a leetle of my plunderations from old Belly-ache Blusterdoff ; so , now , jist take and put a leetle o ' this ( gives brandy. ) in the hub of your wheels . Mur Nelson Murdale You 're a noble fellow , Calvin ; but tell me , friend , how in the name of Heaven , did you contrive to escape from that fortress , and with Rowina . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel ( Fixing by table . ) Well , now , I 'll jist take and tell you the hull , straight plainification , and roundaboutation on it ! Well , you see as how the darned Muscovies shet me up in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this ' ere big brass kittle to raise the neighborhood with , and left me a bit to my own kal'ations . There I was nicely trip 'd , though I felt a considerable smartness all over ; then I begin to get all stormin ' mad , and I really believe that with a leetle taller on my head , I mought ha ' swallowed myself ; so I kal'ated that if I could only git my cornstalk a leetle furder up , I mought back my cart agin the darned stable door and break it open . So I took out my cartwhip , pulled off my coat , and begun lickin ' myself ; but it wa n't the thing ; I next went to work upon this ' ere brass kittle , and I beat Yankee Doodle at sich an allstormin ' rate , as you haint heer 'd me do since we left Boston ; in come old Ruffenough and the rest of the Russian dogs ; and by the forewheel of old Phoebus ' cart , if they wa n't all nearly ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ere Muscovies with this ' ere kittle jist about as slick as the Varmount gals charm bees , by beatin ' the fryin ' pan ; they promoted me right off to be beater of the great drum . Finally , I crawled clear into their affections , like a black-snake into a stone fence ; but how in the deuce I did it , I do n't know , for I was jist about as sassy , as old maid Crumpy 's dog , that when he could n't see anything else he 'd turn around and bark at his tail . Well , they tell 'd me that after a day or so , they was goin ' to have a sort o ' trainin ' outside o ' the house , and that I mought go out and ' stonish the great rustycrats with my beatin ' on the Brazen drum  --  and I guess I did ' stonish ' em a leetle too slick , for I beat a retreat instanterly the moment I go out ; that same night , while all was snorin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that tuck me right into Miss Rowina 's room . Tarnation fine gal that , her hair curls as slick as a cedar shavin ' , and it 's about as soft as corn-silk . Well , after that , I kal'ated on a plan that mought git us both out as snug as a leetle sharpened wind , thinks I , I 'll jist take and make a door in that ' ere drum , and when they let me out to the trainin ' I 'll put Miss Rowing into it , and cart her clear off . So I stole a darn sharp fightin ' scythe from one of the sleepy Muscovies , and with a bit of a file I found , I made a sort o ' saw o n't . Well , the next night they all happened to be in a regular tetotally drunken sleep , and was snorin ' away like used-up carthorses ; then the way I made my patent saw walk into that drum was about equal to a little steam-mill ; but after a bit the darned queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I jist come the possum ; laid right straight down , and tried to snore like the noise my saw made ; and tarnation well I did it . " D  --  n that Yankee , " says one  --  " What a queer snore he 's got , " says t' other ,  --  so I jist spread it on a leetle thinner till they got to sleep agin , and I began sawin ' again ! Well , the next night I got the drum all fixed ; I druv into Miss ' room , slip 'd her into it , and carted her into our garret so slick that she hardly know 'd it herself ; and by old Samstrong , before mornin ' come , there I set on the drum head whistlin ' Yankee Doodle ; not a single solitary Muscovy reckon 'd what I 'd been doin ' ; but by the giant Goligy , did n't I feel ' bout as ticklish as a young colt whenever any on ' em come near the drum ? Well , as soon as daylight begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after bit up comes old Bluster  --  and ordered me to strike up the Brazen drum ; that in course I did n't agree to no how , and I was rather afraid it mought have a suspicious sound ; the darned old dog shook his fightin ' scythe at me ; I felt my cornstalk beginnin ' to rise , but seein ' that would do no good , I give ' em a double rattle on the little drum , and made the Muscovies stare agin ; jist then we were all ordered out ; the doors and gate was throwed open  --  I slung the big kittle on my back , and down we marched to slow time , but all the while I heer 'd Rowina 's heart beatin ' quick time inside . Well , jist as we got into the yard , old Count Roughenough seen that Rowina was not to be seen , an ' he did kick up an allstormin ' noise , an ' called all the Muscovies up agin  --  up stairs they flew  --  out o ' the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lightning . Well , I had n't got over about twenty paces , ' fore I seed one of their sentinel 's eye on me  --  he told me to stand , but I would n't stand it , no how ; jist as he was goin ' to shoot , I sent a snow-ball right into the primin ' of his gun ; he pulled , but it would n't go off ; so I pushed on  --  he turned after me ; says he , " Stop , you slave  --  you Yankee , " says I , " you lie , I 'm a Russian , " an ' I reckon I was , for if I did n't rush out o ' his sight about as quick as a streak of Elexandertricity , then I do n't know anything about it .

Have we not seen the streets of Praga strewed , nay , piled with the gory corses of our fathers , mothers , sisters , and their unoffending offspring  --  butchered by the fell Suwarrow ? In short , have we not seen Rusciosko leave his country in despair ; our dearest relatives yoked like brutes together and driven to dread Siberia ?

Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Oh , so am I , ma'am  --  jist as you say ! I reckon as how you 're a temperance woman , but not a teetotallar , as we say down East and about there  --  now my uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his apple orchard for fear his pigs mought eat apples , and thereby grow up to be drunken hogs . Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff Come , sir , not a word against temperance  --  I forbid it  --  but , inform me , are you really a Yankee savage . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Not quite a full blooded Yankee savage  --  but I reckon , I was a savage Yankee a minute ago . Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff Bless me , I thought the Americans were of a copper color , and all alike . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Why , ma'am , we are all alike , but not all of a color  --  most on us now are of no color . Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff How ? ( With surprise . ) Cal .

Calvin Cartwheel Well , now ma'am , to tell you the clear truth about it , I 'm sorry to say , that some queer old critters do go in for ' malgamation ; but ma'am that sort o ' way o ' mixin ' colors do n't go down with true blooded Yankees , no how . Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff Some forbid it then ? Cal . Calvin Cartwheel I reckon they do  --  by old Goligy , if they were all to go in for that , the country 'd be so eternally dark , that the people could n't see one another . Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff Indeed ! ah ! bless me , what a pity that such a fine intelligent youth like you , should become a rebel . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel No disgrace , I reckon , ma'am  --  do you know the greatest man that ever lived was a rebel ? Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mrs. Blusterdoff I think I must have heard of him before  --  but tell me , how came you to leave your country and your sweetheart to join these rebel Poles . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel Why , you see as how , ma'am , I was carpenter , carter and drum-major in the State of Varmount , and was reckon 'd at trainin ' and the like , a purty considerable of a critter  --  well , when the news come over that the brave Poles had struck against tyrant Nick , and wanted help , I thought o ' Rusciosko and Pulaski helpin ' us  --  and thinks I one good turn deserves another , so here goes for Poland . I tell 'd Kitty about it  --  she gnaw 'd the eend of her apron abit , then wipin ' her eyes with the corner on it , says " Its rather hard , Calvin , to part  --  but mammy stood it in old times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served me up a few notions , and down I went to Boston ; there I happened to come across Nelson Murdale , who was a regular pilot , two other Englishmen , and some Boston boys , with a small vessel , all determined to go the hull critter for the brave Poles . Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff The wretches ! Cal . Calvin Cartwheel There a question riz , as to how we were to go for to git into Poland . " Jist wait , " says I to ' em , " I 've kal'ated on a plan that will take us there jist as slick as a soaped ferret into a rat hole . " I shew 'd a machine I 'd invented for dressin ' hemp  --  says I , " jist cart a few o ' them across the big salt pond , and if they do n't so astonish the Russian rustycrats , that they 'll leave us go anywhere , then you may saw my body up into lie-tubs for tellin ' a lie , "  --  so I tuck and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em up in long boxes  --  then we got a hull pack o ' shootin ' sticks and shootin ' things , packed ' em in the same sort o ' boxes , and marked ' em all " Patent hemp dressers , for Russia . " Well , off we sailed in our leetle blue-sail 'd Liberty skiff , and by the forewheel of Phoebus ' cart , if she did n't skim it across old Neptune 's pickle tub a leetle bit faster than a barn-swallow scared by a cartload o ' thunder . I beat Yankee Doodle on the drum , and it appeared to me the harder I beat the faster she went ; at first I got sort o ' sea-sick , and I felt as though my bowels was playin ' swing with my stomach  --  but after being soused in pickle a few times , we druv in sight o ' one o ' your Russian forts , with sich an all-fired liquim vitae name , that ' t would crack one 's skull to remember it . Well , out come two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and axed what we was loaded with , and what we was after ; we tell 'd ' em we 'd come on a bit o ' speculation , with machinery ; I jist tuck out one o ' my hemp machines , tuck a piece o ' hemp , and showed ' em how it worked : " There strangers , " says I , " I give that ' ere as a present , jist keep it agoin ' and darn me if it 'll ever stop , or ever want mendin "  --  and by my spokes , if I did n't drive it down ' em at sich a rate , that one on ' em ordered a hull dozen for his farms in Poland . They look 'd into a few boxes , said all right , and told us to drive up to the town ; in we druv , and after we 'd sold and swap 'd the hull o ' my patent hemp dressers , they give us liberty to cart our remainin ' boxes to what they call their serfs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pilot us around to it  --  well , we soon druv up to a big stone barn , somethin ' like this ' ere , and there some o ' your darn 'd Russian varmints had  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Blusterdoff Come , that 's insolence  --  I forbid it . Cal . Calvin Cartwheel And there they had the brave old Poloski , with his datter and about fifty of his men , reglarly caged  --  and ready to set to work at dressin ' hemp . Arter we 'd carted our boxes all into the yard , I give the old chap a wink , says I , " I kal'ate the Muscovies ' ll lose by this speculation . " Six on our crew got the Russian pilot into our cloud skiff again to cart him off somewhere , and somehow , darn me , if they ever got back again ; ( aside. ) though I seen somethin ' tarnation like ' em this mornin ' . Howsomever , one o ' your captains with a Boston lady 's muff on his head , ordered all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemp-dressers  --  and I tell you what , when they seed the boxes was filled with shootin ' sticks and the like , darn me if they did n't jumps for joy like a scapegallows Nathan , that when he got pardoned under the gallows , he jump 'd so tarnation fur out o ' the cart , and come down so fur in the mud , that he had to run all the way back to git the people to come and help him out . Well , by the time that ' ere Russian captain , with the lady 's muff on his head , come into the yard , there stood every man with one o ' my patent hemp-dressers on his shoulder , ready to pop at him  --  and by the forewheel of Phoebus ' cart , if he did n't turn as blue as a bit o ' brimstone scortch 'd by lightnin ' .  --  Well , he made right after me  --  says he , " slave , are these your hemp-dressers ? " says I , " jist so , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a piece o ' nothin ' left of you , jist back yourself out o ' this  --  bull dogs and all "  --  here he rung a bell , and in come a whole flock of Muscovy geese  --  Mrs. B.

Calvin Cartwheel Guards , I meant  --  but we went to work upon ' em with my dressers , and used every Muscovy clean up ; the Poles were free , and the great barn teetotally their'n ; all done slick as dubbin ' by my sham patent hemp-dressers .
