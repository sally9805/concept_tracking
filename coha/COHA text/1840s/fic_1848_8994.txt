Sce ne  --  An Island in the Archipelago , and a Convent on the Continental shore  --  A Scene of the Sixteenth Century . PROLOGUE . To wake the genius , and enlarge the mind , To gild each thought with sentiment refined , To hold , as ' t were , a beacon on the stage , And stay the follies of this wayward age ; To portray with nature 's genial power each part , And thence aspire to mend the human heart : For this the drama takes her lofty stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the vasty deep , Who ages slumbered in oblivion 's sleep ; Revives the darkest scenes on history 's page , The grand , sublime and tragic of the age ; Spreads through the world a vivifying flame , And raises genius to immortal fame ; Gives vice its darkest shades , whose withering doom Engulfs its votaries in desponding gloom ; And clothes the angel Virtue , as she flies , In all the rainbow beauty of the skies . For this , fair Thespia , with her magic art , Adorns and purifies the erring heart ; Draws with her mystic wand the scenes of life , Its loves , its hates , its battles , and its strife ; Portrays the passions of the aspiring soul , Without direction and without control ; Enrobes immortal virtue as the sun , Too bright for vice to gaze or look upon . Long may the drama thus perform her part , And sway the passions by her ennobling art ; And as she soars , as lofty as the skies , May she be blessed by grateful memories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The poet 's brightest gems to her redound ; And all the arts , in bright angelic lays , Unite to celebrate the drama 's praise . Kind friends , our author solely aims to-night , To add one ray of humanizing light  --  To hold the tragic doom his hero bore , A beacon on this dark , untraveled shore . In fair Lucretia 's untimely fate , To trace the dangers of a father 's hate ; Drives to despair his age 's hope and pride , And madly drags her loved lord from her side . Long may the drama hold its steady way , Illuming mental darkness with its ray ; Each play a moral to the admiring age , Enriched by brightest truths from history 's page . On this broad platform should the drama stand , Dispensing light and knowledge through the land ; Here should her flowing banner be unfurled , The boast , the pride and glory of the world ! Main text ACT I.  --  SCENE I. Night  --  Storm  --  Thunder and lightning  --  A view of the sea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and firing minute guns  --  A wild rocky shore  --  Monks are seen upon the rocks waving torch-lights  --  The ship gradually breaks up and disappears . Enter Prior Bertrand , with Monks . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand How dreadful is this raging storm ! The noble ship , dashed on our rocky coast , Is now engulfed amidst the lashing waves ; No hope now lingers for the fated crew ; All , all have perished in this furious storm  --  And the dread monarch , grim , relentless Death , Waves his black ensign o'er the angry deep . FIRST MONK . First Monk And yet there is a hope ! some furious wave May dash a drowning wretch upon the shore , E'en while struggling in the deadly grasp , Engulfed by ocean 's wild imperious surge ; Perchance encircled by some friendly wave May cast him harmless on our fatal shore . PRIOR BERTRAND Prior Bertrand looking towards the sea , and apparently examining with great solicitude , suddenly starts . Methought , but now , amidst the frothy surge , I saw a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings unto a broken mast ! It is a female struggling for her life ! May Heaven protect her in this dreadful hour ! FIRST MONK . First Monk And see ! the waves have dashed her on the rocks ; Father , let us swiftly fly from hence , And save her from her dark impending fate . Prior Bertrand and Monks exeunt . The storm still continues , accompanied with occasional thunder and lightning . The Monks are seen to draw a female figure out of the sea . They all re-enter , bearing her lifeless form on the stage . PRIOR BERTRAND Prior Bertrand examining the body . Is life extinct ?  --  or , rather , is there not Some lingering spark , that soon , by prudent care , May yet be fanned into a genial flame ? The circling current of life is stopped , The lungs refuse their functions  --  And yet , about the regions of the heart , A gentle warmth prevades . Bear her forthwith within the convent walls ; Quick , brothers , quick ! no moments must be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . The Monks bear the body off the stage as the scene changes . SCENE II . An apartment in the Corsair 's fortress . Enter Gonzalvo . GONZALVO Gonzalvo solus . It is in vain , upon my downy pillow , I court the favors of the drowsy god ; In vain I seek , by sleep 's oblivious pow'r , To plunge in sweet forgetfulness my woes . Dark , fearful visions flash upon my brain , And , as I lie writhing in agony , Red , ghastly spectres , rising from their graves , Glare fiercely at me , pointing to their wounds  --  Wounds , too , inflicted by these guilty hands  --  With throats cut , and foreheads cleft in twain , Deep , lacerated wounds upon their breasts ; They point to them , and fiercely , wildly cry , Vengeance upon their guilty murderer ! O ! ' t is horrible ! ' t is agony ! ' t is death ! That , while I 'm wrapt within the arms of sleep , Such phantoms crowd on my distemper 'd brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes there ? Enter Alberti . How darest thou , at this unseemly hour , Intrude upon my privacy ? ALBERTI . Alberti Signior , but now a messenger arrived , Who brings the intelligence That a large ship was wrecked in this night 's storm , On yonder coast , And every soul on board has perished ! GONZALVO . Gonzalvo What country 's flag did she display ? ALBERTI . Alberti Spanish , signior . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Ha ! then I have lost a noble prize ; Spanish , didst thou say ? Then welcome , storm and tempest , That sweep the proud imperious flag of Spain To its destruction . May all that shall escape my vengeful ire , That sails beneath that blood-polluted banner , Meet in the ocean 's wild and stormy billow A dark and fearful death ! ALBERTI . Alberti Signior , I 've heard you oft before Vent imprecations ' gainst the Spaniards ; Pray , if I may presume , Why dost thou bear to Spain such deadly hate Before all other nations ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Because of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have borne What no human bosom but my own could bear ; Falsely accused of treason to my sovereign , Torn from my exalted state and dignity , And from the endearments of a lovely wife , Cast into a dark and loathsome dungeon , And sentenced to an ignominious death ! What could I bear within my bleeding breast But vengeance , burning vengeance , ' gainst my foes ? ALBERTI . Alberti Hast thou not seen thy wife since then ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo From that dark hour , alas ! I 've never gazed Upon her lovely form ! ALBERTI . Alberti How didst thou escape this death of infamy ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo With gold my friends did bribe my guards , And by immediate flight secured my liberty . But dark misfortune followed in my path : Scarce had I sailed on board a noble bark Bound for the Ionian Isles , When an Algerine corsair bore upon us ; O'erwhelmed by numbers we were soon made captive ; Few were spared , and those Were borne in ignominious chains to this Ione isle , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberti How long didst thou remain in bondage ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Until my vengeance kindled to a flame So fervent and intense , I could not halt Its raging impulse . Dire calamity had fallen on my house By the machinations of my enemies . At length I joined the corsair 's standard , And swore to him allegiance ; I then made an irrevocable vow Never to cease my vengeance ' gainst the Spaniard . Thou knowest well how I have kept my oath . Many a time , and oft , I 've stood Upon the quarter-deck of my stout ship , When a Spanish bark was floating by my side , Gazing at the slaughter of her crew ; And as each dark shriek of wild despair Rose from each dying wretch , While launching o'er the vessel 's side , Or , whilst a portion of my bloody band Were slaughtering them beneath the decks , Each shriek would sound more charming to my ear Than the dulcet music of the nightingale . But , come , the lark 's sweet notes without betoken That bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest dawn we must set sail , And bear the captives to the Barbary coast . Go thou immediately on board our ship , And see that all are stirring . I soon will follow thee . Exeunt , separately . SCENE III . A view of a dungeon in the fortress  --  Discovers Alphonso seated by a small table , on which burns a taper  --  He is loaded with chains , and his countenance appears haggard and dejected . ALPHONSO . Alphonso Silence now reigns within these gloomy walls : Naught , save the clanking of the captive 's chains , Mingled with sighs and groans that pierce my soul , Dares to disturb the stillness of the hour . Thus has a tedious , lingering year roll 'd Its lagging moments through such scenes of wo ! Oh Liberty ! thrice glorious Goddess ! Who can prize thy worth half so well As the wretch , who , having once tasted the joys That flow from the realms of thy divine abode , Is torn away from them perhaps forever ? But , hark ! Amid the clank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones , Mingling his dreaded accents mid the jar Which frights the peaceful silence that prevailed Throughout these dark abodes . He now approaches ; be firm my throbbing heart , And let me meet him like a man . Enter Gonzalvo . He advances to the front of the stage , at the same time gazing on Alphonso with a malignant scowl . ALPHONSO . Alphonso To what am I indebted For this early visit ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo It were time thy sorrows now should cease ; Thou hast , from the first moments of thy existence In this babbling and contentious world , Reveled in the lap of affuence and grandeur . But fate has ta'en thee from thy high estate , Where , on its exalted , giddy pinnacle , Thou didst not heed the fearful agonies Which thou inflicted upon others . To place thee in the school of dark affliction , Thou dost owe to the great law of nature A debt which thou shouldst shortly pay , And doing so secure thy freedom From all the sorrows of this babbling world . ALPHONSO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Talk'st thou of liberty ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo I do , most noble Alphonso ; I 'll minister to thy dark affliction ; And , like a skilful surgeon , separate The material from the immaterial part , And place thy disembodied spirit At liberty ! ALPHONSO . Alphonso Surely it can not be ! What meanest thou ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Twelve months have now elapsed Since thou wert in this dungeon placed . I have protracted thy existence But to scoff at thy agony . It is my pleasure that thy sufferings end ; By to-morrow 's earliest dawn Thou diest ! ALPHONSO . Alphonso Heavens ! for what dread purpose Dost thou design my death ? Why add to thy long catalogue of crimes Another murder of the foulest dye ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo To gratify my vengeance ! Alphonso , look at me ! Behold in me , the Pirate chief Gonzalvo , Thy direst enemy , the once proud Carlos ! Dost thou not , twenty years past , remember When , by the false accusation of thyself And the machinations of my enemies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did wed , That I was cast into a loathsome dungeon , And sentenced to a death of infamy ? How I appealed to all thy generous feeling , And implored thee to preserve my life , By exerting with my sovereign thy power ? How thou didst scoff at me , And taunt me with a traitorous design , When thou didst know that I was innocent ? But I escaped the dreadful doom Which ye designed me  --  And live ; live to redress my wrongs And wreak my vengeance on my murderous foes . Ho ! Altemont , within there ! Enter Altemont , with others . Bear yonder prisoner to the Eastern tower , Confine him in the darkest dungeon , And by to-morrow 's earliest dawn , Hang him from the battlements in chains . ALPHONSO . Alphonso Oh , Gonzalvo ! spare , spare my life ! Remember what my sufferings have been ; Remember that my life is but a span , And that my frail existence soon will close : Be magnanimous as you are brave . Look at these gray hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alphonso For mercy 's sake recant thy dreadful sentence ; Here at thy feet I humbly beg thy mercy . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Away with him . Altemont and the other pirates seize Alphonso , who struggles with them as they strive to force him out . ALPHONSO . Alphonso Tyrant , my death will be revenged ! Thy doom is fast approaching ; Ere another sun shall set , Thou mayst appear before the dread tribunal Of an offended God ! GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Away with him . ALPHONSO . Alphonso Then will thy dreadful crimes , howe'er so dark , Crimsoned with the blood of fellow man , Rise up in blazing characters of flame , And loudly cry for retribution ! Alphonso by this time is dragged out of the dungeon as the scene closes . END OF ACT I. ACT II .  --  SCENE I. An apartment in a Convent  --  A large gothic window in the rear , through which is a view of the sea . Enter Prior Bertrand and First Monk , meeting . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand How fares it , holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monk Thank Heaven ! she 's better than at yester eve . The burning fever which inflamed her brain , And tortured her with agonizing pangs , Hath much decreased , and now there is a hope , With Heaven 's kind smile , she 'll soon recover ; Still is her mind plunged in the maniac 's gloom ; And like the surge that beats the craggy bluffs , And rages on the rocks that bind our shore , So doth her tortured thoughts , through troubled slumbers . Burst forth at times the tempest of her soul . Our gentle Sister Martha called this morn , And begg 'd I would attend her to the sufferer 's couch ; Then a full tedious hour I marked her ravings : Oft in her mutterings did she mention death , And cursed the hour she e'er beheld the light ; Once she did speak of Don Bassario 's name , Called him her father , and implored That Heaven would but forgive the many wrongs Which she from her stern sire had oft endured . Oh ! it is a chilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblest gift , Which , mid the storms and buffetings of life , Must sink at last beneath its weight of woe ! PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Spoke of Bassario 's name ! Called him her father ! can it be ? If so , my dark conjectures are confirmed . The Duke Bassario had an only daughter , The fair Lucretia , whom thirty years since I linked in wedlock with the gay Don Carlos . The dreadful incidents which did attend The fatal marriage of this devoted pair , I will e'en now relate , should you incline To hear a tale of wo ! FIRST MONK . First Monk Most willingly . Do thou proceed , And I will hearken with profound attention . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand An hereditary feud had long subsisted Between Bassario and the Carlos house . Bassario had designed his only daughter , The fair Lucretia , soon should wed The brave Antonio , famed in martial arms ; But being call 'd to join in foreign wars , It did a while prevent his dreaded purpose . Lucretia loved not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gentle soul Were won by him who was of worthier note . Don Carlos , blooming in the prime of youth , Was then the object of her tenderest love  --  Nor was her love in vain ; for , from the hour That he had first beheld this lovely maid , The tenderest passion had inflamed his soul . Dost thou hear ? FIRST MONK . First Monk I am all attention ; pray proceed . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand This amorous youth , by strange disguise , Had gained free access to her father 's house , And well improved the golden opportunity Of Bassario 's absence at the wars ; Soon did he gain Lucretia 's free consent To lead her captive to Hymeneal bower ; The marriage rites , unknown to all the world , By me were solemnized . FIRST MONK . First Monk Did dark results prove fatal to this union ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand They did ; For soon these halcyon moments fled forever , And doom 'd this happy pair to lasting wo . But one short moon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ray th ' Hymeneal bow'r , When , by the machinations of his secret foes , Don Carlos was destined in chains to breathe The sick'ning vapors of a loathsome dungeon ! Soon was he dragg 'd from thence , and charged Before the king of treason ' gainst the state ; By false accusers was he e'en condemn 'd , And sentenced to immediate death ! Nor friends nor kindred of high renown , With all their power , could save his life . In vain did they implore for mercy on his youth , Recounting o'er the many warlike deeds Which oft were wrought by his departed sire . Indignant , the monarch to their prayer replied , No pow'r on earth , nor aught with it combined , Should change his last determined resolution . FIRST MONK . First Monk How bore the fair Lucretia her sad fate ? Strove she in vain to shield her injured lord ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand She little knew the fate of him she loved , And vainly sought in tears her injured lord . ' T was now her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorious war , Who now demanded his fair daughter 's will To instant marriage with Don Antonio . Trembling , she sunk at her stern sire 's command , Breathed forth the tender secret of her soul , And owned Don Carlos as her wedded lord . FIRST MONK . First Monk What did Bassario ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand In rage Bassario drew his sword , And would have pierced his daughter to the heart , Had not Alonzo , her noble brother , Seized his sire 's arm , Who had forgot , by Heaven she was ordained To choose the partner of her bridal bow'r ! FIRST MONK . First Monk What was her fate ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Lucretia was to a foreign shore conveyed , And there delivered of a lovely boy ; But this dear charm , that sweetened all her woes , And soothed each torturing pang that rent her soul , Was torn from her throbbing bosom To meet her relentless sire 's dark design . In course of time by him she was compelled To be the wedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd heard the dreadful doom Of him who won her first and only love . And now , good brother , I will depart And closely question this fair stranger . Should she but prove the same of whom I 've spoke , Some dreadful secret draws her to these shores ! FIRST MONK . First Monk Stay , brother , stay  --  it were unwisely done To wake the sufferer from her present slumber ,  --  For in the soothing balm of gentle sleep Rests there alone the surest hope of cure ; So defer thy visit till some hours hence ! PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand ' T is well . Thy prudence merits richest praise , And would befit one of far older years ; Not until eve will I attend her couch , And question her whom sorrow marks its own ; And now we will prepare for morning vespers , And spend the coming hour in sweet devotion . Exeunt . SCENE II . An exterior view of the Corsair 's fortress by the earliest down , on the left  --  in front the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sentinels are seen walking to and fro on the ramparts  --  A small boat is seen lying at the shore  --  One of the gates of the fortress opens , and Alberti , two sailors and First and Second sentinel enter from within . ALBERTI . Alberti It is the captai 's orders That I instantly repair on board , And make immediate preparation To sail by to-morrow 's dawn For the coast of Barbary . Comrades , we have no time to lose . The two sailors get into the boat and take the oars  --  Alberti seats himself in the stern as the boat shoves off for the ship . FIRST SENTINEL . First Sentinel I say , comrade , Strange visions have flitted in the air to-night , And sounds portentous of some dreadful evil . Gaze on the eastern tow'r ; Dost thou behold that streaming pendant ? But a short time since As I did look thereon , I saw What never mortal man did see before : It plainly waved against the rapid wind Which loudly whistled o'er the lofty turrets . Methought it strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind should swiftly blow , And from south the banner straightway flow ! SECOND SENTINEL . Second Sentinel Speak no more ! My soul already is too full of horror ! For I have gazed upon such scenes to-night , Which , did I strive to unfold to thee , Would choke my utterance .  --  Mark me ! Dost thou not know the western bastion Which doth o'erlook the sea ? There , as I did patroll my usual round , And ruminated on the many perils Which did o'er land and sea encompass me , I heard beneath , as from the yawning grave , A hollow groan ; another and another followed , Which sounded doleful to my attentive ear . I started ! trembled ! looked , and naught could see ! ' T was then I gazed upon the sea beneath , And saw , O horror ! rise before my sight ! A ghastly spectre , wrapt in winding sheets ! Dreadful he looked , while from his bosom flowed , In thick profusion , clodded streams of gore . He held both arms extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophetic , cried , Gonzalvo ! Gonzalvo ! Gonzalvo ! Lost ! Lost ! Lost ! Then with a shriek that pierced the neighboring rocks , He sank , and rose no more upon the wave . FIRST SENTINEL . First Sentinel Comrade , say no more . Another tale like that will drown my spirit , And turn what daring manhood I possess To woman 's weakness . Such wondrous scenes must truly augur Some dread calamity . Let us in , And tell our captain our strange vision ; Perchance he may avert the coming evil . SECOND SENTINEL . Second Sentinel And he may cut our throats for our pains , And call us credulous fools . Exeunt through gate , which they close after them as the scene changes . SCENE III . An apartment in the fortress . Enter Lampedo . LAMPEDO Lampedo solus . These eight-and-thirty years Have I graced my master 's service , But , alas , how wondrous things are changed From what they were at that long period back ! Then was he the pride and glory of his country : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then was he not beloved by all ? Now is he not despised by all ? No ! he 's not despised by me , For , though he 's full of faults , I must confess , Still do I love him in the midst of all ; And I 'll e'er adhere to him as closely As I would to the richest wine That e'er did sparkle on the banquet board Of the greatest king in Christendom . Rolando is heard singing without . Ah , hither comes Rolando ; A man , though gay in speech , Yet deep in sentiment . ( Rolando Rolando without , sings . ) And when I took a wife She was the plague of my life , To my riti fol de riddle I do . ( Entering . ) But soon she did die , And it caused not a sigh , To my riti fol , &c.; ( Turning round , he observes Lampedo ; they both laugh . ) LAMPEDO . Lampedo So you had a wife , had you ! eh ? Ha , ha , ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rolando Ha , ha , ha  --  bless thy good old soul , I never had a wife in all my life , And what 's the best , I hope I never shall ; ' T is only in my song , man , ' t is only in my song ; And now pray , good Lampedo , Why art thou not Engaged in all those heavy duties Which necessarily demand your supervision ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo A pretty question , truly , To ask one old enough to be thy granddad . And why art thou not at the landing , pray ? Dost thou not know thy presence there most needful ? ROLANDO . Rolando Ay , truly do I ; ' t is as I conjectured : Went to the landing , and quoth they , " Why art thou not assisting Lampedo In his official duties ? " Came to Lampedo , and quoth he , " Why art thou not at the landing ? " Thus have I found myself to be One of those consequential personages That 's wanted everywhere And needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master approaching ; And with him , as I live ! a lovely woman . Come along with me , Rolando ; We 'll take some wine before we part . ROLANDO . Rolando With all my heart , good , kind Lampedo . Exeunt . Enter Gonzalvo and Imogene . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Here is thy apartment ; here thou must remain Till my return from the Barbary coast . Until that time , I 'll patiently await Thy final determination ; And in the mean time , calmly submit To all thy mute displeasure . IMOGENE . Imogene Then hear now my firm resolve : Rather than submit to thy fiendish purpose  --  Rather than thus pollute my spotless soul , I 'll cast myself from these high battlements Into the ocean , which now laves their base . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Madam , there are dungeons in this fortress : Thy threat has haply placed me on my guard . Thou shalt be immured in one of them , Which , doubtless , too , thy exalted pride will humble , And make thee a more willing instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thou wearest by thy side a sword ; Plunge it into this bosom . Act bravely , nobly  --  destroy my life  --  But do not rob me of my innocence ! GONZALVO . Gonzalvo ' T is in vain ! you have heard my final decree ; And as you have thus fiercely derided My proffered love , Know , supercilious woman ! That , if thou dost not freely consent To what I have proposed , Force shall be resorted to , And direst infamy thy doom ! IMOGENE . Imogene Presumptuous man ! how canst thou dare To trample thus on unprotected woman ? And thinkest thou by thy awful threat'nings , To intimidate a true Castilian dame ? Fool , as thou art ! I have a means of speedy death , In which thou canst not thwart me . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Aside . Well ! be it so ; have it as she will  --  He who would aim to gain a woman 's love , Must minister to her peculiar nature ; Not cross her in her thoughts and purposes , And stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle rivulet , Swoln by late rains from the adjacent hills , We sit upon its bank , and calmly wait Till it exhausts itself . Aloud . Madam , I have changed my purpose . Thou shalt occupy these apartments , And all due and courtly attention Shall be freely rendered in my absence . Thou dost appear weary and exhausted ; Repair to yonder chamber , Where thou wilt find everything prepared For thy reception . IMOGENE . Imogene Dost thou promise Not to intrude upon my privacy ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo I do most willingly ; Your seclusion shall be for a time Most sacred . Exit Imogene . GONZALVO Gonzalvo solus . What a wondrous thing is woman ! Like a complex piece of mechanism , There are springs within her bosom which , when touched , Send forth the most sweet and dulcet sounds ! And there are others of an opposing nature , Which , when handled by the unskilful artist , Strike upon the ear in wildest discord ! Well , I have gained a glorious prize to-day ; Hope leads me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ACT II . ACT III .  --  SCENE I. The curtain slowly rises to soft music , and discovers a view of the sea  --  To the left a ship lies at anchor in the offing , and in the distance on the opposite shore , is a view of a Convent , whose bell is heard tolling at intervals . Enter Alberti and Roderigo . RODERIGO . Roderigo Hark ! the distant peal ! From whence that sound ? ALBERTI . Alberti ' T is you Convent bell , that tolls The hour of vespers , Whose holy inmates , morning , noon and eve , In solemn reverence render up Their fervent orisons before The sacred shrine . Thus do their fleeting days In peace roll on , While each with each together joined , Hold sweet communion with their God . But , Roderigo , what 's the word From the fair shores of Arragon ? RODERIGO . Roderigo The like no mortal yet hath ever told . Oh ! that I could clutch him with an iron grasp , And plunge a dagger to his ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenged , And I , alas ! ALBERTI . Alberti What dreadful secret talk'st thou of ? Speak , Roderigo !  --  speak , I charge thee ! RODERIGO . Roderigo Dost thou behold you noble bark That bends her bosom proudly to the wave ? She did contain an object , who to me Is dearer than the costliest gems That e'er did sparkle on a royal diadem . Her transcendent beauty far outshines You burning orb , whose radiant beams Now tinge with gold the Eastern sky ! Oh , Imogene , my lovely bride , Thy tender smiles once crown 'd my happiness , And all was joy to me . But now ! now ! distracting thought ! Thou art within a tiger 's fangs ! ALBERTI . Alberti Good heavens ! what sayest thou ? Thou didst make mention of Imogene 's name ! What dreadful thought has flash 'd across my brain , And whispers untold horrors to my soul ? It can not be ! Speak , I pray thee ! What of Imogene ? RODERIGO Roderigo pointing to the ship . That she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dreadful thought 's confirmed !  --  And she , alas ! must prematurely sink , Another victim to the inhuman fiend . RODERIGO . Roderigo Never , so long as this arm wields a dagger ! Sooner shall the gentle stream of life Ebb from her lovely bosom , Than she should fall a sacrifice To such a monster ! ALBERTI . Alberti Better to sheathe thy dagger in the tyrant 's breast , And free the world of this detested outlaw ! RODERIGO . Roderigo Thou sayest well . Now know , Alberti , Thrice have I aimed it at his merciless heart , And thrice Rolando 's friendship cross 'd my purpose : But now , by Heaven I swear , When next I raise this arm against his life , No mortal pow'r shall halt my great intent ; But soon the glorious purpose , for the which We did enlist beneath this Pirate 's banner , Shall be accomplished , And the brave Alphonso restored to liberty . I learn by to-morrow 's earliest dawn He has ordered him to an ignominious death From yonder ramparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RODERIGO . Roderigo ' T is even so . Therefore , to-night We must strike the fatal blow , Even though Antonio should not arrive , And save , if possible , thy aged sire From a cruel and ignominious death . ' T is prudent now that we should hence depart , For should they know of this our conference , They would suspect us of some false design Which might forever blast all hope ; So let 's away . ALBERTI . Alberti Stay , Roderigo , stay , I pray thee , And e'er we do depart , I would entreat Thou wilt unfold to me the dreadful tale By which my unhappy sister fell Into the Pirate 's power . I do entreat it of thee , Roderigo . RODERIGO . Roderigo To gratify thy wish , a moment I 'll remain , And reveal to thee a tale of horror That will rend thy soul with agony . So listen to the fatal secret Which I would fain , as yet , have not made known . Fortune had deck 'd us with her golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap  --  When we had left Palermo 's fair port , Were bending swiftly on our homeward way , A Spanish vessel from the Italian shore Did cross our course . Thou knowest well the mortal hate That Gonsalvo hath borne so long his countrymen , And he now reveled in the cruel thought Of imbruing his hands in their innocent blood . Eager on this intent , He bore upon the Spanish bark , And soon o'ertook her in her tardy way . But the Spaniard was no easy conquest ; Desperate and bloody did she make defence , Until , o'ercome by overwhelming power , She bent at last beneath the merciless foe , Gonzalvo , frantic with rage and fury At this her brave and long resistance , Sprang upon her deck , and ordered all to slaughter ; And death triumphant reigned Amid the hapless crew . O , Alberti ! had I but been Among the foremost of that bloody band That followed their inhuman leader , I might have saved , alas !  --  Much distressed . ALBERTI . Alberti Speak out , I charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERIGO . Roderigo Hoping I might , e'en by entreaty , Save some ill-fated wretch , I boarded the bark with this intent . The first piteous object which struck my sight Was an aged man , stretch 'd upon the deck , Whose silver locks would from a fiend of hell Command due pity and respect . The gory stream flowed swiftly from his bosom , While the inhuman Gonzalvo , With bloody poniard rais 'd on high , Waved it triumphant o'er his helpless victim . I gazed upon the bleeding corse , And gazed again . Mighty powers ! Alberti , ' t was thy uncle ! Gasping in the relentless fangs of death ! ALBERTI . Alberti Oh ! horror ! horror ! horror ! Much distressed . RODERIGO . Roderigo ' T was then I drew this faithful steel To sheathe it in the murderer 's heart , Had not Rolando seiz 'd my arm , And earnestly begg 'd me to forbear .

I rushed to the spot from whence it came , And then beheld , to my astonished view , A helpless female dragg 'd upon the deck By four relentless ruffians . Each held uplifted o'er his intended victim A dagger , which he was about to bury In her lovely bosom . But already had Gonzalvo , with lustful eye , Gazed upon her beauteous charms , And with a thundering accent , cried , forbear ! The ruffians murmured at the stern command , And with a sullen aspect sheathed their daggers . As yet I had not closely viewed the maid . Stretched and motionless she lay upon the deck , While many thought her spirit long since fled ; But I , suspecting of the cause , Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bent my steps towards where she lay , While a stripling youth , the page of Gonzalvo , Had gently raised her head upon his arms . I now bent low , withdrew the veil , And raised the cordial to her lips . ' T was then I gazed upon her lovely face : I faltered  --  trembled  --  Rolando seized the cup  --  She was my loved Imogene ; Her dreadful fate now flashed across my brain , And senseless I fell upon the gory deck . The report of a distant gun is heard . But hark ! the signal gun doth now denote The speedy landing of the outlaw 's band . More would I , e'en at this hour , have made known , But at more proper time and place I 'll whisper all my sorrows in thine ear . Exeunt . SCENE II . An apartment in the convent , with large Gothic windows in the rear , through which is a view of the sea . Enter Lucretia . Her countenance appears disordered , and expresses great mental suffering ; her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . LUCRETIA Lucretia solus . I 'll sleep no more  --  no more I 'll close these eyes ' Till death shall close them in eternal sleep . Felt I that sting ? It is the sting of death . Heard I that peal ? It summons to the grave . Oh ! that dream  --  that horrid dream Hath harrowed up my very soul ! Methought I saw him clutch his dagger thus , And swiftly hurl it to his father 's heart . I saw him fall  --  fall beneath his own son 's arm . ' T was then I snapped the hideous spectre 's bands , And headlong rushed  --  but all , all was in vain . He bleeds , my Carlos , my love , my husband  --  He dies ! he dies ! he dies !  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! Distracted , she falls senseless on the floor . At this moment enter Prior Bertrand and First Monk , with other Monks . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Protecting mercies ! how she raves ! This is , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies . To an attending Monk . Good brother , hasten with some restorative . Exit one of the Monks . Bertrand and First Monk raise her gently ; re-enter Monk with medicine , which they administer . Lucretia slowly recovers . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Oh , that dream  --  Gonzalvo ! BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand She proves indeed the same ; Didst thou not hear her name Gonzalvo ? Aside to First Monk . FIRST MONK . First Monk I marked it well  --  aside . LUCRETIA . Lucretia What would you ? Away from hence ! PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Her intellect is much disturbed ; Disappointment and suffering have overcome her powers , And reason for a time resigned its sway . Enter Sister Martha , who attends Lucretia , and supports her . LUCRETIA . Lucretia I 'll forth on the balcony . Come , my son ; The balmy air will cool my throbbing temples , And ' suage the fever that now burns my brain . Come , my son , to the balcony , Where the moonbeams light up the sculptured columns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son . The blue sea heaves ' neath the battlements , And the mermaids spring from the coral beds , To bear us o'er its bosom . Come , my son  --  come , come , come . She beckons as if calling to some one , as she , with the female attendant , exits off the stage . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Attend her , sister , and closely watch the poor sufferer ; Bear her back to her chamber ; And gentle rest , with soothing care , May soon effect a speedy restoration . Good brothers , we must now repair To the sea shore , where , amidst the rocks , We may find dead bodies , cast by furious waves Upon their stony breasts in last night 's storm ; And ' t is meet that those we shall discover Receive the rights of holy sepulture . Exeunt Prior Bertrand and Monks as the scene changes . SCENE III . A apartment in the fortress , in which Imogene Imogene is confined ;  --  she is discovered reclining on a couch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! cruel fate ! That wills me here to sigh ! Unhappy doom  --  A captive must I die ! Yet , gentle hope , Thy charm I still shall hail , And , with thy aid , Must o'er each woe prevail . Nor shall death 's sting Destroy thy gentle power ; But thou'lt my soul Enrapture in that hour ; And while on high My spirit wings its flight , I 'll bless the hour That sealed my happy plight . Inspiring Power , Then soothe each fear to rest , And quell the storm That rages in my breast ; And when life 's dark And fleeting scene is past , Then will I sing In heaven thy praise at last . IMOGENE solus . I can not sleep , surrounded as I am By all the gloomy terrors of this hour ; E'en music 's hallowed spell can not enchain My troubled spirit . And while I ruminate upon the doom , The dreadful doom that doth await me , My soul shrinks with horror and dismay : rises . But I am determined , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall this dagger fate cast in my reach , Sever in twain the trembling cord of life , And thus elude pollution 's deadly grasp ; Oh , Roderigo ! when my spirit wings Its gentle course to realms of heavenly bliss , E'en there I 'll fondly dream of all the joys That blessed with happiness our holy love ! Ah ! I hear approaching steps without  --  Perchance it is the pirate chief , who dares Intrude , to fright me with his hated presence ! A door in the apartment opens inside . It must be so !  --  support me , Heaven ! She sinks on the couch greatly agitated . Enter Roderigo Roderigo through door , left hand . Methought but now I heard the dulcet strains Of her sweet voice ; And as I gained yon ramparts , I heard a plaintive air , Which , by its sweet entrancing melody , More tuneful than the wild bird 's gayest notes , Warbling in forest green , I knew to be her own . Turning round , he discovers her on the couch . Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast As I behold that sweet angelic form , More lovely to these eyes than all the beauty That ever sparkled in a kingly palace ! More radiant in her loveliness and truth , To my enraptured vision , than the sun ! More priceless in her innocence and love Than all the dazzling treasures of an empire ! My Imogene , my own dear wife . IMOGENE . Imogene Heavens ! my Roderigo ! my husband ! Rushing into his arms . Look at me ; let me gaze upon thy face . I fear me ' t is a baseless phantom , a dream  --  recoiling . A foul illusion of my tortured brain . Look at me ! Art man ? art flesh and blood ? Or art thou but a fleeting spectre Come to mock me in my dreadful agony ? Oh ! no , no  --  thou art , indeed , My loved , my brave , my honored husband ! Rushing again into his arms . RODERIGO . Roderigo Yes , my dearest Imogene , Placed here by Heaven 's o'erruling Providence , To save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fortress soon shall tremble , Hurled from his giddy and exalted height , To meet the doom which vengeance doth decree . Fear not his threats and insults  --  For now I sought thee , love , That thou mightst know on what thou couldst depend ; For mark me , dearest  --  ere to-morrow 's dawn , This trusty blade shall reach his savage heart . ' T is late  --  retire to thy couch , my love ; Grant me and our good cause thy prayers , And let thy gentle slumbers be as calm As the mirrored surface of the unruffled ocean . IMOGENE . Imogene Oh ! I can not leave thee now , my lord , My life , my husband . Death now surrounds thee everywhere . Dost think that I could fling me on you couch , And slumber peacefully and calmly there , Whilst thou whom I so love , nay , do adore , Wert standing on a dreadful precipice , When danger and destruction gleamed around thee ? Oh , Roderigo ! thou dost not prize Thy wife 's undying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thus , my love . Full well I prize thy gentleness and truth ; But know , ' t would now be fatal to our cause For thee to leave this chamber . Guards are without , Watching with Argus eyes each passer by . Here thou must remain till midnight . At midnight , love , I will again be with thee . Till then , farewell ! and may protecting spirits Shield and guard thee . IMOGENE . Imogene At midnight , love , I shall expect thee . RODERIGO . Roderigo At midnight , love , I shall be with thee . He imprints a kiss upon her forehead , and with reluctance tears himself away from her and exits  --  she reclines on the couch as the scene changes . END OF ACT III . ACT IV .  --  SCENE I. An apartment in the convent  --  Large Gothic windows in flat , through which is a view of the sea  --  Lucretia discovered reclining on a couch . Enter Prior Bertrand . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand How fares it with thee , gentle lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  much better . Reason now dawns upon my tortured mind , And wakes me to a sense of all my woes . Oh ! had destiny but willed a gentler fate , Or doom 'd me to the tomb in early years , Then should I have ' scaped the many ills That rend my soul with agony and woe ! PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Good lady , banish these dreary thoughts , Nor let thy sorrows drive thee to despair . But look to Heaven ; there will you find A soothing balm for all your torturing woes . Oh , gentle lady ! too well I know The many ills which thou hast long endured . LUCRETIA Lucretia surprised . Too well thou knowest my many ills ? It can not be . What meanest thou , good friar ? Speak  --  speak , I pray thee , for methinks  --  She closely observes his features . And yet I know thee not . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand No , gentle lady , it seems not strange , The iron point of time hath wrought such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , That even thou shouldst not descry the same Who linked thee in the bonds of holy love , And thus became the bride of lost Don Carlos . LUCRETIA Lucretia surprised . What ! Bertrand  --  Bertrand , is it thee ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand It is , fair lady , even Bertrand 's self  --  He who now feels thy sorrows as his own . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Oh , generous man ! how can I thank thee ? Yes , it may be , that , with thy friendly aid , Don Carlos ' life shall yet be spared . Nay , start not , for Don Carlos lives  --  And lives the pirate-chief of yonder isle ! She points through one of the Gothic windows . Oh , Bertrand ! I have a tale to unfold , Which , when told , needs must strike thee dumb . Cold drops now thickly lower from my brow , While I yet ponder on the fearful theme . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Can it be that , in the outlawed chief Gonzalvo , Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the once proud , brave Don Carlos ? I pray thee to explain to me , good lady , This dreadful mystery . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Hearken , then , good Bertrand ; But I must briefly tell thee o'er my tale . Each moment now is dearer than my life . Perchance , within this fatal hour , he 'll sink Into the yawning gulf that lies before him . Thirteen short moons have shed their waning light Upon this convent 's dark and gloomy walls , Since the lone object of my tenderest care , My noble son , was joined in wedlock 's bands To the fair and favored daughter of the great Duke Alphonso , renowned throughout our land . But one short moon had winged its gentle course , To light with its mild ray the Hymeneal bower , When Alphonso , journeying to foreign shores , Was captured by the pirates of yon isle ; And by their chief was doom 'd for life to remain Closely confined within a gloomy dungeon . For , mark me , Alphonso ever proved The hated enemy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , roll 'd on , And naught was heard of brave Alphonso 's fate . All , with a darkened aspect , now confessed He must be swallowed in the briny wave . At length a captain from the band escaped , And revealed to Alphonso 's friends his doom . No sooner was the dreadful tale made known , Than my brave son , the more like his brave sire , Led forth his noble friends , and swore To restore the Duke , or perish in the attempt . With this intent , they all , in strange disguise , Set out to execute their daring purpose . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Alas ! it must prove fatal to them all . The pirate is encompassed by a band Numerous and brave . Armed to the teeth , both fierce and sanguinary , It were a mighty power that could contend And triumph over his disciplined hosts . Already does his blood-stained banner wave Defiance to the maritime of Spain ; While his pirate ships now prowl on every sea , And capture all that cross their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have other means at hand To aid them in their enterprise . The brave Antonio  --  whom , thou dost well know , I was constrained to wed by my departed sire  --  He , too , with thousands of his warlike troops , E'en now is ploughing on the stormy wave , To aid my son and his heroic band . But , oh ! Bertrand !  --  heart-rending thought !  --  Too little now my son doth know He aims a dagger at his own sire 's heart ! PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Alas ! fair lady , deeply I feel thy woes ; But be supported , ' midst thy dread forebodings , By Him who sways the whirlwind and the storm , By Him who guides man 's mysterious destiny , And from the blackest darkness brings the brightest sunshine . LUCRETIA . Lucretia I know it well , good father . His o'erruling Providence foresees our fate , But deigns not to direct our destiny . Now to conclude , I will relate The mode by which it was made known to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brave Don Carlos , once my own loved lord . While Antonio was making preparation Against the dreaded pirate and his band , Lawrenio , the aged steward of our house , Was tottering then upon the brink of death  --  Who now implored I would attend his couch To hear a wondrous tale he would make known . Quickly I hastened to the dying man  --  Who feebly breathed his secret in my ear , And thus declared the pirate chief My long-lost injured lord ! Aghast I stood ! nor could deny the truth  --  And yet I doubted as I conned it o'er . ' T was now Lawrenio tremblingly drew forth The many letters which my lord had sent , But which by me had never been received . He grasped the fatal papers thus  --  Declared ' t was by my sire 's command They were detained by him . He humbly begged forgiveness for the wrong , And died as he had lived , in agony of mind , Though deeply penitent . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Peace to his troubled spirit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd the writing ; ' t was Don Carlos ' hand . The dreadful truth now flashed upon my brain : I now beheld my loved and noble son Arrayed in arms against his father 's life ! The horrid thought then rent my soul in twain , And nearly froze the gentle stream of life . With madness mingled with despair , I from Lawrenio 's chamber rushed  --  Nor was a single moment to be lost To strain each nerve and save my husband 's life . With this intent , I secretly prepared A noble bark , manned by a hardy crew , And with fair wind we swiftly bent our course Towards these distant bleak and barren shores . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand But Heaven , by its o'erruling destiny , Decreed that all your noble crew should meet A watery grave upon our rock-bound shore . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Alas , too true ! For as we neared your iron-bounded coast , A dreadful tempest lower 'd its angry front , Mantling the ocean o'er with horrid gloom ! It burst  --  terrific was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck ! Loud roar 'd the angry thunder to the blaze ! The wind now whistled through the splitting sails , And as the raging gulf now foam 'd beneath , And swell 'd its fury to the howling blast , So did it quickly dash our tattered bark Upon the frothy breakers near the shore . A shriek now burst from every trembling lip  --  " All 's lost ! " re-echoed from the hopeless crew ! And as our cries of anguish pierced the storm , Mingling with the wild wailings of the blast , A mountain wave now roll 'd its awful front And swallow 'd all amid the weltering billows ! None of the ill-fated crew were saved , None save myself , whom destiny ordained To lengthen out my wretched hours of life , That I might warn Gonzalvo of his doom , And stop my son , who seeks his sire 's destruction . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand Yes , gentle lady , in that fatal storm , We witnessed your noble vessel 's wreck . No effort could we make to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach  --  Cast there on broken timbers from the ship ; And as we dragg 'd thee from the briny wave , The madd'ning surge did battle for its prey . We thought thee dead , but bore thee from the sea To give thy body decent burial . But soon we found the spark of life remained . Swiftly we carried thee within these walls , And soon restored thy cold inanimate form To a precarious and doubtful existence . Long we watched with care , thy couch , And now thank Heaven for thy restoration . And now , good lady , were it not well To seek the presence of the corsair chief ? ' Cross yonder channel , but three leagues in breadth , The pirate 's stronghold lies ,  --  While at the base of you tall tower , A strong and well-appointed boat is moored . Shall I , in that vessel on the instant , Bear thee in safety to yon Pirate Isle ? LUCRETIA . Lucretia O , generous Bertrand ! how I thank thee ! Yes , instantly we will depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch every nerve , Nor lose a moment to complete my purpose . Exeunt . SCENE II . A chamber in the Pirate 's fortress . Enter Gonzalvo and Lampedo . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Dost say , too , he visited her chamber ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo I do , signior . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo And conversed with her ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo And conversed with her , signior . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Alone , too ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo Alone , signior . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Pray , how gained he admittance ? Were there not guards without ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo He wears thy signet , signior . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Ha ! ' t is even so ; I do remember : But why should he betray his trust ? There 's something dark , mysterious in this man . I do remember on the vessel 's deck , In which this lordly maid was taken captive , That he did shrink when he beheld her , And senseless fell upon the gory deck . I did inquire of him this wondrous act , And doubt me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood . I do suspect me of this man . Brave he is most truly , For I have tried him in most bloody deeds ; And there is something in his gait and manner , That does bespeak the courtly gentleman . Him I shall closely watch , Ay , watch him with an Argus eye . If he prove traitor , this bright steel shall reach The warmest fountain of his recreant heart . For when the lion with its mate is couched Within the deep recesses of its den , And a bold formidable rival comes To rob him of the prize he holds so high , With horrid threatenings , and with eyes on fire , The dreadful passions of his nature rise ; Like lightning , forth he issues from his lair ; But the dastard foe that would destroy his bliss , Shrinks back appalled , and shuns the deadly strife . Shall I then calmly gaze , and coward-like , View the wide wreck of all my earthly hope , And not revenge me on the hated spoiler ? No ! by my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he dies ere rise of sun . Lampedo , to thy station . Observe most closely all that 's stirring , And mark the conduct of this Roderigo . Shouldst thou by word or deed mark aught in him That would involve my peace , I charge Bear it forthwith to me . Shouldst thou fail , Thy life shall be the forfeiture . Away ! Exit Lampedo . Gonzalvo Gonzalvo Solus . Shine forth , bright sun , and let thy burning rays Cheer the dull soul , and rob it of its gloom . Illume what 's dark in this terrestrial sphere , And shed throughout thy burning bright effulgence . Thou art the light which doth illume the worlds , Which in their orbits now revolve around thee . Thy beams , transmissible from sphere to sphere , Illume each revolving orb , And are reflected like our own bright moon  --  Changing thy dazzling bright and golden hues Into the soft and mellow silvery ray : But though thy light now shines with yellow radiance , Changing what 's dark into effulgent brightness  --  Though through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy thy genial sway !  --  Yet thou canst not within this troubled breast , Illume the horrid darkness that presides Within its deep recesses . All here is gloom ! Dark , dreadful , foul , impenetrable gloom ! No genial ray lights up this troubled soul . All here is blasted ! Wide-spread desolation reigns throughout The deep recesses of this burning heart ! Exit . Enter Roderigo and Rolando . ( Speaking entering . ) RODERIGO . Roderigo On thee , Rolando , it will devolve To secure the dungeon keys ; All else were fruitless did we not possess That talisman to our noble kinsman 's safety . Therefore on thee devolves this important trust . Go find Lampedo . Thou knowest how well he loves his wine : But he is guarded , cunning , full of craft , And might suspect thee ; therefore , use these powders , Each one of which , so potent is the drug , Will plunge him into deep and heavy slumber . Attached unto his girdle , you will find The dungeon keys . These once in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid arrive not , With all the prisoners armed on our side , We still may conquer in our dread extremity . To-night Gonzalvo gives a drunken revel , To which all are invited . Our friends will be there , but will not too far Enjoy the goblet 's deceitful pleasures , Save in appearance , to prevent suspicion ; And before the hour of midnight , Each will , with caution , silently repair To his appointed station . Then will commence The scene of bloody slaughter and revenge . Rolando , on thy firmness and valor Much depends , for shouldst thou fail , Alas ! farewell to hope and liberty ! I learn that by to-morrow 's earliest dawn , He has doomed his noble prisoner to death . Therefore , to-night , at midnight , we must strike The blow that gives him liberty and life . ROLANDO . Rolando Doubt not my prudent caution in this cause , Most noble Signior ; already have I gained Lampedo 's confidence . He is much devoted To his master 's interest , but I fear me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond , Together with this potent and narcotic drug , I shall possess myself most speedily Of what thou dost so much desire . To-night he has appointed me To wait upon him in his chamber , Having , he says , a wondrous tale to unfold , For he is a most garrulous old rascal . As usual , he will introduce his wine , Old , rich , and of a most delicious flavor , A portion of which I will early drug , And then with care possess me of the prize . RODERIGO . Roderigo Thanks ! Rolando , thanks ! At which time I will meet thee there , And proceed to the dungeons To unloose the prisoners . Rolando , on thee everything depends , And on thee solely I do now rely  --  For to-night , at midnight , we must strike the blow That sweeps this pirate horde to its destruction . Exeunt separately . SCENE III . The western shore of the island , with a front view of the sea by moonlight  --  Several ships of war are seen lying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish fleet , expresses the greatest joy . ALBERTI . Alberti This is , indeed , a glorious sight ! Such powerful aid as this will lead Our cause triumphant . Now we fear no danger ; all is well : The tyrant soon must fall , And injured innocence and virtue , So long outraged , Will be in full avenged . Ah ! hither comes the brave Antonio ; The daring prow of his gallant barge Cuts the proud ocean 's crystal wave . See how she ploughs the briny surge , And bears her precious burden to the shore ! At this moment a barge enters , out of which comes forward Don Antonio with his attendants . My noble friend , Antonio , I am rejoiced At this most opportune meeting ! ANTONIO . Antonio Noble Alberti ! I , indeed , rejoice ! Long have I desired to behold thee , To hear thee discuss thy perilous adventures , Of direful danger so replete and full  --  But more of that anon . I did not expect to meet thee here At this portentous hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thou shouldst be Within the corsair 's fortress , And near our noble kinsman , At this momentous crisis . ALBERTI . Alberti ' T is true ; but deeming it most fit , Roderigo directed me to bear to thee The important message ; And with all brief dispatch did hasten here , To disclose the purport of my errand . Will it please thee to direct thy attendants to retire ? ANTONIO . Antonio Fear not ; for in a cause like this , No traitor can be couched beneath my banner . ALBERTI . Alberti Then hear me , Don Antonio . As you well know , Gonzalvo has this day returned , Laden with richest spoil of his late conquests . Puff 'd in his pride , with arrogance he boasts Of all his deeds and perils on the wave ; While his ruffian crew , with their ill-gotten gain , Now plunge alike in riot an excess ; And thus will lay their strong and powerful hold An easy prey to your victorious arms . A hundred noble friends , within their walls , Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the midnight hour , When this pirate band , sunk in debauch , Will fall an easy conquest to the foe . Remember ! at the hour of twelve to-night , When you shall hear the fortress bell Loudly striking the midnight hour , Then , when the brave Alphonso shall be safe , Nor aught to fear from the relentless crew , Then strike the fatal blow by land and sea , And sweep this pirate horde to its destruction . ANTONIO . Antonio The plan is wisely laid . Instantly we 'll disembark the troops , And make due preparation for the storm ; Whilst thou , Alberti , hadst better now return , And thus prevent suspicions to arise , Which might prove fatal to the great design . ALBERTI . Alberti ' T is well , Antonio ; prudence guides your steps , And proves your wisdom and your noble zeal ; But ere I do depart , These papers , left within my charge for thee , Will give all information requisite Safely to conduct your march across the isle . He presents Antonio papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till then , farewell . ANTONIO . Antonio Fare thee well , noble Alberti ; I shall remember . Exit Alberti . Antonio and attendants re-enter the barge , and are seen shoving off from the shore . Music from the orchestra as the curtain falls . END OF ACT IV . ACT V.  --  SCENE I. An apartment in the fortress  --  Lampedo and Rolando discovered seated at the table drinking . ROLANDO . Rolando But why not now conclude thy tale , Lampedo , And tell me how thy master did escape ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo Hast thou not heard , Signior Rolando ? Then I will most briefly tell thee : But ere we do begin , we 'll drink Another bumper to my master 's health . What sayest thou ? ROLANDO . Rolando O ! with all my heart , Signior Lampedo ; In a full bumper we will drink his health . Pours wine into goblets . Wine ! Signior Lampedo , wine is the very nectar , The very essence of infinite good humor ! As we drink from the rosy goblet , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To our friends  --  prosperity and happiness ; To lovers  --  early matrimony ; To husbands  --  good wives ; and to wives good husbands ; To the mariner who sails on the treacherous deep  --  Fair winds and a prosperous voyage . Thus , in our cups , we drink good luck to all ! Hence , as I 've said before , Wine is the very essence of infinite good humor  --  With this exception  --  That sometimes , ' mid our revel , we do drink Death and destruction to our enemies ! Rolando and Lampedo drink . At this moment the fortress bell is heard slowly to strike eleven o'clock . ROLANDO . Rolando Aside . Only one hour till midnight ! So late ! I have no time to spare ! I must use The powerful narcotic that will plunge His faculties in deep oblivion 's slumber . He takes from his bosom some powders , and throws them into Lampedo 's glass unseen by him . LAMPEDO Lampedo who now appears to become gradually intoxicated . Here is to the glory of my noble master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  And a most wondrously witty gentleman ! Thou dost discuss with a most oily tongue Subjects from my understanding most remote ; And now , I do bethink me , thou shalt hear How the Duke Don Carlos did escape . ROLANDO . Rolando Thanks ! kind Lampedo ! in thy last recital Thou didst leave the noble duke in prison , And sentenced to an ignominious death . LAMPEDO . Lampedo True ! thou now shalt hear the ending Of this most wondrous tale : Well , as thou knowest , he had powerful friends  --  Who , when all failed to gain for him a pardon , Had recourse to stratagem , and bribed The keepers who possessed the Duke in charge . Privately they bore him then on board A noble ship they 'd previously prepared , And into which they had conveyed his treasure , With the choicest of his faithful servants . The duke now bent his course to distant lands ; But dark misfortune crossed him in his path : He had not been scarce twelve short hours at sea , Before a pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful force , Triumphant led him captive to this isle . Here he was for many years destined In chains and gloomy bondage to remain , Deserted by his country , friends and all ! He , in despair , besought the pirate chief To strike the chains from off his fettered limbs , And for to count him ever , from that hour , The most trusty , worthy and noble of his band ! ROLANDO . Rolando Most strange and wonderful ! But pray , proceed . You interest me much . LAMPEDO . Lampedo Nor did he seek in vain ; the Pirate chief Received him as a fellow of his crew . In course of time the outlaw 'd chieftain died  --  And as my noble master now by all Was thought the fittest of this hardy band To be their chief and leader on the wave , He was , forsooth , with one accord declared The ruler of this great and powerful band . And now , Rolando , we will drink Another bumper to my master 's health ! They pour out wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lampedo appears to labor under considerable drowsiness , which he endeavors to check as much as possible . ROLANDO . Rolando Aside . Ah ! the narcotic ! Well does it perform its duty ! LAMPEDO . Lampedo Signior Rolando , it seems most wondrous strange That thy master should visit my master ! ROLANDO . Rolando That thy master should visit my master , Thou dost mean to say ! LAMPEDO . Lampedo Not so ! Dost dare to contradict me , youth ?  --  That thy master so often visits my master . Thus am I pestered , hauling these huge keys Pulls some large keys from his girdle and throws them on the floor . That make my old bones ache again . More than twenty times I 've , through the day , Accompanied my master to the dungeons . ROLANDO . Rolando Aside . But now he said my master visited his master ! Now he doth reverse it , poor old dolt : The potent draught already hath assumed Its lethean sway , And soon will wrap his senses in oblivion 's slumber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lampedo ? LAMPEDO . Lampedo Ay , more than thirty times , forsooth ! Dost dare to doubt me , youth ? ROLANDO . Rolando O ! by no means , good , kind Lampedo ! Aside . What an old , rusty liar ! for only once Did he this day approach the dungeons . Thank Heaven ! the keys are safe ! Lampedo , during this dialogue , endeavors to check his excessive drowsiness , but fails at length in his efforts to do so . LAMPEDO . Lampedo Longer would I confer with thee , Ro-Ro-Ro-lando , But my brain is  --  heavy  --  and  --  ' t is  --  vain  --  I try  --  I must  --  I sleep ! Lampedo 's head falls senselessly on the table in deep slumber . ROLANDO . Rolando Rising , takes the lamp off the table , and closely examines Lampedo . His sleep is deep and truthful . No treachery is there  --  though he is assuredly A most wily villain ; but now he sleeps In deep and death-like slumber ! It is Death 's likeness ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ! man ! How helpless and unguarded in thy weakness ! How powerful in thy majesty and strength ! Soon , soon , Alphonso , shalt thou hail With joy the cheering dawn of freedom ! He cautiously takes up the keys . Enter Roderigo . RODERIGO Roderigo displaying great anxiety . Is all safe ? ROLANDO . Rolando Ay , all !  --  behold the keys ! RODERIGO . Roderigo Thank Heaven ! Instantly from hence Do thou to the dungeon swiftly repair , In which our noble Duke Alphonso is confined . Alberti with some friends will accompany thee  --  While I will to the troubled couch Of my beloved Imogene ! Should Heaven smile propitious on my effort , And bless me with my dearest darling 's safety , Thou mayst soon expect me  --  And I will be the first to sever the chains That have held so long in grievous bondage The father of my adored Imogene . Rolando , be thou resolute , Nor let our purpose lack due promptitude ; As yet we 've much to do . So away . Exit Rolando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pensive light Upon these lofty turrets ; upward she mounts , Soon to dispel the lingering gloom of night , Which now in silent grandeur reigns throughout , Upon the vast expanse of half creation : Soon will she light the western shades Of these gray towers , and by that light Perchance the crafty sentinel may spy , From these high battlements , the still 'd approach Of our brave warriors . Unfriendly moon , Why cross us thus in this portentous hour , Presaging destruction to our fondest hopes ? May some dark lowering cloud now intervene , And thus obscure thy bright and treacherous rays ! High Heaven ! now lend thy great and powerful arm To shield the cause of nature and of justice , That we may make these desperate recreants feel That many a noble Spanish heart now swells , Indignant for his bleeding country 's wrongs , While vengeance , burning with a fiery glow , Now aims its deadly venom at the foe . Exit . SCENE II . Discovers to the left an exterior view of Gonzalvo 's fortress : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship of Gonzalvo is seen lying at anchor  --  Sentinels are seen walking to and fro on the ramparts  --  A small boat is seen approaching the shore , and lands , out of which enter Prior Bertrand and Lucretia . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Good Bertrand , what 's the hour ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand ' T is past eleven , my lady . Didst thou not hear the fortress bell Within this moment loudly strike the hour ? LUCRETIA . Lucretia No , good Prior ! I heard it not ! For as we journeyed hither , across the stream , I saw , O Bertrand ! I saw a scene That wrapped my soul in revery and gloom ! And had the cannons of this fortress roar 'd Their awful thunder through the trembling breeze , I 'd heard them not : I would be deaf to all . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand What didst thou see , fair lady ? LUCRETIA . Lucretia Oh ! that sight has fired my soul with anguish ! And warns me of the dreadful storm that soon Will burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , good Bertrand , a large and powerful fleet Of many ships , that ploughed the briny wave . My sight was dimm 'd , yet through the lowering mist I plainly marked them in their swift approach . This I well know , none other can they be Than the brave Antonio , and his powerful force : But we must instantly repair within , And warn Gonzalvo from his awful doom ! E'en now , they closely view us from the ramparts . They approach one of the gates of the fortress  --  Prior Bertrand knocks . FIRST SENTINEL First Sentinel TO SECOND . Who knocks thus loudly at the outer gate ? SECOND SENTINEL . Second Sentinel One of the holy brothers , Who hither bent his course from yonder convent , Attended by a female stranger , who , perchance , Now seeks the pleasure of our festive board . FIRST SENTINEL . First Sentinel Admit them , e'en at this dead hour of night ; There is no danger from such holy guests , To ope our gates and give them free access ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ramparts ;  --  the gate opens , at which he is seen . SECOND SENTINEL . Second Sentinel What would you , strangers ? PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand We seek the instant presence of your chief . SECOND SENTINEL . Second Sentinel That can not be . To-night he is engaged Within the banquet hall with all his friends , And were I now to lead you in such garbs Before his presence , ' t would be instant death . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Fear not , good stranger ; I must to-night Unfold a dreadful secret to your chief  --  So instant lead us hence . Here is much gold Which richly will repay thy services . She takes from her neck a large gold chain and crucifix , and presents them to the sentinel , who eagerly accepts them . SECOND SENTINEL . Second Sentinel Ah ! well , good lady , I will lead thee hence  --  But there are many troubles to o'ercome Ere we shall gain my noble master 's presence . Characters exeunt through gate as the scene changes . SCENE III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side door is seen to open , through which enters Roderigo and Imogene . IMOGENE . Imogene Merciful heavens ! my father , didst thou say RODERIGO . Roderigo Even so , Imogene . Mark me ! Thy long lost father is confined Within the gloomy dungeons of this fortress . I am the instrument that fate decreed Should be the savior of thy injured sire , And doing so , preserve thy innocence . Shrink not , my love ; For Heaven will smile propitious on our cause  --  But see ! thy father approaches ; Mark his haggard mien and fettered limbs ! Behold his noble brow , Furrowed with corroding care and suffering ! Misfortune hath done its work , While the pestilential vapors of this dungeon Have impressed upon his manly image The distinctive impress of consuming time . Let us retire , and for a moment Mark him . They conceal themselves as Alphonso enters at the opposite side  --  at this moment the fortress bell strikes the hour of midnight  --  Alphonso attentively listens . ALPHONSO Alphonso solus . The deep-toned bell proclaims the midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivion . How longs the soul , When once ' t is plunged in hateful bondage , To rise in all its majesty and power , And soar untrammel 'd to th ' ethereal shores ! How slowly time drags on to him who groans Beneath the weight of captive 's chains . Each hour that flies , unminded by the free , Appears to him an age Of dark suspense and stern reality . What jar of dread contention now without ? The clashing sabre and the swelling trump Are sounds portentous of a dreadful strife ; They now approach within the dungeons . Thank Heaven ! for this may bring to me Death or glorious liberty ! Enter Rolando , bearing a torch-light , followed by Alberti and others  --  Roderigo and Imogene come forward  --  Alberti and Imogene rush into the arms of Alphonso , exclaiming , " My father ! " Alphonso Alphonso much surprised . My son ! my daughter ! Is this , indeed , reality ? or , rather , Is it not a delusive dream , The baseless phantom of a diseased mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , indeed , my children . I scarcely know you ; how came you here ? O ! mysterious Providence ! thy ways , Indeed , inscrutable appear to mortal vision . I ne'er did hope to clasp you thus again , To fold you in these arms , my lovely daughter ; And gaze upon that sweet angelic countenance , So truthful a similitude Of thy meek and gentle mother . Blessings on thee , my daughter ! Kissing her forehead . And may Heaven shield and protect thee From all impending danger ! But how came you here ? to Alberti . Explain all this . ALBERTI . Alberti My father , We bring thee that thou long hast sought , Liberty and life ! Curse on these chains ! Thus do I tear them from thee . Strikes off the chains from the arms of Alphonso . RODERIGO . Roderigo Soon will the alarm bell sound , And the forces of the fortress be in arms . No moment now is this For the sweet interchange of filial greeting . E'en now I hear the gathering storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So let us instantly depart from hence , Or all will be lost forever . Exeunt omnes precipitately through door  --  Alberti and Imogene supporting out Alphonso . SCENE IV . A splendid banqueting scene in the fortress  --  Discovers Gonzalvo on an elevated seat at the head of the table ; various others of his band seated round  --  They All sing the following song and chorus as the scene opens . SONG . Wine has the charm to banish every grief  --  So join , companions , join ; drink the health of our noble chief : Wine has its sway , wine has its power , To warm and cheer our sinking hearts when dark misfortunes lower . CHORUS . Then drink , boys , drink , and the sparkling goblet fill ; Drink , boys , drink , with a free and hearty will . Wine has the power , ' mid storm or mortal strife , To nerve the shrinking arm , and fill the soul with life ; Wine , too , imparts to woman a magic charm , And brighter gleams her gentle smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , boys , drink , and the sparkling goblet fill  --  Drink , boys , drink , with a free and hearty will . Enter Lampedo drunk  --  staggering . LAMPEDO . Lampedo Them 's hic my sentiments exactly ; Drink , boys , drink  --  drink wine hic with all my heart . Where is Ro-lan-do ?  --  where 's my keys ?  --  I say , where 's my keys ? Drink , boys , drink  --  Drink , with all my heart  --  singing . Where 's my keys ?  --  Drink , boys , drink hic . He falls into a seat . First Sentinel rushes in and addresses Gonzalvo . FIRST SENTINEL . First Sentinel My chief , we are betrayed ! Now by the moonlight , plainly we descry The adjacent hills , which blaze with warlike arms ; While a mighty fleet now rounds the western point , And swiftly sweeps its course along the shore . Nor is this all  --  for in our walls doth rage A dreadful plot of dark conspiracy , Headed by Roderigo , who now leads forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened all the dungeons , And have enroll 'd the prisoners in their ranks . They now with fury attack the guards , And bear down all before them . Gonzalvo and characters rise in great consternation . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo Treason , dost say , within our walls ? Sound loud the alarm bell ! To arms ! to arms ! my noble friends ! We 'll beat these daring traitors back . Onward to the dungeon yard ! Sound the alarm  --  to arms ! to arms ! Exeunt characters precipitately . Gonzalvo , while going out , suddenly stops . I feel a dreadful coldness here ; It strikes with icy power upon this heart . The circling current of my life seems stopped , And doth refuse to perform its functions . Strange and malignant visions flit before me . Spectres horrid and most ghastly taunt me . Can this be fear that has so seized upon me , And thus would shake within my lion heart ? Banish the thought ! Shall dark conspiracy prevail before me , And recreant traitors revel in these halls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose all I 've bartered every hope for ?  --  The golden mines which I have hoarded up , Superior to the wealth of all the Indies  --  The female beauties of such luscious loveliness As doth surpass the Sultan 's gorgeous harems  --  Shall I now lose these ? No . I will rise Superior to them all , and hold the prize . Exit . Enter from the opposite side Second Sentinel , followed by Lucretia and Prior Bertrand . PRIOR BERTRAND . Prior Bertrand I saw them swiftly hurry out from hence As we approached . What means all this ? LUCRETIA . Lucretia And see !  --  with torch-lights now they cross The outer porch ; so let us swiftly follow  --  Or all  --  all will be lost forever ! Exeunt precipitately . Flourish of trumpets without as the scene changes . SCENE V. A view of part of the dungeon yard  --  in front , a wall crosses the stage , in the centre of which is a gate  --  the alarm bell is ringing  --  clashing of swords without . Enter Roderigo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous train of followers , released prisoners , &c.,; all armed . RODERIGO . Roderigo The outlawed chief doth swiftly now approach , And leads a powerful party of his band ; Should they o'ertake us ere we reach our friends , Their numbers must o'erwhelm us . The roar of distant cannon is heard . Hark to the distant cannon of our friends ! Down with the gates , and quickly let us fly , And seek protection in Antonio 's ranks . Characters break down gate in centre , through which exit omnes precipitately . SCENE VI . An exterior view of the fortress , as in the 2d Scene of the 2d Act , by moonlight  --  The Spanish fleet is discovered lying at anchor  --  The piratical ship is discovered to be on fire  --  The battlements of the fortress are crowded with soldiers  --  The bell continues sounding the alarm , while a thick column of smoke is seen rising from the centre of the fortress , and discovers it to be in flames  --  One of the gates is burst open , through which enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and numerous followers , as before  --  At this time , Don Antonio enters , at the head of the Spanish troops , with music and banners  --  After taking their stations , Gonzalvo rushes in , with drawn scimitar , followed by a numerous train of armed Pirates  --  The Spanish troops place scaling ladders to the walls  --  Gonzalvo rushes with desperate fury on Roderigo .

General conflict between the Spaniards and Pirates  --  Imogene swoons , and is borne off by one of the attendants  --  The Spaniards put the Pirates to flight , and attack the fortress  --  At this moment , Lucretia , attended by Bertrand , is seen rushing , with hair disheveled , from the burning fortress , wildly crying . LUCRETIA . Lucretia Roderigo !  --  for your life , forbear ! ' T is thy father whom thou wouldst slay ! But it is too late  --  already Roderigo has plunged his sword in Gonzalvo 's breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest astonishment at beholding Lucretia . RODERIGO . Roderigo Almighty powers !  --  what can this mean ? My mother !  --  O , my mother ! Lucretia , who saw Gonzalvo fall beneath the sword of Roderigo , now bursts forth in all the agony of her soul on viewing the appalling spectacle before her , discovering in her countenance the workings of a distracted mind as she wildly gazes on the bleeding Gonzalvo . LUCRETIA . Lucretia ' T is he !  --  my husband !  --  my own Don Carlos ! Murdered !  --  murdered by thy own son 's arm ! She sinks by the side of Gonzalvo . GONZALVO . Gonzalvo That voice !  --  O mighty powers !  --  what destiny is this ? Is this the Corsair 's Doom ? It can not be ! Thou callest me Don Carlos !  --  art thou Lucretia  --  The daughter of the once renowned Bassario ? It can not be  --  and yet that voice ! those eyes ! Turn from me !  --  look on me not !

Roderigo Gracious Heavens !  --  he my father ? GONZALVO . Gonzalvo I feel the icy chill of death upon me ! My pulse has ceased to beat  --  my heart is cold ! Lucretia ! my beloved wife ! A dreadful destiny conspired against us To blast our love , and separate us forever ! Give me thy hand , my son !  --  I pardon thee ! My wife , let me die in thy arms  --  For I can die sweetly there ! Thou lovest me yet !  --  O , Lucretia ! To die by thee is happiness I never had hoped for ! Farewell , my wife !  --  my wife  --  Lucretia ! Dies . LUCRETIA Lucretia Distractedly falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes  --  this is the Corsair 's doom ! Slaughtered by his own son 's arm ! And died on the bosom of his long lost wife ! O ! while I gaze upon thy manly form , And ruminate the scenes of early youth , My soul recoils in anguish at thy doom , And seeks to wing its spirit with thine own ! Ha !  --  it shall be so !  --  no longer I 'll endure These torturing woes which Fate unkindly deals ! She hastily draws forth a dagger . But thus  --  thus Stabbing herself I sever in twain The trembling chord that bound me to existence ! She sinks by the side of Gonzalvo . Oh ! my beloved Carlos ! Farewell  --  my  --  son ! Dies . RODERIGO Roderigo much distressed . Oh ! my mother !  --  thou , too , dead ? Great nature ! now in justice claim thy tribute !

Like some bright sun in its meridian splendor , Illumes with light the many worlds around , And sheds its genial influence afar  --  At length is hurled from its glorious height To plunge creation in eternal gloom ! Character form in groups . The burning fortress is seen falling in ruins  --  Roderigo sinks on his knees by the side of Gonzalvo and Lucretia ; and the piratical ship , which has hitherto appeared in flames , now sinks beneath the wave as the curtain falls .
