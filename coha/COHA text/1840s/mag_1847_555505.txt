txt HARDLY nine years have passed since the publication of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella placed Mr. Prescott at once , by universal consent both in England and America , in the front rank of English historians . And what a golden account he has rendered of his labors during this brief period Taking up the theme of Spanish discovery and conquest nearly where he had left it in his first work , passing by an easy transition from the story of Columbus to that of Cort&amp; and the Pizarros , he has followed their track amid the virgin forests and gorgeous mountain scenery of the tropical regions of this continent , till he has reached the close of what may be called the heroic period of Spanish adventure in the settlement of America , and has left as little to be done by his successors as he had found accomplished by those who had preceded him in the enterprise . The subject of his last two histories , the conquest of Mexico and Peru , does not equal his earliest topic in splendor and variety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic incident . It has the absorbing interest of a chivalrous legend or an // Oriental tale , while it lacks the dignity and complexity of the vast subjects treated by Gibbon and Hume . The picturesque style of the old chroniclers is better adapted to it than the thoughtful manner and sharp analysis of the philosophical historian . It could not have fallen into better hands , therefore ; for Mr. Prescott 's temperament is more that of a poet than a philosopher . Seldom and unwillingly does he interrupt the clear and brilliant flow of the narrative , or the imposing trains of vivid description , to moralize or speculate upon the succession of events , or upon the characters of the personages who were concerned in them . He has skilfully preserved the romantic coloring which the old Spanish storytellers gave to the incidents and scenes they described , and which is the more glowing as many of them are led to speak of their personal adventures , or of what their own eyes had witnessed . In a critical sketch of one of the most remarkable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own features as a historian . " Garcilasso 's work is the reflection of the age in which he lived . It is addressed to the imagination , more than to sober reason . We are dazzled by the gorgeous spectacle it perpetually exhibits , and delighted by the variety of amusing details and animated gossip sprinkled over its pages . The story of the action is perpetually varied by discussions on topics illustrating its progress , so as to break up the monotony of the narrative , and afford an agreeable relief to the reader . This is true of the First Part of his great work . In the Second there was no longer room for such discussion . But he has supplied the place by garrulous reminiscences , personal anecdotes , incidental adventures , and a ' host of trivial details , - trivial in the eyes of the pedant , - which historians have been too willing to discard , as below the dignity of history . We have the actors in this great drama in their private dress , become acquainted with their personal habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , gather up those minutke which in the aggregate make up so much of life , and not less of character . " It is this confusion of the great and the little , thus artlessly blended together , that constitutes one of the charms of the old romantic chronicle , - not the less true that , in this respect , it approaches nearer to the usual tone of romance . It is in such writings that we may look to find the form and pressure of the age . The worm-eaten state.papers , official correspondence , public records , are all serviceable , indispensable , to history . // They are the framework on which it is to repose ; the skeleton of facts which gives it its strength and proportions . But they are as worthless as the dry bones of the skeleton , unless clothed with the beautiful form and garb of humanity , and instinct with the spirit of the age . - Our debt is large to the antiquarian who with conscientious precision lays broad and deep the foundations of historic truth ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dress of public life , - man in masquerade ; but our gratitude must surely not be withheld from those who , like Garcilasso de Ia Vega , and many a romancer of the Middle Ages , have held up the mirror - distorted though it may somewhat be - to the interior of life , reflecting every object , the great and the mean , the beautiful and the deformed , with their natural prominence and their vivacity of coloring , to the eye of the spectator . As a work of art , such a production may be thought to be below criticism . But , although it defy the rules of art in its composition , it does not necessarily violate the principles of taste ; for it conforms in its spirit to the spirit of the age in which it was written . And the critic , who coldly condemns it on the severe principles of art , will find a charm in its very simplicity , that will make him recur again and again to its pages , while more correct and classical compositions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 297 , 298 . While the taste and imagination of our author dwell fondly upon the graphic sketches of this old chronicler , he is by no means insensible to the severer claims which the refined culture and skeptical spirit of these later times make upon the diligence and judgment of the historian . He has labored even more assiduously to preserve fidelity and truthfulness in the accounts , than to deck them in an attractive garb , or to preserve the tone and spirit of the age and country to which they belong . The materials which he collected were even embarrassing from their variety and copiousness ; to select , compare , and reconcile authorities was the most difficult portion of his task , if we except , perhaps , the preliminary labor of hunting them up from the resting-places where most of them had slumbered for nearly three centuries . Many of the attendants and successors of the conquerors of Peru seem to have had an itch for collecting and writing ; but their bulky narratives and reports were preserved mostly in manuscript , and guarded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national archives . Slowly and reluctantly have the great doors of these prison-houses of information // been opened , the piles of dusty and worm-eaten papers examined , the half-defaced writing deciphered , and still more slowly has the printer 's art been allowed to rescue them from the manifold chances of mutilation and loss , and to render them accessible to the learned and curious in other countries . But little was done to make them known to the world till within the last thirty years ; during this period , 1*vIui'ioz , Navarrete , and other Spanish scholars , have accomplished much , and Mr. Prescott has richly profited by their labors . Obliged to rely in the main upon manuscript authorities obtained from Europe , our author 's researches in this way have been carried so far , and prosecuted with so generous an expenditure of time and money , as to leave very little to be *leaned by subsequent collectors . To the bibliographer and the antiquarian his lively accounts of the quantity and character of these materials , and his biographical and critical sketches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive portion of his work . By long practice and discipline , this labor of research and collation seems to have become as congenial to his taste as the comparatively easy task of composition . Continued study has rendered him so familiar with the peculiarities of the Spanish chroniclers , with the official reports and personal narratives of the agents in the conquest and settlement of central America , that he speaks of them with the fondness of friendship , and draws their characters with an evident bias of partiality , as if they were his intimate acquaintances . This predilection for his authorities , conceived by a writer of genial temperament and quick sympathies , has acted upon his style , and reproduced in it the vivacity and freshness of the contemporary observer and narrator . At the same time , his good taste has pruned their luxuriance and wordiness , and his sound judgment corrected the effects of their excited imaginations and almost unbounded credulity . He examines accounts with as much severity as if engaged in a legal investigation , while the results thus carefully arrived at are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation of an interested witness . Robertson is the only English historian of any note - in fact , the only writer in any language - who has preceded Prescott in the attempt to furnish a complete history , based upon the original authorities , of the conquest of Peru . A cheap compend , made to booksellers ' order , of that portion // of his history of America which relates to Peru was written for Constable 's Miscellany , some years ago , by a literary Spaniard who rejoiced in the sonorous name of Don Telesfaro de Trueba y Cosio . He was a mere hack writer , and his work has no attractions for one who has at command the volumes of the learned Scotch historiographer , from whom he borrowed all his materials . Robertson was a laborious and faithful , no less than an elegant historian . He wrote under great disadvantages , as the archives at Simancas were not open in his day , so that he was ignorant even of the existence of many valuable documents relating to his subject , and others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he spared no pains or cost for obtaining those which could be had , and he was patient and conscientious in the use of his collections . As he was writing the history of the whole continent , his account of the conquest *f Peru was necessarily brief , but it is able and trustworthy as far as it goes . Prescott 's history is far more complete and satisfactory , and , as we have implied , it presents all that we can ever hope to know respecting the civilization of the Incas , and their subjugation by the Spaniards ; but his narrative and statements seldom conflict with those of Robertson , and the impressions given by the two historians of the characters of the chief actors in the scenes described agree perfectly with each other . What the one left in outline the other has filled up and colored with splendor and artist-like effect ; but the drawings in the two cases entirely correspond . The cautious Scotchman is perhaps a little more skeptical as to the entire fidelity of some of the wonderful stories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Mr. Prescott obviously leans to greater confidence in their veracity . But the accounts , as given by the original authorities , are repeated by both writers , and the reader can form his own judgment respecting the credibility of them . Robertson shares to some extent the predilection of his countrymen for metaphysics , and everywhere shows himself a grave and thoughtful , if not a profound historian . He does not speculate widely or rashly , he does not indulge in the brilliant but delusive generalizations which have become so popular among the French , he has no comprehensive historical theories to defend ; but to his meditative mind history is no barren record of facts , but a vast repository of examples // enforcing moral lessons and illustrating general truths . Prescott is not so fond of reflection , and gives way more freely to the enthusiasm excited by wonderful adventures , striking exhibitions of character , and the novel and inagnificent scenery which formed the theatre of Spanish exploit in the New World . The reader 's intellect is left in the main to do its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons , varying according to the original temperament and bias of the spectator . He has greater vivacity of style than his predecessor , and at least equal correctness and elegance ; his narrative is more flowing and spirited , his descriptions more vivid and picturesque . He is not so much of a professed teacher , but a far more fascinating companion . Both excel in the clear arrangement of the matter , the skilful grouping of objects and incidents , and the distinct portraiture of character . Robertson 's style is more measured , elaborate , and ornate ; Prescott 's more varied , sprightly , and idiomatic , and at least equally pure . The English critic , made jealous and sharp-sighted by national pride , labors in vain to detect Scotticisms in the one , or Americanisms in the other . Hume is more careless than either , but his manner has secret and inimitable graces , which throw later historians into despair . Two of the chief authorities consulted by Mr. Prescott in his preliminary account of Peruvian civilization are Juan de Sarmiento and Polo de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were not in the possession of Robert* son , if indeed he was aware of their existence . The Relaciones of the latter , however , were in the bands of Herrera , who made free use of them in his history , on which Robertson placed great dependence , and thus profited by them at second hand . Both Sarmiento and Ondegardo have high claims to confidence , as they visited Peru during the lifetime of the Pizarros , travelled over the country , examined the works and institutions of the natives , collected their traditions , and presented their accounts in the form of official reports to the Spanish government . The former occupied a high post as President of the Council of the Indies , and his rank naturally adds weight to his testimony . Traditions of the early history of the Peruvians , of the origin of their arts and institutions , he seems to have derived from conversation with the Inca nobility ; and these he repeats , according to Mr. // Prescott , with candor and faithfulness , but also with bountiful credulity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferings of the natives after the conquest , and reprobated with great severity the inhuman and rapacious conduct of the Spaniards . In his account of what he saw and heard for himself , our author gives him full credit for veracity , and follows him with full confidence in his description of the antiquities of the country , and the manners , social institutions , and religion of the natives . Ondegardo was a Spanish jurist and magistrate , who had excellent opportunities for studying the laws and customs of the Peruvians , and was therefore consulted by the home government when further information was desired respecting the country and people that had been recently subjected to their rule . To a series of interrogatories addressed to him for this purpose he returned full and elaborate answers , which display a thorough knowledge of the condition , habits , and progress in civilization of the Incas . Mr. Prescott speaks with high respect of his sagacity and judgment , his freedom from superstition and credulity , the exact and business-like air of his reports , and his xvise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquerors . The administration of the finances was the subject to which he gave most attention , and on this point his minute statements are entitled to the highest consideration . The only other original authority of much note , whom our author has followed in his " Preliminary View , " is the Inca Garcilasso de la Vega , whose father was a Spanish captain under the Pizarros , and his mother a Peruvian princess , niece of Huayna Capac , and granddaughter of one of the most celebrated of the native sovereigns . We have already copied Mr. Prescott 's lively portraiture of his literary character . His great work , the Commentarios Reales , published during his lifetime , has long been the chief guide to those who were curious respecting the early history and antiquities of Peru , and Robertson was indebted to it for a most valuable portion of his materials . " Garcilasso 's mother was but ten years old at the time of her cousin Atahuallpa 's accession , or rather usurpation , as it is called by the party of Cuzco . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the chronicler , befell most of her kindred , and with her brother continued to reside in their ancient // capital after the Conquest . Their conversations naturally turned to the good old times of the Inca rule , which , colored by their fond regrets , may b3 presumed to have lost nothing as seen through the magnifying medium of the past . The young Garcilasso listened greedily to the stories which recounted the magnificence and prowess of his royal ancestors , and though he made no use of them at the time , they sunk deep into his memory , to be treasured up for a future occasion . When he prepared , after the lapse of many years , in his retirement at Cordova , to compose the history of his country , he wrote to his old companions and schoolfellows , of the Inca family , to obtain fuller information than he could get in Spain on various matters of historical interest . He had witnessed in his youth the ancient ceremonies and usages of his countrymen , understood the science of their quipus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance he now obtained from his Peruvian kindred , he acquired a familiarity with the history of the great Inca race , and of their national institutions , to an extent that no person could have possessed , unless educated in the midst of them , speaking the same language , and with the same Indian blood flowing in his veins . Garcilasso , in short , was the representative of the conquered race ; and we might expect to find the lights and shadows of the picture disposed under his pencil , so as to produce an effect very different from that which they had hitherto exhibited under the hands of the Conquerors . " - Vol. i. , p. 295 . Without carrying the list of original authorities any further , it is obvious that there is no lack of credible testimony at first hand respecting the condition and civilization , the arts and works , of the Peruvians , at the time when their country was first invaded by the Spaniards . Many independent witnesses confirm each other . Spanish grandiloquence and boastfulness may have colored the accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been exposed by internal discrepancies or conflicting external evidence . But this satisfactory character of the testimony must be strictly limited to the period of the Conquest . What was the previous condition of the natives , what was the antecedent history of their government , the origin of their civilization , what the causes of many peculiarities in their habits , laws , and religious and social institutions , are questions which it is impossible to answer with any precision or certainty . The only substitute for writing possessed by the natives was a very von . Lxv. - *o. 137. 32 // 374 Prescott 's Conquest of Peru . crude system of mnemonics , which was a help to the inemory of an individual , but almost useless as a vehicle to transmit thought from mind to mind ; it could not be called writing , therefore , except by an abuse of language . Rude , confused , and contradictory traditions were their only sources of knowledge respecting the past . Garcilasso and Sarmiento have collected and preserved many of these legends , but they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make darkness visible in the annals of Peru before the Spanish invasion . The history of the generation first discovered there by the Spaniards , and of their immediate predecessors , is all that can be known . It is mournful to be obliged to add , that the history ends as abruptly as it begins . In the subjugation of the country by the Pizarros terminates the history , not only of the empire and the civilization of the Peruvians , but of their distinct national existence . The race was not absolutely exterminated , but so feeble a remnant was left , and this reduced to a condition so servile and abject , that it ceased to be an object of notice for the historian . The mild , tranquil , and unwarlike character of the natives accounts for the rapid success of the Spaniards , and the consequent speedy extinction of every trace of the government and religion ' of the Incas . The whole framework of their institutions perished and disappeared , as a ship founders at sea , leaving no trace of its existence upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polity of the Peruvians seems to have been admirably adapted to their national character . Their government was a theocracy , an absolute but paternal despotism , that watched over them from the cradle to the grave , guiding every action , and regulating their conduct in all the relations of life . The reigning monarch was at once their sovereign and their deity , and resistance to his mandate was an act both of rebellion and sacrilege . Disohedience or revolt consequently was never thought of , and the royal authority , finding no opposition to conquer , and no limits to ovedeap , naturally subsided into a gentle and patriarchal exercise of its functions , giving the people no cause to murmur , though they had nothing to hope . Where there is no sphere for ambition , and no field for contest , there is no occasion to he cruel , deceitful , or unjust . The people had no room for progress , and therefore could not regard it as possible ; their station and employments were determined by // their birth , and they could neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune or rank . Domestic quiet was assured to them , and a certain subsistence for a fixed and moderate amount of labor ; the country and every thing contained in it belonged to the Inca , their temporal and spiritual sovereign , and to him they left the entire management of it , without suspecting that they had a right to any voice in the matter . He divided the land among them , and assigned to each his due proportion of its products , the division being renewed once a year , so as to accommodate the amount of possessions to the varying number in a family ; pauperism was not tolerated , and prodigality was impossible . The Inca was virtually high-priest as well as king , and the sacredness of his person , maintained by the awful sanctions of religion , was kept before the eyes of the people by his presence and action at the most solemn of the religious festivals . Yet he commonly delegated his sacerdotal functions to one of his brothers or nearest kindred , who officiated on all minor religious occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The claims of the monarch to divine authority were further displayed in the imposing and rigid ceremonial of the court , the humiJiating duties performed before him by the proudest of the nobility , and the consecration even of every article of his attire . The most noted and conspicuous article of the imperial insignia was the borla , a kind of crimson fringe that encircled his forehead , and a single thread of which given to the messenger or minister of his will , like the si*net-ring of an Oriental sovereign , was the voucher of his mission , and a token that enforced instant obedience . Garments and utensils once used by the Inca could not afterwards be devoted to meaner purposes , but were laid aside or destroyed ; and at his death , even the mansions that he had occupied were abandoned , his furniture and treasures were sealed up for ever against vulgar sight or touch , and the new sovereign provided for himself other palaces and new equipments of state . The highest order of nobility in the empire consisted entirely of members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Incas inherited a portion of their ancestors ' glory and authority . As the same dynasty had certainly continued for many generations , and each monarch had many wives and children , these nobles became very numer // ous , though their rank was transmitted only in the male line . They peopled the court of the prince , commanded his armies , and filled the highest offices in the state and among the priesthood . The chiefs of conquered nations and their descendants constituted another and inferior order of aristocracy . Their authority was usually local , confined to the administration of affairs among the vanquished tribes , and controlled by higher officers , who were chosen from the reigning family . The origin of so singular a form of government , of the universally admitted possession of divine authority by the sovereign , and the transmission of a portion of it to all his relatives and descendants , is a curious problem , but one wholly incapable of solution . The Incas were certainly a distinct race , speaking a language of their own , and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The engravings in Dr. Morton 's work show that the facial angle of the Inca skull is much larger than that of the Peruvian . Though their number had become considerable , from the causes already mentioned , still it was not so great , in comparison with the whole body of the inhabitants , as to make it probable that they were originally an invading tribe who had established themselves in the land by their victories . They appeared like a clan which had expanded in the course of not many generations from a single family . A conquering nation , not aided by the vast superiority in arts and arms which enabled the Europeans to make their rapid conquests , ought to bear a higher proportion to the number of the vanquished . If a whole tribe had thus overrun the country , it is not likely that they would have falsely claimed descent from a common progenitor , and arrogated to themselves an inheritance of divine power . We can not help thinking , then , that there was a nucleus of truth in the familiar tradition- which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair , who earned divine honors for themselves and their descendants by the priceless benefits of a higher civilization , of which they were the founders . Mr. Prescott says that this tradition is only one of several that were current among the Indians , and that it is improbable even when stripped of its supernatural accompaniments . It does not seem so incredible , however , as the only other one that he mentions , and it has the merit of explaining the otherwise mysterious fact , that the Jnca tribe were all related to each other , and were distinguished from the // body of the people by a higher physical and mental organization . We copy our author 's account of this legend . " According to the tradition most familiar to the European scholar , the time was , when the ancient races of the continent were all plunged in deplorable barbarism ; when they worshipped nearly every object in nature indiscriminately ; made war their pastime , and feasted on the flesh of their slaughtered captives . The Sun , the great luminary and parent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of his children , Manco Capac and Mama Oello Lluaco , to gather the natives into communities , and teach them the arts of civilized life . The celestial pair , brother and sister , husband and wife , advanced along the high plains in the neighbourhood of Lake Titicaca , to about the sixteenth degree south . They bore with them a golden wedge , and were directed to take up their residence on the spot where the sacred emblem should without effort sink into the ground . They proceeded accordingly but a short distance , as far as the valley of Cuzco , the spot indicated by the performance of the miracle , since there the wedge speedily sank into the earth and disappeared for ever . Here the children of the Sun established their residence , and soon entered upon their beneficent mission among the rude inhabitants of the country ; Manco Capac teaching the men the arts of agriculture , and Mama Oello initiating her own sex in the mysteries of weaving and spinning . The simple people lent a willing ear to the messengers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid the foundations of the city of Cuzco . The same wise and benevolent maxims , which regulated the conduct of the first Incas , descended to their successors , and under their mild sceptre a community gradually extended itself along the broad surface of the table-land , which asserted its superiority over the surrounding tribes . " - Vol. i. , pp. 8- 10 . Omit the incident of the wedge , and the parentage of the Sun , and there is nothing very improbable in this beautiful legend , though it only pushes the difficulty one step farther back , as the question remains , Whence came this extraordinary couple , and how did they obtain the knowledge which they imparted to the Peruvians ? The religion founded by Mauco Capac was certainly the purest form of belief and worship that existed among the several native tribes of this continent at the time when it was first visited by Europeans . The Peruvians believed in one Supreme Being , but they worshipped a crowd of inferior 32* // deities , among which were conspicuous the heavenly bodies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protector , or national god . The Moon was worshipped as his sister-wife , the stars as a part of her celestial train , and Venus , surnamed " the youth with the long and curling locks , " as the page , the morning and evening attendant , of the Sun . On the grand temple of the Sun at Cuzco the wealth of successive Incas had been lavished without stint , till it had become a treasure-house blazing with gold and silver and precious stones . The old Spanish chroniclers can not find words to express their admiration of its splendor , though before they saw it the hapless Atahuallpa had caused it to be spoiled of much of its wealth , in his attempt to ransom his life from the inexorable and faithless Pizarro . Other sacred edifices , some almost rivalling the magnificence of the metropolitan temple , were scattered over the provinces , and the ministrations in them performed by an army of priests . The Virgins of the Sun were a numerous class , doomed to perpetual celibacy and seclusion from the world , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occupied in weaving hangings for the sacred buildings and apparel for the Incas , and in tending the sacred flame , which was kindled but once a year , on the feast of Raymi . Each month had its appropriate festivals , but the four principal ones of the year marked the arrival of the Sun at the solstices and equinoxes . Sacrifices were then offered , and sometimes , though rarely , a child or a beautiful virgin was made a victim ; but the service was never polluted , as among the Mexicans , by a cannibal feast . Libations were poured out , and offerings made of animals , fruits , and flowers . The Inca , presiding at the royal table , distributed bread and fermented liquor to his nobles , and the entertainment ended with music and dancing . The deity and the mode of worship were alike appropriate for an agricultural people . As tillers of the ground , indeed , the Peruvians appear to great advantage , their success in this respect greatly surpassing that of the Mexicans and every other native tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , each one receiving his share , encouraged the practice of husbandry , and the laborer was further stimulated in his work by the example of all the great officers of state , and even of the Inca himself . Once a year , like the emperor of China , // the sovereign went out to the fields , attended by a great concourse of the nobles and common people , and with his own hands guided a golden plough through its furrow . Nor did his patronage of the farmer 's art stop here , but the resources of government were liberally applied to great public works for the improvement and irrigation of the soil . Vast canals and subterranean aqueducts conveyed water , in some cases to a distance of five hundred miles , to moisten ground that was seldom blessed by rain . In immense granaries the excess of one harvest was stored to make up for the possible deficiency of the next . Where nature had scarped the mountain-side , the natives cut the declivity into terraces , facing them with walls if the earth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formely a barren rock . They made skilful use of manure , and anticipated by three centuries the scientific agriculturists of Europe in availing themselves of the valuable properties of guano . As the immense slope of the Cordilleras afforded every variety of climate , they were able to raise various products each in its appropriate locality , and thus to turn the ground into a continuous garden , from the burning level of the ocean up to the limit of perpetual snow . Jmmense herds of llamas , a domesticated animal that united the useful qualities of the sheep and the camel , were pastured along the steeps of the Andes , and employed as beasts of burden , while their fleeces were spun and woven into garments . Wool was obtained , also , from two species of wild animals , which roamed over heights inaccessible to man . Other mechanic arts , besides spinning and weaving , were carried by the Peruvians to considerable perfection . Vases and ornaments of gold and silver , domestic utensils of clay and copper , polished stone mirrors and graven gems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were ignorant of the use of iron , though nature had stored vast quantities of it in their soil ; but they made chisels of stone , or more frequently of copper , which they bad the secret of hardening , according to Humboldt , by combining with it a little tin . They worked mines , not by sinking shafts to any great depth , but by opening horizontal veins near the surface , which afforded a considerable supply ; and they smelted the ore in furnaces , not having learned the use of quicksilver in forming amalgams . In architecture they // had made no great progress , though they erected buildings of vast size , simple and massive in construction , with little ornament . Stones were finely hewn for the walls , and nicely fitted to each other ; but they were unacquainted with the principle of the arch , they tied the timbers together instead of mortising them , light was admitted only by the doorways , and the roofs were simply covered with thatch . The great military roads are the most remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception and the amount of toil which they required , the pyramids of Egypt , and far more honorable to their makers , as answering a useful purpose , and contributing effectually to the progress of civilization . We borrow Mr. Prescott 's account of one of the two great thoroughfares of Peru . " One of these roads passed over the grand plateau , and the other along the lowlands on the borders of the ocean . The former was much the more difficult achievement , from the character of the country . It was conducted over pathless sierras buried in snow ; galleries were cut for leagues through the living rock ; rivers were crossed by means of bridges that swung suspended in the air ; precipices were scaled by stairways hewn out of the native bed ; ravines of hideous depth were filled up with solid masonry ; in short , all the difficulties that beset a wild and mountainous region , and which might appall the most courageous engineer of modern times , were encountered and successfully overcome . The length of the road , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred to two thousand miles ; and stone pillars , in the manner of European milestones , were erected at stated intervals of somewhat more than a league , all along the route . Its breadth scarcely exceeded twenty feet . It was built of heavy flags of freestone , and in some parts , at least , covered with a bituminous cement , which time has made harder than the stone itself . In some places , where the ravines had been filled up with masonry , the mountain torrents , wearing on it for ages , have gradually eaten a way through the base , and left the superincumbent mass - such is the cohesion of the materials - still spanning the valley like an arch ! " Over some of the boldest streams it was necessary to construct suspension bridges , as they are termed , made of the tough fibres of the maguey , or of the osier of the country , which has an extraordinary degree of tenacity and strength . These osiers were woven into cables of the thickness of a man 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were conducted // through rings or holes cut in immense buttresses of stone raised on the opposite banks of the river , and there secured to heavy pieces of timber . Several of these enormous cables , bound together , formed a bridge , which , covered with planks , well secured and defended by a railing of the same osier materials on the sides , afforded a safe passage for the traveller . The length of this aerial bridge , sometimes exceeding two hundred feet , caused it , confined , as it was , only at the extremities , to dip with an alarming inclination towards the centre , while the motion given to it by the passenger occasioned an oscillation still more frightful , as his eye wandered over the dark abyss of waters that foamed and tumbled many a fathom beneath . Yet these light and fragile fabrics were crossed without fear by the Peruvians , and are still retained by the Spaniards over those streams which , from the depth or rmpetuosity of the current , would seem impracticable for the usual modes of conveyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balsas - a kind of raft still much used by the natives - to which sails were attached , furnishing the only instance of this higher kind of navigation among the American Indians . " - Vol. i. , pp. 63- 65 . A general view of the condition of the Peruvians under their native sovereigns forms on the whole an agreeable picture for the philanthropist . There was little suffering and little crime among them ; the government , though despotic , was mild and paternal , th' people were satisfied with their lot , the arts were sufficiently advanced for the most essential purposes of domestic comfort , and intellectual cultivation was not neglected . Indolence was their easily besetting sin , for the want of property in the soil , the rigorous and minute supervision of the government , and the virtual institution of castes among them stifled every motive to exertion , and almost annihilated their free agency , the highest attribute of man . If Europeans had never come in contact with them , it is probable that their civilization would have remained nearly stationary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many points of character and situation , and like whom , also , they must soon have begun to suffer from the many evils caused by a redundancy of population . They were rescued from this fate , indeed , yet only by the occurrence of a more awful calamity , - the Spanish invasion , which demolished the entire fabric of their empire , almost with the suddenness of an earthquake , and nearly buried their whole nation in the ruins . A few survived only to test nature 's extreme power of enduring destitution and servitude . // The Spanish adventurer in America in the sixteenth century was a singular compound of the bigot , the pirate , and the knight-errant . He was fierce , rapacious , and cruel ; his conduct towards the natives was restrained by no sense of honor , no touch of compassion , no regard for the laws of God or man . A demon let loose from hell to wreak his spite and vengeance upon the sons of men could hardly have matched him in savageness , perfidy , and debauchery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rapacity and fanaticism . A thirst for gold can work wonders , but it certainly never accomplished a greater miracle than in throwing the vices of this monster somewhat into the shade by mingling with them some of the most attractive qualities of chivalry ; by imparting to him a reckless bravery , an invincible fortitude , and an untamable thirst for enterprise and distinction . The- religion he professed , a wicked perversion of the name and spirit of Christianity , was hardly more dignified , or at all less hateful , than most forms of paganism for it added the fervors of bigotry to the practice of crimes so monstrous , that the natural spirit and uninstructed conscience of man would have shrunk from them with loathing and horror . To say that he was sincere in his belief does not palliate the enormity of his offences against the law of justice and hu inanity , or give him any advantage over the untutored Indian whom he persecuted so remorselessly . And we have no confidence in the sincerity of his professions of zeal for the advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This motive alone would never have led him to encounter danger and hardship with so firm a mind , to brave the perils of the unexplored sea and wilderness with so much daring and constancy , as to throw into the shade all the achievements of the heroes of older time . It was the accursed thirst for gold , acting on an excitable temperament , a lawless will , and a fervid imagination , which sustained him in his almost superhuman exertions ; and in this point of view , of course , he sinks to a level with the swindler and the picaroon . The magnitude of the evil accomplished by him was unhappily in full proportion to the atrocity of his intentions and character . Never had crime a broader or more magnificent theatre on which to act than in the conquest and subsequent desolation of the happy kingdoms of Mexico and Peru , and the subjection of millions of a simple and inoffensive people // to the lust and wickedness of a few European adventurers . Seldom had robbery and murder been practised before on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , or in the invasion of the Northern hordes which avenged the cause of outraged humanity on the descendants and successors of those who had fought under C*sar and Agricola . The pitiable condition , down to the present day , of those portions of America which were ravaged and colonized by the followers of Cort*s and Pizarro , the frightful picture which their annals present of ceaseless anarchy and bloodshed , poverty , pestilence , and crime , seems but a fit though terrible retribution for the deeds of their ancestors . And under the iron heel of the invader they are even now expiating the long arrears of guilt . It seems hardly too fanciful to say , that the siege of Mexico by Cort6s has found its parallel and its punishment in the terrific bombardment of Vera Cruz . We have used strong language to characterize the proceedings of the Spanish conquerors , because it seems to us that Mr. Prescott 's imagination has been somewhat carried away by the romantic nature of their exploits , the grandeur of the scene on which they acted and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their expeditions through the wilderness and along the frightful passes of the Andes , and above all by their knightly appearance and language , their chivalrous daring , fortitude , and prodigality , so that he appears at times forgetful of the baseness of their motives and the moral atrocity of their acts . We donot say by any means that he labors to excuse or palliate them ; on the contrary , the moral tone of his work is elevated and pure , and when he stops to consider their conduct at all in its ethical aspect , he invariably stamps it with the reprobation it deserves . Still , he follows with so much enthusiasm the wonderful story of their achievements , and depicts in such glowing colors their noble bearing and prowess , that the general effect is like that of a record of knight-errantry ; his heart is stirred within him , as at the sound of a trumpet , by the recital of their deeds ; and the consequence is , that the reader is hurried along with him , and cheated into admiration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , which shows their character in its true light ; but it is not fraught with the full sternness of moral indignation , and the reader gladly escapes from it , and indulges in the pleasing delusion again . There // is some incongruity between the tone of the narrative , and the impartial moral estimate which follows it ; the brilliancy of the one leads us to disregard or forget the severe lesson taught by the other . It is the highest compliment to Mr. Prescott 's powers of narration and description to say that he has this power of enchaining the reader 's attention and judgment , and forcing him to look at persons and events from his own favorite point of view . But history is recreant to its highest duty , when it fails to gibbet the name and memory of the cruel and perfidious , though splendid , conqueror . It was too great an honor for Pizarro and his followers , that their deeds should have been commemorated with so much zeal and eloquence as have here been lavished upon them . Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peru , was an adventurer originally of the lowest stamp , baseborn and illiterate , hut of great energy , daring , and firmness , the very man to lead a marauding expedition through scenes of frightful peril and suffering to ultimate success . He was wily and unscrupulous , and showed as little fairness in his conduct towards his associates as in his treatment of the hapless Peruvians . He owed no favors to fortune , except that his lot was cast in a country and age which opened a broad field for enterprise and bravery , and made the attainment of the highest prizes in life possible to the humblest soldier . His father was a Spanish colonel , who had earned some renown in the wars , and , bringing to his home the licentious morals of the camp , had indulged his passions there in the lowest amours , and left his illegitimate offspring either to perish or to grow up as a foundling and an outcast . The founder of Rome had a more noble fostermother than the conqueror of Peru , who , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of swine . The story is not a probable one , and may have arisen from the fact that his earliest occupation was that of a swineherd . From this degrading employment he contrived to escape , and to join a band of adventurers , who were bent upon seeking their fortunes in the world beyond the waters , where riches and fame were said to await the boldest aspirant . In Hispaniola his courage and talents first attracted notice , and gained for him the favor of Ojeda , who made him his lieutenant in command ef the settlement he had established in Terra Firma . After the disastrous issue of this attempt at coloniza // tion , Pizarro became one of the followers of Balboa , and shared with this cavalier the glory of discovering the Pacific . He remained in the colony afterwards established on the Isthmus , and was often employed by its governor on military expeditions , which were more productive of hardship than of either glory or gold . Discontented with the meagre results of such enterprises , he looked with longing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the hope of finding a theatre there for achievements as splendid as those of Cort*s in Mexico . His own means were insufficient to fit out a voyage of discovery ; but he found associates who would listen to his schemes , and share the perils and cost of the undertaking . These were Diego de Alinagro , a soldier of fortune like himself , and Hernando de Luque , an ecclesiastic , who appears , however , to have been a mere agent in the application of funds intrusted to him by the wealthy Licentiate Espinosa . The expedition set on foot by these three persons was a mere private affair , coldly sanctioned by the governor , and having little more pretence of public utility than an ordinary voyage for the purposes of commerce . In a small vessel , with about one hundred men , Pizarro sailed from Panama in the autumn of 1524 , and steered to the south , keeping near the coast , on which he hoped to find indications of some El Dorado existing in the interior . Toilsome and perilous was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark was battered by the tempests , and their scanty stores being soon exhausted , they were threatened with the extremities of famine . The land appeared as unfriendly to them as the ocean , for thick forests and dismal morasses skirted the shore , and the natives whom they encountered were fierce and warlike , besides being so poor that a victory over them was nothing worth . At last , Pizarro was obliged to land at a place afterwards appropriately called the Port of Famine , and establish himself there with half his company , while the others went back in the vessel to the Isle of Pearls , to obtain a supply of ' food . Six weeks did the unhappy leader with his followers remain at this wretched spot , worn by hunger and exposure , and having but faint hopes that their comrades would ever return to their rescue . From the Indians in the vicinity Pizarro obtained a little grain , some few trinkets of gold , and the report that an opulent kingdom lay farther // south , the monarch of which was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had invaded his dominions . This was quite enough to encourage a sanguine man to persevere ; and when his vessel at length came back with provisions , though twenty of his followers had already perished , Pizarro went aboard with the remainder , and again sailed for the south . But the continuation of the voyage only added to the list of disasters . Having advanced but a few leagues along the coast , the Spaniards landed again to explore the interior , and discovered an Indian town of considerable size , which had been abandoned at their approach , so that they robbed the houses of some provision and a little gold without hindrance . But the fierce savages would not abandon their property without a struggle . Collecting a large party , they made a desperate onslaught upon the invaders , which was repelled with great difficulty , as Pizarro 's men on this voyage were not provided with firearms . Five of their number were killed , and many wounded , among whom was their leader . Disheartened by this loss , and their crazy bark being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Panamh , hoping that enough had been done to persuade the governor to fit out another expedition . They arrived safely , and were soon joined by Almagro , who , in a smaller vessel , had followed in Pizarro 's track , fought with the natives , and obtained more gold , without being lucky enough to meet his confederate on the voyage . They had added but little to the southern limit of Spanish discovery , their exploration of the coast having terminated at a point far to the north of the opulent kingdom of Peru . Instead of creeping timidly along the shore , if they had boldly stood out to sea , with the intention of making the land again only after they had passed the equator , the voyage would have produced far more brilliant results with less suffering and disaster . As it was , the adventurers had but a cold reception at Panamit , and only with great difficulty were they able to obtain men and funds for a second attempt . After much delay they succeeded in raising a still smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better supply of military stores and the two captains , now equal in command , sailed each in his own vessel for the southern land of promise , their priestly confederate still remaining at home to provide additional sup- // 387 plies . The story of this second and memorable expedition , which resulted in the discovery of Peru , is told by Mr. Prescott with great animation and distinctness . It was the most honorable portion of Pizarro 's career , for he encountered every kind of discouragement , hardship , and peril with unbroken firmness , and triumphed over them all , - shedding but little blood , for indeed he was too weak to be the aggressor , ever placing himself in the front rank of danger , adhering to his strong purpose with invincible fortitude when , out of his whole company , hut thirteen men could be found bold enough still to cling to his desperate fortunes , and pointing out at last to the enraptured eyes of his associates the fair shores of that rich country of which they had been so long in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusion of the precious metals which their most sanguine dreams had never equalled . Before attaining this consummation of their hopes , the vessels were obliged repeatedly to go back to Panamh for supplies , the heroic leader remaining each time on shore with a portion of his forces , as if to hold possession of every inch of ground which they had gained to the southward , exploring the unbroken forests and swamps , and enduring the extremities of fatigue , hunger , and suspense , till the welcome sails should again appear in the horizon . We borrow Mr. Prescott 's striking sketch of their situation when thus left to themselves in the wilderness . " On the departure of his vessels , Pizarro marched into the interior , in the hope of finding the pleasant champaign country which had been promised him by the natives . But at every step the forests seemed to grow denser and darker , and the trees towered to a height such as he had never seen , even in these fruitful regions , where Nature works on so gigantic a scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolling onward , as it were , by successive waves to join that colossal barrier of the Andes , whose frosty sides , far away above the clouds , spread out like a curtain of burnished silver , that seemed to connect the heavens with the earth . " On crossing these woody eminences , the forlorn adventurers would plunge into ravines of frightful depth , where the exhalations of a humid soil steamed up amidst the incense of sweetscented flowers , which shone through the deep glooms in every conceivable variety of color . Birds , especially of the parrot tribe , mocked this fantastic variety of nature with tints as brilliant as those of the vegetable world . Monkeys chattered in crowds // above their heads , and made grimaces like the fiendish spirits of these solitudes ; while hideous reptiles , engendered in the slimy depths of the pools , gathered round the footsteps of the wanderers . Here was seen the gigantic boa , coiling his unwieldy folds about the trees , so as hardly to be distinguished from their trunks , till he was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the borders of the streams , or , gliding under the waters , seized their incautious victim before he was aware of their approach . Many of the Spaniards perished miserably in this way , and others were waylaid by the natives , who kept a jealous eye on their movements , and availed themselves of every opportunity to take them at advantage . Fourteen of Pizarro 's men were cut off at once in a canoe which had stranded on the bank of a stream . " Famine came in addition to other troubles , and it was with difficulty that they found the means of sustaining life on the scanty fare of the forest , - occasionally the potato , as it grew with cultivation , or the wild cocoa-nut , or , on the shore , the salt and bitter fruit of the mangrove ; though the shore was less tolerable than the forest , from the swarms of mosquitos which compelled the wretched adventurers to bury their bodies up to their very faces in the sand . In this extremity of suffering , they thought only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - except with Pizarro and a few dauntless spirits - were exchanged for the one craving desire to return to Panam62 ' - Vol. s. , pp. 247-249 . Still more frightful were their sufferings on the little isles of Gallo and Gorgona , where Pizarro was left for a time with but thirteen followers , under circumstances that might well have caused the boldest to despair . Rescued at last by one small vessel with a scanty crew , instead of turning his prow northward , he boldly prosecuted his voyage over those unknown and perilous seas , and dropped anchor at last in a haven of the golden empire of the Incas . The place was Tumbez , lying at the bottom of a beautiful bay of the same name , protected in part by the island of Santa Clara . The following is a description of the town as it appeared to the Spaniards , or rather to two of their number , whom they sent ashore to obtain information . " On the day after their arrival , the Spanish captain sent one of his own men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a negro who had come in the vessel from Panama , together with a present for the curaca a Peruvian chief of some swine // and poultry , neither of which were indigenous to the New World . Towards evening his emissary returned with a fresh supply of fruits and vegetables , that the friendly people sent to the vessel . Molina had a wondrous tale to tell . On landing , he was surrounded by the natives , who expressed the greatest astonishment at his dress , his fair complexion , and his long beard . The women , especially , manifested great curiosity in respect to him , and Molina seemed to be entirely won by their charms and captivating manners . He probably intimated his satisfaction by his demeanour , since they urged him to stay among them , promising in that case to provide him with a beautiful wife . " Their surprise was equally great at the complexion of his sable companion . They could not believe it was natural , and tried to rub off the imaginary dye with their hands . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time his rows of ivory teeth , they were prodigiously delighted . The animals were no less above their comprehension ; and , when the cock crew , the simple people clapped their hands , and inquired what he was saying . Their intellects were so bewildered by sights so novel , that they seemed incapable of distinguishing between man and brute . " Molina was then escorted to the residence of the curaca , whom he found living in much state , with porters stationed at his doors , and with a quantity of gold and silver vessels , from which he was served . He was then taken to different parts of the Indian city , saw a fortress built of rough stone , and , though low , spreading over a large extent of ground . Near this was a temple ; and the Spaniard 's description of its decorations , blazing with gold and silver , seemed so extravagant , that Pizarro , distrusting his whole account , resolved to send a more discreet and trustworthy emissary on the following day . " The person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the first who intimated his intention to share the fortunes of his commander . He was sent on shore , dressed in complete mail as became a good knight , with his sword by his side , and his arquebuse on his shoulder . The Indians were even more dazzled by his appearance than by Molina 's , as the sun fell brightly on his polished armour , and glanced from his military weapons . They had heard much of the formidable arquebuse from their townsmen who had come in the vessel , and they besought Candia to let it speak to them . ' He accordingly set up a wooden board as a target , and , taking deliberate aim , fired off the musket . The flash of the powder and the startling report of the piece , as the board , struck by the 33* // ball , was shivered into splinters , filled the natives with dismay . Some fell on the ground , covering their faces with their hands , and others approached the cavalier with feelings of awe , which were gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his countenance . " They then showed him the same hospitable attentions which they had paid to Molina ; and his description of the marvels of the place , on his return , fell nothing short of his predecessor 's . The fortress , which was surrounded by a triple row of wall , was strongly garrisoned . The temple he described as literally tapestried with plates of gold and silver . Adjoining this struc. ture was a sort of convent appropriated to the Inca 's destined brides , who manifested great curiosity to see him . Whether this was gratified is not clear ; but Candia described the gardens of the convent , which he entered , as glowing with imitations of fruits and vegetables all in pure gold and silver ! He had seen a number of artisans at work , whose sole business seemed to be to furnish these gorgeous decorations for the religious houses . " The reports of the cavalier may have been somewhat overcolored . It was natural that men coming from the dreary wilderness , in which they had been buried the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tokens of civilization which met them on the Peruvian coast . But Tumbez was a favorite city of the Peruvian princes . It was the most important place on the northern borders of the empire , contiguous to the recent acquisition of Quito . " - Vol. i. , pp. 275- 279 . With his present insignificant force , Pizarro could not attempt to conquer the country , or even to establish a Spanish colony in it ; he therefore wisely avoided hostilities with the natives , and resolved to carry back to Panama the news of the discovery , in the hope that the brilliant tidings would enable him to get together an armament strong enough to annex the whole Peruvian empire to the dominions of the king of Spain . Accordingly , after he had explored the coast for some distance to the southward of Tumbez , and found still more striking proof of the opulence of the people , he left two or three of his companions among them to acquire a knowledge of their language , took on board an equal number of Peruvians to be instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been absent a year and a half . But the governor of that place still refused to aid the three associates in their great undertaking , alleging that the colony was not strong enough to invade so mighty // an empire . The confederates resolved , therefore , that Pizarro himself should proceed directly to Spain and lay the matter before the sovereign , as an enterprise so important might well demand the patronage of government . This scheme was carried into effect , and the fine person , insinuating address , and natural eloquence of Pizarro , notwithstanding the deficiencies of his education , made so favor*able an impression upon Charles , that ample authority was given him for the conquest of Peru , and he was appointed its Governor , Captain-General , and Adelantado , with fitting emoluments . These grants , it is true , cost the court nothing , and the adventurers were left to raise the necessary armament , and defray its cost , from their own resources . Pizarro showed his wily and perfidious character by the manner in which he treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain a post second in authority and importance only to his own ; but he secured for him merely the comparatively insignificant place of governor of the fortress of Tumbez . This breach of contract was the beginning of a dissension between them which afterwards produced bitter fruits for both . The bargain with the government being completed , Pizarro proceeded to his native province of lEstremadura , to beat up for volunteers in the expedition , as he had covenanted to raise two hundred and fifty men for this purpose . Among the first to join him were his three brothers , Hernando , Juan , and Gonzalo , the two latter illegitimate like himself , and a relative by the mother 's side , Francisco de Alc*intara . Hernando Pizarro was a true Spanish cavalier , haughty , jealous , and implacable in resentment , but of a noble presence , high courage , and fine abilities . His youngest brother , Gonzalo , was more frank and generous , expert in all martial exercises , daring even to temerity , but deficient in sagacity and prudence . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ; the remaining brother , Juan , as brave as either , more courteous , and less cruel , was prematurely cut off before the subjugation of Peru was completed . They formed a remarkable family , distinguished as much by their prowess and grand achievements , as by their unhappy end . The chief agents in a wicked invasion , and in the numberless miseries inflicted upon the hapless Peruvians , the crimes of three of them were expiated by a premature and bloody death . Francis , the greatest of them all , died by the hands // of his own rebellious countrymen , provoked by his murder of his ancient comrade , Almagro ; Gouzalo met the fate of a rebel under the sword of the executioner ; Juan , really the most fortunate , was killed by the Indians at the siege of Cuzco ; Hernando alone returned to his native land , but it was only to languish there for twenty years in a prison , and then to die in obscurity and neglect . The stern demands of natural justice were answered , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid fortunes , if these were to be achieved only by the commission of such dark crimes , and to be followed by so terrible a punishment . Leading back to Panamh a force somewhat smaller than he had agreed to furnish , Pizarro was met there by fresh difficulties . Almagro , incensed at his breach of faith , threatened to set on Coot a rival expedition , but gave up his resentment at last , induced by fresh promises made only to be broken . The colonists had suffered too much in the former voyages to be at all disposed to embark on a new one , though a few of the old troop consented to follow a leader so well approved for courage and conduct . Having at length collected one hundred and eighty men , tolerably well armed and equipped , with twenty-seven horses for the cavalry , Pizarro embarked them in three vessels , and in January , 1531 , sailed on his last expedition , leaving Almagro behind , as usual , to collect reinforcements . Considering the numbers of the Peruvians , and reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had attained , to invade their country with so small a force might well appear a desperate enterprise . But circumstances favored the invaders ; the empire of the Incas was now involved in a civil war , consequent on a disputed succession to the throne . The mild and unwarlike character of the people , also , of which the Spaniards had seen full evidence on the former visit to their coast , together with the recent splendid success of Cort*s in Mexico , greatly emboldened the assailants . The indolent and peaceable disposition of the Peruvians was fostered by their peculiar social institutions , which tended to make them quiet and happy subjects , but stifled all ambition , repressed the development of military ardor and skill , and rendered them nearly indifferent to a change of masters . Having no absolute ownership of the soil , which was divided anew among them at short intervals , and sure that their wants // would be provided for by the paternal care of the state , there was no encouragement for the accumulation of private wealth ; having little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were ready tamely to submit to the first invader . The existence of the Inca clan among them as a distinct race and a higher caste , constituting an order of nobility to which the common people could not rise , and monopolizing offices and dignities by an undisputed title , left no field for preferment , and chilled all energy and spirit among the multitude . The vast amount of gold and silver , which the Spaniards robbed them of , belonged for the most part not to individuals , but to the state and the church , which in fact were one , and they consequently saw it change hands with hardly a murmur ; and when the prestige of the Inca 's divine power was broken by his misfortunes , his captivity and death , the natives , now regarding the Spaniards as the superior race commissioned by Heaven to rule over them , would scarcely have objected to installing Pizarro in his place , and admitting his comrades to the dignity and privileges of their former nobility . They allowed their country to be overrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapacity , lust , and cruelty of the invaders at last goaded them into frantic rebellion , Pizarro might have triumphed without bloodshed , and almost without an effort . The empire of ' the Incas , vast , opulent , and imposing in appearance , was a frail house of cards , that toppled down in a moment under the slightest blow . Landing about one degree to the north of Tumbez , the Spaniards marched through the country towards that place , plundering and murdering as they went without provocation or excuse . The natives abandoned the city at their approach , and almost the only resistance they encountered was from the islanders of Pun*t , who were at war with the people on the mainland , and who had been provoked by the murder in cold blood of ten or twelve of their number by Pizarro . They were easily defeated with the loss of only three or four Spaniards , and a considerable reinforcement having now arrived from Panamh , the Spanish leader prepared to march into the interior , to get possession of Cuzco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , of the person of the Inca . He had resolved to play the same game there by which Cort*s had succeeded in Mexico , and by seizing the sovereign , and retaining him in confinement , to awe his subjects // into submission . The treasure of gold and silver already obtained was sent to Panamh to pay the debts incurred for the outfit , and to stimulate fresh troops of adventurers to join his standard . Having founded , about thirty leagues from Tumbez , a new city , called San Miguel , to be a place of refuge in case of disaster , he left fifty men as its garrison , and with two hundred others commenced his march towards CuzCo . Satisfied that lenity was now his true policy , he forbade all acts of violence , and maintained strict discipline on the route . The l ) lacable and timid natives immediately ceased their hostilities , welcomed the troops to their hamlets , and furnished them abundant supplies . The reigning Inca , the unfortunate Atahuallpa , was collecting a large force near Caxamalca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite the strangers to visit his camp , and to afford them a hospitable reception . His indecision was fatal to him , as it caused him to leave unguarded the passes of the Andes , which it was necessary for Pizarro to cross , and where the natural difficulties of the route , united with the Peruvian fortresses already erected on it , might have more than compensated the superiority in arms of the invaders . We copy in part our historian 's picturesque description of the passage of the Spaniards over the mountains . " At early dawn the Spanish general and his detachment were under arms , and prepared to breast the difficulties of the sierra . These proved even greater than had been foreseen . The path had been conducted in the most judicious manner round the rugged and precipitous sides of the mountains , so as best to avoid the natural impediments presented by the ground . But it was necessarily so steep , in many places , that the cavalry were obliged to dismount , and , scrambling up as they could , to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  too , where some huge crag or eminence overhung the road , this was driven to the very verge of the precipice ; and the traveller was compelled to wind along the narrow ledge of rock , scarcely wide enough for his single steed , where a misstep would precipitate him hundreds , nay , thousands , of feet into the dreadful abyss ! The wild pass . es of the sierra , practicable for the half-naked Indian , and even for the sure and circumspect mule , - an animal that seems to have been created for the roads of the Cordilleras , - were formidable to the man-at-arms encumbered with his panoply of mail . The tremendous fissures or quebradas , so frightful in this mountain chain , yawned open , as if the Andes had been split asunder // by some terrible convulsion , showing a broad expanse of the primitive rock on their sides , partially mantled over with the spontaneous vegetation of ages ; while their obscure depths furnished a channel for the torrents , that , rising in the heart of the sierra , worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savannas and green valleys of the tierra caliente on their way to the great ocean . " Many of these passes afforded obvious points of defence ; and the Spaniards , as they entered the rocky defiles , looked with apprehension lest they might rouse some foe from his ambush . This apprehension was heightened , as , at the summit of a steep and narrow gorge , in which they were engaged , they beheld a strong work , rising like a fortress , and frowning , as it were , in gloomy defiance on the invaders . As they drew near this building , which was of solid stone , cbmmanding an angle of the road , they almost expected to see the dusky forms of the warriors rise over the battlements , and to receive their tempest of missiles on their bucklers ; for it was in so strong a position , that a few resolute men might easily have held there an army at bay . But they had the satisfaction to find the place untenanted , and their spirits were greatly raised by the conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it would have been easy to do so with success . " Pizarro now sent orders to his brother to follow without delay ; and , after refreshing his men , continued his toilsome ascent , and before nightfall reached an eminence crowned by another fortress , of even greater strength than the preceding . It was built of solid masonry , the lower part excavated from the living rock , and the whole work executed with skill not inferior to that of the European architect . " Here Pizarro took up his quarters for the night . Without waiting for the arrival of the rear , on the following morning he resumed his march , leading still deeper into the intricate gorges of the sierra . The climate had gradually changed , and the men and horses , especially the latter , suffered severely from the cold , so long accustomed as they had been to the sultry climate of the tropics . The vegetation also had changed its character ; and the magnificent timber which covered the lower level of the country had gradually given way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose still higher , to the stunted growth of numberless Alpine plants , whose hardy natures found a congenial temperature in the icy atmosphere of the more elevated regions . These dreary solitudes seemed to be nearly abandoned by the brute creation as well as by man . The light-footed vicui*ia , roaming in its native state , might be sometimes seen looking down from some airy // cliff , where the foot of the hunter dared not venture . But instead of the feathered tribes whose gay plumage sparkled in the deep glooms of the tropical forests , the adventurers now beheld only the great bird of the Andes , the loathsome condor , who , sailing high above the clouds , followed with doleful cries in the track of the army , as if guided by instinct in the path of blood and carnage . " At length they reached the crest of the Cordillera , where it spreads out into a bold and bleak expanse , with scarce the vestige of vegetation , except what is afforded by the pajonal , a dried yellow grass , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the snow-covered peaks , looks , with its brilliant straw-color lighted up in the rays of an ardent sun , like a setting of gold round pinnacles of burnished silver . The land was sterile , as usual in mining districts , and they were drawing near the once famous gold quarries on the way to Caxamalca ; Rocks rich in gems , and mountains big with mines , That on the high equator ridgy rise . ' Here Pizarro halted for the coming up of the rear . The air was sharp and frosty ; and the soldiers , spreading their tents , lighted fires , and , huddling round them , endeavoured to find some repose after their laborious march . " - Vol. i. , pp. 381 - 385 . The little army descended without loss , and occupied Caxamalca , where Pizarro prepared to carry into effect his plan for kidnapping the Inca , who was encamped with his army at a little distance . The simple monarch at once fell into the snare by accepting the invitation to visit the Spaniards in their quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , most of them unarmed . Pizarro had concealed his troops in the deserted temples and other public buildings around the great square , where the Inca was received only by a Dominican friar , who made him a long speech , inviting him to become a convert to the Christian religion , and to submit his kingdom to the Emperor Charles the Fifth , who had received authority in a direct line from St. Peter to claim it as his inheritance . The native sovereign refused this modest request with some indignation . The scene which followed must be given in Mr. Prescott 's own words . " Pizarro saw that the hour had come . He waved a white scarf in the air , the appointed signal . The fatal gun was fired from the fortress . Then , springing into the square , the Spanish // captain and his followers shouted the old war-cry of St. Jago and at them . ' It was answered by the battle-cry of every Spaniard in the city , as , rushing from the avenues of the great halls in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and foot , each in his own dark column , and threw themselves into the midst of the Indian crowd . The latter , taken by surprise , stunned by the report of artillery and muskets , the echoes of which reverberated like thunder from the surrounding buildings , and blinded by the smoke which rolled in sulphurous volumes along the square , were seized with a panic . They knew not whither to fly for refuge from the coming ruin . Nobles and commoners , - all were trampled down under the fierce charge of the cavalry , who dealt their blows , right and left , without sparing ; while their swords , flashing through the thick gloom , carried dismay into the hearts of the wretched natives , who now , for the first time , saw the horse and his rider in all their terrors . They made no resistance , - as , indeed , they had no weapons with which to make it . Every avenue to escape was closed , for the entrance to the square was choked up with the dead bodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such was the agony of the survivors under the terrible pressure of their assailants , that a large body of Indians , by their convulsive struggles , burst through the wall of stone and dried clay which formed part of the boundary of the plaza ! It fell , leaving an opening of more than a hundred paces , through which multitudes now found their way into the country , still hotly pursued by the cavalry , who , leaping the fallen rubbish , hung on the rear of the fugitives , striking them down in all directions . " The Indian monarch , stunned and bewildered , saw his faithful subjects falling round him without fully comprehending his situation . The litter on which he rode heaved to and fro , as the mighty press swayed backwards and forwards ; and he gazed on the overwhelming ruin , like some forlorn mariner , who , tossed about in his bark by the furious elements , sees the lightning 's flash and hears the thunder bursting around him with the consciousness that he can do nothing to avert his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Spaniards , as the shades of evening grew deeper , felt afraid that the royal prize might , after all , elude them ; and some of the cnvaliers made a desperate attempt to end the affray at once by taking Atahuallpa 's life . But Pizarro , who was nearest his person , called out with Stentorian voice , Let no one , who values his life , strike at the Inca ' ; and , stretching out his arm to shield // him , received a wound on the hand from one of his own men , - the only wound received by a Spaniard in the action . " The struggle now became fiercer than ever round the royal litter . It reeled more and more , and at length , several of the nobles who supported it having been slain , it was overturned , and the Indian prince would have come with violence to the ground , had not his fall beea broken by the efforts of Pizarro and some other of the cavaliers , who caught him in their arms . The imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Estete , and the unhappy monarch , strongly secured , was removed to a neighbouring building , where he was carefully guarded . " All attempt at resistance now ceased . The fate of the Inca soon spread over town and country . The charm which might have held the Peruvians together was dissolved . Every man thought only of his own safety . Even the soldiery encamped on the adjacent fields took the alarm , and , learning the fatal tidings , were seen flying in every direction before their pursuers , who in the heat of triumph showed no touch of mercy . At length , night , more pitiful than man , threw her friendly mantle over the fugitives , and the scattered troops of Pizarro rallied once more at the sound of the trumpet in the bloody square of Caxamalca. " - Vol. i. , pp. 418 - 423 . Here , in fact , ends the story of the conquest of Peru . The hapless Inca was retained in confinement till his faithful subjects had.placed in the hands of the Spaniards an immense treasure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most solemn engagements , was remorselessly put to death . The spirit of the people was crushed , or rather the idea of resistance was not developed among them ; the power which had suddenly established itself in the midst of their land , had imprisoned their heaven-descended sovereign , held him to ransom , and finally butchered him without cause , seemed too axvful to contend with ; perhaps opposition would be impiety . Certain it is that the Spaniards made themselves masters of Cuzco , and subjected all Peru to their sway , with but a single skirmish of any importance ; and that was with a brave old chieftain , whom , as a punishment for his rebellion , Pizarro caused to be burned to death . Some time afterward , the outrages of which the conquerors were guilty stung the natives into revolt ; for a few months they held the capital in siege , killed Juan Pizarro with many of his comrades in fair fight , and but for the seasonable return of Almagro // with his force from Chili , the dominion of the Incas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been acknowledged throughout Peru . As it was , the coming of these veterans from the south turned the scale which till then had hung with an even beam ; and the terrible punishment which they inflicted on the revolters riveted the chains upon this unhappy people for ever . They sought refuge in the mountains and the desert , or became serfs to their conquerors ; and never was servitude more oppressive or more hopeless . 1'lr . Prescott 's second volume , quite equal in interest to his first , is nearly all occupied with a history of the wars of the Spaniards with each other , and of their several expeditions , most of them disastrous , for the exploration and conquest of the countries around Peru . The work ends with an account of the pacification of the country under the excellent President Gasca , after the Pizarros , the two Almagros , and many of their original comrades , were at rest in a prison or a bloody grave . The fate of the innocent Peruvians could not be averted , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes and wrongs did not escape what seems the immediate judgment of Heaven any more than the future execration of mankind . We do not anticipate for this work a popularity quite so extensive as that of the author 's two former publications , though it would have made the fortune of a less distinguished historian . The subject is a somewhat inferior one in unity and importance , and had lost in part its freshness through the brilliant treatment of the very similar topic , the conquest of INlexico . The matter is better suited for a gorgeous episode in a larger history , than for a history by itself ; and a little management has perhaps been used to add to its dignity , to make the characters seem more august and the incidents more momentous . There is a witchery in Mr. Prescott 's style that enables him to give what impressions he likes , and which indisposes the reader to go beneath the surface of the splendid narrative or vivid description . We might refer to a passage already cited , the account of the seizure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing , which describes with all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war an incident that might be spoken of more simply , by one inclined to depreciate its importance , as the mere kidnapping // of an Indian chief , and the butchery of his unarmed attendants , by a handful of bloodthirsty Spaniards , the act being accomplished by them without risk or the loss of a man . But the fault here is in the subject , and it only leads us to wonder more at the skill in the disposition of materials , and the command of style , which enable the historian to gloze over or cover up the defect . The incident in question was weighty enough in its consequences , as it was the turningpoint of Pizarro 's enterprise , and it therefore justified minute and elaborate treatment . Considered simply as a narrative of wild adventure and romantic achievement , this work is quite as attractive as its predecessors . We are hurried on with almost breathless interest from one scene or event to another , never impeded by confusion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moralize , and finding so pleasant a variety of objects on the road , that the end of it comes unlooked for and unwelcome . It is pleasant to hear that the book has had as hearty a reception in Europe as in this country . Translations of it , we learn , are already in progress into French , Spanish , and German , and a very large edition has found a rapid sale in England . Various learned societies , the doors of which have seldom or never been opened to an American , have added Mr. Prescott 's name to their list of members ; and in the case of the Royal Society of Literature , the compliment was enhanced by its coming to him through the hands of its distinguished president , Mr. Hallam . Lord Mahon was the organ of the Royal Society of Antiquaries for a similar purpose . We allude to these things more for their national than their personal interest ; they show in what estimation American literature is coming to be held in Europe , and that the depreciating , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than fifteen or twenty years ago is now considered unfair and in bad taste . No man living has contributed more to this change of opinion than Mr. Prescott ; and we trust that his future labors will be equally effective for the growth of his own fame and his country 's glory.
