txt IT is a striking illustration of the nice imagination of the ancient Greeks , that when they would speak of the comprehensive art of oratory , they designated it by the single word Xs*ovo*4a . Seeing in the action of the accomplished orator 's hand , a power and meaning which we too seldom appreciate , they seized upon this leading organ of speech to express the whole art of effective public speaking , drawing along in its train of course the action of all other bodily organs whose movements are in any way connected with the utterance of thought . Under this title therefore , while our remarks will be illustrated to a considerable extent from the sphere of the pulpit , we propose to advance some considerations in respect to the outward power and graces of the orator . There are three things required in the preacher , if he is to make the Gospel in his hands manifestly what it declares itself to be , the power of God and the wisdom of God unto salvation . these things are , first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ; secondly , a proper impression of the great value of this truth ; and finally , the ability to communicate the truth to his hearers by means of those faculties and organs of the body by which we are enabled to hold intercourse with others . And just as the preacher has these qualifications in greater or less strength and perfection , will he make the Gospel in his hands more or less uniformly the instrument of salvation to his fellow men . The conviction of ' this on the part of most intelligent persons , is what requires our religious teachers to spend years in colleges and theological seminaries , and forbids them to think that they can handle the instruments of grace with as little previous study as they do the implements of agriculture or merchandise . It has been thought to some extent , that men might step from mending nets in the fisher-boat , and catch men for the kingdom in the same rough way as they would the scaly inhabitants of the waters ; and apostolic precedent has not unfrequently been alledged in justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have come to peruse another chapter of early apostolic history , wherein they find that those fishermen of the time of Christ were not divinely commissioned as the heralds of salvation , until after they had received the miraculous powers of the day of Pentecost . When any modern fisherman therefore can substantiate his claim to the spiritual endowments of Peter or Paul as well as to their trade , we will allow him to go from net-mending or tent-making into the pulpit . Until he can do that , our sense of the dignity and difficulty of the ministerial work authorizes us to require , that the prospective occupant of the sacred desk shall prepare himself for his work by the discipline of a protracted course of study . This demand of previous and prolonged study on the part of the preacher , respects chiefly however , what we have termed the first requisite of the profession or business in which he is engaged , namely , the clear conception and harmonious adjustment of the truth in his own mind . He who is to stand up as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of God , needs more than simply to know that salvation is secured through faith in Christ . He who is to come in contact with the depravity of the unrenewed heart , and who , of necessity , will be- compelled to vindicate the ways of God against all the charges of man 's multiform iniquity , he who is to hunt down every false notion and doctrine , and drag it out from its den of darkness and sin into the daylight of truth , must be in no inconsiderable degree familiar with the prominent facts of man 's nature , and familiar in no inconsiderable degree with the relations of the gospel to all that pertains to man as an intellectual and a moral being . He needs the discipline of protracted study in order that he may go forth to encounter the hosts of error , and be able to wield the weapons of truth with skill and efficacy . But if such a preparatory training and discipline is requisite , no less so is a proper impression , abiding in the mind of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is his business to proclaim . And by this is meant , not merely that intellectual impression of its value , which every one of respectable understanding must have , to some extent , and which he who bends his mind continuously to the investigation of divine truth must have in a far greater degree ; but that impression , deeper still than these and more vivid , which comes as the result of the practical experience in his own heart of the worth of that truth . It is not enough for him who is to take his stand among men as a herald of salvation , that he is intellectually convinced // that the truth of the Bib1e is truth of the highest value . Such a conviction , be it ever so well settled and abiding , will not equip him properly for the work of an ambassador of Christ . There can be but little expectation that the labors of such a one will produce , even under a system of gracious influence from above , any general and perman ? nt reformation of character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , testifying to the excellence of the word of God . The heart must be convinced as well as the head . The man must be able to look into the well of his own living experience , and there discern the constant evidence of the value of that truth which God has given to man in the Scriptures . So long as this power is wanting , there will be of necessity a lack of power in all the ministrations of the man . His words will lack life , they will be mummies instead of living beings , and so will only lay hold of our curiosity instead of our sympathy . But even after that the heart has come into unison with the head , and the value of divine truth has become the well settled conviction of the one as well as of the other , there is an acquisition still remaining to be made , and a power yet to be attained , if the preacher would exercise his vocation to the best effect , and accomplish most uniformly and successfully the true end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in its various bearings , and after he has become heartily convinced of its inestimable worth , he needs then the ability to tell others this truth , and to send it into their minds with the resistless power of his own deep convictions . The well digested arrangement of related truths and doctrines , the ready insight of the laws of mental operalion , the knowledge of the intricate mazes of human feeling and action , *nd the assurance of the worth of that truth which is set forth in the word of God , all this does not render the man of God thoroughly furnished ' for his work , as he is justly expected to be who comes forth to his fellow men in the attitude of a heaven-sent ambassador . There is yet needed a familiarity with and a command over words , which are vehicles of thought and truth . And , what is less considered , though no less important , there is needed a command over certain other vehicles of thought and truth which God has placed at man 's disposal . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while its culture may he carried on with little or no injury of other , and what may seem more needful studies , tt promises a great accession of power to the preaching of the gospel . The tendency of our habits has been to call for close attention to doctrinal knowledge , and the possession of unquestionable piety on the part of the Christian ministry . And in our desire to secure these we have too much overlooked that element of power in the l ) ulpit , which consists in the most effective communication and enforcement of well digested and strictly religious thought . No one can question that the preacher must first of all have something to say , and something worth saying , too , before it is worth while to consider how it shall be said . This is the foundation , which must be well laid if we would have either a strong or graceful superstructure . Nor can any one reasonably doubt the value , nay , the absolute necessity of a right temper of piety in the soul of him who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The single history of Chalmers is enough to settle this question to the satisfaction of all . For several years he preached the Gospel in the power of a mere intellectual conviction of its value , and a mere intellectual understanding // of its worth and mode of operation . For years he thus preached , himself as much a stranger to the essence and spiritual virtue of the Gospel as were any of his hearers . And what was the result of his preaching ? Let this fact answer , that with all Chalmers 's learning and fire and lofty imagination , his audience diminished regularly from week to week , and a neighboring clergyman of little note used to exchange with him occasionally , with the benevolent purpose of affording the congregation to which Chalmers preached a little spiritual food ! The same powers of mind when directed by a renewed heart produced a different effect , as all the world knows . But important as is learning , and important as is a heart filled with the experience of Christian truth , and beating with Christian love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully equipped for his work . One can not consider the matter for a moment , hardly , without seeing enough to convince him of this . How many do we know , who to powers of mind of an exalted type add a piety whose fervency admits no question , and who nevertheless fail to make any great favorable impression upon those to whom they minister . Why is it that of two men of equal piety , but of unequal mental capacity and discipline , the one of meagerest mind is often by common consent the best preacher of the Gospel ? Why can it be , except because the one compensates the deficiency in power of thought by the superior power of exhibiting and enforcing the thoughts which he has ? Here then is a matter deserving consideration , how to give effective utterance to the truth . We are convinced , too , that there is no point where the like attention and labor will effect so beneficial a result upon our preaching as just here . There is many an occupant of the sacred desk whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery . They are still-born . The godly tone ' of the preacher has become proverbial , and justly too . In the attempt to give a solemnity to the voice , which shall correspond with the solemn character of divine truth , very many adopt a tone which is neither in the likeness of any thing in heaven or on earth or under the earth . It is an unearthly tone , netther more nor less ; a tone which has nothing about it in sympathy with good taste , and which only serves to clothe religion with its own distasteful and forbidding character . What is yet worse , this tone of voice being put on for the Sabbath or the time of public worship , soon comes to be permanent , and its croaking is heard in the street and the parlor , and on every occasion . The human voice , in its perfection , is the finest music which is found on earth , and God has given it a divine power to touch the sensibilities and move the hearts of men . We undo time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so far as we injure or misuse the vocal organs with which our Maker has endowed us . It is a great mistake moreover , though a very prevalent one , to suppose that the organs of speech are only the mouth and those which are contained within it , as the tongue , and teeth . These are no more truly the organs of speech than is the eye , or the hand . The whole body of man is organized for speech , from eyebrow to foot ; and there is hardly an organ lying visible to our sight which may not be seen acting its part in the business of speech . This is a fact too much lost sight of , and certainly too much overlooked by those whose profession calls them to express thought and announce truth to assemblies of men . It is a fact too , of which there is a lamentable ignorance or disregard in almost all our schemes of education . We have generally taken up the notion // that the voice is the sole instrument of language ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given to any thing more , as regards making effective and proper speakers , than to give a few lessons in respect to pauses , cadence , and inflection . The prevalent habit also of the world at large in expecting nothing more , tends indirectly if not directly to repress all other language save that which comes through the voice . The conseq*uence is that the boy comes to manhood less fitted in most cases , to stand up as a speaker before his fellow men , than he would have been had no attempt been made to educate his faculty of speech . The very process of education in this respect , as it is too commonly conducted , creates a positive discord among powers and faculties which God has fitted together in accordant harmony . If we would only see how God sends us forth upon the world , we might correct our notions in regard to this subject ; and having corrected them , oratory would hold such a rank with us , and be cultivated with some such assiduity as it was in the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little child is your true model of an orator . The child speaks all over . From head to foot he is all animate with expression ; and it is an expression which tells its story to those whom he addresses . And what is more , the child speaks his thoughts long before he can utter a single sentence in words . To him any other organ of the body is more an organ of speech than tongue or palate . Every movement of the hand or foot , every inclination of the trunk , every turn of the head , in short , every contraction of a muscle in the face or in almost any part of the body becomes the utterance of a thought . All is graceful too , as every one has noticed . There are no stiff and awkward attitudes , no rigid or uncouth postures . All is grace ; to express it in a word , all is the grace of childhood . The child would grow up also as he begins , only superadding to the organs already in play those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that art begins its deforming work upon the outer as well as inner being , and that every thing about him and in the habits of society tends , by a systematic process , to rob him of his grace and power . Every free emotion is forbidden utterance . " Children should be seen and not heard , " is the sage maxim which is sought to be enforced upon the child from the outset . Happy the child if , true to his instincts , he is able to resist the pressure of this false instruction , and obey the law of his Maker , which is , " children should be seen and heard too . " But most commonly these natural instincts are overborne in the attempt to make a man of a child before he has reached manly years or capacity . The feelings which are ever ready to gush out into expression , . the busy thoughts which struggle for utterance , the sympathies which long for communion with kindred sympathies in others , all these are repressed by word and look , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety . The result is , the world is filled with men from six to sixty . There are no boys in it . All are babies or men . And such men ! They are very well represented , in theory at least , by that caricature which figures on the cover of Punch , a man 's head on the body of a tender child . Dwarfs they are apt to be , or rickety and distorted in various ways , uncouth , in fact well nigh shorn of all manliness . Such is the simple truth of the case . And if this were not assured to us by watching the common growth and education from childhood , it would be by the observation of a certain comparatively few who have escaped such , a harmful process , // or have had stro*gth to break through all opposition to the course of nature . Happily there are such and ever have been ; and their example may serve as a beacon to show others their position and direct them on the right course . It is trite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most assiduous culture , or to mention the first of Roman orators , since every school boy almost has read his his . tory in his own words . But the entire history of the world , in regard to its orators , testifies that there was a power in their addresses as delivered by them , which is not to be found in the same addresses as transferred to parchment or paper . And what isthisbutthe testimony of the world 's history , that over and above mere thought and the ability to express thought accurately and elegantly by words , there is a power of expression , a power of vivid representation , an ability to manifest the nicer shades of thought by means of other bodily organs than those of the voice ? We have it on the authority of Valerius Maximus , that " a great part of Demosthenes is wanting , for it must be heard and not read . " When one was conversing with Eschines in commendation of the power of his great rival , as it appeared from a perusal of his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy a triumphant rather than a defeated man , " what would you think had you heard him ? " And how many have sought in vain in his reported speeches , for the indications of Chatham 's eloquence . The full power of Patrick Henry also , is lost in the same manner , if we may estimate him by the acknowledged effect of his speeches . The character of the late Dr. John M. Mason , too , as a man of surpassing power in the pulpit , rests on tradition rather than upon his published discourses , eloquent as they confessedly are . Dr. Backus is said to have met him at the foot of the pulpit stairs after having listened to his sermon , " the Gospel preached to the poor , " and with tears in his eyes , and voice all tremulous with emotion , declared he would never attempt to preach again . The discourses of Whitfield , as printed , may defy the world to discover any peculiar power in them . And so the utterance of a single sentence , has told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere words . It is said of an emtnent divine of our own country , that whenever , in a discourse on " the character of Judas , " he comes to pronounce the sentence , " Judas was a mean many " he brings his whole audience upon their feet . Mr. Clay ts reported to have done the same thing in the senate , by the peculiar utterance of the words , " executive usurpation . " The comparison of Mr. Clay with Mr. Webster shows us the power of oratory in distinction from power of thought and verbal language . No one would think of placing the orator of Kentucky on a level with the statesman of Massachusetts , so far as the ability to construct a strong logical and overwhelming argument is concerned . Mr. Clay never could have written Mr. Webster 's constitutional arguments . And yet Mr. Clay would carry a promiscuous audience whithersoever he might wish , when Mr. Webster would hardly move a tythe of them . We remember once to have heard a person read these words from the prophet Jeremiah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saith the Lord ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ? " The effect was thrilling . The flames seemed to be crackling around us , and the rock to fly into a thousand pieces before our eyes . Such facts as these show us that , for the purpose of influencing the thoughts or actions of others , there is a power which the deepest thought and the most skillful arrangement of words is not equal to . // It is the power of utterance ; the power of utterance through all the organs of language in the body , the power of speaking what we think not only by vocal sounds , but also by expressive motions of grace and strength . We know how apt men are , when we come to attribute such a power to mere bodily movements , to disparage the whole thing by some sneering remark , or to aver that those who have been distinguished as orators are exceptions by which the mass are not to be judged , and which are not to be set tip as models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact , but not by any peculiarity of nature , nor such exceptions as to weaken our argument . Demosthenes began life with less promise as a public speaker than a great multitude of others ; and we believe that the same labor which he expended for this purpose would make other orators like him . To talk about the motion of the preacher 's hand may seem to some , to be coming down from the high elevation of the truth , with which his discourse is concerned , to treat of a very trivial matter . Such is not the fact . Not so thought the ancients , for they called the entire art of speaking zem*oin'o , da . Quintilian moreover uses this language in respect to the use of the hand " Manus vero , sine quibus trunca esset actio ac debilis , vix dici potest , quot motus habeant , quum paine ipsam verborurn copiam persequantur . Nam cetera* partes loquentem adjuvant , he , prope est Ut dicam , ipsa* loquuntur . His posimus , pollicemur , vocamus , dimittiinns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tristitiam , dubitationem , confessionem , pc*nitentiam , modum , copiam , numerum , tempus , ostendimus . Non concitant ? inhibent ? supplicant ? probant ? admirantur ? verecundantur ? Non in demonstrandis locis ac personis adverbiorum atque pronominurn obminent vicem ? Ut in tanta per omnes gentes nationesque linguae diversitate hic mihi omruium hominum communis sermo videatur. " - Lib. xi , C. 3 . How few know any such use for the hand as Quintilian did . Were the old Roman rhetorician to hear some of our public speakers , he might perhaps add to his description of the uses of the hand , An non his truncamas ? pugnarnus ? ' For the most obvious interpretation of the natural language of much of our manual gesticulation , would be that of a threat to decapitate some of the audience , or to dare any champion of the Philistines to a pugilistic encounter . But if the whole art of elocution may receive its name from the use of the hand , then the right use of this member of the body must be an object deserving no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the first of orators has said that the first , second , and third requisites of effective speaking are embraced in action , he did not mean any action whatever , nor the action of any one organ exclusively . Action indeed may be as serious a defect in a speaker as the want of it . rfhere is an incessant motion of the hands , for instance , which by its very constancy deprives the hand of any meaning or any power to illustrate or enforce thought . The remark of the sailor tn respect to a sermon to which he had been listening , was founded on a shrewd observation . The sermon in itself , he said , was well enough , btt he did'nt see the use of the preacher 's lobstering so with his bands . This homely figure well describes the worse than homely figure which many make in the use of that most eloquent of all the visible organs of the body . Many seem to think that to be graceful and impressive , they have only to move their hands in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // and the result too often is , that the movement of the hand contradicts as flatly as possible the spoken sentence which it accompanies and which it was intended to enforce . We might profitably perhaps go on and illustrate the subject of oratory as it is concerned with the various bodily organs . But this is far from our present design , which is simply to call attention to the general subject , leaving the more minute study and application of it to the disposition of those more immediately concerned . And there is a field opened here of immeasurable extent ; a field which may be traveled and explored long and far , without its ultimate boundaries being arrived at . The subject offers a life long study . Demosthenes , unrivaled as he was , doubtless regarded his attainments as being short of absolute perfection , and found room for improvement in every successive effort of oratory . But while the mark of the - perfect orator is so high as to seem , like that of Christian perfection , almost beyond attainment , it is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advancement toward it , as well as the complete final acquisition , is valuable , that we urge this subject upon the attention of preachers of the Gospel more particularly ; but inasmuch as the same principles and laws apply to all spheres of oratory , to urge them upon all who have or may have occasion to address their fellow men in regard to any subject of importance . We should be most glad could we , by any remarks of ours , give this subject an interest in the public mind , which it does not now possess . Could the mass of men be made to see that effective utterance by means of all the organs of speech , is of as much account as the understanding of the l ) rinciples of grammar , or an ability to spell words correctly ; it would put a new face upon our schemes of edu cation . It would make us almost a different race of beings . The saying of the old Lycaonians , " the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license of speech . Not to mention the reform which it would effect in the oratorical style of the speaker on the stump or in the halls of legislation , or of the effect which it would have upon the pleadings of the bar ; it would work a most hopeful revolution in the oratory of the pulpit , the oratory of chief interest to us and of chief concern to the world . And it would effect the greatest transformation here , because the oratory of the pulpit is the farthest of any from reason and propriety . The man who canvasses a district from stump to stump , for the purpose of securing an election , commonly gives himself up to the impulses of his nature , and when he addresses his fellow men upon a political topic , the whole man speaks , and speaks with effect . The lawyer , too , marred as the native grace and eloquence of his boyhood may be , by reason of a defective education or the forbidding habits of the world around him , finds no occasion from the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or manner , and so he speaks with a certain measure of native force . It is the misfortune , to use no harsher term , of those whose office it is to reason with their fellow men , " of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come , " to fall too frequently upon such a mode of address as takes off the edge of their argument , and exposes them in some cases to the ridicule of those who have after all but little to boast in their own behalf . Every one is cognizant of this fact . Many are the men who are equal to any argument , to any effort of reasoning , to any process of logical analysis , who in their religious discourses leave the rejectors of divine truth without // a doubt to cling to , or a sophistry under which to hide , whose power of ' argumentation is yet unfelt or felt but feebly , because the setting forth of their words is lame and feeble , or something still worse . How many read their discourses with even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper . How many lounge now on one foot and now on the other , or stand fixed on feet close together like men in the stocks . A few at least grasp the cushion before them at each end , and thus bent over their manuscript in a constrained position , attempt to speak ; when the utmost that they can accomplish , is , by dint of unwearied effort , painful to themselves and equally so to their auditors , to expectorate a feeble , harsh , or inhuman sound , whose only power is that of repulsion , while , so far as the accompaniment of gesture is concerned , all they can do under the circumstances is to wriggle the spine from side to side in graceful undulations ! Such is the true picture of some who stand in the pulpit as God 's ambassadors , to deliver his all-important messages to mankind . It is a happy fact that many preachers are of another stamp , men whose thoughts breathe with the vitality of heaven , and whose words burn with unquenchable fire ; men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brought as a trophy of the quickening Spirit to the foot of the cross . Still the picture which we have drawn is but too correct a representation of a portion of our preachers . And it is because such a picture may be drawn and yet be faithful to the reality , that we would do something to call attention to the subject in a way calculated to work some improvement . We know it may be said that God has the more glory from the very fhct of this deficiency on the part of his ministers . We may be told that he chooses earthen vessels as the instruments of dispensing his grace to men . We are free to grant this ; but not that he chooses earthen vessels , which are cracked and distorted too . Enough that they be earthen , however perfect as such . The grace of God is higher and purer than instruments of such a mould , and its origin can never be in danger of being referred to a human source . It is a mistake , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by urging the necessity of a high tone of oratory in the preacher , we are derogating from the power or the sovereignty of God . But God works under laws and by means , as no reasonable man can doubt . We have it moreover , on apostolic authority , that it pleases God to save men " by the foolishness of preaching . " Is the preaching then of any use ? Does it bear any relation to the result ? If so , as no one can doubt , then has the quality of the preaching any thing to do with the production of the result ? I-las clear argument any force to this end ? Has an affectionate spirit ? Has an earnest solicitude ? Is it then of any consequence that this clearness of argument , this affectionate and earnest feeling of soul , should be manifest to those addressed , by all the helps which the bodily organs can give to the utterance of the bare words ? Will a harsh voice convey to the soul the melting influence of love as readily and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posture , or a labored effort at animation , command the attention , or open the door for God 's truth to enter the soul , as well as another style ? There is but one correct answer to such questions as these . Moreover if we are to fear lest we are derogating from the sovereign power of Jehovah in this thing , then we ask how we have come to know that the present state // of human equipment , is that which paves the way for the highest display of divine agency and divine glory in the work of salvation ? Perhaps God would be more glorified in the matter , were we still more awkward than we now are . It becomes an inquiry of no little importance , therefore , whether we ought not to degrade our present style of oratory , and deliberately study to make it yet more forbidding . But no , this would be insulting the common sense of all . No one could go this length without exciting the suspicion of his being a fit subject for a madhouse . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does not use them indiscriminately , or without reference to the particular character or nature of the means . It is not the . Tholishness of the preaching , but the preaching which saves men . If then the outward additions of utterance in all its various attributes of position , attitude , and gesture , are of any worth in connection with divine truth , it would seem that the worth of each and every one of them to the preacher of divine truth , must rise in proportion to their perfection . In the words of one who adds to the cogency and beauty of his thoughts and the choiceness of his language a further charm and power , " A good elocution in the pulpit is as really important as any elocution at all . If it be useful to preach the Gospel , then it is useful to preach it so that it will be understood and felt . If its truths ought to be expressed , then they ought to be expressed fully and properly . To proclaim them , and yet adopt such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blunt their force , is to do and undo a thing at the same time . The advantages resulting from a true , natural elocution , in the pulpit , are the same with the advantages of Christian doctrine well exhibited . The evils ensuing from a false , unnatural elocution , are the same with the evils of misrepresenting the word of God . He who undervalues the right method of enunciating religious truth , undervalues also the niceties of sentiment , the delicate mouldings of thought , which are a constituent portion of that truth ; and which are lost from the view , when a preacher 's elocution hides behind itself the ideas which ought to be delivered to his hearers . An affected delivery is often a delivery of mere words , often words conveying a thought never intended by the speaker . " And again the same writer says , " Being endued with physical and spiritual susceptibilities , man is the most deeply impressed when an appeal is made to both parts of his sentient nature ; when the eye and the ear are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And such is the sympathy between the corporeal and the mental powers , that when the former are in a state of appropriate excitement , the latter act with increased vigor and success . The soul perceives the more of truth , and feels it the more keenly , when the eye traces the lineaments of this truth upon the countenance of the speaker , and the ear catches the vibrations of it from lips which have been touched as with a live coal from off the altar . " We can not forbear making a brief quotation from another eminent preacher , whose praise is in all our churches and in many of other lands . " If a preacher have not the right things to say , and the right motives and spirit in uttering them , manner can do nothing for him or his hearers . But for men who are morally and intellectually qualified to preach the Gospel , the importance of manner can scarcely be overrated . And to overlook it is a proof neither of piety , dignity nor wisdom . If there were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of preaching were designed // to be mesmeric ; and people were to be put to sleep , instead of being aroused , in order to instruct and impress them , we might dispense with elocution and the culture it requires . But so long as men are in the body , it will be found requisite for the most effective exercise of the ministry , that a part of clerical education consist in the study and practice of oratory . That necessity is founded on these two facts , that the communication of thought and feeling depends upon the right exercise of our bodily organs ; and that those organs are within the domain of that great law which requires the cultivation of the faculties . It is not sufficient for the purposes of electrical power that the battery be fully charged ; a good conductor must be added . Alas ! how much preaching is in the class of non-conductors- A pure elocution is indeed a vain show in a man who has no other excellence ; but it multiplies indefinitely the power of one who possesses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of the truth of the last sentence which we have quoted , that has led us to what we have now said upon this subject . Elocution without thought , or without a right heart , is worth nothing . These are prerequisites in the order of nature , the foundation which God has ordained ; and no man can lay any other with any prospect of success . But if these are possessed , elocution can not be too highly estimated or too earnestly coveted . It is a fire to warm our thoughts into a genial glow . It is the light which gilds the salient projections of thought , and leaves the gentler emotions to repose in the quiet shadows which befit them . It is the charm of color , throwing a varied beauty over every form of thought , and so conspiring to satisfy an ever present desire of our nature . What then is to be done ? This is the practical point of our remarks . First of all , then , we need to be convinced that man is , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one complex , yet comprehensive organism of language . in " the inner man ' he is a being of thoughts and feelings , and he is wrapt around with all mechanical contrivances , cords , pulleys , levers , hinges , and sonorous pipes , that he may communicate his thoughts to other be ings , and receive their thoughts in turn from them . Man 's organs of speech are not in his mouth alone , but his whole body is an organ of speech . Let this be understood , let it be a generally received notion , and the natural result would be a new aspect of the race . There would be a life in men which there is not now . The conventional usages and absurdities which infest society would crumble away under the influence of the truth , and we should grow up in freedom , freedom to act as God has made us to act . We should not first , from the discouraging looks and words of domestic life , receive an influence to chill and repress and unnerve divers organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter made worse by the vicious education of the school , but we should grow up under the guidance and tuition of nature , correcting only the evils and deformities occasioned by our depravity . But what shall they do who have already grown up to a faulty habit , and especially , since our remarks have principal reference to the business of the pulpit , what shall he do who is even now the occupant of the sacred desk and is conscious of manifest defect in the power of expressive utterance ? We answer , let him uneducate himself as fast as possible . The trouble with the mass of speakers of all professions is a bad education ; a process which instead of drawing out , as all true education should , what God has placed within man , has drawn man // away from his natural endowments .

Let him be assured that God has given him the same organs and instruments by which to express all his thoughts of whatever character they may be ; and that he has the same machinery and only the same , by which to declare the messages of salvation in the pulpit and relate the anecdote in the street . Let him not then be guilty of the folly of undertaking to fight against the ordinance of heaven , by endeavoring to assume a tone or a look of sanctity for the Sabbath which he does not on other grave occasions . All truth is God 's truth ; and if an unnatural tone is needful for the enunciation of the doctrines of grace , so is it likewise for the recitation of the propositions of Euclid . Man can not make himself more grateful to his fellow men , nor give his communications greater weight with them , than when he meets them as a man , when he is Honorable or Reverend not for the office which he fills or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the truth which he utters by his life and the various instruments of speech . And if the preacher would learn what he has lost by education and can not learn by inspecting the powers of language which lie rusted or paralized about him , then let him go to school to his children , or if he is so unfortunate as not to have any , let him watch his neighbor 's children , and see what is natural before man is spoiled by a faulty education . Let him learn from the man in frocks , how to let his thoughts run out from the spark . ling eye , and how to let his emotic ) ns leap from his finger 's ends . Let him learn , when he has a thought worth uttering , to utter it in the way that is natural to him , no matter how many frigid criticisms or laws of ( im ) . propriety may stand in the way .

And if any one says that such men as Chalmers , whose almost constant gesture was a thrusting of his hand directly in the faces of his audience , are above the rules of the elocutionist , let him dare to think that it was the superabundance of other qualities that enabled Chalmers to dispense with the graces of oratory ; that he was an eloquent man , not by the help of his uncouthness , but in spite of it ; and that had he exchanged it for a better style of elocution , he would have been a still more eloquent man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ideas as these in his mind , let him prose . cute the business of improvement in the belief that every step of progress is valuable , and that he has not to reach perfection in order to reach that which is of any worth .

We mean the Pulpit Elocution " of Russell , to which we are indebted for some hints and extracts which have been of service to us in our present course of remark . It would be a wise purchase for every preacher to secure this volume at the earliest opportunity . // stand as a preacher of righteousness . Let him come forth to his fellow men as one of them . We should not do justice to even such a brief consideration of the subject as our present limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to a part of it which might otherwise escape notice . We allude to the public reading of Scripture and sacred poetry . It is a great error to suppose that elocution has reference only to the proper enunciation of the preacher 's discourse . Elocution , rightly conceived , covers a wider ground by far . It bears a relation to all the exercises of the sanctuary in which one or more human beings undertake to guide or instruct others , to all in which thought or emotion are to be conveyed from man to man . It has to do therefore with the public reading of the Scriptures and sacred hymns . These we suppose should be read for effect , and not to carry out a certain formality . And if for effect , it must be through the truth which is thus brought before the minds of an audience . And if this is so , then it is as important that this truth should be uttered in the best manner , as it is that the truth which the preacher has embodied in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house of worship , in distinction from the recited discourses of the preacher , ought not to be so destitute of good effect as they now are . As a matter of fact the number of those who can read a portion of Scripture or a hymn so as to give it interest and make it speak to the heart , is fewer even than the number of those who can pronounce a discourse with tolerable pfopriety . Is it not the best of all proofs of this , that the reading of Scripture and of hymns is regarded by most people as a comparatively unimportant portion of the services of the sanctuary ? You may hear a person excusing his tardiness at the house of God most complacently on the ground that he arrived there " before the sermon commenced . " He seems to have no thought that it is a noticeable delinquency when one is not present to hear what precedes the preacher 's discourse . We have known ministers also to arrange the order of their services , so as to throw the reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that space of time , in which the tardy ones will be entering the house of worship . And why is this ? Why , if not because there is commonly so little expression in the reading of the pulpit that neither minister nor people anticipate much interest in it , and so of course attach little if any importance to it . It is time that this defect were remedied . If it is proper to read a portion of the word of God , or a hymn to his praise , when in the house of God , then it is proper that the reading should be such as to give the utmost effect to what is read . Nay , it is absolutely improper to read otherwise . And to read well is a matter little if at all less difficult than to speak well . It requires great care and attentive study . The reason why our public reading is more uniformly worse than our public speaking , is perhaps to be found in the fact that almost all persons pass through a course of instruction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often so small , that , while the pupils make but very little attainment in the art of reading , they go out into the world with the notion that reading is a very easy matter , and that they are sufficiently skilled in it . And hence it is a thing of no small difficulty to induce one who is preparing for the ministry to give attention to reading with a proper instructor . We lose very much of the power of our religious services because our reading is so defective , so tame and spiritless . The Bible seems to be read too often as a kind of prelimin // ary flourish by way of introduction ; and the hymns are only so many stepping-stones to the sermon . XVhereas the reading of a portion of Scripture ought to fill all hearts with the power of its peculiar sentiment , and a psalm should be so read as to kindle in every pious heart a desire to sing it aloud to God . " If I have ever been of any use , " said the late Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an instrument of spiritual good , it has been , to a great extent , through the reading of sacred poetry ; where I have had my choice of means , I have selected it in preference to any other . " Such testimony from such a man is certainly worthy of serious consideration . It is said of J ) r . John M. Mason , that his reading of a hymn was often more effective than the sermons of some men . We remember having heard of his reading a single line in such a way that it shot a thrilling effect through a whole congregation . These instances show us by contrast the power in which the ministry to a great extent is deficient , and the power which , if it were generally possessed , would make God 's sanctuaries the theaters of mightier displays of divine grace . Here we arrest our remarks upon this very interesting and fruitful subject . We have spoken as we have in regard to the oratory of the pulpit , in the conviction , painfully felt , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which God has sent his messages of grace and redemption , and behind the capabilities of the members of the clerical profession . Some may think we have spoken in too harsh and sweeping a strain . Of such we ask that before they pass sentence of condemnation upon us , they will look more largely at the subject . Our purpose has been not to point out the good qualities of the pulpit-they will make themselves known  --  but to call attention to its defects as the best means of securing a remedy@@184069742.txt THE greater part of the articles which compose this volume , have been in one form or another , for some time before the public ; and have received much of the attention , to which as elegant and impressive discussions , they are certainly entitled . There is great beauty of style-much force , and much felicity , of language about them . They display a rich and vigorous imagination , a fine and cultivated taste , and for the most part an elevated and courteous spirit ; to all which we regret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodox faith , we are obliged to render but the scanty justice of this paragraph . We discover also a comprehensive and philosophical turn of thought in many of his discourses ; of which that for " Miracles preliminary to the argument for a Revelation , " is perhaps the finest specimen . His views too , of inspiration , display the same tendency toward enlarged and general views ; though of these we can by no means speak with the same unqualified approbation . This philosophical tendency , however , requires great accuracy of discrimination , and much logical force , to render its results at all valuable . Without these , it is apt to deprive us of facts of the utmost moment , and give us instead of them , only barren and useless generalizations ; an objection to which in our view , much of our author s reasoning lies open . The fact however , that Dr. Dewey 's work has been so generally known to our readers , and his literary and philosophical merit so generally and highly appreciated , may serve as an apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the aspect to which its controversial character naturally invites us . The two opening chapters of the volume , one upon " The Unitarian Belief , " and the other upon " The nature of Religious Belief , " present to us a question of some interest , in which our author stands at issue with Prof. Stuart . In his review of Mrs. Dana 's recent work , the last named gentleman has dropped some very significant expressions , with reference to the use of orthodox terms in some portion of the work before us , alledging that in using the the words " Atonement , Regeneration , Depravity , " &amp;c. , to express the religious belief of Unitarians , employing at the same time " an entirely new set of definitions , " Dr. D. has been guilty of a " degrading artifice , " and one which " merits the scorn of every upright man , " &amp;o . These remarks Dr. 1 ) . quotes in a note , as a " surprising comment " upon his language and his motives ; and replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly warm . The practice which Prof. S. thus severely reprehends , had been so frequent , and is so unjust to what we deem the truth , that though the topic is a most uninviting one , we feel constrained to point out the utter futility of the vindication which Dr. D. has attempted . He argues that he has nowhere professed to use these terms in the orthodox sense , but that " throughout as every reader must see , a discrimination is studiously made between the ortho. dox and the liberal construction " of them ; - that even if used " wit/tout any express qualification , " " the very position of the writer obviously qualifies them ; " and finally that the terms in question are scriptural terms , to which one has as good a * Discourses and Reviews , upon ques. tions in Controversial Theology , and Practicat Retigion .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying upon his position as a Unitarian to ensure a just interpretation of it , there is one obvious consideration which renders the plea inadmissible in the present instance , however valid it might he in some others . Dr. D. has himself declared that his position itself is " entirely misunderstood ; " - that there is a strange " misconstruction " of the opinions of himself and his party ; so much so that " it seems to be received as if it were a matter of common consent that we do nut hold to the doctrines of the Bible and that we scarcely p etend to hold to the Bible itself . " All this he asserts on the very first page of his book , and assigns this wide and deep ignorance of his views , as the very reason of his 1jrofessed endeavor to tell what he understands " the prevailing belief of Unitarians to be . " To require a community thus totally misinformed as to " What Unitarianism is , " to interpret any language by a reference to that system , seems unreasonable enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask that the public would interpret by his general position , the very Ianguag ' in which he professes jo define that position . The logic cf this paragraph is obviously too loose to require any exposure , or to admit of any defense But this is not his main vindicacation ; for that , he relies upon the fact that the language is properly qualified . Has our author then , we are led to ask , so guarded his statements as to forestall the answer of Prof. Stuart ? The sufficiency of such disclaimers as he here pleads , must evidently depend very much upon the circumstances of the case . Before his own congregation , who must of course be entirely familiar with his views , the briefest explana tion alone would be requisite . Before an assembly of divines the same disclaimer would , for the same reason , be ample . But in a popular discourse this brief and occasional qualification , of language used with the utmost frequency and in connections which carry irresistibly to the public mind , ideas utterly repugnant to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candor and manliness call for . Dr. Dewey 's explanations we are constrained to consider precisely of this character ; they are far from being so ample as to hold up distinctly and steadily the prominent ideas of his own system . A writer who aims to disabuse the public mind of a deep seated misapprehension , assumes a peculiar responsibility for his use of language . The surpassing importance too , of the themes on which Dr. Dewey has chosen to write , gives every reader a right to demand the utmost fullness of explanation which can be requisite to a distinct apprehension of his meaninLr . The total inadequacy of his explanations for this end , becomes apparent the moment we apply to his opponents , our author 's vindication of himself . Lie protests strenuously against the application to his own party , of the somewhat harsh terms in which they are sometimes mentioned , tie expresses his astonishment at the bold and confidertt tone in which it is sometimes said * there is no religion among us ; "  --  and declares that no man has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The case between them stands thus : I believe , ' says the one , truly and firmly in the atonement , though certainly not in the popular sense of that word . ' Very good , ' says the other , I call you an Infidel , though certainly not in the popular sense of that term . ' It would certainly require some ingenuity to show that Dr. D. 's vindication of himself is not equally good for his opponent . If his simple and occasional disclaimer 6s Jan. // of the popular meaning , is a sufficient justification of his usage , it justifies also all that he so earnestly protests against , in the usage of others . If our author were to be assailed as " an ungodly man , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ , " very slender justification would he deem it , to be told that all this was studiously declared to be not in the popular but the scriptural import of the language . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere cover for theological rancor , in any opponent who should solemnly declare that in that sense he most fully believed it , how can it furnish any justification for Dr. Dewey 's usage ? Let any man describe the Unitarian as a man full of all subtlety , and mischief , unceasingly perverting the right ways of the Lord , ' and he would find that rio cautious statement that he used the terms not in the popular sense but in what he really deemed a more scriptural and just one , would exempt him from the charge of calumny. lie would be told that whoever uses such terms not in their popular meaning , has no right to use them in a popular discourse ; and that none but a covert and unworthy design could lead him to persist in it . As for the " right " of using " common property " in this manner , Dc . Dewey 's concessions effectually negative that . It needs no argument to prove that no one has a right to use any language which perpetually and necessarily misleads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so mislead , is beyond a question . Our author himself tells us that at first , Unitarians hesitated about the use of these terms , because they " stood in the prevailing usage for orthodox doctrines . " When to this admission , we add the repeated and most earnest assertions of all orthodox readers , that they themselves are constantly confounded by this language , it can not he doubted that it is felt to be on the part of all who employ it , a source of incessant misapprehension . Since then the language by their own admission conveys to the popular ear only the idea of the orthodox doctrine , why persist in the use of it ? Dr. D. has exposed the reason with a simplicity which provokes some wonder . " The body of the people , " he says , page 5 , " not often hearing from our pulpits the contested words and phrases , * - hold themselves doubly warranted in charging us with a defection from the faith of Scripture . " His use of scriptural language then , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas ; it is a mere theological artifice , employed for a sectarian purpose . The question narrows itself at once then to this : Has any one the right to create constant misapprehension , for the sake of avoiding unjust aspersions upon his character and his faith ? Has any one the right to create erroneous impressions of his system , for the sake of giving that system greater currency ? To these questions an honorable mind can render but one answer . XVe say therefore , that Dr. D. has failed to make out any justification of his usage . Still it will no doubt he termed a hardship that the Unitarian should be shut out from the common heritage of Christendom , and forbidden to give utterance to his religious convictions , in the consecrated words of tnspiration . One additional consideration will serve to show how unfounded even this impression is . If it is really a hardship to be compelled to abandon the scriptural mode of expression , how does it happen that on certain subjects the Unitarian so readily and cheerfully does abandon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopts the phraseology of the Bible . Dr. D. himself takes occasion // more than once , to explain and vindicate at large his views of this topic ; and we have carefully examined his language . He does indeed say that " all the language of Scripture on this solemn subject we have no hesitation about using : " but he no where ventures to use in the expression of his faith , any one of its decisive declarations . Nay , he evidently feels not the least disposition to employ a certain style of Scripture language in defining his views upon it . This departure from biblical usage he vindicates most satisfactorily , indeed , on the ground that " popular ignorance " has so fixed the meaning of this phraseology , that " it is difficult to use it without constant explanation . " Very true ; but then why employ this kind of language on other subjects , in respect to which " popular ignorance " is equally profound ? Why , when popular ignorance perpetually misunderstands this language , insist upon a right of perpetuating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popular estimation , a grouud on which a generous mind can feel content to abate a jot or tittle of its endeavor to convey the most accurate conceptions of its faith ? That it would suffer seriously from such an endeavor , we most certainly believe ; but this conviction in the mind of one who receives that system as the sum of Christian truth , would betray a pitiable want of confidence in truth itself . We might pursue this subject farther , but it is by no means an agreeable one , and we gladly leave it . We have said enough to sustain the remark with which we conclude our discussion of it ; that in pursuing a course which to say the least of it , is so questionable , Dr. D. must be indebted altogether more to the courtesy of his opponents , than to any well founded claims of his own , for his exemption from the unpleasant terms in which Prof. S. has char. acterized it . There is perhaps no one of the subjects mentioned in this volume which Dr. Dewey discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discourse uow first presented to the public , on the theme " that errors in theology have sprung from false principles of reasoning , " his most important application of the principle is to this doctrine , and his remarks upon it disclose a sense of its importance , with which we most heartily sympathize . After a very earnest presentation of his objections to the orthodox view of it , he speaks thus : - " So powerful , so overwhelming , has appeared to me the argument against the Trinity , that for years I confess I have been looking for its effect upon the churches of England and America . I have sometimes involuntarily said-Is it possible that what appears so clear to me , so unanswerable , can go for nothing with the minds of others ? What are the men of England and America thinking ? " &amp;c . We will not withhold the expression of our respect for the earnest spirit in which these remarks are conceived ; nor can we help regarding the frankness with which they are uttered , as highly honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncandid disposition which we have found in some other quarters , to consider this a settled question . Probably every intelligent observer of the progress of opinion has cherished similar anxieties ; has *vaited , and watched , and longed , to see some token of the things which he felt assured " must shortly come to pass . " The advocate of free communion has looked with interest for the effect of the calm and resistless logic of Robert Hall ; and he finds at length the whole Baptist community in England , pervaded with his sentiments to an extent he had scarcely hoped for . The Protestant has waited and prayed for the reaction which he knows must be at // hand , against the forms and superstitions with which Rome has supplanted the Gospel ; and he beholds all over the blood-sprinkled soil of France-in the realms of monarchs who gloried in the title of " most Cathol ic " - wherever , in short , the hand of power leaves any access to the millions it has so long and so jealously guarded against our approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has so longed to see . The lover of religious freedom has anxiously listened for the response which all christendom is yet to make to the announcement of our separation of church and state ; and he hears swelling from the glens of Scotland and the vales of Switzerland , the sound which confirms his faith in freedom . And amid all this universal progress of truth , the Unitarian too listens for the tokens which are to conv*y to him the grateful intellKence that he is no longer to be cut off from the sympathies of the universal church ; but alas ! no cheering voice brings him that consolation-over the broad earth he finds no sigr* that he is not as isolated , and his views as widely rejected as they have ever been . What a melancholy position ! Why will he not , we are tempted to ask , let it awaken for once , that wholesome distrust of his system , which alone can ever bring him into sympathy with the mass of Christian minds . The tone in which our author urges his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be expressive of the strongest confidence , is by no means arrogant or offensive . Again and again he earnestly objects that our doctrine involves a palpable contradiction ; and argues that it is impossible for any one , steadily and consistently , to maintain his faith in it . " So distinct , " says he , p. 343 , are these persons of the Trinity in your idea of them , that no power of human reason or imagination can make them one being . " Lie maintains repeatedly that even when worshiping Jesus , the Trinitarian does for the time drop all thought of any other being , and simply investing him with divine attributes , " is , and his mind compels him to be , virtually a Unitarian . The charge of inconsistency at this point , comes , in the present state of the Unitarian body , with a very ill grace from them ; and if we might for once assume to advise , we would counsel Dr. D. to abandon it . When we see their religious edifices designated by no significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the solemnity their system of faith can supply , to Him as their " Teacher , Redeemer , and Lord " - when we hear them venturing to offer no petition to the paternal goodness which Christ has revealed , but it must be slavishly offered in His name-seeking no blessing of the Merciful Father , hut it must be entreated for His sake-when we see them thus standing before Christ with all that other men call religious homage , we smile at these charges of inconsistency between our faith and our worship . We bid the opponents who can attain to no higher views of Christ than these poor assaults upon the system which exalts him , take one lesson from the deep convictions to which they are evermore unconsciously giving utterance . We bid them listen to the sensibilities and affections which , in all that portion of the body that seems to us to have most of the spirit of piety , seem yet loyal to the truth as it is in Jesus and which proclaim amid all the negations of their theory , the indissoluble connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines they deplore . And here we doubt not is the secret , in part at least , of the phraseology which to the no small scandal of their system , Unitarian writers find themselves impelled to use , and yet unable to justify . They are nut // exempt from the power of the ancient faith . They were taught to bow the knee and lisp the prayer of infancy , to a Savior who died for them ; - they have been surrounded ever since with the symbols of a faith which " knows nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified ; " -a history illustrious with examples of evangelical piety  --  a literature rich with imperishable works of evangelical devotion , have environed and moulded them since they had a being : till now as often as they bend in prayer or send up their song of praise-as often as they preach or hear the Gospel of the Redeemer , the name of Christ mingles itself with each solemn act , and as we behold their devotions we seem to hear the very voice of nature within them doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In respect to the Trinity , Dr. Dewey makes his first issue upon a principle of interpretation . This he affirms to be of such vital moment that " it settles the whole question . " He magnifies so highly the importance of this principle , that one is a little amused when he comes to state it , to find it dwindling into the very familiar and harmless one , that the Bible is to be interpreted like other books . " It is the principle that words are not to be taken by themselves in the Bible ; - that limitations and qualifications in their meaning must be admitted ; - that the Scriptures are in this respect to be interpreted like other books , " &amp;c. , ( page 62 , ) as though orthodoxy made war upon that ! But let us test Dr. Dewey 's adherence to this principle , and try the strength of his cause upon his chosen ground . The infidel objects to the Unitarian believer in inspiration , that the Bible is utterly repugnant to the goodness of God , in teaching the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repel the charge ? Why , he maintains that the word everlasting is capable of a different meaning . Very true , says the former , but what is there to show that it is entitled in this place to the construction you propose ? Why is it not to be allowed its full import ? especially as in a connection immediately adjacent , and precisely similar , it denotes by general consent the absolutely endless blessedness of the just ? rfo this question Dr. D. may be challenged to frame any reply , which does not assume the inspiration of the sacred volume , and make it the ground of a claim that the Scripture is not to be so interpreted as to conflict with the divine character . Again ; suppose it maintained that Christ as a mere cunning impostor claimed a divine and preexistent nature ; and his own words , " the glory which I had with thee before the world was , " alledged in support of the charge . Now nothing is more common than similar attempts to awaken superstitious reverence . If such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professed prophet , it would beyond all question receive precisely this interpretation . How then does the Unitaria@ escape this conclusion in the present instance ? He assumes that the inspiration of the Scriptures furnishes ground for an interpretation of them different from that of other and similar records . In the argument with those who admit inspiration , he finds no difficulty . He says evermore , ' Such a construction is inadmissible because it is absurd ; but of this inspiration , his own scheme , we most seriously believe , can furnish no proof whatever . His vaunted principle sweeps away the very ground beneath his feet . When we find the Apostle prefacing his affecting biography of the Master who loved him , with the mysterious announcement that the Logos existed in the beginning with God , and was God-attributing in language most deliberate and peculiar , each mighty work of creation to his // power  --  and then proceeding , in terms which defy all other application , to identify this divine agent with the Savior whose glory they had themselves beheld , we interpret all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XVe do this , not because the Bible is to be interpreted differently from other hooks , but because if we found such an account in the Vedas , or the sacred books of any people , we should feel constrained by every law of language to do the same there . And so would Dr. Dewey : so does he interpret each similar account in the religious literature of every nation under heaven . There , he pronounces it all the mere superstition of a barbarous age ; but it never occurs to him , or to any one , to deny that it was originally designed and received as a statement of literal truth . Let our readers judge then whether it is on his part or on ours , that the Bible is interpreted with all the limitations which the common judgment of mankind imposes , on the early records of the religious history of our race . The confidence with which Dr. Dewey asserts the impossibility of conceiving of the persons of the Trinity as any other than three beings , apart from the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of argument he has alledged in support of it . When he so earnestly asserts that " the dogma of the Trinity destroys every kind of unity which can be conceived of in an intelligent being , " ( page 344 , ) we naturally look for some analysis of the nature of being-some argument to show in what its unity consists . But beyond the mere assertion , that " when we speak of unity in a being we mean that he is self-conscious , " there is not the least attempt at such ana ! ysis . He no where aims to show what the elements of our idea of being are . Now it is precisely upon such an analysis that the common orthodox theory of the doctrine is founded . Trinitarians generally consider the idea of a being to include two great elements  --  the substance and its properties . These elements belong necessarily to our idea of each existing thing ; it is a substance possessing certain properties . In the instance of a material substance , these are the properties of solidity , extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a spiritual being , they are the various faculties of thought , emotion , will , &amp;c . The common theory of the Trinity is , that in the Divine Being there is a multiplication of these attributes ; - there are three several faculties of action and of consciousness , which all inhere similarly in the same common substance . To each of these classes of attributes , the name person is given . It will be at once perceived , that if this idea of the nature of being is correct , it affords a ready reply to all the oft repeated assertions , that we can not conceive of distinct persons without subverting the Divine Unity . We point at once to the grand element of all being , lying simple and undivided , at the basis of our conception , and say that while there is no distinction there , there is no force in this charge . The word being denotes a complex idea , and until there is a triplication of each of the elements which compose it , there is no triplication of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while it is disclaimed , we must consider the charge that tritheism is essentially involved in their doctrine , one which a careful analysis not only refuses to support , but distinctly contradicts . Dr. D. seems to imply ( for as we have said he attempts no formal analysis ) that consciousness and certain other faculties constitute our whole idea of a being . On this assumption , he argues that the duplication of these faculties amounts to a duplication of the being . But if the idea of being includes another es // sential element , then evidently no mere multiplication of consciousness , will , &amp;c. involves the multiplication of that idea . Our author implies that consciousness and moral faculties are the sole elements of our conception of a being ; a position to which we at once take the exception , that it assumes all that is decisive in the argument . Orthodoxy holds that there is another element , fundamental to that conception , on the strict unity of which , its assertion of the unity of a Tn-personal God is fbunded . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question between him and the orthodox , how entirely his discussions fall short of reaching the grounds on which they rest ; and how necessarily , in consequence , his conclusions must fail to command their acquiescence . Dr. Dewey 's argument meat proceeds on the supposition , conceded by some Trinitanians , that the unity of the Godhead necessarily implies an absolute identity of attributes in the persons of the Trinity ; and all the strength of his argument depends on this hypothesis and concession . But the common theory contained in these memorable words of the old Confessions- " the same in sub . stance-equal in power and glory " - is certainly entitled , if not refuted , to be considered a triumphant defense of the doctrine of the Trinity against the charge of inconsistency . The objection is , that distinct wills , consciousnesses , &amp;c. , in the persons of the Trinity , would render the doctrine inconsistent with the unity of God . What then , we ask , is the unity of which the orthodox view admits . We say nothing of unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counsel a ad purpose between persons so intimately related must far surpass any which can be deemed to characterize the counsels of beings substantially distinct ; the scheme implies an absolute philosophical unity . The persons are really one being , by virtue of the unity of their substance . The conception of substance is one of the most important of all our necessary ideas : the charge of * theoretical " tnitheism agaInst a scheme which lays so broad and palpable a ground fbi absolute uaity of nature , we can only say , surprises us . But a candid estimate of our theory must concede to it a higher unity than this . Conscious unity is ( besides the substantial unity of which we have just 51 ) okea ) lie only other unity of which we can conceive . Now to this it is essential that the mind should know itself as distinct from every other ; should feel that in the conscious experience of c aother , it has no participation . It is on this uround that our conception a of our own individuality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , and we know that their experience stands in no connection with ourselves . Now supposing such a personal distinction as we advocate , to exist in the divine mind , it is obvious that there could not co*xist with it , any such consciousness of individuality as would convey the idea of three separate beings . Each must be aware of the thoughts and acts of the others as sustaining a close relation to himself . Each must conceive of the faculties of another as sustaining to the common substance , the same intimate relation as his own . There may be therefore a conscious unity of a very high kind , based upon consciousness of identity in the substance of their being , and conscious participation of each other 's experience . The capacity of separate action is the only element , in the idea of unity which consciousness gives us , is the only possible one . There may be a real unity which yet , does not imply precisely the same elements as ourS . // The grounds of ' moral agency , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natures ; reason may be in other orders of ' beings , as certainly as it is in God , materially different from what it is in man . Why then may not the unity of the divine nature vary within certain moderate limits , just as the intelligence of that nature does , from ours ? Evidently persons who are thus " the same in substance , " conscious of that identity and on the ground of it conscious to an extent which may be very great , of the experience of each other , are not simple and separate beings ; are one in their inward nature-one in their outward development , and possibly one in their conscious knowledge . Such a unity falls but little short of the highest conceivable . The possibility of this theory , no Unitarian has made any strenuous effort to disprove . We find no careful discussion of it by any oneof them . Channing , Ware , Sparks , Dr. Dewey himself , which of them devotes a solitary page to the examination of it ? Prof. Norton , whose work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it professes to be so ) of " the different forms which the modern doctrine has been made to assume , " does not even mention that it is held by any class of his opponents . If we are wrong in these remarks , we shall cheerfully submit to correction . If there is any Unitarian discussion of this theory , we be to have it pointed out . XVe would not affirm that there is no allusion in the writings of the men we have mentioned , to the distinction of substance and attribute as connected with this doctrine ; but that they have made no extended and explicit attempt to overthrow the theory , is evident from their own language on the subject . Dr. Ware , in his most recent work , says that " none have pretended to explain or to understand what is meant by a person as distinguished from a being , or wherein any number of separate persons differ from the same number of separate beings . " * No one who compares this statement with the very palpable distinction we have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have been made in absolute oversight of our theory . The call for a Unitarian analysis of this sub ect has been long and earnesily made . it is in itself ; too , a most reasonable demand , that writers who are perpettially asserting that the statements of others are inconsistent with the unity of God , should tell us in the way of extended argument in what the unity of ' being consists . To an argument upon that subject , Unitarianism has never committed itself ; perhaps we may provoke them to that good work , if we add that we have little expectation that it will ; though till it does , Dr. D. has small reason to wonder at the perversity with which " the men of England and America " turn a deaf ear to the " charmings " of its advocates . We have dwelt so long upon these topics that we are constrained to pass over entirely some *vh cli we should be glad to notice in more favorable terms ; Dr. Dewey 's exhibition of the doctrines of depravity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first of these subjects is prejudiced throughout by a serious errot ' . He maintains that our view of it includes the dogma that there is no natural freedom in the human mind to do good that Calvinists believe that " men have lost the power of recovery , all voluntary moral powet ' to be good and pure . " lie represents the evangelical theology as teaching , and stands aghast at the " astounding paralyzing contradiction ; that we are *ommanded , on pain of God 's eternal disWare 's Inquiry concerning Religion , vot. ii , p. 146 // pleasure , to do that which we have no power to do , " - &amp;c. &amp;c. , p. 361 . Now Dr. I ) . ought certainly to know that among those who uphold the doctrine of the entire depravity of man , are some , not to say many , who regard with the deepest disapprobation the dogma he thus undiscriminatingly imputes ; men who have grown gray in protesting with all the emphasis of langua ge , against confounding this with the evangelical system ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge upon them , through every possible evasion ; and who have received for their earnest toil an abundant and thankless req nitaL Nay , the honor of that improvement in the popular theology has been already won . Aiming to identify this repulsive tenet with the doctrine of depravity , he argues that the two are most intirnately connected-that " if a man is totally depraved he can have no freedom to be good-if he has no freedom to he good he is indeed totally depraved. " - p. 359 . We crave the indulgence of our orthodox readers for detaining them with even the briefest reply to this charge . What possible depravity can exist in a mind which has really " no freedom to be good ? " Such a man is no more depraved than the animal creation-has no more obligation or responsibility than a maniac . What sin can he be justly charged with , who can do no better than he dues ? On the other hand , nothing would be easier , were we in the humor for such trifling , than to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variance with moral freedom . Virtue is in his system as truly necessary as sin can be in any other . For the mind , on his view of it , necessarily forms " the idea of moral rectitude , " and the idea he tells us implies the previous existence of " the feeling of rectitude "  --  and this feeling of rectitude he esteems virtuous , he says it is " right . " Every man therefore is by the most stringent necessity virtuous in some a - degree ; though what species of rectitude that is , which exists in the mind antecedently to the very " idea " of rectitude , Dr. D. is perhaps safe in not attempting to specify . In quite a kindred strain he proceeds in his review of Wardlaw , ( an author whose teachings some Calvinistic writers have earnestly repudiated , but whom , nevertheless , Dr. D. chooses to consider the exponent of Calvinistic opinions , ) to deny to Calvinism any genial or kindly tendencies . " What sort of practical ethics , " he asks , " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a depraved and doomed one , he inquires , ( p. 387 , ) " Under the dread shadow of this system , what can remain to its consistent votary ? What can be his ties to society at large ? can he have friendship ? can he wish for intercourse with unregenerate men , bad men , utterly bad men ? Why should he ? What is there in them to love ? If he must be connected with them by business or kindred , yet what are these circumstances compared with the great ties of moral relationship ? And the moral relationship on the part of the regenerate can be nothing but that of superiority , and pity , and prayer ; not of friendship . " We pause in a wonder that deepens into amazement at the hardihood of this most grievous charge . Firmly believing all that is here charged as so odious and repulsive in the orthodox faith , we have had occasion to utter many a mournful assertion of human sinfulness , but such a statement as this , never . Many a denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human heart ; but the natural sympathies and affections which bind man to man , we never had the heart to deny to any thing that breathes . Often have we felt constrained to question the reality // of much that passes for religion among the class whom Dr. Dewey represents ; but that they were , or must he , insensible to each warm and genial impulse-that in proportion as they drink in the spirit of their faith they must become dead to each lovely sentiment that adorns human nature , recreant to each obligation that binds to love , to confidence , to gratitude , among men ; - lost to all that is honorable and generous beyond their own narrow pale ; - absolutel y incapable of all affection and even of all " friendship " - the most cold hearted believer in our dark and cheerless creed never sticrmatized his kind b with an accusation like this ! And why has Dr. Dewey put it forth ? Has inspiration taught him to paint this repulsive picture of all who cordially imbue their minds with the great truth he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he constrained by that conviction of its absolute necessity to human salvation , which alone calls forth the believer 's melancholy and reluctant statements ? No ; there is no such necessity upon him . Is it in the heat of debate that he has given utterance to these cutting and bitter words ? No ; it is from the calm solitude of his study , and with the nicest touches of his art upon them , that he sends them forth , upon a cool calculation of the advantage they may bring to the interests of the party for which he pleads . And what has Calvinism done that it should be deemed the fit object of these reproaches ? Let the inquiry be understood , for it is not the Calvinism of election and the saints ' perseverance that he here attacks , but that which maintains the entire depravity of mankind and the endless retributions of eternity ; what we say has this system done , that of all the superstitions which have disgraced humanity , this should be singled out for the very palm of infamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in bile and blood " - that it is some malignant system , breathing pestilence *vhithersoever it comes-one before which all the elements of human happiness wither and die-one whose adherents have testified no kind attachments , manifested no glowing zeal for the good of their race , and borne no share in the sufferings and achievements to which liberty and civilization and religion have been indebted . Dr. D. himself asks the question , " What has Calvinism done ? Into what literature has it ever breathed its spirit ? What poem has it ever written , but Pollock 's Course of Time ? What philosophy but Dr. Wardlaw 's ? into what reveries of genius but those of Bunyan has it ever breathed its soul * " We will tell Dr. Dewey . What literature ? The noblest religious literature which the earth containsworks of devotion , more than we can name , which shall be cherished while the earth stands . What poetry ? The whole religious poetry of the language bears the impress , and far the larger part of it the names of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian philosophy in the language which is worthy the name-works of philosophical theology which from Calvin 's days to those of Dwight and Chalmers , have taken rank at the head of the philosophical thinking of Christendom -- works which with all their imperfections will hold that rank , till others from the same source shall surpass them . But such as these are not its highest exploits . It is to moral achievements that it owes its chief renown . It has inspired a heroic endurance which challenges everlasting remembrance . Heaven seems to have found no sterner , truer band , to whom to entrust the post of danger and of glory . Laud and Graham of Claverhouse , Mary and the Ninth // Charles and Alva , whose are the sufferings and the heroism which these names recall ? This western shore , for religious freedom and religious power , the glory of all lands , to whose indomitable love of freedom and of truth does it owe the glorious career it is but beginning to run ? To whose faith did approving heaven vouchsafe that sublimest conception of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness the future home of civilization , hither through all peril , to bear the seeds of liberty and piety for all the generations ? And in our own day , whose charity that " never faileth , " is bearing abroad the everlasting Gospel ? Whose love is it that has consented to share each privation , each hardship , each peril under which nature can subsist ? Whose noble contempt of danger has braved and tamed the cannibal ferocity of savage tribes , confronted the capricious tyranny of Indian despots , and penetrated through sands and snows , where the foot of civilized man had never trod , in the heavenly purpose " to seek and to save that which was lost ? " What system is that which leaning on the very arm of the Almighty , has made its way into every haunt of heathenism , and reared , all unconscious of the glory which was gathering over it , in all lands which encompass the earth , monuments of its attachment to the human soul , to the truth , to the kingdom of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds have shed a new luster upon the Gospel itself , are not the " consistent votaries** of Calvinism . Naught else under heaven than these views of the utter depravity and hopelessness of mankind , ever nerved the fortitude of manly piety and the tenderness of woman 's love , for this work of love . We might retort this inquiry . We might ask what are the deeds of Unitarian benevolence , that it should feel entitled to take us thus to task ; but we forbear . Trophies like these need no contrast to heighten them , and we spare Dr. De*vey the humiliation of a reply to any inquiry for the achievements of Uiiitarian heroism and devotion . These are the works  --  and human history records none nobler-into which our system has " breathed its spirit ; " we bid Dr. D. look at them , as the wide world is learning to do , and blush to remember , what we feel with pride we can afford to forget , that he has suffered himself invidiously to ask what Calvinism has done in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his race ? With our author 's views of depravity , his idea of conversion maintains a melancholy consistency . lie not only doubts the reality , but he denies the possibility , of any sudden change in the essentials of character . He admits indeed that " religion has a beginning , " and that there are great " epochs " of improvement which mark its progress ; but the possibility of any thing like a den and radical change ( if character , such as the current theolo*y insists upon , he utterly denies . " No change of the inward mind and character can be sudden . The very laws of the mind forbid it . " Let us test this alledged impossibility . A company of profane and intemperate men , hardened by years of dissipation against all healthftil influence from without , are led by some unusual course of their own thoughts , to forswear for all coming life the base appetite which has enslaved them ; and go from their accustomed haunt of vice , never again to gratify by one moment 's indulgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rphe spendthrift whose debaucheries have at length exhausted his estate , sits in unwonted thoughtfulness for hours , and rises from his meditations , strong in purposes which control and supplant each previous impulse of his being . On the very lowest account // of f cts like these , we must see in them , an absolute and sudden victory over some of the strongest impulses which form the character ; and even supposing them to be but changes from the control of one sin or passion to that of another , yet if impulses erroneous and false , can so subdue and change the habits and passions of all previous life , what may not be hoped for from truth and wisdom , in the hands of omnipotence and love ? Why then is it to be deemed a thins impossible , that grace from on high should suddenly work even a rudical and entire change of character ? But the rashness of this assertion rises even to recklessness , when we compare it with the unquestionable facts of the Gospel history . What was Paul 's conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character ? " Or will it be maintained that the Apostle was " inwardly " the same persecuting bigot after that event that he was before ? And who needs to be rem*ndcd that Christianity has achieved similar triu rap hs in every year of its existence since ? XVho that has read the narrative of a conversion like that of Col. Gardiner , or the early history of Methodism , or the religious history of our own country , needs any argument for the possibility of radical and sudden changes of character ? Erroneous however as the postion is that we are controverting , one truth it may well be supposed to convey to us . Dr. P. could never have maintained the impossibility of such results , had he ever witnessed them . Had he ever known in his familiar ministrations , the sensual and profligate mind suddenly arrested , subdued , purified by the doctrine which it was his work to unfold-had he seen the vain and thoughtless spirit , suddenly awed into a seriousness deep and permanent-had he ever beheld a man who delighted in expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensnaring youth and Seducing innocence , changed at once into a soul breathing only penitence and self-abasement , no sophistry could have blinded his mind to these signal attestations of the power of his faith . Let him not then be surprised if the evangelical body should find in an argument like this , confirmation of all its previous *onvictions of the inefliciency and *vorthlessness of his system ; and should on the strength of these concessions , pronounce it utterly alien from that gospel , which every age has proved to be " the power of God unto salvation . " The religion which this work enforces , and the skepticism which it repels , would amply repay examination . They indicate , the one in theory , and the other in practice , defects of the most serious nature . All religious philosophy which is not absolutely perfect , has its opposite tendencies , its points of repulsion as well as of attraction , and stands in relation to unbelief as well as to faith . The type therefore of unbelief against which any religious system contends , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the superstitions of th' papal church are by almost all Protestant writers alledged to tend powerfully toward infidelity , and even atheism ; and Unitarians have not been slow to adduce similar results from the errors of the orthodox faith . But the skepticism against which Dr. Dewey contends , is little else than the most cheerless and wretched negation even of immortality itself . Yet of this abandoned scheme he says , with a tenderness which contrasts strangely and significantly with his bitter reprobation of Calvinism , " I do not wish to speak harshly . " On the edge of this dismal abyss he assumes his position , and courteously contends with this grim skeleton of unbelief ; that God and immortality are realities ; or at least if some doubts do necessarily mingle with our faith in them , doubting is ever a salutary process , // and meanwhile it is far more reasonable to believe than to deny . But defective as are his views of religious philosaphy , his exhibition of practical religion seems yet more so . He seems resolved on cutting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective influence ,  --  from all those modes of action which afford it the most profita* ble culture . Religion is in his view of it , wholly subjective ; it has no great and sublime relations to any out of the mind itself . Personal elevation and dignity of no inferior kind indeed , still , merely personal , is all that he enforces with any earnestness . Do not be a bigot , or a hypocrite ; do not dwell in sottishness or vice ; remember your immortal nature and do for heaven 's sake be something generous-this seems the whole burden of his exhortation . Without doubting the truth or the importance of this scheme of instruction , we must yet question whether all that human natare calls for , and all that the word of God supplies , will come within the compass of this . It is destitute of all the elements which are most powerful to move our moral nature . We can not barter for this the system which presents as the grand objects of religious thought , the attributes , the character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the boundless love and tenderness of our divine Redeemer , and the reclaiming and renewing grace of the Holy One-love and grace which are able to subdue more of human sinfulness than Dr. D. is able to believe in . Still less can we accept the teaching which declares , that " brotherly love and hope and faith derive from the circumstances of the early age , a prominence and peculiarity which ought since to have passed away ; " which instead of enforcing with all emphasis the earnest study of the heavenly word , tells us that this " formal and forced perusal of obscure chapters with a sort of demure reverence tends to throw dullness and doubt and obscurity over all our conceptions of religion ; " which discourages all personal religious effort as calculated only to " distress and terrify " men , and as " planting in the mind the seeds of superstition which a whole life often is riot sufficient to eradicate ; " and which quotes only to stigmatize as " odious and offensive freedoms of speech , " the simple and modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christ " precious . " We offer no comment in terms of pious horror upon these pregnant and promising statements ; we utter no " sepulchral toacs of awe and lamentation . " They might check Dr. Dewey in the wholesome work to which he has put his hand ; and we would have him by all means carry it on . Let him show how many Christian affections he can repudiate-upon how much of Chris . tian effort he can cast reproachupon how much of the language and the sentiment of the Bible he can pour contempt . It will he a salutary disclosure . When the popular mind shall come to understand , that Unitarianism esteems " brotherly love and hope and faith " as obsolete , that system will be itself far on the way to the oblivion to which it is destined . Let it proclaim the idea that while " the most abandoned of men only ( ! ) make vice odious , " parental faithfulness " makes virtue so ; " and it will instantly be spurned as an outrage upon all that binds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent personal attachment to Christ , fanciful and visionary , and the humble and scriptural expression of it , " odious and offensive , " and we can not for one moment doubt , that when all this is fully tiaderstood , whatever piety may exist among men , will pronounce its philosophy a melancholy delusion , and its Christianity a melancholy abandonment of all that is peculiar and all that is precious in the Gospel of our salvation.
