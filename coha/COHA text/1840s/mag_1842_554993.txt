txt IN the course of the past winter , an important and radical change in the system of studies pursued in Harvard College , which had been proposed by the President and Fellows , received the final sanction of the Board of Overseers . We have understood that the alteration was also approved , though informally , by the Professors and Tutors , who compose what is called the Faculty of the institution . The pamphlets before us relate to the action of the Corporation and the Board of Overseers . Two of them were printed for the use of the Board , and the third , the " Remarks " by the President , was published a few days before the final decision by the Overseers , and was addressed to them with a view of facilitating and influencing that decision , and not to the community at large with the intention of informing or guiding public opinion upon the subject . We can not disguise our regret , that a greater publicity was not given to the proceeding . It is true , that the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' *ting in the Senate Chamber the year before , and at this last session it was publicly discussed for two days in the same place . But the affair was hardly mentioned in the public journals ; and the President 's pamphlet , the only one that has been published having any relation to the subject , though it appeared for a few days on the counters of the booksellers , was seen by very few except those to whom it was particularly addressed . Many of the alumni and other friends to the College heard of the new system of studies for the first time , several months after it had been in operation . Yet the new plan is not merely a change in the details of instruction , but a virtual abandonment of that whole scheme of a liberal education , upon which the College has acted ever since its establishment . As such , we conceive that it ought not to pass without being fully brought to the notice , not merely of the friends of this particular institution , but of all who watch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . The leading principles of the new system appear in the following resolutions , which were submitted by the Corporation to the Board of Overseers . Resolved , 1 . That every Student who has completed , during the Freshman year , the studies required by the laws of the University , in the Greek and Latin Departments for that year , and shall have passed a satisfactory examination in them , and shall be recommended by the Examining Committee and his Instructors for the privilege of election in such branch , respectively may discontinue the study of either or both branches , at the end of the Freshman year , at the written request of his parent , or guardian ( if under age ) , made with a full knowledge of his standing as a scholar , in each branch respectively , of the future studies in each department , and of those to be substituted for them . " Resolved , 2 . That those Students , who continue in the study of either or both branches after the commencement of the Sophomore year , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to continue through the Sophomore and Junior years ; - the second course to extend through the Senior year , and particularly designed for those who wish to become accomplished scholars , or to qualify themselves thoroughly to instruct in classical schools and colleges . " Resolved , 3 . That those who pursue the first or second course , in either department , shall receive in addition to the // usual diploma , a special certificate expressing the studies each has respectively pursued . " Resolved , 4 . That those Students who discontinue the study of Greek or Latin , shall choose as a substitute one or more of the following branches ; - Natural History ; Civil History ; Chemistry ; Geology ; Geography and the Use of Globes ; Popular Astronomy ; Modern Languages ; Modern Oriental Literature ; or studies in either Greek or Latin , which may not have been discontinued , in addition to the prescribed course in such branch . The times and order of these studies will depend on the convenience of the Instructors , and the decision of the Faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a number of studies as shall , in the judgment of the Faculty , be sufficient reasonably to occupy his whole time . " Resolved , 5 . That those Students who have not at the commencement of the Sophomore year , completed the Greek or Latin studies required in the Freshman year , will be allowed the same choice with the others as to their regular studies . But in addition to these regular studies , and in place of a voluntary study , which in this case will not be allowed , they shall , unless excused by a special vote of the Faculty , continue the Greek or Latin in which they are deficient , until they have completed those required in the Freshman year . - Report , &amp;c. pp. 5 , 6 . From the following report , made by the President to the Corporation , it appears that the study of Latin and Greek has only shared the fate which that of pure mathematics underwent a year before . " At a meeting of the President and Fellows of Harvard College , held August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of changes made in the Mathematical Department , by virtue of the vote passed on the 26th of May , 1838 , - respectfully reports ; " That the liberty to discontinue the subject of the Mathematics at the end of the Freshman year has been found highly acceptable to both the Students and their parents , and been attended thus far with none of the ill consequences anticipated ; few or none qualified to make any important proficiency in the Mathematics , having , it is believed , discontinued altogether ; and , from the numbers who chose the second and the highest course , there is reason to conclude , that the election which has been given , has had a direct tendency to encourage those capable of profiting by the study of that branch , to pur // sue it , and to stimulate those , who possess decided mathematical talents , to aim at acquiring a knowledge of its most abstruse and difficult parts . In a class of fifty-five , only eight discontinued the study of Mathematics , and of the remaining forty-seven , thirty-two took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve the third course , during the first term . In the second term , the class being reduced to forty-eight by discipline and taking up connexions , six only discontinued the study , and of the remaining forty-two , twenty-seven took the first course , four the second course , and eleven the third course . The result is considered by the head of that department , as proving most decidedly the superiority of the voluntary system , and the practicability of adapting different courses of instruction to different classes of students , and as being in a high degree satisfactory and successful , and as promising great advantages by the new opportunity the elective system offers , of introducing improvements in the details of instruction . " The success of this experiment on the effect of the elective system of study in the Mathematical Department , has revived the wish of those friendly to its introduction into the other departments , and particularly into those of Greek and Latin . Both the Professors in these departments have expressed their concurrence in such a change , and their opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these branches , than to lower and reduce them . " In conforming with these views , the President respectfully submits a series of Resolutions , founded upon the same general principles heretofore adopted in relation to the Mathematical Department , for the consideration of this Board . " - Report , &amp;c. pp. 4 , 5 . The magnitude of these changes can be understood only by knowing how much time and attention were given to these branches under the old system . The study of pure mathematics was formerly pursued during the Freshman arid Sophomore years , at the rate of five exercises a week for the first year , and four exercises a week for the second . Now , any student who sees fit , and who can obtain , if under age , the permission of his parent or guardian , may discontinue the study in this department at the end of the Freshman year , and give up thereby nearly one half of the amount of mathematical knowledge , which was formerly requisite for a degree . The study of the ancient languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undergraduate course ; it // may now , at the option of the student , be cut short at the end of the first year . As the classical studies of the Sophomore and Junior years , owing to the pupil 's advanced state and increased facilities of learning , were of a higher order , and extended over far more ground in proportion to the time employed , than those of the preliminary and the Freshman course , we may fairly state , that the College does not now require more than one half the amount of classical learning , which was formerly deemed essential to a degree . The change , therefore , considered only in its immediate results , is one of a very sweeping character ; and the arguments by which it is supported , as we shall endeavour to show , really cover the whole ground , and , if they amount to any thing , justify an entire relinquishment , if the pupil pleases , of the three great branches of study , the pursuit of which is already so naterially abridged . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a measure has been quietly introduced , which places the whole scheme of a college education on an entirely new foundation . We believe , that this change has grown out of the earnest desire entertained by the managers of the College , that the institution should not lag behind the opinions and improvements of the day . No bigoted attachment to old forms and methods has been permitted , of late years , to fetter the progress of this ancient seminary of learning . Its halls , designed for active studies , have never been made the retreats of learned indolence ; and a fresh zeal for reform has of late rendered them the theatre of changes , quite as numerous as are consistent with prudence and due deliberation . Though our higher institutions of learning do not require so frequent alterations , as are necessary for the common schools and inferior seminaries , to keep them adapted to the increasing population and shifting manners of a new country , yet they can not go on in the beaten track of centuries , without soon finding their influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harvard College seem to be fully aware of this truth ; and enlarged means of instruction , improved discipline , and a rising standard of scholarship , attest the practical success of their endeavours to keep pace with the spirit of the times . While engaged in such a career , experiments must be made . The effect of new plans of education can not always be made to appear from antecedent // reasoning ; it must be ascertained from experience . The College has shown no reluctance to make trials , and no unwillingness to retrace its steps , when the results have been unfavorable . We consider the present introduction of the Voluntary System in the studies of mathematics , Latin , and Greek , as one of these experiments , and we believe that the scheme will be abandoned , as readily as it was taken up , if the issue should prove that the change is inexpedient . Having said thus much , we have no hesitation in avowing disbelief of the expediency of this measure , and entire dissatisfaction with the arguments by which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what has just been remarked in favor of testing new plans by experience . Experiments are not to be made at undue cost . Their proper range is confined to those subjects , where the injury arising from a possible failure is far more than balanced by the good which will be obtained , if there should be a prosperous result . The trial should not be made on several objects at once , nor conducted in such a manner , that the injury arising from ill success should be in great part irreparable . The voluntary system might be more safely applied to the study of Latin and Greek , if the experience of more than one , or even two years , had proved its beneficial or harmless effects in the case of Mathematics . It might be tested with far less risk , than by applying it at once to each of the three great branches of learning , which the judgment and experience of centuries have approved as the only proper basis of a liberal education . In the estimation of many persons , a knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why not ascertain whether the great proportion of young students , if allowed their own choice , would not entirely abandon the study of the former language , before giving them an opportunity of throwing up the latter along with it ? Why not make the study , at first , optional only for the Junior year , instead of putting the Sophomore year along with it , and thus hazarding more than half the classical instruction , which is given in the whole college course ? There is an old adage about the experimentum in corpore viii , which the authors of such a plan might well keep in view . The College , indeed , considered as an aggregation of instructors and means of learning , has a continuous existence , and can at any time , without great loss , return to a position , // which it has injudiciously quitted . But , when viewed as a collection of students , preparing themselves for the duties of after life , the matter assumes a different aspect . A generation of undergraduates continues only four years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them a final and decisive measure . Its evil effects in their case can not be repaired , and , in the case of an unlucky experiment , they will have fair ground of complaint . Our readers will wish to know on what grounds this important step has been taken by the College . They are fully set forth in the pamphlets now before us , two of which are entirely devoted to an exposition and defence of the new system . In the remaining one , the Chairman of the Visiting Committee presents very briefly some considerations , which may be regarded in legal phrase as a caveat to the proposal of the Corporation . As our wish is to lay open the whole subject for discussion , we shall give as full a summary , as our limits will permit , of the arguments in favor of the scheme , and then endeavour to present some views , which may lead to a different conclusion . President Quincy 's " Remarks , " though evidently drawn up in haste , show the fruits of much reflection on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project , as its friends can desire . The Chairman of the select Committee , to whom the subject was referred by the Overseers , gives a brief but able argument in favor of the plan , considered from a somewhat different point of view . The President states , that " a desire to open the University to a larger class of persons , has long been the wish of the friends of the Institution , and is apparent in its laws . " He thinks , that " the amount of Greek and Latin , exacted as a condition of a degree , " prevents many parents from sending their sons to the College , because they regard such studies as a waste of time and labor . By a resolution passed sixteen years since , the College was opened to students not candidates for a degree , and they were permitted to choose such studies as they preferred , and to pursue them exclusively . But they could not in this way obtain a degree , and the certificate , which was offered them , of proficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclaimed . The plan failed in consequence , but few persons taking advantage of the opening . A prescribed course of classical studies , as a condition of receiving college honors , becomes // with many a student " a positive obstacle in the way of his joining the Institution ; and the benefits of its approved apparatus and of ' its eminent professors are , in consequence , confined to those , who coincide in opinion as to the benefits of such a course. ** It appears , therefore , that at least one of the objects held in view by the authors of the new system , is to increase the number of students in the College ; or , in other words , to render it more popular . It seems , that many will not join the institution , even with the privilege of selecting their own studies , unless they can obtain a degree . Therefore , give them a degree also , and in this way " open the University to a larger class of persons . " It is further urged , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of classical learning at Cambridge , will be to elevate it , " to make it more thorough , general , exact , and profound . " No real standard of scholarship , it is said , has ever existed at Cambridge , or , as far as known , at any other college in this country . One can be created only by confining the appropriate honors to those who have successfully passed through the ordeal of a searching examination . Such a trial is the only test of ' scholarship , and without it no standard exists , that is not " fictitious , formal , or imaginary . " The means of classical studies may be increased , and more time and labor be expended upon them ; hut , so long as the diplomas are all couched in the same terms , so long as no distinction is made between those who have used these advantages and those who have neglected them , no real test or criterion of scholarship exists . By the new system , a positive standard will be created ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be accompanied with special certificates , stating what voluntary studies he has pursued , and what proficiency he has made in each , as determined by a thorough and searching examination . But the question immediately occurs , Why not convert the ordinary College diploma into such a test of scholarship , by granting it to those only who are able to pass the strictest ordeal , which the instructors may choose to devise ? The answer is very briefly given , - that the authorities of the College have " never dared " to take such a decisive step . It is said , that the friends of classical learning are not so nunerous in the community as its opponents ; that the latter // form an influential , wealthy , and popular class , whose " countenance and patronage are all essential to the support of such institutions . " To make a thorough examination in these studies the criterion of a degree , would be to " deprive the seminary of one third , if not one half , of every graduating class ; and to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would be unwise and improper to make the only certificate of having received a college education depend on a greater proficiency in some branch of learning , than what most of the intelligent and influential minds in the country deem necessary or useful . If those who will study Latin and Greek only by compulsion are permitted to quit the unprofitable task , the willing and ambitious students will he relieved from a serious hinderance to their progress , while the whole time and attention of the instructors will be given to those who can make a proper use of such advantages . Even those who leave the classical department at the end of the Freshman year , it is expected , will apply themselves with fresh ardor and diligence , in view of a strict examination which they must pass , before they will he permitted to make a bonfire of the hated grammars and dictionaries . As to the question , who should continue , and who be permitted to resign these pursuits , it is thought that parents and guardians can decide better than the College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wards , and are most interested in their making a judicious choice . And there is no reason to apprehend , that a large portion of each class will take advantage of this offer , and leave an unpopular department . On this point , we quote the President 's own language , with some of his concluding remarks . There are principles existing in human nature , and in the relations of college life , which are conservative of the affection for the classics , and which you can no more generally eradicate , than you can annihilate emulation , pride , love of distinction , taste , and the desire of acquaintance with the eminent men and works of every age . The result of the experiment in the Mathematics is conclusive , it is apprehended , on this point . Of all studies in the College , none is so unpopular as this . The Professor of Mathematics thought , previous to the experiment , that one half of each class might quit that study . In fact , in a class of fifty-four , only seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any great number to join the third course , extending // through the four College years , that he anticipated only one . Whereas thirteen took the highest course . And the consequence is , that a greater number of individuals more highly instructed in that branch will be now sent from the College , than were ever seat heretofore . " The repugnance to the learned languages is much less than to the mathematics , and the inducement to their study far greater ; so that the apprehension of an alarming defection may be considered as in a great degree unfounded . " There is also an undefined apprehension that the permission of any portion of a class to quit Latin and Greek at the end of the Freshman year , will have a tendency to lower the estimate of the value of those languages in the community that no more will be required in other colleges , where the examinations will be only formal ; and that the amount of classical attainment will be thus essentially diminished . But the estimate of the importance of classical learning does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligent minds in the community . " Now , if these minds are satisfied that the object and tendency of the new system is to elevate , and not to depress ; to introduce more thorough and exact attainment , and to make the knowledge of the classics more profound ; they will find that their prejudices in favor of those languages are sustained , and not opposed , and the end they earnestly desire advanced . " As to the character of a college , it depends , like the character of an individual , upon what it does , - upon its actions , - its effects . Now a college which should send forth only two thirds , or even one half of its graduates , thoroughly educated by a known and seen standard , by which they were faithfully tried , and rejected if found wanting , and if approved receive the appropriate honor , will do more for the cause of classical learning , than twenty colleges which send forth all their members tried by no standard , without any evidence of attainment , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have done is a matter of faith , and not of sight . " - Remarks , &amp;c. pp. 17- 19 . The Chairman of the Committee , to whom this subject was referred by the Overseers , welcomes the new system , because it evinces that a principle of progress and improvement exists within the College . The principal advantage expected from the measure is , that it will enable each student , soon after he enters college , to select and pursue his studies with a view to his chosen profession and his probable destination in life . This period is not thought too early for making // such a choice , and the selection may be made by the pupil and his parents better than by his instructors . When the boy can see the direct connexion between his present pursuits and his future employments , - his business for life , - he will study under a fresh stimulus . He will at any rate exert himself to more purpose in the branches which he himself has chosen , than in the tasks imposed upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obstacle and a discouragement to the progress of others . It is said , that the effect of the new system will be to change the College into a University , a consummation of which its friends have always been greatly desirous . The leading idea in this plan is declared to be coincident with the great principle of the University system that no attempt should be made to induce all students to pursue the same branches , or to follow each study to the same degree of advancement . The character and value of the College diploma will be improved . It will tell , not what the individual has professed , but what he has done , during the four years of his undergraduate life . Such is a brief synopsis of the arguments , by which this new application of the Voluntary System to College studies is supported . To give some idea of the details of the plan , and of the manner of carrying it into effect , we subjoin in part the rules adopted by the Faculty soon after the decision by the Overseers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their Prescribed studies shall be Mathematics , Greek , Latin , and History . " 2d . The Prescribed studies during the Sophomore year shall be English Grammar and Composition , Rhetoric and Declamation , one Modern Language , and history . The Elective studies shall be Mathematics , Greek , Latin , Natural History , Civil History , Chemistry , Geology , Geography , the Use of the Globes , or any Modern Language ; so far as the means of such instruction are within the resources of the University . " 3d . The Prescribed studies during the Junior year shall be English Composition , one Modern Language , Logic , Declamation , Physics , Psychology , Ethics , Forensics , and History . The Elective studies shall be a more extended course in Psychology and Ethics , and any of the elective studies above enumerated . " 4th . The Prescribed studies during the Senior year shall // be Rhetoric , English Composition , Political Economy , Constitutional Law , Forensics , Theology , History , and Declamation . The Elective studies shall be Political Ethics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elective studies above enumerated . " 5th . Four weeks at least before the close of the Second Term , every student shall make a written statement to the Faculty of the elective studies he wishes to pursue the following year ; accompanied , if he be under age , by an application from his parent or guardian ; it being understood that the branches elected shall be sufficient with the prescribed studies in the opinion of the Faculty to occupy his time ; and the arrangement thereupon made shall be binding for one year . " 8th . The extension of the Elective privilege , herein provided for , makes necessary some change in the principle and mode of the assignment of parts at Commencement , - which shall be as follows . From two thirds of the Students of the Class which is to graduate , who are marked the highest , twelve shall be selected , according to their rank in Themes , Forensics , and Elocution , to whom shall be assigned Exercises in English Composition . From the same two thirds four students shall be selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proficiency in those languages ; two Exercises to be in each language , one of which shall be the Salutatory Oration . The performances , with the exception of the Salutatory and Valedictory Orations shall have no discriminating titles , and none shall take more than ten minutes in speaking . They shall be single parts and arranged in an order to be determined at each assignment . The same rule shall be applied to the distribution of parts at Exhibitions , so far as is practicable . " 9th . To the end that precise information of the standing of Students may be given , the names of not more than ten of the highest Students of the graduating class , in each department , shall be published in a tabular form with the order of Exercises at Commencement ; of whom the three highest shall be numbered one , and the remainder shall be numbered two . The aggregate rank of the above Students , being the result of the whole College course , shall also be published . " In the estimation of most persons , this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prospects of classical learning in this country . In the vicinity of Harvard College , at least , it derives additional importance from its bearing on the character and future position of that institution . The friends of sound learning and of an enlarged and // liberal scheme of college education have always rested their hopes on this time-hallowed seminary . Its age and rich endowments , - rich at least in comparison with other American colleges , - its numerous professorships and abundant means of illustrating the different sciences , its excellent library , and above all the characters of the men to whom are intrusted the management of its concerns , all gave good reason to hope , that the interests of letters and scholarship in this country would here be cherished , and so directed as to affect most widely and permanently the national character . From its independent position , it was thought , that , far from truckling to the spirit of the times , it might aspire to guide and elevate this spirit . It was created in order to influence , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Such indeed is the nature of ' every college , that deserves the name . It teaches the teachers . It guides those whose future office will be to guide others . It sends forth the men who are to enlarge the domain of science and learning , who alone will be capable of appreciating high literary and scientific effort . Of course , there are numerous exceptions ; for the self.taught , especially in this country , have often done more in scientific discovery , sometimes also in the sphere of scholarship and recondite studies , than those who are said to be liberally educated . The raw recruit has sometimes beaten the trained soldier . But , for all that , it would be no mark oC prudence in a country , to do without an organized and disciplined force altogether , and to trust its defence entirely to " citizen-soldiers . " Just so in the struggles and conquests of science , in vigorous efforts made for the advancement of learning . We want our trained bands , as well as the irregular volunteers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colleges are instituted for this purpose , to rear up a small number , whose duty and privilege it will be to lead the way in many noble enterprises , to be the first to discover , promulgate , and defend the truth . Such is the theory of these institutions , at any rate , however ill they may have performed their office . Their vocation is to foster liberal studies , to keep up departments of knowledge , which would otherwise decay and die out , for it is not worth the while for the mass of the community to attend to them . It is not necessary , for instance , that the bulk of any Christian people should be acquainted with the Hebrew Ianguage ; // but it is very much for the interests of such a people , that a few among them should be able to read the primitive records of their faith in the original tongue . To seek to render the education given in colleges too practical , to adapt it too closely to the wants and opinions of the whole people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times , is wholly to mistake the object and appointed limits of these seminaries . It is to place them on the same footing with common schools . We do not say , to degrade them to the same level , because here is no question about rank or precedence . The difference is simply one of function . That large numbers now receive a college or university education is a fact , that may seem to contradict this theory . When considered by itself , it must be admitted , the number is large , and we are glad that it is so . But when viewed in reference to the whole population , when compared with the millions who receive only a school education , the number appears very small . Our position is , that the managers of these higher seminaries have no right to alter the quality or the quantity of the instruction given , for the mere purpose of increasing the number of pupils . The object of colleges and universities is , to give the best possible education to a few . The object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good education to the greatest possible number . We are ashamed to dwell on such obvious considerations ; but the whole gist of the question about the new plan of studies in the College depends upon them . Hitherto , it has been the boast of Harvard College , and the leading principle of its management , to raise the standard of scholarship in the country ; to increase the accuracy and the extent of the studies , which go to make up what is called a liberal education . And its efforts in this way have been eminently successful . The requisitions for admission to the Seminary have gone on constantly increasing of late years . The examinations at entrance have become more severe ; a greater amount of preparatory studies is required , and greater thoroughness in those which were exacted before . Take the department of Greek , for instance . Students are now required , on admission , to write Greek prose with tolerable correctness , a point to which no attention was paid , even during the undergraduate course , till within ten years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be required // after the next Commencement , and the quantity and difficulty of the extracts therein given will take six months more of study , than the manual by Jacobs , which is now in use . The studies after admission have been increased in a still greater ratio . New professorships have been established , and the range of former ones has been widely increased . Till very recently Civil History was hardly studied at all in the College . Now a course in it extends through the whole four years . Several branches of Natural History are taught , which were formerly neglected altogether . In fact , it would be easy to go through every department of instruction , and show a large increase of means and requisitions , that has taken place within a short period . Certainly , the effect of all these measures has riot been to enlarge the number of undergraduates . Such a result was probably not contemplated by the movers of the improvements . The principal , if not the sole , object with them , was to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labors have been most effectual . With this view of the past conduct of the institution , and this opinion respecting its legitimate objects , many of its friends saw with regret a resolution suddenly proposed , and hastily passed , for effecting a radical change in the course of studies ; a measure avowedly supported , in great part , on the ground of its being a necessary concession to the belief of many persons , who do not perceive the practical utility of certain branches of instruction , and wish to see others substituted for them . We say , supported in great part on this ground ; for , though the author of the " Remarks argues at great length to show , that the results of this step will not be injurious , but rather beneficial , to the classical studies in the College , it is easy to see , that this consideration was a secondary one , and is now brought forward not as the oriainal object of the measure , but in order to excuse and palliate it . The intent of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Remarks ; to obtain the good will of a large class in the community , whose " countenance and patronage are all essential to the support ' * of the College , and who hold it a mere waste of time and labor for anybody to study Latin and Greek . In the remainder of the pamphlet , which is occupied with the argument to prove , that classical studies will be more effectually pursued and to a // greater extent on the voluntary system , than on the one previously in use , we can not hut consider the writer as endeavouring to convince himself , and as not succeeding very well in the task either . But , with the friends of classical learning , the whole question hinges upon this point , and we shall therefore briefly examine the reasoning and the facts , and endeavour to show why they are not conclusive . The advantages of the new plan of classical studies must be tried in comparison with the one which existed in the College a year or two since , and which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " Remarks , " nor in the " Report " of the committee , is there any allusion to the system of dividing the classes into three sections according to proficiency , the study of Latin and Greek being carried on in each section independently of the others . Nor was this subject mentioned in the discussion before the Overseers , so far as we have heard ; though it is easy to show , that all the advantages now claimed exclusively for the voluntary system belong also to this arrangement , and were actually experienced under its operation . On their admission to the College , the previous attainments of all the pupils being ascertained by the preliminary examination , they were arranged in three divisions , and instruction was given separately to each , their tasks being proportioned to their abilities . As often as there appeared occasion , individuals were transferred from one section to another , and thus pupils of equal diligence and ability were constantly classed together . This plan was introduced about eight years since , and was continued in force with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . It excited no discontent ; it removed all impediment to the progress of the willing and the ambitious ; it saved others from being dragged forward with a rapidity beyond their strength or inclination ; and it supplied a fresh stimulus to exertion in the prospect of being advanced to a higher section . An incidental advantage was perceptible in its effect upon the schools and academies , where students are fitted for college . Instructors saw that their reputation was at stake in securing for their respective pupils , not only free admission , but such a place in the divisions of the class , as evinced the comparative exactitude and completeness of their preparatory studies . It is in view of this good effect , probably , that the system is still retained as to the Freshman class . About two // years since it was given up as to the Sophomores and Juniors , to make way for still another plan , by which , the whole class appearing together at the exercise , and remaining there for a longer time , an opportunity was afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus uniting the advantages of a lecture with those of a simple recitation . We would call attention , in passing , to the fact , which appears from these statements , that the voluntary system now introduced makes the third important change in the mode of pursuing classical studies , that has been introduced into the College within eight years . We hope those persons , who are so anxious after reform and progress in our systems of education , will see in this fact some evidence , that the College is disposed " to prove all things , " as well as to " hold fast that which is good . " For ourselves , having perfect confidence in the watchfulness and intelligence of the managers of the institution , and heing satisfied of their anxiety to keep pace with all the improvements of the day , we will merely hint , that too frequent alterations may do harm , as some confusion is always incident to their introduction , and the possibility ol an evil result is enough to outweigh the prospect of a slight good . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in which it is attempted to prove , that the volsuntary system is an improvement upon the one formerly in use , in respect even to the effect upon the study of Latin and Greek , so that the cause of classical learning will not be injured , but benefited by its introduction . Now , it is apparent , on the slightest consideration , that every one of the assumed beneficial effects , in this respect , of the new measure took place equally under the previous scheme , - that of division according to proficiency . Able students were not kept hack , feeble or indolent ones were not goaded on beyond their strength . Certificates might have been offered , - we believe they were , - that the pupil had belonged to the advanced sections , and had pursued his studies to the furthest possible limit . Indeed , all the machinery , if it may so be called , of the new plan , - the rigid and prolonged examinations , the different certificates given , the variation in form of the usual College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the student , - is no necessary adjunct of the voluntary system , more than of any other . It is all appli // cable to the former arrangement ; - a large portion of it was actually thus applied . The examinations on the second plan above described , - that whereby the whole class appeared together at the exercise , - were made as severe and complete , as we believe to be practicable . They extended through several days ; they were conducted both orally and in writing ; the committee and the instructors took part in the work . To do more than this would be to worry both students and examiners with an interminable and intolerable task . In short , the only essential difference between the voluntary system and those formerly in use consists in the permission accorded by the new scheme , to any student who sees fit , to quit the department altogether . It behoves those who makd the assertion we are now considering , - that the classical standard of the College will be elevated by this change , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because his companion makes no progress at all . In order that A and B may become better scholars , it is not necessary that C and D should give up study altogether . If they recited togethei* , if they were compelled to advance pan passu , there would be some truth in the assertion . But this course is not necessary , and was not adopted in the unexceptionable plan , which existed in the College for several years . That the instructor will be enabled to bestow more time and attention on the able aud industrious scholars , if released from the charge of the feeble and the indolent , is certainly true . But we presume that this argument will not be pressed by the favorers of the plan , because it would be equally cogent in favor of a great extension of the system . It would prove , that one or two of the ablest pupils in each department should be selected , and all the means of the College be applied for their benefit , leaving the remainder of the class to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for the execution of their duties , their number should be increased . If the funds of the College will not admit of this , then the benefit of their instruction shoiild be divided equally as far as it goes . So long as the institution retains any pupil in its embrace , it is bound to give him a full share of the advantages of the place . If his capacity be limited , and his application small , even more pains should be taken to make up for his deficiencies . Others will get on with less help . // Much is said of a classical " standard " in the " Remarks . " We do not perceive any justness in the applica tion of the term . By a college aandard in any study , we understand the average degree of proficiency attained by the students in this particular branch . If any pupil fails to reach this point , he is said to fall below the standard , and becomes subject to censure , or may be removed from the institution . Hence we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater or less attainments , which the College absolutely requires . But , in the pamphlet before us , the word is used as indicating that evidence which a scholar gives of his attainments , hy passing a severe examination before he receives a degree . Therefore it is said , that no classical standard exists " in Harvard , nor , so far as is known , in any college of this country . " It is perfectly obvious , that " standard " is here confounded with the proof publicly given , that the standard has been attained . Such a use of the word is certainly allowable in the looseness of conversation , as when we speak of the patterns or models , made by Mr. Hassler for the American government , as being the standard of weights and measures ; though they are , in fact , only the tests by which ordinary instruments are tried , the actual standard of weights and measures being an abstract quantity . But this application of the word by the author of the " Remarks " covers the whole fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hitherto existed at Cambridge , and if one is to be created by this system , the change is surely advisable . But we mean hereby " a certain degree of proficiency , " which the student must attain before graduating ; otherwise the proposed alteration offers in this respect no advantage whatever . It is a matter of perfect indifference for the cause of sound learning , if the student has made great acquisitions , whether he manifests them publicly , by submitting to severe tests , or not . The knowledge he has gained will be equally beneficial both to the public and to himself , though he may not have displayed it just before Commencement to a board of examiners . Of course the author does not mean , that no degree of proficiency in classical studies has ever been attained " in Harvard , nor in any college of this country . " He means by " standard " nothing but the examination preparatory to receiving a degree , and as this could be instituted // quite as well on the old system as on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the argument lies . Only a portion of the class , it is true , will in this way be subjected to the test ; but on the former plan also , if deemed advisable , some of the students might be excused from the examination without allowing them to give up all the previous studies . Because a pupil has not made such good use of his time , as to be able to pass " a thorough , searching , individual examination , " it is no sign that he can not succeed in a less trying ordeal ; a fortiori , it is no reason why he should cease to study at all . And why should such peculiar importance he attributed to the examination before graduating ? Examinations have always been frequent in every department throughout the college course . " But success in them is not made the condition of receiving a degree . " It is virtually such a condition . If a student should fail entirely in several of these trials , and show thereby that he was wasting his time , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would not surely be allowed to remain in the class . His friends would be advised to remove him from the institution . Such a scrutiny indicating with sufficient correctness the standing of every member of the College , the Faculty can at any time determine what amount of idleness , what degree of incapacity , shall be deemed a proper cause for displacing an undergraduate , and thereby depriving him of his degree . Thus , it is the instructors ' own fault , if precisely such a " standard , " as is described in the " Remarks , " does not already exist at Cambridge . We repeat it , therefore , the only essential feature of the voluntary system is the permission accorded to every student who may see fit to do so , to give up at the end of the Freshman year the study of Latin , Greek , and Mathematics altogether . No advantage whatever can be claimed for this system but what consists in the simple fact , that a young man may now receive the usual college diploma , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the strength of one half the classical and mathematical knowledge which was formerly required for a degree . We are well aware , that the question about the expediency of the change , even under this form , is a debatable one , and that men of intelligence and sound judgment , after attentively considering it , may arrive at opposite conclusions . We are willing to join issue // on this point , and therefore have endeavoured to clear up the mist that surrounded the subject , and to show that the matter in dispute does not relate to one or another method of pursuing classical studies to the best advantage , but to the expediency of relinquishing these studies , either in part , or altogether . To do this , it was necessary to go somewhat into the details of college management and instruction ; but this hardly requires an apology , for even the minutiw of the system are not without interest to many persons more or less directly connected with such institutions , and to all who have at heart the welfare and progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classical studies is spoken of as the only effect of the voluntary system . And this is true for the present time . But , if the arrangement continue in force , the ultimate result will too probably be the abandonment of such studies altogether . Whatever arguments are adduced in the pamphlets before us , founded on the supposed practical inutility of Latin and Greek , and on the opposition made by many persons to the study of these languages , are even more cogent against wasting time in the acquisition of a mere smatteriiig of lore . If good classical scholars are not wanted in the community , poor ones are still less needed . If it be not worth while to read Livy and Tacitus , Horace and Juvenal , it is idle to study the Latin gramtnar . The parent may well complain , if his son is obliged to spend three or four years in fitting for college , by prosecuting studies which he may relinquish within one year after admission , when his knowledge of them is still so insufficient , that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation of a writ , or stumble through a chapter in the Greek Testament . It is surely unprofitable and vain to erect a scaffolding where we have no intention of building a house , - to sow grain which we are fully satisfied will not pay for reaping . And to acquire the mere elements of the learned languages , in order to fit one 's self for college , so far as they are concerned , is mere cellar-work and scaffolding . in schoolboy phrase , it is downright " digging . " The labor of the Freshman year , at the most , adds only the ground-floor of the structure . Only when near the close of the college course is a taste for classical pursuits usually formed , for then only the masterpieces of ancient genius , the odes of Horace , // the striking pages of Tacitus , the orations of Demosthenes , the poems of Homer , are read and understood . Then only the toil of " construing and parsing " becomes secondary to the application of the higher laws of criticism and taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thought . To stop short of this point is to throw away most of the previous labor . The concession to the opponents of such studies will be rightly deemed insufficient to purchase peace . In President Quincy 's own language , - " a principle of this kind will be attended with the common results of half-way measures . They neither satisfy the friends nor foes of classical learning . " We are aware , that this argument has a double edge . It may be urged , that , since the studies of an undergraduate must at any rate stop far short of thorough scholarship , there is no reason why he may not relinquish a particular pursuit as well at the end of the first , as of the third , year of his col* lege course . We may be asked , why not continue classical instruction throughout the Senior year , since the time and labor of scholars so far advanced must be bestowed proportionally to still greater advantage ? The answer is an obvious one . In the pursuit of every branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , the assistance of others , ceases to be necessary ; and , if the pupil chooses to go beyond it , he can do so suo . Marte , through the impetus acquired by previous training . The goal selected for the termination of the classical course , as we believe , was happily determined by the old plan at Cambridge . It was placed sufficiently far off . The pupil was required to read a portion , at least , of all the more distinguished Latin poets and historians . He was familiar with the style , if not with all the writings , of Cicero , Livy , and Tacitus , of Virgil , Horace , and Juvenal . Most of the students at the time of graduating , we presume , could read Latin prose with fluency , and the works of the poets without any exhausting effort . Their attainments in Greek were equally satisfactory , if we take into account the greater copiousness and difficulty of the language . They read large portions of Homer , several books of each of the three principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the training was carried so far , that at any subsequent period of life , if taste and leisure should prompt them to restime their classical studies , they might do // so with ease in retirement , without further aid than could be readily obtained from books . They were rendered independent of an instructor . An avaricious reckoning of time and labor , an extreme desire to economize for the benefit of other pursuits , might perhaps have withdrawn a single author or a few months of study from this course without material disadvantage . But to strike off two whole years , and those far the most important ones , would be fatal to the only object held in view from the very beginning , in such case , it would be better for the student , if he had never opened a Latin grammar , hut spent his time on something else . The voluntary system , therefore , if continued in force , must result in the entire abandonment of classical studies by every pupil , who , at this early period of life , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outset a repulsive task . Consistency requires this enlargement of the plan , for the cause and the arguments of every opponent of Latin and Greek will be strengthened hy the present concession . The choice must finally be offered to each student , not at the end of the Freshmen year , when he begins to find flowers upon the road , but at the very commencement of his acquaintance with the grammar and dictionary , when nothing but brambles and thickets lie before him . There can be little doubt which way his choice will be determined . But it is worth while to inquire , what will be the probable result , if the choice be offered at the time contemplated under the present arrangement ? How many students will probably leave the classical department , if they are permitted to do so at the end of the Freshman year ? The writer of the " Remarks " observes , that the study of Mathematics is the most " unpopular " in the College yet , when the option was presented , only seven students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The repugnance to the learned languages , " he goes on to say , " is much less than to the Mathematics , and the inducement to their study far greater ; " so that there is little fear of a great defection . These statements seem , indeed , to indicate a state of things , that makes the introduction of the voluntary system quite a superfluous measure . If more than seven eighths of each class study Latin and Greek from their own choice , it is obvious , that few persons will be propitiated hy a release from the injunction . But the experience which has been had , // since the publication of the " Remarks , " puts a different face upon the matter . The option in respect to Mathematics has now been offered to three classes successively , and each year a larger number than before has quitted that department . If the rate of increase continues the same , in about twelve years not one student will continue his Mathematical studies beyond the Freshman class . The experiment in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the choice was offered to two classes , the Freshman and the Sophomore . Of the latter class about one third quitted the department altogether . If the number continues to increase , and at the same ratio as in the Mathematical department , it is very obvious , that the number of volunteers in the study of the classics will soon be reduced to an indivisible quantity . And there is every reason to suppose , tl ) at it will thus increase . Classical learning has now for centuries been identified with the idea of a liberal education . It is hallowed by old associations , and academical distinctions seem in a great measure to be founded upon it . But every instance of a student graduating without passing through the old course contributes to weaken the spell ; and the establishment of a new set of college honors , entirely independent of the classical department , must soon destroy it altogether . Besides , the opportunity of selecting at will a substitute for the abandoned study from eight or ten branches of learning , - some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rather an agreeable relaxation , than a severe discipline of mind , - is flattering to youthful pride . The mere desire of change at the end of the Freshman year , during which a large portion of the time is devoted to the classics , will induce many students to leave the department , though at the end of a few months they may repent of their choice . From these combined causes , there can be little doubt , that in the course of a few years the study of Latin and Greek in the College will be in the same condition as that of Hebrew , which was once enjoined throughout the course , but was afterwards made voluntary , and is now pursued for a few months by about a half a dozen members of each class . The question before us , then , relates to nothing less than the entire abandonment of classical learning , - the rejection of the idea that it forms a necessary part of a liberal education . We can hardly believe , that the matter presented itself // under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken time for deliberation , and for allowing the subject to be discussed at large and in public , before they decided on a step of such vast importance . We see no call for the measure in the present tendency of opinions , nor in the circumstances of the times . There was a time , when the expediency of classical studies was attacked and defended with zeal , - when tl ) e matter was thoroughly examined under all its aspects . The pages of this Journal presented frequent and elaborate essays upon the subject . One of the smaller colleges , indeed , in Massachusetts , actually prepared a course of English education , and organized separate classes for those who wished to obtain the usual degree , but had not time or inclination to study Greek and Latin . But the experiment proved unsuccessful , and was abandoned within two years . The result of the discussion and the experiment , as we believe , was to satisfy the public , that the old course was the only safe and appropriate one . The matter was perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone could determine what course of studies was best calculated to effect that exact and thorough discipline of mind , that enlarged and generous cultivation of all the faculties , which afforded the only sure foundation for effort on the part of those who aspired after high professional eminence , or were ambitious to sustain the interests of literature and science for another generation . The judgment of those who had the direction of Harvard College was fixed upon this point , and the course of the institution was unwavering . The requisitions for admission went on constantly increasing ; the course of study was enlarged ; improved methods of instruction were introduced . These efforts , far from being censured by the community in general , were noticed with frequent commendation . Far from paving the way , by a gradual *vithdrawal of the injunction or by a diminution of the means of classical studies , towards a total relinquishment of them , every thing seemed to announce a determination on the part of the College to preserve and carry forward the standard of scholarship with the utmost speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . The friends of the cause , therefore , were not prepared for the announcement of a measure , by which the amount of classical knowledge required for a degree , was at once reduced to one half , and which must re // suit in the entire abandonment of this branch of learning . There was no pressure from without , and the lesser seminaries apparently had not thought of the change , when this , the oldest and best endowed literary institution in the country takes the decisive step , and , thereby , retraces its own path and undoes entirely its previous labors . It was like striking the flag in the citadel , before any of the outworks had surrendered . We have no wish to argue the cause of these studies for to whom can the argument be addressed , but to scholars , who already enjoy and appreciate the rich fruits of the labor of their youth , and with whom , consequently , it would be altogether superfluous ? Another and still larger class in the community , is cOfl ) pOsed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which they were themselves deprived in youth by the force of circumstances , and who therefore send them to college for the express purpose of having their studies selected and arranged , as well as proper instruction given . The question can not be mooted before such persons , for they acknowledge their incompetency to decide the point . Others look upon education only as a means of obtaining success in life , and with them the briefest and the most economical preparation , cceteris paribus , is the most satisfactory . They wish to perceive the practical utility of every branch of learning , and its direct connexion with the future employments , for which the individual is designed . General culture is a phrase that has no meaning to them ; or , if they acknowledge its importance , it is as a collateral advanta* , e , to be acquired by exercise in those studies , that are essential in the management of business , or to success in professional life . It is not an end , which merits pursuit for its own sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisest men may entertain them under peculiar circumstances , and it is the part of every individual to judge for himself , whether his own situation , or that of his son or ward , is such that it is necessary for him to be governed by these considerations . But we do say , that an education of this sort can not be obtained at college . Let such an individual 's destination in life be what it may , a college diploma is not essential before he can enter upon his course with freedom , and pursue it with success . He may become a merchant , lawyer , physician , or divine , in less time and at less cost , // than by spending four years within the walls of Harvard College , or of any other similar institution . If incompetency or ignorance within the sphere of his own calling is all that he fears , it is not unlikely that he will be surprised himself , after examination , to find how small an amount of preparation is necessary , before he can lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purposes which he has in view , and any attempt to make them conform to his ends , would he a departure from their original design . But if education be taken in its widest sense , as that culture by which one may be fitted to sustain with honor all the offices , both public and private , which circumstances may impose upon him , the utility , nay , the indispensableness , of classical studies , as a part of the course , may be safely asserted . We can not wish a plainer recognition of this truth , or a more concise and satisfactory statement of the reasons on which it is founded , than is afforded by a single sentence in the " Remarks " of President Quincy . " That there are advantages in the study of the ancient languages , - that they are better adapted than most other studies to inure students to overcome intellectual difficulties , and secure a habit of solid and vigorous application at an early period of life ,  --  that these languages are mixed etymologically with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own , - that as mere inventions , as pieces of mechanism , they are more beautiful than any of the modern languages , - that the works they contain have longest stood the test of time , and pleased the greatest number of exercised minds , - are reasons why they should be made the groundwork of the early training of all who aim at the distinction of a liberal education . " - Remarks , &amp;o. p. 17 . A perfect acquaintance with our own language can he acquired only through the medium of Latin and Greek . A full insight into the princilmies of universal grammar must be gained in the same way . The nomenclature of nearly all the natural sciences , which is common in a great degree to all the nations of modern Europe , can he understood only through an acquaintance with these languages . Many of the most n-iportant treatises on science and philosophy , many even of modern date , exist only in Latin , a knowledge of which is just as requisite for the thorough comprehension of Bacon and Descartes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for // understanding Horace and Tacitus . The most perfect models of history , poetry , and eloquence , the unchallenged rriasterpieces of literary genius , untranslated and untranslateable , can be consulted only by the classical scholar . These statements comprise only the undisputed facts respecting the study of the ancient languages , and constitute , therefore , only the opening of the case . But can any education be esteemed exact , complete , and generous , which resigns without a struggle even these advantages ? If it was the purpose of the founders of our colleges to afford the means of such an education , and not merely to minister to the wants of those , wl ) ose only wish is to know how they may enter upon active life the earliest , and grow rich the fastest , can the studies , which afford even the results above mentioned and no others , with any propriety or justice be banished from these institutions ? If we look at the effect of these studies on the general discipline of the mind , the cultivation and refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reasoning faculty , their importance is no less obvious and undeniable . Other exercises , it is true , tend towards the same result , so that this advantage can not he claimed exclusively for the pursuit of classical learning . But we contend , that no more sure and systematic process has been devised for the attainment of this end , than that which consists in the study of Greek and Latin , and of the works that exist only in these languages . Their complex structure and copious vocabulary increase the difficulty of obtaining an accurate knowledge of them , and require an earnest and long continued effort , before this difficulty can he overcome . Habits of close and unremitting application , of accurate analysis , and nice discernment are formed or strengthened in the process , and the labor is cheered by a perception of constant progress , and by the contemplation of the variety and beauty of the works , about which it is employed . It is not the study of words , but of ideas , that occupies the pupil ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere so clearly perceived , as in the effort to acquire forms of expression , which differ so widely from our own . No one is in so great danger of mistaking words for things , and of using the former in a mechanical way , so that little or no signification is attached to them , as lie who knows but one language , e . Certain formuke of expression take the place of thought , and the individual // talks or writes for ever , without really enunciating one idea . The labor of acquiring another tongue tears open this curtain of words , and the light which dawns upon the student respecting the real function of language is in exact proportion to the dissinilarity of structure between that other tongue and our own . Knowledge is a state of mind ; perception is a mental act ; to the thinking subject , things are what they appear in his individual conception of them . They have subjective , hut not objective reality . The name belongs to the idea , and not to the object , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty only upon an introduction to another set of names , having a very different application . How idle , then , is that distinction hetween words and things , which is meant to discredit the study of the former , when it is obvious that the idea is what ought to be perfected , and that things , as they exist per se , are less intimately connected than words with the thought . With this view of the beneficial results of study ing the ancient languages , with what reason is the praise of utility , even of the most practical and easily appreciated cast , denied to the labor of acquiring them ? In what pursuit are not the faculties required , which are developed and strengthened by this exercise ? To what ends are such means not subservient ? If happiness is the object in view , so far as it is dependent on a well-ordered mind , and the procurement of a train of mental pleasures , inferior to no other in amount or degree , its attainment is secured by such a training . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in political and professional life , there is no fact more frequently attested , there is no theme on which the individuals themselves more delight to dwell , than the enjoyment derived from the revival and prosecution at intervals of the classical studies of their youth . This particular branch of their early education is marked as leading to such a result , hecause it fills a larger space in the retrospect of life , having originally extended through several years , and the peculiar characteristics of the objects studied have left a deep imprint on the memory . And if general culture conduces in any degree to success in the pursuit of wealth or reputation , the importance of classical learning , even for these purposes , must he equally admitted . Many , indeed , prosper in these pursuits , without the advantages of such discipline in early life ; hut their success is no // more to be attributed to the want of such preparation , than the eminence of many distinguished statesmen of England is to be imputed to their training at Eton and Oxford . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great ability will force its way in spite of neglect in early life , or any other adverse circumstance ; and Fox and Pitt might have led the House of Commons , though they had not been distinguished as classical scholars . Wealth is sometimes acquired by those who can neither read nor write ; reputation has been gained by some men , who never went to school in their lives . But we do not , on this account , deny the necessity of some education , nor cease to maintain schools at the public expense . The utility of many things is acknowledged , though it can not be demonstrated by universal experience . But the study of Greek and Latin is discouraged because they are dead languages , and the acquisition of French and Italian is recommended in their place . If the object of instruction in the languages were to promote intercourse between different nations , there would be some force in this consideration . But the tuition is not directed with a view to enable pupils to converse or correspond with foreigners , occasions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one student in a hundred has any expectation of learning to talk in any foreign tongue , and not one in a thousand really acquires this power , except by visiting Europe . The object of study is to become acquainted with the stores of modern literature ; and to this end instruction in the modern languages at Cambridge is exclusively directed . Therefore , for the great majority of students , French and German , Italian and Spanish , are just as much dead languages , as Greek and Latin . XVith this limitation of the objects of instruction , we do not see , why an acquaintance with Homer and Sophocles , with Cicero and Horace , is not quite as desirable as with Dante , Goethe , or Racine . Quite as much pleasure will be derived from the perusal of the former class of writers , and the mental discipline acquired in the effort will be much more exact and valuable . We are far from undervaluing the elegant pursuits of modern literature , now so fashionable among us ; but we have no wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for them . Considered merely as an elegant accomplishment , an acquaintance with the language and literature of the ancients , promises // as much , as familiarity with the finest productions of modern genius . The language of the Greeks , the most dulcet instrument on which the human voice ever played , the most flexible and copious in expressing all the workings of intellect and the modifications of passion , more cunning in its structure than any other on which the grammarian and the philosopher have ever labored , - this wonderful tongue loses nothing by comparison with the sweetness and simplicity of the halian , or with the richness , pliancy , and strength of the German . For the Latin , it is enough to say in connex ion with this t6pic , that it forms the shortest and most agreeable introduction to all the languages of southern Europe , a thorough knowledge of which can not be gained without some acquaintance with the source whence they were all derived . And the productions of the ancients , - how few have been surpassed , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality , it is true , was superseded by the birth of our religion ; and the state of society and manners , half described , half satirized , by Horace and Juvenal , exists no longer . But their systems of logic and philosophy are even now recovering from a temporary neglect , and furnish* ing fresh materials for the speculations of our own day . And their oratory lives . It lives in the burning words of modern patriots and statesmen , who have spoken under the inspiration derived from the study of ancient models . It lives in all the triumphs obtained by men who have formed their taste and manner on the o Id exemplars , so that the eloquence of all modern times has been but one continuous and far-resounding echo of the voices which spoke originally from the Athenian Pnyx and the Roman Forum . And their poets , too , - are their works dead ? or is not rather their spirit to be found in the poetical literature of every nation , that rose from the wreck of the Roman empire ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he wandered about the isles and colonies of Greece , after giving form , expression , - ay , birth , - to the whole literature , character , and national institutions of the people to whom he belonged , have come down to us through a period of three thousand years , during which time they have served as a theme for scholars , a model for poets , a study for all who could appreciate what was grand and beautiful in the efforts of human genius . In vindicating a place for classical studies in the scheme of // a liberal education , we are not actuated by a blind and exclusive admiration of such pursuits , nor do we advocate such excessive and injudicious devotion to them , as in some European institutions has brought discredit on the whole cause of ancient learning . The pride of scholarship has too often degenerated into pedantry ; and , even now , that attention is too frequently wasted on the niceties of philology , which might more profitably be given to the meaning and criticism of particular writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . It is equally unwise , to allow such pursuits to monopolize the whole province of ed .. ucation , sacrificing to them all knowledge of the physical sciences , and all study of our own language and literature . But Harvard College has at no period exposed itself to this reproach , and , least of all , of late years . A mere glance at the scheme of studies , shows conclusively , that something else is studied at Cambridge besides Greek and Latin . Five modern languages , a complete course of physical science , ancient and modern history , English rhetoric and composition , philosophy , natural theology , ethics , political economy , and constitutional law , besides occasional lectures and recitations in natural history , anatomy , and the useful arts , are some of the exercises that hold a place by the side of mathematics and the ancient languages , and , as we conceive , leave little to be desired in point of copiousness and variety . Some may even think , that there is more danger of excess than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies are all comprised within the space of four years , and are pursued by students nearly all of whom are much under age . But we had no fears on this score , so long as the three great branches , which have always been considered as the groundwork of a liberal education , were allowed to retain their place , and occupy a fair share of the student 's attention . But , if these are now to be pushed out , if the substantial acquirements of classical and mathematical learning are to be buried under this heap of miscellaneous pursuits , we think the wit of man could hardly devise a plan more injurious to the formation of a sound and healthy intellect , and a well-ordered character . The pupil 's attention will be distracted , and his mind frittered away by a swift succession of books and subjects , resting on no one of them sufficient time to form habits of patient analysis and careful thought ; to gain solid nutri // ment for the intellect , or to master effectually the subject of inquiry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering college or after graduating , is he annoyed with such a preposteroLis variety of studies , without having his attention fixed , and the power of concentrated and unremitting application developed , upon one or two points of interest and importance . He will leave college with a smattering of all possible sciences , without being fully or accurately acquainted with any one , and , what is still worse , with desultory habits and an ill-trained mind . It is a matter of evil omen for the coming generation , if the substantial and manly exercises of mind , by which our fathers were trained , are to give way to this passion of knowing every thing , to a superficial information on a great variety of subjects , which ought hardly to be dignified with the name of learning . A desire of converting the College into a University on the European plan , which is very apparent in two of the pamphlets now before us , seems to have brought about this introduction of the voluntary system and the great enlargement of the academical plan of studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no great importance , and , if it were , why not assume it at once , since both terms are indiscriminately applied in this country to institutions that hardly rank with respectable high schools ? But , if an attempt be made to copy a foreign model in any other respect than the appellation , we hope it will be definitely ascertained what this model is , and what changes are necessary in the constitution of a college in order to transform it into a university . So far as we know , there is little uniformity in the European practice . At Oxford and Cambridge , many colleges form a university , just as many families constitute a community . Certain professors are attached to the university at large , but their offices are mostly sinecures , and degrees are conferred by a board that represents the collected colleges . The London University corresponds very nearly to this plan , there being a central board of examination for the purpose of conferring degrees , to which students are presented by various privileged institutions in the metropolis , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . The English scheme , therefore , seems to be , that colleges give the instruction , while the university confers the degrees . In Scotland , the two functions are combined , though there , as in England , // attendance on prescribed classes for a certain period , and passing- an examination more or less severe , are the requisites for obtaining the appropriate degree . On the continent of Europe , universities are generally composed of ' the several faculties of law , theology , medicine , and philosophy or the arts , the last corresponding to our undergraduate course . The different faculties give out their respective degrees , the requisitions being a certain time passed in the institution , or attendance on prescribed courses , and a certain degree of proficiency in several branches , as made apparent by an examination , or presumed from the fact of residence . As an entire set of professional schools is attachel to Harvard College , each giving its proper diploma ; the title of a university may be justly assumed by this instittition , the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in whose name all the degrees are conferred , and therefore performing the functions of the university proper . An attempt to copy still further the European scheme must proceed by imitating peculiarities , which are mere accidents of the system , brought about by circumstances in the nature of the country and its civil and literary institutions , and are not essential features of the university plan . Thus there are many offices in these countries , which are conferred upon evidence of remarkable qualifications in some one branch of learning , as the offices under government , and those in the universities themselves and other literary institutions of the country , which are often distributed after a concourse , as it is termed , or an open competition before a board of inquiry . This opening to lucrative and honorable situations naturally creates a large body of students , who take what the French call a speciality , and either with or without obtaining an ordinary degree for general acquirements , devote their whole time and labor to one department of science or letters , in the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities Jor an indefinite period , following their own selected studies . The number of such students , with whom a diploma is no object , naturally lessens the importance attached to common degrees , and therefore many , even of those who do not belong to this class , leave the university without graduating . But the important point for us in the present discussion is , that these degrees are never conferred btit upon evidence afforded of proficiency in certain prescribed studies , // a greater or less amount of classical learning being an invariable requisition . A student can not reside at a college for a few years , pursuing what studies he likes , and then claim a degree as a matter of course . The two writers , whom we are now reviewing , appear to think , that ibis introduction of the voluntary system at Cambridge is a step of approximation to the European university system , whereas , in fact , it is a direct departure from it . It is of great importance to the interests of science and sound learning in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed in our colleges , who would devote all their powers to one subject ; but the circumstances of the country as yet offer no encouragement for its formation . There are no fellowships here , as at the English universities ; professorships are few in number , small in value , and are never conferred after open contest ; and public offices are conferred by popular favor on a far different criterion from that of scholastic attainments . Harvard College did all that was possible for this end sixteen years ago , by throwing open the institution to persons not candidates for a degree , who wish to pursue 1 ) artic*Ilar studies . She offered to receive such students , but the issue proved there were hardly any to be had . The present measure is nugatory for this purpose , and directly destructive of the only remaining object which our colleges have to pursue , - the maintenance of a high standard of scholarship as essential to a degree . The plan of allowing undergraduates to select their own studies , never adopted abroad except under the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance , by which our own colleges are distinguished from European ones , - the great youthfulness of the students . Except two or three members of each class , whom peculiar circumstances have obliged to commence their education later in life , and the average age of the remainder does not probably exceed sixteen at the time of admission . Many enter two or three years earlier . Is it judicious , or even prudent , to allow such mere boys to select their own studies , and thereby to determine their own education ? Will not indolence , or caprice , or the love of novelty , be likely , in a great majority of instances , to direct their choice ? Can they , at best , be so competent to decide this point , as men who have made the theory and practice ofeducation // the constant subject of their thoughts and the business of their lives ? Many of our most distinguished classical scholars have made themselves such by studies pursued after graduating , youthful carelessness or whim having induced them to neglect in great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation which they were compelled to make , the foundation deep and strong , which they almost unconsciously laid , rendered the task of resumption easy , when the taste and judgment of maturer years , or the force of circumstances , directed a return to the neglected pursuits . To diminish by one half the required amount of classical knowledge in the college course would be to render such a future resumption of these studies impossible , or , at least , to surround it with difficulties which few would have the ardor and perseverance requisite to encounter with success . But the plan requires that all students , who are under age , should obtain the consent of their parents before relinquishing any branch of study ; and it is thought , that in this way the danger of a rash choice will be obviated . Those who urge this feature of the scheme have surely never considered the characters and situation in life of most persons , who in this country send their sons to college . Many have not received a liberal education themselves ; nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of husbandry , or the toils of a profession , and have neither time nor thought to bestow on such a subject . The answer of a parent , consulted for advice by his son under such circumstances , would very naturally be , " Why , that is the very thing for which I sent you to college , - to have your studies selected and your education deter niined by the authorities there . I know nothing about these things . Take your own choice . " In respect to classical studies , the reply of an uneducated parent might chance to be still more peremptory , or very much in the style of the Dutch professor immortalized in the " Vicar of Wakefield . " " You see me , young man ; I never learned Greek , and I do n't find that I have ever missed it . I have ten thousand forms a year without Greek ; I eat heartily without Greek , and , in short , as I do n't know Greek , I do not believe there is any good in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common arguments against classical learning ; but we still hope never to hear it sanctioned by the // authority of a future Professor at Cambridge . Yet on one of its public days , since the introduction of the new system , it was our lot to hear from one of the ingenuous youth an argument *reminding us strongly of the view of the Dutch professor . It is argued in favor of the new plan , that it " will tend to connect in the minds of the students their college studies with the pursuits of later life . " Their preparatory exercises , it is said , will be better adapted to their future destination , being chosen with direct reference to the profession which they intend to follow . Such reasoning , we can not but think , shows an imperfect acquaintance with the position and views of the great body of the undergraduates . Not one in ten of tl ) em has any idea about choosing a profession till very late in his college course , and the great majority do not decide upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own minds are necessarily unsettled upon a subject of so great importance , and what prudent parent will venture to mark out a career in life for his son so many years before he is to enter upon it ? The common and very wise course is to leave this matter to be decided by the pupil after he has finished his college studies , and ascertained , from some inter* course with the world at large , what employment is most likely to suit his taste and capacity . Besides , even if it were practicable , would it be worth while for the student , by a special selection and arrangement of his studies , to commence fitting himself for a profession or for any active employment at an earlier period , than is now common in this country ? Is there any reasonable apprehension of time being lost before the youthful aspirant is fairly embarked on his voyage ? It is the peculiar misfortune of this country , that , the openings into active life being numerous and easy of access , young men are tempted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds still in doubt , whether they have really hit i*ipon the desired and appropriate profession after all . We have lawyers and clergymen enough , who have not attained their majority , and even legislators whose beards are hardly grown . Is it advisable to have them younger still , to abridge still further the period of general studies , to bring down the necessarily narrow and exclusive training for professional pursuits to the very brink of childhood ? It is admitted , that the pupil ought first to obtain // " the elements of a general culture ; " and how weak , beggarly , and insecure must be this common basis of all effort , if the preparation of it , even by the most highly educated class in the community , must stop short in the student 's sixteenth year . It is the curse of professional life , that its jealous nature requires the abandonment of all taste for general literature and science , and the resolute sacrifice of all the discursive exercises of the intellect and the imagination . The neophyte lawyer must imitate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , that are not bound in law-calf , and all his papers , that are not writs or instruments of conveyancing , before he can look forward to the higher honors of the bar and the bench . It is cruel to anticipate the period of this sacrifice , to nip in the bud the first flowers of taste and fancy , to check the earliest developement of the many-sided mind . Such a partial culture may indeed produce an able lawyer , a skilful physician , or a sound divine , though even this effect may reasonably be questioned ; but for the education of the whole man it is profitless and wrong . It is one branch of that vast system of distributed labor , which condemns some individuals to spend all their lives in n ) aking the eighteenth part of a pin . We have spoken with freedom of the introduction of the voluntary system , and the consequent depreciation of classical studies , at Harvard College , because it seemed to us an unnecessary concession to the utilitarian spirit of the times , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution was established . The change , unless we greatly err , was not desired by the great body of the community , who feel little interest in the conduct of the College , being affected only by its more remote results . And they are wise enough to see , that the higher interests of science and learning , the preservation of a high standard of education and general scholarship , are indissolubly connected with the honor and welfare of the country . The smaller class , who have a more lively regard for the institution to which they are indebted for their own early training , or to whose guardianship and instruction they are about to intrust their sons and relatives , look with surprise and regret upon a measure , which seems like a total departure from the former principles of management , and the effect of which must be to lessen the amount of sound scholarship in the country , and // to lower the estimation in which it is held . They are unwilling , that the College should diminish the magnitud eand value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater number of persons . The experience of one or two years will probably show how groundless was the expectation , on which the authors of this system have acted , that a large body of students would be attracted to Cambridge by such a free and conciliatory proposal . Then , if not before , we hope they will be willing to retrace their steps , and to stake the reputation of Harvard College , not on the numbers enrolled in its Catalogue , but on the extent , accuracy , and thoroughness of the education obtained within its walls@@184059002.txt THE object of this work is , to bring together a fair and full account of the most important criminal trials , which have occurred in the history of the now United States . The idea of a middle course between the heavy " State Trials " of Howell , and the sprightly " Causes Ce'l*bres " of the French , is a good one , and , as far as the volume before us , relating to trials before the American Revolution , is concerned , the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . The book is suitable for popular reading , being free from legal technicalities and formal statements . A trial is taken , and all the facts anterior to its occurrence , with other matters serving to throw light upon it , are carefully collected . The materials are then interwoven into a narrative of the writer 's own , thus forming a series of interesting and prominent facts in juridical literature . Besides the public principles unfolded and illustrated in the judicial proceedings recorded in this work , the details of circumstances leading to the trials , and of the evidence adduced at them , exhibit a minute , graphic , and striking view of the state of society and manners at different periods and places , such as is scarcely in any other way to be obtained . The interior of social , domestic , and private life is frequently thrown open in the course of an examination of witnesses , and an access afforded to the retired paths of ordinary human experience , which history , in any of its other forms , does not approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual life , in its minutest relations and interests , brought out to view in the true and authentic aspect which they wear , when appearing with the sanction of oaths , and under the decisive tests of a public investigation , and an unsparing cross-examination . The mind reposes with confidence on the scenes thus presented , and is gratified in beholding the image of its own nature and condition reflected in so clear a mirror . When we consider how acceptable , from this and other causes , to the public taste and curiosity , the accounts of trials , particularly criminal trials , always are , and look at the manner in which the work before us is prepared , // and take into view the field from which the author proposes to select his materials , we can not doubt the success of his labors . The present volume justifies us in expressing the opinion , that Mr. Chandler , as he proceeds , will produce a work that will shed much light upon the progress of law and liberty , and also of manners and morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Anne Hutchinson . She was tried and condemned , not so much in consequence of alleged heretical opinions , as of the mischievous social influence she was believed to be exerting . At the meetings which she held , and which she made so attractive as to draw in a continually increasing number of the females of the colony , she is represented to have made a systematic assault upon the principles preached in the pulpits , and administered in the government , of Massachusetts . That assault was rendered effective and formidable by her genius and zeal . She was felt to be undermining the foundations of the church and the state . The question came up in her case , which comes up in other forms in our own age ; and it was settled by the New England fathers in the same way in which it has been settled of late in different parts of the country . It is , whether it is better to endure , in patience , the disturbance produced by agitators and fanatics , or by an exercise of absolute force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid examination of the case the conclusion may , perhaps , be reached , that the New-England people of the olden time exercised about as much forbearance as men of this generation would commonly exhibit under similar circumstances . Mrs. Hutchinson was not only in the daily habit of denouncing and ridiculing the clergy and the most cherished institutions of the country , but she advocated the startling doctrine of private revelations from the Divine Spirit , which she placed where , if real , they belonged , on a level with the revelations recorded in the Scriptures , or rather , as in effect it was , infinitely above them , because infinitely above any particular interpretations that may be made of them . She was powerful and ingenious in her knowledge and application of the Scriptures , long trained to disputation , fluent , prompt , and eloquent . Her sex shielded her from many of the means of opposition and resistance which might otherwise have been employed ; and , besides all this , there was mingled with her bold and fanatical notions and proceedings much truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the acquisition by her is wonderful and unaccountable . For these and other reasons , too numerous to be mentioned , she was indeed , most naturally , an object of the greatest dread , as an agitator and innovator , and was rapidly making progress in upturning and overthrowing the whole system of society and religion which the Puritans had fled to the American wilderness to establish and enjoy . And who that considers the sacrifices they had made , the privations they had endured , the sufferings and sorrows they had encountered , in procuring their settlement , - the price they had paid for the institutions and arrangements of their social and religious state and order , - can wonder that they were unwilling to see the fruits of their labors and struggles blasted , and the fabric , they had carefully and painfully reared , undermined and cast down ? But much as we may sympathize with and pity them , we must not withhold our concurrence in that general voice of condemnation of their proceedings which is uttered by the present age . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that condemnation , should be imprinted everywhere upon the public mind . It declares that no circumstances of provocation will ever justify the use of force in suppressing opinion , and that , however much disturbance , perplexity , and vexation , moral , political , or theological agitators and innovators may occasion , the hand of society must never attempt to restrain the utterance of their sentiments . We must endure and bear with them as incurable evils . We may try to keep out of their way , which , probably , is the better course , or we nay , if we choose , resist them by argument ; but , whenever we so far lose our patience as to think of employing force , of any kind , to put them down , we come under the same conden*ation which we , and all the rest of the world , have pronounced against the persecutors of Anne Hutchinson . The political lesson taught by the proceedings in this case is , the danger of allowing a community , in its executive and legislative functions , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Court , the governor presiding , and the ministers of the colony being permitted to mingle in the deliberations and proceedings . The tribunal , thus constituted , was armed with the entire political and moral power of the State , and was , for this reason , uncontrolled // and incontrollable . It was held in check by no principle of law , freed from the restraints of judicial precedents and usages , limited by no provisions of charter or constitution , and safe in going to any extremity of violence and outrage , because sure of support from the passions and the power of- the whole people . Whoever reads this trial , or the trials of the Quakers , or of the reputed witches , which are very satisfactorily and fairly reported and described in this volume , will learn the infinite value of an independent judiciary , as an essential department of government , and will be convinced that it is the only safeguard of the liberty and life of the citizen . We notice that Mr. Chandler intimates that Mrs. Hutchinson was probably employed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , for the sake of promoting the political designs of the party attached to Governor ( afterwards the celebrated Sir Henry ) Vane . Unless he has better evidence of this thiin has come to our knowledge , we would suggest , whether the whole transaction is not rendered unnecessarily perplexed and entangled by such an insinuation . One of the most curious and interesting events , in the history of society in this country , is presented in the chapter entitled " The New York Negro Plot . " It occurred in - 1741 , fifty years after the witchcraft delusion , which has given such a peculiar notoriety to Salem , a city always at least on a level with any other in the intelligence of its population , but which , in consequence of its having happened to be the scene where the court assembled for the witchcraft trials , has ever since been most unjustly identified with popular superstition and fanaticism . We hesitate not to say , that in every particular the New York Negro Plot runs parallel with the witchcraft trials , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of the popular excitement , in the violence that was done to common sense , reason , and the law , and in the bloody and awful results of the proceedings . And yet the world has been willing to forget the New York Negro Plot , while every child is taught , when the name of Salem is mentioned , to associate with it the horrors and the follies of witchcraft . But the New York Negro Plot ought not to be forgotten ; it teaches a much more important lesson than the witchcraft delusion . The latter illustrates the blind and destructive energy of the popular passions , under circumstances and influences , belonging to an age of comparative ignorance and superstition , and which can never again occur ; while the // former illustrates the same blind and destructive energy of the popular passions , under circumstances and influences belonging to all times , and which may be repeated , perhaps will be more likely to be repeated , the more society is concentrated by the progress of civilization . A considerable degree of ill-feeling had for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored population of the city of New York . The passions of the respective parties were inflamed by frequent collisions and difficulties occurring between individuals . The public imagination , as usual , when the popular passions are excited , soon became distempered . The whole mass of accumulated fear , prejudice , hatred , and revenge , was at last kindled , as by a spark , on the utterance of the cry " Negro plot ! " and the community rushed blindly into the most desperate and phrensied delusion , each individual contributing fuel to the flame . Accusations , confessions , executions , followed in quick succession . The government , the judges , the entire bar , and all classes , were swept into the excitement . No individual retained his coolness or self-possession . There was not a hand left to hold firmly aloft the scales of justice . There was not a voice to plead the cause of accused innocence . Reason was , for the time , extinguished , and every heart was perverted and hardened , by fear , and hate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cast into prison . Four white persons were hanged . Eleven negroes were burned at the stake eighteen were hanged , and fifty were transported into West India slavery . This whole horrible scene was an utter delusion , commencing in malice and folly , and carried through all its terrific stages by a combination of passions , such as exist , and always will exist , in every community of men , and unless controlled , and guided , and mitigated , by reason , law , and the spirit of Christian moderation , may at any time break forth and lay waste society . It is a singular circumstance , and completes the parallelism between this transaction and the Salem witchcraft , that in each a clergyman was among the sufferers . While the negro-plot delusion was at its height , the public mind was still more distracted and shocked , and thrown into deeper consternation , by the cry of " Popery " ; and the idea at once pervaded the whole community , that the Pope of Rome was at the bottom of the conspiracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Ury , fell a victim . The following is the address he made , when arrived at the place of execution " Fellow-Christians , I am now about to suffer a death , attended with ignominy and pain ; but it is the cup that my heavenly Father has put into my band , and I drink it with pleasure ; it is the cross of my dear Redeemer , I bear it with alacrity , knowing that all that live godly in Christ Jesus , must suffer persecution ; and we must be made in some degree partakers of his sufferings , before we can share in the glories of his resurrection ; for he went not up to glory before he ascended monut Calvary ; he did not wear the crown of glory before the crown of thorns . I am to appear before an awful and tremendous God , a being of infinite purity and unerring justice ; a God who by no means will clear the guilty , that can not be reconciled either to sin or sinners ; in the presence of that God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands , and solemnly protest , I am innocent of what is laid to my charge . I appeal to the great God for my non-knowledge of llughson , his wife , or the creature that was hanged with them . I never saw them living , dying , or dead ; nor ever had I any knowledge or confederacy with white or black , as to any plot and , upon the memorials of the body and blood of my dearest Lord , in the creatures of bread and xviae , in which I have commemorated the love of my dying Lord , I protest that the witnesses are perjured ; I never knew them but at my trial . But for a removal of all scruples that may arise after my death , I shall give my thoughts on some points . " First , I firmly believe and attest , that it is not in the power of man to forgive sin ; that is the prerogative only of the great God to dispense pardon for sin ; and that those who dare pretend to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and unpardonable sin , the sin against the holy spirit ; because they pretend to that power which their own consciences proclaim to be a lie . " Again , I solemnly attest and believe , that a person having committed crin-tes that have or might have proved hurtful or destructive to the peace of society , and does not discover the whole scheme , and all the persons concerned with him , can not obtain pardon from God . And it is not the taking any oath or oaths that ought to hinder him from confessing his guilt , and all that he knows about it ; for such obligations are not only sinful , but unpardonable , if not broken . Now , a person firmly believing this , and knowing that an eternal state of happiness or misery depends upon the performance or non-performance of the above mentioned things , can not , will not , trifle with such important affairs . // I have no more to say by way of clearing my innocency , kno*ving that to a true , Christian , unprejudiced mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not very solicitous about it . I rejoice , and it is now my comfort , ( and that will support me and protect me from the crowd of evil spirits that I must meet with in my flight to the region of bliss assigned me , ) that my conscience speaks peace to me . Indeed , it may be shocking to some serious Christians , that the holy God should suffer mnnocency to be slain by the hands of cruel and bloody persons , ( I mean the witnesses who swore against me at my trial , ) indeed , there may be reasons assigned for it , but as they may be liable to objections , I decline them ; and shall only say , that this is one of the dark providences of the great God , in his wise , just , and good government of this lower world . " In fine , I depart this waste , this howling wilderness , with a mind serene , free from all malice , with a forgiving spirit , so far as the Gospel of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping and praying that Jesus , who alone is the giver of repentance , will convince , conquer , and enlighten , my murderers ' souls , that they may publicly confess their horrid wickedness before God and the world , so that their souls may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus . " - pp 248 - 251 . The most important trial , by far , in this collection , is that of John Peter Zenger , before the Supreme Court of New York , for two libels on the government . It took place on the 4th of August , 1735 , James de Lancey , Chief Justice , presiding , assisted by Frederick Pelipse , second justice . Governor Crosby , whose administration began in 1732 , became involved in a violent and bitter controversy with the people of the Province of New York . The legislature and the Council were brought under his influence , and the higher courts of law also were so modelled as to be instruments in the hands of the government against the people . The only resource of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Weekly Journal , " was their organ . It was l ) rinted by John Peter Zenger , a poor , but able and spirited individual . The chief justice endeavoured in vain to prevail upon the grand jury to indict him . The Council then pronounced four of Zenger 's newspapers to be " false , scandalous , malicious , and seditious libels , " and ordered them to be burned by the common hangman . The order was read in the court of quarter sessions , but the magistrates would not suffer it to be entered . The sheriff caused the papers to be burned by his negro servant . Zenger was then arrested by // order of the Council , and thrown into jail . His friends procured a writ of haleas corpus , but the bail was put so high that he could not procure it . While he was thus lying in jail , the judges attempted again to get him indicted by the grand jury , but without success . The attorney-general then charged him by information for a misdemeanor in printing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libels . " Two popular leaders , James Alexander and William Smith , undertook the defence of Zenger , but , taking exceptions to the jurisdiction of the court , tley were summarily excluded from practising in the court , and their names stricken from the roll of attorneys . This high-handed procedure of the judges amounted to a threat of destruction to any lawyer of the New York bar , who should venture to espouse the cause of Zenger . In this extremity , his friends had recourse to a remedy which proved effectual . They went to Philadelphia and engaged the services of Andrew Hamilton , a celebrated barrister , about eighty years of age . This extraordinary man is thus described by Mr. Chandler ; " Educated in England , and in practice there before coming to this country , he had a good knowledge of law as a science , and took the highest rank in his profession . His honor , integrity , and ability secured for him the respect and admiration of many who differed from him in opinion . He was an ardent friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , he denounced the encroachments and usurpations of those in authority with a boldness that excited their fear and hatred , while his easy and graceful eloquence , his powers of sarcasm , and his powerful declamations , enraptured the people . " When the trial came on , Z enger had been in prison many months , and there seemed but little ground for hope that he could be rescued from the vengeance of the government . The charge was , that he had printed and published certain alleged libels . The first point to be judged was , that he did print and publish the papers ; and the next , that they were libellous . The junior counsel for the defendant proposed to contest the first point , but Hamilton overruled him , and , acknowledging the printing and publication , boldly threw himself on the other point , and took the ground , that he had printed and published no more than every free-born British subject had a right to print and publish . // We can assure every one , who reads it , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forensic and judicial eloquence . In dignity and strength , in ingenuity and elegance , and in every attribute that can add force or weight to such an argument , it is scarcely surpassed . He was frequently interrupted by the attorney-general , and the chief justice endeavoured to cut him short , taking the ground , that the jury had no other duty to perform than to find the facts of the printing and publishing , which Hamilton had admitted , and that it was for the court to adjudge the libel . Upon the court 's asserting this , Hamilton deliberately turned to the jury , and addressed his argument to them , showing it was their right , and privilege , and duty , to place themselves between the coumt and the citizen , and protect the latter against such a claim by the former . lie proved that they , the jury , were the judges of the law as well as the fact , that the whole case was in their hands , and that they ought not to relinquish any part of it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to us that , if ever the spirit of liberty was embodied in the language of man , it was on that occasion . In that argtiment , the sovereign power of the people , of whom the jury were the representatives , first came forth in complete manifestation , in America , perhaps we may say , in the world . The judiciary having become degraded into the tool of the other branches , Hamilton evoked from the bosom of the people , through the peaceful and legitimate medium of a jury , that great remedial and conservative power , which , in the last resort , can only be found in the peol ) le . He concluded in the following manner , alluding it will be perceived , to his having come from another Province , and to his great age " I hope to be pardoned , Sir , for my zeal upon this occasion ; it is an old and wise caution , that , when our neighbour 's house is on fire , we ought to take care of our own . For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government where liberty is well understood , and freely enjoyed ; yet experience has shown us all , ( I am sure it has to mc , ) that a bad precedent in one goveminent is soon set up for an authority in another ; and therefore I can not but think it mine , and every honest man 's duty , that ( while we pay all due obedience to men in authority ) we ought at the same time to be upon our guard against power , wherever we apprehend that it may affect ourselves or our fellow-subjects. // " I am truly very unequal to such an undertaking on many accounts . And you see I labor under the weight of many years , and am borne down with great infirmities of body ; yet , old and weak as I am , I should think it my duty if required , to go to the utmost part of the land , where my service could be of any use in assisting to quench the flame of prosecutions upon informations , set on foot by the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complaining too ) of the arbitrary attempts of men in power . Men , who injure and oppress the people under their administration , provoke them to cry out and complain ; and then make that very complaint the foundation for new oppressions and prosecutions . I wish I could say there were no instances of this kind . But , to conclude ; the question before the court and you , gentlemen of the jury , is not of small nor private concern ; it is not the cause of a poor printer , nor of New York alone , which you are now trying ; no ! it may , in its consequences , affect every freeman that lives under a British government on the main of America . It is the best cause ; it is the cause of liberty ; and I make no doubt but your upright conduct , this day , will not only entitle you to the love and esteem of your fellow-citizens ; but every man who prefers freedom to a life of slavery , will bless and honor you , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by an impartial and uncorrupt verdict , have laid a noble foundation for securing to ourselves , our posterity , and our neighbours , that to which nature and the laws of our country have given us a right , - the liberty , both of exposing and opposing arbitrary power , in these parts of the world , at least , by speaking and writing truth . " - pp. 203 - 205 . The jury returned a verdict of not guilty , in the very teeth of an authoritative charge from the chief justice against the defendant . The decision of the jury was received with shouts of applause . The judges threatened to imprison the promoters of such a disorderly proceeding , hut the people were too much excited and entranced by the greatness of the occasion to heed the voice of authority . A son of Admiral Norris rose and called for a renewal of the shouting , which was continued , and could not be repressed . Hamilton , who would receive no pecuniary compensation for his services , was borne in triumph from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was repeated by the city authorities before his return to Philadelphia . The Common Council presented him with the freedom of the city , the certificate of which was // enclosed in a splendid gold box , purchased by subscription , and , as he stepped into the barge , on his departure ffom New York , the public sense of gratitude and admiration was expressed by a salute of artillery . Gouverneur Morris asserted , that Hamilton 's argument , and the result of the trial of Zenger , were the germ of American freedom , the morning star of our liberty . The trial took place forty years before the Revolution . Massachusetts and Virginia have indulged in an honorable contention for the glory of having first started the ball of independence . Pennsylvania and New York , on the strength of this trial ,  --  the one having furnished the advocate , the other the jury , - may not unreasonably put in their claims for the glorious distinction . We would suggest to Mr. Chandler to prepare abrief sketch of the life and character of Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first volume , together with the notices he has given of Stoughton , John Adams , and Josiah Quincy , Jr . He was for a great length of time a leading man in Pennsylvania in the legislative and executive departments of the government , and was long the undisputed head of the bar . Under his direction the State House was erected in the city of Philadelphia , and the square belonging to it laid out . In the month of August , 1739 , four years after the trial of Zenger , he retired from the chair of the Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly , and from l ) ublic life . His speech on the occasion is preserved by the historians . He died near the close of the summer of 1741 . His son , James Hamilton , was for many years Governor of Pennsylvania , and as such received the encomiums of General ( then Colonel ) Washington . Andrew Hamilton , of East New Jersey , was selected in 1701 by William Penn , to be Governor of Pennsylvania , an office which he filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler , if lie would ascertain and inform us , whether this early governor of Pennsylvania was the ancestor of Andrew and James Hamilton . The memory of such a man as the defender of Zenger , of his origin and descendants , ought not to pass into oblivion . Our limits do not allow us to enter upon the consideration of any of the other trials presented in the work before us . The following is the shortest of the collection , and not without interest . " In the month of April , 1769 , a brigantine , the Pitt Packet , // of Marblehead , was boarded as she was corning in from Europe , seven leagues from land , by a boat from the Rose manof-war , the Boston station ship , then cruising in order to impress seamen . The seamen of the brigantine , four in number , determined not to be impressed , and , having provided themselves with harpoons and other weapons , they shut themselVes up in the fore peak , declaring that they preferred death to slavery , and would sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Panton , the lieutenant of the Rose , seeing the desperate determination of the men , at first endeavoured to persuade them to surrender , and at length promised that lie would be content with one of their number . Finding that mild ineasures were of no avail , he informed them that he should make use of force , and they declared that they would resist unto death . A pistol , charged with po*vder , was then fired at them , which burned the face of Michael Corbett , and immediately afterwards another of the number received a shot in the arm . 112 he seamen now became desperate , and repeatedly asserted that they would kill the first man who offered to approach them ; and a man sent in by the lieutenant was considerably wounded , and retreated . " Lieutenant Panton then declared that he would lead the way himself . Corbett warned him not to approach , and called God to witness , that , if he advanced one step towards them , he should instantly die . The lieutenant , who was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen many a brave fellow in his life , but would take a pinch of snuff and consider the matter , which , having deliberately done , he moved towards the seamen , when Corbett , agreeably to his threat , struck him with a harpoon , which cut the jugular vein . The unfortunate officer gasped out that they had taken his life , and immediately expired . The seamen continued to defend themselves , but , having provided themselves with rum , they became intoxicated and were taken to Boston . Their names were Michael Corbett , Pierce Fenning , William Courier , and John Byan . They were brought up before a special court of vice-admiralty , consisting of crown officers , commissioners for the trial of piracies , robberies , and felonies on the high seas , ' which court had always proceeded without a jury . But James Otis and John Adams , counsel for the prisoners , insisted upon a trial by jury as a matter of right . The point was elaborately argued by counsel . Governor Bernard , the president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the King 's counsel acceded to it ; the only point remaining was the manner of summoning the jurors . But Hutchinson , the chief justice , who was one of the commissioners , being well satisfied // that the decision was directly against law , drew up a statement of the case , which convinced the court that they ought to proceed without a jury . " Accordingly , on Tuesday the nineteenth of June , 1769 , the trial commenced in Boston , before the following commissioners - Sir Francis Bernard , governor of Massachusetts ; John Wentworth , governor of New Hampshire ; Samuel Hood , commodore and commander of his Majesty 's ships ; Thomas Hutchinson , lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts ; Jonathan Warner and George Jaifrey , of his Majesty 's Council in New Hampshire ; Robert Auchmuty , judge of the court of viceadmiralty for Massachusetts ; John Andrews , judge of the court of vice-admiralty for Rhode Island ; Andrew Oliver , secretary of the province ; Robert Trail , collector of the port of Portsmouth ; John Nutting , collector of Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trial occupied a week . The fact of the homicide was clearly proved ; but it appeared that neither the lieutenant nor any of his superior officers were authorized to impress , by any warrant or special authority from the Lords of the Admiralty ; and the court was unanimously of opinion , that the prisoners had a good right to defend themselves , and that they ought to be acquitted of murder , with which they were charged ; and that , at common law , the killing would not have amounted to manslaughter . " The prisoners were accordingly discharged , and a midshipman of the Rose was immediately arrested in an action for damages for the wound inflicted in the arm of one of them , and gave bail in the sum of three hundred pounds .
