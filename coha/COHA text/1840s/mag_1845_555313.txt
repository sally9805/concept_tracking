txt Th taking notice of a work on international law written by the accomplished minister of the United States to the court of Berlin , we need not bespeak for it any attention , which the long established reputation of the author would not of itself command . Mr. Wheaton 's name is no stranger to the pages of this Journal ; it has for years been most honorably connected with not only the literary , but the legal and diplomatic , annals of our country - No writer ever enjoyed greater // opportunities for testing the principles deduced from the works of philosophers and historians by their application to the business of cabinets ; while as a jurist , associated in its brightest days with the most august tribunal in America , whose province is not only to expound constitutional and municipal law , hut to interpret treaty obligations and the law of nations , our author became conversant , at an early period , with the operations of the international code upon the rights and duties of individuals . The work now before us owes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essay by the Institute of France , and its object is to trace the progress which the law of nations has made since the treaty of Westphalia . But much of the interest which it has for the American reader is derived from the additions made to it since its translation into the English language . These preserve in a durable form the diplomatic papers written by Mr. Webster during the negotiation of the treaty of Washington , and which of themselves would be enough to establish for their author an enduring fame as a statesman and a jurist . International law , in the sense in which we understand it , consisting , when not based upon express conventional arrangements , of recognized principles , forming a sort of common law among the independent states of Christendom , can hardly be said to have had an existence among the nations of antiquity . The Greeks and Romans respectively regarded all other people as barbarous . The Greeks had among themselves , owing to their common origin and the similarity of their systems of religion , some regulations tending to mitigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rather religious than political institutions , providing for resort to the temples and oracles of the gods in war as well as in peace , and for the burial of the dead , and other matters of a similar character . Even the Amphictyonic Council , which we are in the habit of regarding as a federal tribunal , and as the political arbiter of Greece , in reality enjoyed few prerogatives , and these were chiefly of a religious nature . The only institution at all resembling the permanent legations of modern times , having for its object to preserve good-will and remove causes of offence among nations , was that of the proxeni . These agents , however , were not usually citizens of the country whose husiness they // transacted , but of the state in which they resided ; and their functions were of the character which , according to the usage of modern times , would be deemed consular , not diplomatic . The rich stores of Grecian literature furnish not one treatise on the law which should regulate the intercourse of nations with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to find any basis for such an essay ; and though Grotius refers to one as among the lost hooks of Aristotle , Barheyrac shows , that this eminent writer had been led into an error by one of the commentators of Aristotle , who had mistaken the title , which was /JLXaL4CAIU *uiiv* and not 4txxtca*uara pro ' ) *q*wv , or a treatise on governeminent , and not on war . The Roman policy aimed at universal aggrandizement , and regarded all nations as enemies until they were incorporated into the commonwealth . With them , a system of public law , like that which now exists among the civilized nations of the world , could have no place . In the whole body of the Roman civil law , as it has come down to us , there is no allusion to international relations ; and the very term legatus is applied , not to an ambassador , but to the deputy-governor of a province . It is true , that the fecial law gave regularity to war , and we have memorable examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the most trying circumstances ; but there was nothing to prevent the confiscation of the property of the vanquished , both public and private , and the condemnation of the captives and their posterity to endless servitude . We may here observe , that in no one particular has the advance in civilization been more marked , even since the days of Grotius , than with reference to the treatment of prisoners of war . At the period in question , though not tolerated in practice among Christian nations , the right to reduce prisoners to slavery was not deniedto be a principle of public law . The course which then prevailed was that of ransoming the captives , which had succeeded to the custom of enslaving them and this was effected not at the expense of the government , but of the prisoner , while the sum paid was the private emolument of the individual captor . The first example to be found of an exchange of prisoners , according to the usage of the present day , dates back only to 1665 , when an agent for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bello ; but the old practice of ransoming the captured is referred to in a cartel between England and France so late as 1780 , and in this paper the money price for men of all ranks , both in the land and naval service , is given . The treaty of Westphalia is made the epoch from which to trace the improvements in public law . Before that period , the Reformation had liberated the minds of men from ecclesiastical thraldom . The rights of civil and religious liberty had been vindicated , as well in Germany as in the republics of the United Provinces and of Switzerland , to whose political independence a formal sanction was at that time accorded . The constitution of the empire itself was also adjusted on a basis which was preserved in all its essential features , till it was overturned by the progress of the French Revolution , - a torrent which annihilated in its course all ancient landmarks . Much , however , had previously been done to build up that system of public law , which was already recognized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely superseded as to the Roman population of the former provinces of the empire , had established for itself an acknowledged sway throughout the continent , and might well have been considered as its international code , so far as it was applicable to the intercourse of states with each other . In addition to those simple principles of justice , which could not well be disputed , the usages of nations had also formed a consuetudinary law . Mr. Wheaton enumerates among the publicists who wrote before Grotius , Victoria and Soto , those doctors of Salamanca , who had the boldness in the sixteenth century to support the rights of the unfortunate American aborigines against the avarice of the Spaniards ; Balthazar Ayala , a native of the Netherlands , also a subject of the King of Spain ; Conrad Brunus , a German civilian , who , as our author remarks , is nowhere mentioned by Grotius ; and Alberico Gentili , an Italian by birth , who is known to us not only as an advocate in the English admiralty courts , but as professor of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jure Belli , " we may infer , was , at least in respect to the arrangement of the subject , nearly of the same utility to Grotius as the subsequent labors of Wolf were to Vattel . The consolato del mare , which is the basis of the maritime jurisprudence of Europe , may be traced as far back as the fourteenth century . // On the state of the public law , as it existed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty of Westphalia , the work of Grotius , though written during the Thirty Years ' war , may be considered as a trustworthy authority . It was published in 1625 , twenty-three years before the peace ; and though his citations are generally drawn from the poets , philosophers , and historians of antiquity , excluding all allusions to contemporaneous discussions , it was by his writings and those of his disciples , that the statesmen who took part in the adjustment of the affairs of Europe at that memorable epoch were formed . " During this period , " says Mr. Wheaton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt in the councils and conduct of nations . The diplomacy of the seventeenth century was learned and laborious in the transaction of business . Its state papers are filled with appeals , not merely to reasons of policy , but to the principles of right , of justice , and equity ; to the authority of the oracles of public law ; to those general rules and principles by which the rights of the weak are protected against the invasions of superior force , by the union of all who are interested in the common danger . In the present age , these laborious discussions appear superfluous and pedantic . These general principles are taken for granted , and it is not thought necessary to demonstrate them by reasoning on the authority of the learned . But in the times of which we speak , they had not acquired the force of axioms , and required to be fortified by argument and an appeal to testimonies , which showed the general concurrence of enlightened men in the rules of justice , which regulate , or ought to regulate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Wheaton divides the history of international law , during the two hundred years which he passes in review , into four distinct epochs . In this arrangement it is not our intention to follow him ; but we shall briefly notice the princi .. * pal to*pics to which his work refers . The most interesting . question that is discussed relates to the right of intervention of one state in the affairs of another , which topic presents . itself under several phases in the modern history of Europe . We shall , however , postpone all reference to it , till we have considered the other matters noticed by Mr. Wheaton ; and then we shall examine it in connection with those suggestions of a system of permanent intervention , which philanthropists // at different periods have proposed as a preventive for the evils of war . Other points worthy of special notice are those growing out of the conflicting rights of belligerents and neutrals in maritime wars , involving the right to search vessels , either with or without convoy , together with the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The application of the term contraband , the law of blockade , and the right of neutrals to carry on a trade opened to them by a belligerent in war , but in which they are not allowed to participate in peace , are among the other important subjects considered in this work . Between the United States and Great Britain grave disputes have arisen respecting the right of search for men , with a view of impressing sailors from American merchant-vessels , on the plea that they were British subjects ; and more recently , and in time of peace , respecting the right to search vessels in order to ascertain their national character , and prevent them from taking a part in the African slave-trade ; also , upon the question , how far a merchant-vessel driven into a foreign port by stress of weather is subject to the local jurisdiction . The right of rip arian owners to the use of navigable rivers to the sea has been a subject of negotiation both in Europe and America . The question , whether the ship shall protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about which jurists differed at an early period , and a contrariety of opinion and practice respecting it has prevailed among nations down to the present day . rrhe ordinance of Louis the Fourteenth not only followed the consolato del mare in determining that the goods of an enemy in the ship of a friend were liable to capture , but rejected the rule , that the goods of a friend in an enemy 's ship were exempt from seizure , thus construing the regulation in every case in favor of the belligerent . We may see how far the early code of France was opposed to those maritime rights , of which she subsequently professed to be the champion , by adverting to the ordinance of Francis the First , which made a neutral vessel liable to confiscation for being laden with enemy 's goods . This provision was revived in the ordinance of Louis the Fourteenth , in 1681 , and continued to be the law till 1744 , in the reign of Louis the Fifteenth , when the enemy 's goods alone were condemned , the ship being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France and Spain , and the rule is not to be found in // the jurisprudence of any other country ; though Grotius deemed it necessary to combat the idea , that goods found on board an enemy 's ship were inevitably to be confiscated . He considers only the presumption to be against them , and that it is incumbent on the neutral claimant to prove his property . He says , further , that the vessel of a friend is not good prize , because enemy 's goods are found in it ; though he qualifies his position not a little by adding , " unless they were placed there by consent of the master . " It is worthy of remark , that the earliest relaxation in favor of neutrals is found in a treaty concluded by France with the Sublime Porte , in the beginning of the seventeenth century , by which the goods of enemies on board of French vessels were exempted from capture . The same principle was adopted in other treaties between Turkey and the maritime states of Christendom , while the double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's goods , is contained in the treaty of the Pyrenees between France and Spain . Great Britain , also , in her several treaties with Portugal , France , and Holland , concluded previously to the treaty of Utrecht , had conceded the principle , that free ships make free goods . That rule was a favorite one with Holland , also , and she succeeded in establishing it with France by the treaty of Nimeguen , in 1678 , which was subsequently confirmed by that of Ryswick , in 1697 . France adopted the same principle in her treaty with Denmark , in 1663 , and with Sweden , in 1672 . But in the treaties of that period which Sweden and Denmark had with one another , and which England had with each of them , the old principle of the consolato del mare , declaring that the goods of a neutral in an enemy 's ship were free , and confiscating enemy 's goods on board of a neutral vessel , may be found . The treaties of the peace of Utrecht were followed by commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , in all of which the maxim , free ships free goods , enemy 's ships enemy 's goods , was recognized . The modifications of the law of nations co*itained in the treaties of Utrecht did not extend to nations not parties to those treaties , and as they were all belligerents in the maritime war terminated by the treaty of Aix la Chapelle , the casnsfo*deris never arose ; and though Holland was neutral during the war of 1756 , yet , on the pretext that she had not // fulfilled the guaranties contained in her treaties , Great Britain refused to allow her any benefit from the provision in the antecedent treaties , that free ships made free goods . The maritime law , as it existed in practice , was directly opposed to the provisions of treaties , - the latter sustaining the principle last referred to , while the former adhered to the rules of the consolato* del mare . The conflict between these principles , during the war preceding the peace of Aix Ia Chapelle , occasioned the dispute , memorable on more accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Silesian loan . It grew out of the capture of Prussian ships , and their subsequent condemnation by the Court of Admiralty , on pretext of having enemy 's goods on board , or articles deemed contraband , though not recognized as such in the treaties which Great Britain had made with other powers . Not only was the sufficiency of the ground of seizure denied , in consequence of which Prussia retained the debt due to British merchants , secured by mortgage on the revenues of Silesia , but the exclusiveness of the decision of the Admiralty Court was also disputed . The difficulty was settled , however , as questions between governments usually are , by mutual concession , waiving the question of right , and the case can not therefore be cited as establishing rules in the law of nations . The treaty between the United States and France , in 1778 , concluded before the armed neutrality to which we shall presently advert , established the principle of free ships free goods , the benefit of which was extended , by a French ordinance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , to whom also was conceded the right of sailing from one port of the enemy to another , unless blockaded . With Great Britain we never have had a stipulation of this nature , and the conclusion of the treaty of 1794 with that power , recognizing the rule of law which is understood to prevail in the absence of all treaties , was made the ground of reclamation on the part of France , and led to the decree of the 2d of March , 1796 , authorizing the capture of enemy 's property in American vessels , and declaring that the United States had renounced the privileges enjoyed under the treaty of 1778 . The principle , that free ships make free goods , was , however , again restored by the treaty of 1810 with France , and still continues the rule between the United States and most of the powers with which we have special treaties . It was // adopted in our first treaties with the United Netherlands in 1782 , with Sweden in 1783 , and with Prussia in 1785 . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Great Britain , who , in her last commercial convention with her old ally , Portugal , induced that power to renounce a provision , which went hack as far as 1654 ; and the commercial treaty of 1786 , between Great Britain and France , in which the provision of free ships making free goods was incorporated , was defended by the minister of the day only on the ground that it was likely to be wholly inoperative , as a case could scarcely be conceived , where one of these parties would be engaged as a belligerent while the other was neutral . It may here be remarked , that in the subsequent treaties of peace between Great Britain and France , as in that of Amiens in 1801 , and of Paris in 1814 , a total silence has been observed as to all disputed principles of maritime law . The extent to which articles might be declared contraband of war has also been a matter of frequent conventional arrangement . The ordinance of Louis the Fourteenth had confined the term contraband to munitions of war ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be at all times contraband , but that those which may be used indiscriminately in war and peace are liable to seizure only in consequence of the necessities of the capturing belligerent in which case , the capture is not placed on the ground of the illegal conduct of the neutral , but is referable to the wants of the belligerents ; and with this opinion Bynkershoek coincides . Contraband goods , in the old French law , were subjected , not to confiscation , but to the right of preemption while it seems to have been the early usage of the English admiralty courts to condemn both ship and cargo , on account of the contraband articles . By the modern English practice , naval stores and provisions are subject to the right of preemp*ion only . Our treaty of 1794 with Great Britain contains a definition of contraband , and declares further , that , in those cases in which provisions and other articles not generally contraband shall become so , full indemnification shall be made by the captors . This provision was induced by the complaints against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the subsequent order of April , 1795 , afforded renewed occasion . The British proceedings were defended , 27 * // as well on the ground of reducing the enemy to terms by famine , as from necessity on the part of the English themselves , who were threatened with a scarcity of the articles directed to he seized . The legality of those orders formed a subject of inquiry before the mixed commission under the treaty referred to , in which , as full justice has never been done to the labors of our commissioners , it may be permitted to one who has had occasion to study minutely their arguments , to state , that the principles of the law of nations applicable to the subject were fully exhausted in the able and conclusive opinions of those enlightened jurists , Gore and Pinckney , while the judgments of Trumbull are in no wise calculated to detract from the well earned fame which he afterwards obtained in other spheres of action . The result to our citizens , it may be added , was an ample indemnity . Complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the infractions of maritime law by Great Britain , under her orders in council , after the peace of Amiens , were all merged in an appeal to arms against that country . But the contemporaneous proceedings of Napoleon under the Berlin , Milan , and other decrees , in which he succeeded in making those powers of the continent participate over whom he exercised a commanding influence , while they retained a nominal sovereignty , have been atoned for in the several treaties of indemnity with France , Naples , and Denmark , the last of which was concluded , on the part of the United States , by Mr Wheaton himself . The law of blockade was , in the time of Grotius , as it is at the present day , a matter of sharp contention between belligerents and neutrals , though that great writer founds the right of the former upon the expectation of compelling peace or a surrender of the blockaded place ; and so far from confiscating the vessel and cargo for an infraction of it in all cases , he is for imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his conduct , or security against a repetition of the offence . Bynkershoek , in his enumeration of the treaties anterior to those of Utrecht , infers that the cases subjecting to forfeiture for breach of blockade were those in which contraband articles were in question . His comments on the decree of the States General in 1630 , for the blockade of the ports of Flanders , show that paper blockades // were considered no more defensible by the publicists of that day than they are now , in despite of all attempts since made to sustain them both by England and France . But in the efforts of the Dutch , in 1652 , to prohibit to the world all trade with the English , and in those of the Spaniards to blockade the whole coast of Portugal , we have illustrations of the same arrogant pretensions by which the conduct of the maritime belligerents during the war of the French Revolution was characterized ; and in the treaty of 1680 between England and Holland against France , we find the untenable pretension of blockading the whole French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers who , near a century afterwards , united with Russia in that " armed neutrality " which gave to the reign of the Empress Catharine so much of its lustre . The belligerent right of search , which is not to be confounded with the pretension called the right of visit , recently asserted for the purpose of ascertaining the nationality of vessels in time of peace , was recognized in the consolato del mare . This right , as well as the punishment of confiscation for resisting it , was maintained in the early regulations of England , France , and Spain , though the pretensions of these states were frequently resisted by Holland and the Baltic powers . In early times , it was difficult to distinguish between claims founded on the right of search , and those supposed to be derived from the jurisdiction over the close seas . The preposterous claims of Spain and Portugal , founded on the bulls of Alexander the Sixth , to the commerce , navigation , and fisheries of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , the attempt to refute which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed into oblivion . But so late as 1803 , we find England refusing to extend to the seas adjacent to the British isles the provisions respecting impressment , which she was willing to concede in the treaty made with Mr. King as to the rest of the ocean . Great Britain then adhered to those doctrines which were the basis of the " Mare Clausum " of Selden , and which Gentili had maintained , though the assertion of them in former times had occasioned so many bloody contests with France and Holland ; This dispute respecting adjacent parts of the ocean is quite distinct from the claim to so much of the sea as may be brought under special jurisdiction , - within cannon-shot of // the coast , for example , - and over the waters between headlands . Not only has jurisdiction been assumed in such cases for revenue purposes by our government , but exception has been taken to the cruising of belligerent public vessels on our coasts , though not strictly within the marine league . The right of laying tolls on vessels passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the North Sea , is founded on the ownership of the adjacent shores , which belonged exclusively to Denmark , till the cession of Scania to Sweden in 1658 . A collateral question connected with the right of search is the right of a state to protect rnerchantmen against its exercise by the presence of a vessel-of-war . This claim was asserted as early as 1653 , by Christina of Sweden , though the termination of the war then prevailing between the Dutch and English prevented its being applied in practice . A provision to the same effect was incorporated into the Danish code of 1688 , but it seems never to have been called into operation . During the wars growing out of the French Revolution , the question was tested by England both with Sweden and Denmark , who , with the United States , during the greater part of those contests , were the only neutral maritime powers . The Swedish case arose in 1798 , when a fleet of merchantmen , carrying cargoes of naval stores , the produce of Sweden and the property of Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under convoy of a ship-of-war , was captured by a British squadron , and proceeded against in the Court of Admiralty for an alleged breach of the right of visitation and search . The decision of Sir William Scott ( Lord Stowell ) , on that occasion , is among the most celebrated efforts of that distinguished judge . After denying the right of a foreign neutral sovereign to interpose between his subjects and a belligerent cruiser , he pronounced sentence of confiscation , resting his decision , it may be said , on a citation from Vattel , * which , however conclusive on the general right of search , does not in the least touch the question of convoy , the only point at issue . In December , 1799 , a skirmish took place between a Danish frigate , convoying a fleet of merchantmen , and some British ships-of-war . The Danes fired on the British boats , // and the convoy was allowed to pass ; but the English ministers complained of the proceeding to the court of Denmark , as if they were the aggrieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted the claim to visit vessels under convoy . But in 1800 , an engagement took place between the Danish frigate Freya , in attempting to defend her convoy from search , and some British cruisers , in which lives were lost and the Danish frigate was captured . Reclamations were made on both sides , and a special minister was sent to Copenhagen , accompanied , in order to give greater weight to his refresentations , by a fleet . A convention was ultimately made , restoring the frigate and merchantmen , Denmark agreeing to withhold convoy , till the question should be settled by a definitive treaty . Among the maritime rules of general concern , which arose during the period under review , is one which was first attempted to be established in the war of 1756 , from which it derives its name . The object was to confine neutrals during war to their accustomed trade in peace ; and the attempt to punish by confiscation those who c*irried on with the enemy a trade not open in peace was first made by Great Britain against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we indebted for the work of Hubner , the ablest advocate of neutral rights , who was employed on a special mission on this occasion to the courts of France and England . The rule was not put in operation during the American war , but was a subject of constant discussion in the wars growing out of the French Revolution , and was applied by Great Britain to the total interdiction of the trade between neutrals and the colonial possessions of the enemy . The United States felt most sensibly the effects of this policy , and the capture and confiscation of their vessels under it formed one of the causes of the war declared against Great Britain in 1812 . The change of policy on the part of nations having colonies , in allowing foreigners to trade with them during peace , would of course render the rule no longer operative in the event of a future contest ; though to the analogous case of the coasting.trade , the principles , if persisted in , would continue to apply . The most interesting incident in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empress Catharine ; its origin shows how important political events // are often the result of apparent accident . It seems to have grown out of a rivalship in intrigue between the two courtiers Panin and Potemkin , operating upon the vanity and ignorance of the extraordinary woman who then occupied the Russian throne . It is even said , that Catharine entirely misapprehended the purport of the measure , and supposed that it would be particularly agreeable to England . The declaration , however , which has become so famous , was drawn up on the 26th of February , 1780 , and communicated to the courts of London , Versailles , and Madrid . It maintained , that neutral vessels might freely navigate from port to port on the coasts of nations at war , that enemy 's goods not contraband should be free in neutral vessels , and only that port should be considered blockaded into which there was an evident danger of entering . England answered with reserve , merely declaring that she had scrupulously fulfilled with Russia the obligations of her treaty and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from all who were jealous of her power , the Russian declaration received a ready response . Spain declared her conformity , and France answered that the prin* ciples were no other than the rules prescribed to her own navy . Denmark and Sweden concurred , and concluded with Russia a convention of armed neutrality and for the equipment of a joint fleet . By this convention , the Baltic was declared mare clausum to the belligerent powers . The United Provinces , alternately menaced by England and France , the one requiring the stipulated succours , the other endeavouring to confirm the neutrality , acceded to the convention of armed neutrality , which led to the declaration of war against them by Great Britain on the 20th of December , 1780 . The United States acceded on the 7th of April , 1781 , Portugal on the 12th of July , 1782 , and the King of the Two Sicilies on the 10th of February , 1783 . Great Britain continued to act towards the neutral powers according to her previous practice , but exercised her rights with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of 1756 . A proposition to revive the armed neutrality , in some degree caused by the occurrence in relation to the Danish frigate Freya , was made by the Emperor Paul in 1800 and three several conventions were in consequence signed by Russia with Sweden , Denmark , and Prussia , forming a // quadruple alliance , each of the powers acceding to the conventions with the others . The articles of these treaties were similar to the principles of the first armed neutrality ; and there was added a further provision to meet the case of convoy , by which it was declared , the rule of free ships making free goods having been stipi4ated , that the declaration of the officer of the convoy as to contraband goods , the only articles justifying search , should be deemed sufficient . The battle of Copenhagen and the death of the Emperor Paul soon dissolved the confederacy . It led , however , to the commercial convention of 1801 between Great Britain and Russia , which is considered as forming of itself an important epoch in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up the point of free ships free goods , the right of search , however , being confined to public ships-of-war . Great Britain yielded in all matters relating to the colonial and coasting trade , to blockades and modes of search , and to the limitation of contraband to military stores . The question of convoys was compromised in such a way , that , while England retained the semblance of the principle , the search was not likely to occur in practice . It may be added , that , on the rupture in 1807 between Russia and England , the Russian government published a declaration proclaiming " anew the principles of the armed neutrality , that monument of the wisdom of the Empress Catharine , " and engaging never to depart from this system while England proclaimed " anew the principles of maritime law , against which was directed the armed neutrality under the auspices of the Empress Catharine . " The subsequent treaties between Great Britain and Russia , and those between Great Britain and France , are totally silent upon the disputed points . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the peculiar provisions of the treaty of 1785 , between the United States and Prussia , which were intended to introduce important ameliorations into the usages of modern warfare , particularly by exempting noncombatants on sea and land , and merchant-vessels , from the inconveniences incident to war , and stipulating against the issuing of commissions to private armed vessels . The rule against privateering was a favorite scheme of Dr. Franklin , who was one of the American plenipotentiaries , though he clearly saw that by // the adoption of it we should lose more than any other power . A subsequent proposition , to abolish private war on the sea , was made to Great Britain by our government under the administration of Mr. Monroe , in 1823 ; but though eloquently sustained in the instructions of Mr. Adams to Mr. Rush , was not even taken into consideration by the other party . During the long wars consequent on the French Revolution , the United States , owing to the similarity of language and origin , were the principal sufferers from the assertion of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of England , and from the taking away of seamen , supposed to be of British origin , from neutral vessels . Not only was the practice calculated to render ineffectual the rights of citizenship conferred on foreigners by the laws of the United States , but in innumerable cases , either through accident or design , native-born citizens were impressed and put on board English men-of-war . No injury appealed so strongly to the feelings of the American people as this , and to seek redress for it was one of the prominent objects of the last war . The war terminated , however , without any arrangement on this subject , and the matter has since , on several occasions* been brought up for discussion . In the negotiations of 1823 , the American minister was autborized , if Great Britain would agree to abolish impressment , to stipulate to exclude all natural-born subjects of the belligerent party , not naturalized before the commencement of the war , from the public or private naval service of the neutral , and even to extend the exclusion to all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Great Britain was then unwilling to treat on the matter . Impressment was also one of the numerous subjects confided to Mr. Gallatin , during his mission to London in 1826 . In consequence , however , of wbat had previously occurred , that eminent diplomatist , though authorized to receive and discuss , was not permitted to make , any new proposals ; and be found , that , " though Mr. Canning ( who was then premier ) was , as Lord Castlereagh had been , ahead of public opinion or national pride , he did not feel himself quite strong enough to encounter those sentiments , and to give new arms to his adversaries ; and notwithstanding his conviction that an agreement such as we might accept was extremely desirable , he was not prepared at that time to make the proposal . " // The change in the relative power of the two parties since the occurrences referred to , as well as the alterations in the mode of manning the royal navy , will probably prevent any recurrence of the practice ; hut we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader the able argument of Mr. Webster upon this topic , addressed during the late negotiation to Lord Ashburton . Irrespective of the question of right , the Secretary clearly shows , on grounds somewhat novel , that the practice is opposed to the interests of England . To continue the claim is to put obstacles in the way of the emigration , which has proved so beneficial both to Great Britain and the United States . " England acknowledges herself overburdened with population of the poorer classes . Every instance of the emigration of persons of these classes is regarded by her as a benefit . England therefore encourages emigration ; means are voluntarily supplied to emigrants to assist their conveyance , from public funds ; and the New World , and most especiajly these United States , receive the many thousands of her subjects thus ejected from the bosom of their native land by the necessities of their condition . They come away from poverty and distress in over-crowded cities , to seek employment , comfort , and new homes , in a country of free institutions , possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having laws and usages in many respects like those to which they have been accustomed ; and a country which , upon the whole , is found to possess more attractions for persons of their character and condition than any other on the face of the globe . " In time , they mingle with the new community in which they find themselves , and seek means of living ; some find employment in the cities , others go to the frontiers , to cultivate lands reclaimed from the forests ; and a greater or less number of the residue , becoming in time naturalized citizens , enter into the merchant service , under the flag of their adopted country . If war should break out between England and a European power , can any thing be more unjust , any thing more irreconcilable to the general sentiments of mankind , than that England should seek out these persons , thus encouraged by her , and compelled by their own condition , to leave their own native homes , tear them away from their new employments , their new political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undergo the dangers and hardships of a military service for a country which . // has thus ceased to be their own country ? Is it not far more reasonable , that England should either prevent such emigration of her subjects , or that , if she encourage and promote it , she should leave them , not to the embroilment of a double and a contradictory allegiance , but to their own voluntary choice to form such relations , political or social , as they see fit in the country where they are to find their bread , and to the laws and institutions of which they are to look for defence and protection ? " - pp. 740-742 . The exemption of American vessels , driven by stress of weather into ports in the Bahama Isles , from the operation of the English laws , so far as regards property in the slaves which may he on board of them , is maintained by Mr. Webster on the ground , that a vessel at sea is to be regarded as part of the territory to which she belongs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the intention of the owner or master , can not affect her rights . Furthermore , " By the comity of the law of nations , and the practice of modern times , merchant-vessels entering open ports of other nations , for the purpose of trade , are presumed to bring with them , and to retain for their protection and government , the jurisdiction and laws of their own country . " " If , ' * he adds , " vessels of the United States , pursuing lawful voyages from port to port , along their own shore , are driven by stress of weather , or carried by unlawful force , into English ports , the government of the United States can not consent that the local authorities in these ports shall take advantage of such misfortunes , and enter them for the purpose of interfering with the condition of persons or things on board , as established by their own laws .

But slaves on board of American vessels , lying in British waters , are not within the exclusive jurisdiction of England , or under the exclusive operation of English law ; and this founds the broad distinction between the cases . " - p. 729 . The attempt of England , sanctioned as it is by treaties with most of the maritime powers of Europe , to visit vessels on the coast of Africa , with a view to ascertain whether they are slavers and belong to a country which has conceded the reciprocal right of search , was a matter of exciting discussion between the governments of the United States and // Great Britain , to settle which was one of the primary objects of Lord Ashburton 's mission . The treaty of Washington , however , leaves untouched the principle in dispute , and merely provides for the maintenance of independent squadrons for the suppression of the slave-trade ; and though the United States and Great Britain have affixed to this traffic the denomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding some indications which were at first given of a contrary nature , have concurred in considering it merely an offence against the municipal law , to be tried in the courts of the nation to which the vessel belongs , or by the mixed commissions established by special treaties , and not as a violation of the law of nations , which would authorize all civilized powers to regard the parties engaged in it as outlaws . Indeed , the proposition made by Lord Castlereagh to the Congress of Aix Ia Chapelle , in 1818 , to denounce the slave-trade as piracy , was unqualifiedly rejected by the allied powers . The right of riparian inhabitants to the use of navigable rivers to their outlet is a subject , the discussion of which has been of late years very interesting to the people both of Europe and America . It was agitated in 1784 , by Joseph the Second , in relation to the Scheldt , the great outlet of the Catholic Belgic provinces , which had been closed by the treaty of Westphalia ; but the difficulties between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the latter of the desired privilege . After the American Revolution , the question came up between the United States and Spain , in relation to the Mississippi , and attracted the attention of the Congress of the Confederation , besides furnishing occasion for the earliest diplomatic negotiations with Spain under our new government . By the treaty of 1763 , the Mississippi had been made the boundary between the English and French possessions in Am ? rica , and the right of navigation established in favor of the subjects of Great Britain , from its source to the sea . Louisiana was subsequently ceded by France to Spain ; and in the treaty of 1783 , between the United States and Great Britain , the right of navigation , so far as these two powers were concerned , was secured to both . Spain , however , resisted the claim , on the ground of having gained possession of both banks of the river at its mouth ; while // the right was claimed by the United States , as well by the law of nature and nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute was terminated by the treaty of San Lorenzo el Real , in 1795 , by which it was agreed , that the navigation of the Mississippi should be free in its whole breadth , from its source to the ocean , to citizens of the United States . By the cession of Louisiana to France , and its subsequent acquisition by the United States , and by the omission in the treaty of Ghent to renew the stipulation in favor of Great Britain as to the Mississippi , no part of which , it has been ascertained , lies in British territory , the right to its navigation has become exclusive in the United States . By the treaty of Paris , in 1814 , it had been stipulated , that the navigation of the Rhine and the Scheldt should be free ; and the discussions for effecting that object form an interesting chapter in the proceedings of the Congress of Vienna . By the final act of that body , as well as by the treaties between the riparian states of Germany , and by the conventions for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . Similar arrangements have been made as to other rivers of Europe , so that , in practice , subject perhaps to certain regulations as to tolls for the preservation of the works and the regulation of the police , the right of all the inhabitants bordering on a river to the use of it to the sea may be considered as part of the public law of Europe . An attempt has more than once been made by the United States to apply these principles to the navigation of the St. Lawrence . Our claim is supported , also , not only by the consideration , that the St. Lawrence was a joint acquisition at the time when the American Colonies and Great Britain constituted but one people , hut by the fact , that the river is to be regarded as the outlet of the mediterranean seas of our continent , the navigation of which belongs exclusively to us and England . Great Britain , on her side , declares the right of passage to be an imperfect right , exclusively under the control of the local sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this matter . Indeed , she has insisted , that there is no distinction between a passage by land and one by water , and that she might make as good a claim to pass over our territory to the ocean , either by land , or by the // artificial navigation which the State of New York has created , and the Hudson . Incontestable as is our right , we may be permitted to remark , that the withholding of it probably operates more injuriously to Great Britain than to us . The effect of its being conceded might be to divert no small portion of the trade upon the Lakes from our own seaboard to Montreal and Quebec . The right of intervention of one nation in the affairs of another presents a most delicate question of international law . It is not only difficult to lay down any fixed principles by which it may be regulated , but the very admission of the right , in any form , opens the door to indefinite abuse . We know not that we can better illustrate this position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by Mr. Wheaton , in which the attempt has been made to apply the rule . For an intervention to preserve the balance of power , the dispute respecting the Spanish succession in the beginning of the eighteenth century afforded a plausible pretext . The powers of Europe interfered , in opposition to the feelings and wishes of the Spanish nation , to prevent its union with France or Austria , which would reconstruct the empire of Charles the Fifth , and thereby be prejudicial to the independence of other states . The acceptance of the testament made in favor of the Duc d'Anjou , grandson of Louis the Fourteenth , was the cause of a bloody war , which was terminated only by the peace of Utrecht . That treaty sanctioned the right of intervention , by establishing as a fundamental rule of European law , and without reference to the will of the nation , the separation of Spain and France , while it gave to the House of Austria possessions no less valuable than Belgium , Milan , and Naples . The next occasion for the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession , on the death of Charles the Sixth , the last male descendant of the House of Hapsburg . The object of the coalition to which this event gave rise was not to preserve , but to overturn , the existing balance of power in Europe , by partitioning the greater part of the Austrian dominions between Bavaria , Saxony , Prussia , and Spain . Even Frederick the Second rested his claim to Silesia , as his own Memoirs show , on grounds such as those by which military conquerors justify aggression . The questions , however , which the death of 28 * // Charles the Sixth occasioned , were ultimately settled , at the peace of Aix la Chapelle , by the recognition of the pragmatic sanction in favor of his daughter , and without any other diminution of her dominions than the cession of Silesia to Prussia , and of one or two unimportant Italian principalities to an Infante of Spain . The Seven Years ' war , as that of 1756 is often termed , is principally memorable to us on this side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France in America , and left her great rival undisputed mistress of all those portions of the North American continent which were not the property of Spain . It was , also , not without its influence on the relative position of European states . The attempt of France and Spain to form that combination , which it was the object of the treaty of Utrecht to prevent , had been without effect , Great Britain triumphing over their combined naval forces . Prussia , however , at this epoch , had become a firstrate power ; and Russia , having previously acquired a large territory on the Baltic , began to assume her position in the affairs of Europe ; while Sweden , by her cessions , became more than proportionably impoverished , and Spain and Holland lost the position which they had once occupied . The defects in the internal constitution of Poland afforded no apology for an act of wanton spoliation , in which the ablest sovereigns of their times , Frederick and Catharine , took part , and Austria , the other party , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally settled by a convention signed at St. Petersburg on the 5th of August , 1772 ; and this most wanton aggression was justified , by the declarations of the respective powers , from the necessity of intervention , in order that their own mutual harmony and friendship might not be destroyed by the disorders of the republic , and that more natural and sure boundaries might be established for Poland . This partition was finally confirmed i*1775 by the diet ; but from this time Russia regarded Poland as a conquered province . In 1788 , however , an estrangement between Prussia and Russia led to a treaty between what remained of Poland and the former power , and a new constitution , abolishing the liberum veto , and rendering the crown hereditary in the electoral house of Saxony , was adopted . But the hopes of this unfortunate people were but short-lived , and their ally again became their despoiler . A // second partition was made between Russia and Prussia in 1793 ; and in 1795 the work was completed by the third partition between Austria , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous was the fact , that it was consummated at the very time when the partitioning powers were preaching a crusade against France , on account of her revolutionary doctrines , the influence of which , they asserted , was used for external aggrandizement . The proceeding of Austria in relation to the Bavarian succession , in 1778 , was so palpably a case of spoliation of a weak by a stronger power , as not to require any comments . Another case of intervention was that of Prussia in the internal affairs of Holland , in 1787 , for the purpose of restoring the stadtholder , who had been suspended from his functions by the States General ; the immediate apology for interference being an alleged indignity offered to his wife , who was a princess of Prussia . The stadtholder was restored by foreign force , and sustained by treaties concluded with Great Britain and Prussia guarantying his power , while the leaders of the patriotic party were banished . This action was one of the most unjustifiable cases of interference on record , being a foreign guaranty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself , for which a parallel is to be found only in the stipulation after the first disastrous partition of Poland , by which a right of interposition was accorded to Russia . The alliance thus formed proceeded to interfere in the affairs of other nations , and interposed , in 1790 , between Joseph the Second and his revolted Belgic provinces . This same triple alliance continued to exercise an influence in the affairs of Europe till the French Revolution ; and its mediation was employed in the wars between Russia and Sweden , and between Austria and the Porte , and Russia and the Porte . The part which the French government took between Gre*tt Britain and her colonies , in the war of the American Revolution , has been cited as another case of intervention in the internal affairs of states . The treaties , however , which France made with the United States were based on the assumed fact of their actual independence ; and when her right to treat with them was denied , she offered the example of Queen Elizabeth , in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England not only made a treaty with // the revolted provinces , but published a manifesto declaring her determination to sustain them , her course occasioned no rupture with Spain . " It was sufficient for his Majesty 's justification , that the colonies , forming by their number and the extent of their territory a considerable nation , had established their independence , not merely by a solemn declaration , but also in fact , and had maintained it against all the efforts of the mother country . " The application of the principle of intervention again occurs in the war of the French Revolution . This was an interference of a peculiar nature , intended to prevent the spread of revolutionary principles , and to preserve the balance of power by hindering the undue extension of the French dominions . The first attempt to meddle with her internal affairs was made by the Emperor Leopold , in behalf of the German princes who had feudal tenures and tithes in Alsace ; the emperor , at least , had a pretext for his conduct , because he had guarantied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . The Austrian ultimatum of the 7th of April , 1792 , requiring the reestablishment of the monarchy on the basis of the 23d of June , 1789 , was a direct interference in the domestic concerns of France , which could not but justify the declaration of war that ensued . The Prussian manifesto distinctly sets forth , among the causes of war , the propagation of principles subversive of social order , which had thrown France into confusion . " To prevent the incalculable evils which might result to France , to Europe , and to humanity in general ; to suppress anarchy in France ; to reestablish for this purpose a lawful power on the essential basis of a monarchical form ; and by these means to secure other governments against the criminal and incendiary efforts of a band of madmen , - such was the great object of the king and his ally . " The institutions of Great Britain would , not permit her to assume the same grounds of intervention as the continental powers had done . Her complaints were founded on the meditated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invasion of the Netherlands , and the encouragement of revolts in other countries . She was anticipated in her declaration of hostilities but Mr. Pitt said , that the English would not have gone to war to change the internal government of France , but being at war , they had a right to contend for what would give them // security ; and Lord Mornington , afterwards the Marquis of Wellesley , stated , in 1794 , that , " while the present or any other Jacobin government exists in France , no proposition for peace can he made or received by us . " The Congress of Vienna assumed avowedly the office of reconstructing the system of Europe , and the four great powers , Austria , Great Britain , Russia , and Prussia , asserted the right of disposing of all the territories of the French empire , which were not contained in the limits assigned to France , under her restored monarch ; though they subsequently admitted , as members of the directing committee , the plenipotentiaries of France , Spain , Sweden , and Portugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . The intervention of Austria , Russia , and Prussia , the three powers that properly constituted the " Holy Alliance , " in the Neapolitan revolution of 1820 ; of Austria , in that of Piedmont , in 1821 ; and of France , in the Spanish revolution of 1822 , were cases of direct interference in the internal affairs of other states , based upon the propriety of making a general crusade against all revolutionary movements , and all constitutional changes which did not proceed from the sovereign himself . But in none of these proceedings did Great Britain concur . Indeed , on the last occasion , England , as well as the United States , protested against the right of the allied powers to interfere between Spain and her American colonies ; and the United States declared , that they would consider any attempt on the part of the allied powers to extend their peculiar political system to the American continent as dangerous to our peace and safety . The intervention of Great Britain , in 1826 , in the affairs of Portugal , was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended by her to enforce the establishment of the Portuguese constitution against the will of the people ; but to prevent any thing being done by others to hinder this constitution from being carried into effect . The convention of 1834 , the quadruple treaty between France , Great Britain , Spain , and Portugal , was alleged to be founded not only on the preceding considerations , but on the disadvantages which the movements of Don Carlos of Spain , in conjunction with Don Miguel of Portugal , occasioned to both the governments of the Peninsula , and to compel these princes to withdraw from the Portuguese domimons. // Jurisdiction over the controversy between Belgium and Holland was assumed in consequence of the application of the king of the Netherlands to the British government , requesting that plenipotentiaries of the five powers might assemble in congress to effect a conciliation between the two portions of his kingdom . The armistice , which was at once proposed by the conference , was accepted by the king of the Netherlands and by the provisional government of Belgium . There was , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent proceedings of the congress , - the king of the Netherlands denying their right to dismember his kingdom , while the Belgians insisted that they were not bound by treaties contracted by the Netherlands , to which they were not a party . A treaty was made , in 1831 , between Belgium and the five powers , and France and Great Britain united to compel the king of the Netherlands to evacuate the territory ; and by a treaty between Belgium and Holland , in 1837 , the arrangements of the five powers were finally carried into effect . Mr. Wheaton closes with the following remarks his notice of the discussions at this conference of London : " Thus was terminated this long and tedious negotiation , which , in the course of its progress , alternately assumed the character of a mediation , of a forcible arbitration , or of an armed interference , according to the varying events of the struggle , and the fluctuating views of the powers who were interested in terminating it . " Nor has the principle of intervention been confined to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was applied by France , Great Britain , and Russia to the Greek revolution , and was carried out by the battle of Navarino , and the occupation of the Morea by the French troops , when the independence of Greece was recognized by the Ottoman Porte , under the mediation of the three contracting powers . In 1833 , the interposition of the Christian states of Europe in the affairs of Turkey assumed a new form , so that they became the guardians of the integrity of the Ottoman empire against one of its principal vassals . The Porte demanded the protection of Austria , Great Britain , and France against Mehemet Ali , and the forces of Russia were placed at the disposition of the sultan . A settlement was subsequently made with the pacha , under the mediation of England and France . This arrangement was followed by // the treaty of Unkiar Skellessi , which seemed to give to the relations of Russia with the Porte a new character , by introducing the armed intervention of the former into the internal affairs of Turkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recover his lost provinces , and of the pacha to assert his independence , the Western powers of Europe determined to interfere , to save the Ottoman empire from the aggressions of Mehemet Ali , on the one side , and from the exclusive protectorate of Russia , on the other . An arrangement was finally made , in 1840 , between the Porte and all the great European powers , except France , for the pacification of the East . Schemes have been at different times devised by philanthropists for the purpose of putting an end to all war , and in the work before us the plans of St. Pierre and Rousseau , of Bentham and Kant , for effecting this object , are given in detail . In some shape or other , they are all referable to the principle of arbitration , or of a general council of nations , which . may serve as a great tribunal , whose jurisdiction all states are to acknowledge . This project can not be deemed a wholly untried experiment . The limited history of the United States presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference , that of the question respecting the Northeastern boundary to the king of the Netherlands , is not calculated to give us a favorable idea of the mode in which such friendly offices are performed . The Holy Alliance , when it parcelled out kingdoms at Vienna , sacrificing Poland to Russia , the greater part of Saxony to Prussia , and the ancient republics of Genoa and Venice to Sardinia and Austria ; and when it met at Troppau and Laybach , to sustain the rights of sovereigns against their subjects , was exercising , under the most solemn sanctions of religion , that general superintendence over the affairs of Europe , which the philanthropists propose to vest in a general council . If it , be objected , that the declared views of these sovereigns , and the circumstances out of which the alliance grew , afford a peculiar explanation for their hostility to popular institutions , - what is to prevent , in any confederation of independent states , that result which we see in the Germanic confederation , where the great powers of Austria and Prussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of all participation // in the general business of the diet , but which has enabled them to interfere in the internal concerns of the several states for the maintenance of monarchical pretensions against popular rights , and to create and sustain , even by military force , a censorship of the press more severe than any individual sovereign has ever established within his own dominions ? Nor are the annals of the present Germanic confederacy calculated to recommend to us another mode of settlement of national disputes , which has more than once been suggested to our government , - a reference to foreign jurists . This course was proposed by Mr. Jay , while secretary of state under the old Confederation , for the settlement of our Eastern line and the determination of the St. Croix ; and was likewise adverted to in the negotiations about the Northeastern boundary , which both preceded and followed the arbitration of the king of the Netherlands . But when we recollect , that the same Mr. Gentz , who , in 1812 and 1813 , made the most eloquent appeals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew up the protocol of the diet of 1832 , virtually annihilating those constitutional guaranties which even the Congress of Vienna had deemed it necessary to provide for the people against their local sovereigns , one may well doubt the independence and impartiality , however elevated the intelligence , of any tribunal thus constituted , especially when the influence of a sovereign or a powerful state is brought to bear upon the rights of subjects , or on the pretensions of weak neighbours . Great as have been the calamities of war , it may well be doubted whether they ought not to be encountered , in preference to a system which would divest every small state of the perfect independence which belongs to all sovereignties . In the ameliorations of every kind which mark the present age , we see many circumstances that tend to lessen the extent and frequency of national hostilities . The discovery of gunpowder , by the very magnitude of the destruction which it causes , and by the calculations of which it is susceptible in practice , greatly lessened the frequency of war . Steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of human labor , will be found not without correspondent influence in belligerent affairs . Who can tell what a revolution the action of steamers is to cause in future maritime contests ? What influence is the power // of concentrating , by means of railroads , the whole population of a country on a given point , to have on future invasions ? Considerations of self-interest and the mutual dependence of nations have also taught them not rashly to interrupt that commerce which is equally important to all parties . In the universal dissemination of the principles of free intercourse we look for that abolition of war , which we should consider to be purchased at too great a sacrifice , if it were brought about by subjecting , through another Holy Alliance or European congress , all the minor states of the world to the arrogance of England or the despotism of Russia.
