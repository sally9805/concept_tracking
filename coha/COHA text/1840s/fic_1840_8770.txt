PREFACE . It scarcely befits the author of a comedy to meet his readers with a rueful visage , and to give them a prologue seasoned with as many hardships as there are pebbles in a pudding served at a country inn . Were this his privilege , the present entertainer might spread one of the most delicate and delicious banquets of mishap that it has ever been the dolorous fortune of the reader to sit down to . First , we should have a little railing at the managers , the sworn foes to dramatic writers , who lie in wait , as is well known , behind the door of the green-room , to knock the poor gentlemen 's brains out without paying , as gentlemen should , for their sport . It would be impossible in this place too , to pass over a dissertation on the impertinence of producing , at an American theatre , a constant succession of farces with sir Harry Humdrum , my Lord Noddy , and my Lady Highdiddlediddle , attended by flying squads of waiters in livery and coachmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene or personage that has the recommendation of fitness , either in respect to time , place , or audience . In fact , the author might safely dilate on the manifest injustice of not allowing a solitary devil of a poor republican to show his visnomy on the stage more than once in a quarter , and then , only with an English playwright at his back . That the Americans are a stolid , melancholy , long-visaged people , is quite evident from this  --  that they have not , up to this moment , furnished , as far as the present author is advised , material for the concoction of a single genuine and legitimate comedy . The citizen who is employed in the manufacture of constables and aldermen by the year , governors bi-yearly , and presidents quadrennially , may be readily supposed to be too much engaged in this weighty business to find time for the contrivance of idle plays and poems ; although he may be all the while furnishing very admirable material to such lookers-on as have leisure for sketching his worship in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word should be said on the evident absurdity , on the part of our legislature , of enacting a law by which remuneration should be secured to such idle persons as spend their time in the writing of plays . The builder of a cotton umbrella , or the creator of a four-hooped tub , are objects sufficiently dignified for the regards of a senator or representative , because the one may secure the said senator or representative a dry sconce in a shower , and the other a supply of jerked beef in an emergency :  --  but what claim , we beseech you , has a vagabond dramatist , who works in feelings , affections , mirths , and melancholies , upon these pluvious and hungry legislators ?  --  They would as soon think of incorporating a guild of eagles to gaze upon the sun , as of bestowing a charter to think and write , upon the fraternity of dramatic authors . Tariffs and immunites were invented by some fool of a man of genius for the benefit of clowns and calico-mongers , and not for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroic statesman presents a gloomy-looking gun , and says , " One step  --  and you are a dead man ! " Such is his respect for the land he lives in . To the foreign merchant , the prudent statesman extends a formidable , codified document , and exclaims , " Come this side of high-water mark , and it shall cost you twenty per cent ad valorem ! " Such is his affection for the native-born gentleman who clothes his back in homespun . To the invading graindealer , the voracious statesman sends a furious inspector to say , " None of your musty wheat enters this market  --  we pray you mercy ! " Such is his reverence for the home-constructed flour-mill that satisfies his belly . Thrice honored Lycurgus !  --  His back , his belly , and his birth-place he nobly provides for ; but his mind , the immortal , far-seeing , capacious soul  --  That 's sheer stuff , impalpable , intangible , and invisible  --  and if it ca n't take care of itself , a weak , feeble , rickety intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from foreign corruptions , to secure to the home-born offspring of that mind rights of remuneration and inheritance !  --  The sagacious and enlightened M. C. scorns such Props and protections , as laws and enactments for the efforts of his own noble intellect . His speeches are spread over the face of the county in extra Globes and Intelligencers , and he receives eight dollars per diem : so what cares he for remuneration and copyright ! Is not this sound , wholesome , and safe logic for a politician ? For a politician , it is.  --  Having thus suggested what , in a certain mood , he might have said , the author can not part from the reader without giving utterance to a few present feelings of a somewhat deeper cast . In the present condition of things , a manager looks upon a manuscript American play , with , I imagine , about the same favor as he would peruse the wash-book of one of his supernumeraries , and would as soon think , under ordinary circumstances , of putting the last year 's Almanac into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatis person , ( which would in fact make a very pretty spectacle , ) as of producing a comedy by a dramatic writer born this side of Cape Look-out . An American dramatist is at once confronted and frowned back by a cheap array of sturdy strangers , in the guise of farce , burlesque , and comedy , from abroad , that have usurped exclusive authority even in his chosen places of amusement . A spirit alien to any thing that may be found in his home-born compositions starts up and warns him from the spot , with maledictions on the unlucky head that has ventured to conceive scenes of native humor , or to delineate Five Acts of the life which his simple-witted countrymen are content to live . The author of the following work , in the spirit of a liberal self-reliance , has at all times entertained the belief that America contains within itself material quite adequate for any class of literary productions which might be demanded by the public taste . Auspicious nature has , in this land , denied us no product that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : her foundations here are broad , and deeply set , and her airy summits are gilded with the lighter graces and ornaments of natural architecture . Rolling rivers , green dark woods , boundless meadows , and majestic peaks , labor together to complete the beauty and nobleness of its outward aspect . Within the mind of man there is , there must be , unless humanity is false to its trust , something that replies to these . Some spirit of beauty and truth must haunt us in our walks through scenes like these , and awaken the soul to action and utterance not unworthy , at least , of its great inspiration . This is the divine origin , the Delian birthplace of poetic thought , and the poetic progeny can not fail to attain its true growth , if the atmosphere it is allowed to breathe be not chilled or rendered impure by an ungenial or unhealthy national taste . From this grand external world , co-operating with and inspiring an equally grand and elevated human spirit , must spring the loftier creations of dramatic art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cities , the customs , habitudes , and actions of men dwelling in contact , or falling off into peculiar and individual modes of conduct , amalgamated together into a close but motley society , with religions , trades , politics , professions , and pursuits , shooting athwart the whole living mass , and forming a web infinitely diversified ; from this wonderful world of life and opinion , must grow the genial and brilliant representative of life and opinion , Comedy itself . Comedy , it is true , requires something of costume , something of age and reverence to be laughed at , some settled and canonized absurdities to mock , in order to accomplish a portion of its labors . But , rooted and fixed in the very elements of human nature , are to be found the materials with which genuine comic genius seeks to deal ; making use , however , of external aids of face , figure , dress , and action , as the exponents and betrayers of the spirit of folly or humor that lurks within . To say that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst ourselves , is to assert that so great a revolution has been wrought in human nature , that it has ceased to be itself . In truth , with high and generous qualities which have carried us nobly through all past struggles of action , we have proved ourselves , I fear , greatly wanting in lofty and manly self-dependence , in all that relates to the nobler intellectual duties . A resolution to repudiate , without respect to foreign authority , whatever is really hostile to the true national spirit , and to give a welcome to whatever embodies or appeals to it , ( I mean in no false or grovelling sense , ) would go far towards achieving many of the benefits proposed by legislation and restriction . If we are but true to ourselves , no law , no state of things can be false to us . We are first traitors to ourselves , and the law , as a matter of course , follows us as a deserter . We establish a league of disastrous amity with folly and injustice , and we soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though seemingly our country , a place in truth of alien and unhappy servitude . Let us have free thoughts and home thoughts , or let us cease to live ! It only remains for the author to dismiss the reader to the perusal of the following work  --  he could have hoped with a more cheerful and less earnest welcome , but the full heart will have its way  --  with the declaration , that it will be a life-long pleasure to him , if this humble dramatic attempt shall furnish the least countenance to the cause of a true National Literature !

Brisk Now for a capital stroke of policy , Crowder.  --  We must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thought I had ; we must be of the same sect of thinkers :  --  The very thought . BRISK . Brisk Yes , you can look through the thing : many of the more quiet voters being accustomed to its Sunday summons would be brought out and would readily aid our ticket , if they understood the steeple for the time to be in the hands of our party . You see ? CROWDER . Crowder Exactly so ; and with a banner displayed , and our ticket spread on the weathercock , they could not fail to comprehend our views at a glance . BRISK . Brisk Particularly as the weathercock 's a silverside with a gold ball in his mouth ! But you mentioned the porter houses at the upper end of the ward ? CROWDER . Crowder You must make a tour of them immediately . The best arrangement will be to brandy with those in Scammel street , and take your supper of cutlets and pale ale at Works 's with his boarders  --  who , you know , are chiefly retired ragamuffins , disbanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the poll . BRISK . Brisk If that must be done , could n't you get Tom Lug out of the way while I 'm there ? Pah ! the thought of him makes me sick ; a double distilled scamp . CROWDER . Crowder With great influence however , greater than the best citizen we have . I would not insure your election if Mr. Lug 's feelings are ruffled in the slightest . BRISK . Brisk I must digest him then with the coarse steaks , as if they were both as savory as grilled woodcocks  --  that 's all . I only ask Heaven for a dry night  --  for he comes staggering in from a shower , with his drippings , soaked through and steaming like a swamp . CROWDER . Crowder But there are others whom you must know and take by the hand , or they 'll call you an aristocrat . BRISK . Brisk Oh ! I must be spared that title . They may name me toad , snake , dog , monkey  --  but not aristocrat . If the popular nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended , and it veers instantly the other way to catch the odor ( more grateful to its organ ) of gentle loaferism.  --  Who are your other vagabonds ? CROWDER . Crowder There 's a short man with a large mouth , and a scar on his cheek . BRISK . Brisk That 's Joe Surge , by the token : as rough a Christian as ever came into the world , and whose character is as offensive as Tom Lug 's person . CROWDER . Crowder But Joe carries a whole block with him , besides his river influence among the hard-drinking fishermen and shipjoiners . BRISK . Brisk Well , we must be charitable in our constructions ; that gives me a different opinion of the man  --  there are worse fellows than Joe Surge , I am satisfied .  --  How about the revolutionary veteran ? that 's capital too good to be wasted . CROWDER . Crowder He deposits the first vote on our side , and we think of bandaging one of his legs and placing a patch over his eye , to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it to have his vote challenged by the other party it would tell amazingly in our favor , and we would get out a placard at once  --  " Disgraceful ! an old soldier dishonored , " and so forth . CROWDER . Crowder It would afford a good opportunity to call our opponents , ruffians , libellers , and miscreants ,  --  which should not be lost . BRISK . Brisk Could n't we attach two or three cases of suicide to their neglect to clear the river ? whereby , for example , many are prematurely smothered in the mud , that might otherwise have been saved by a drag-net ! CROWDER . Crowder This would hardly do , simply because no such case of devotion to water has occurred within the memory of man ; but we might plausibly charge them with the death of the watchman that was moonstruck the other night sleeping on Gudgeon 's stoop . If Gudgeon had exercised ordinary benevolence , and taken him in , in the early part of the evening , and kept him by the warm fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened .  --  That every one must see . BRISK . Brisk Excellent  --  very excellent  --  but recollect , we must follow them up with charge on charge , accusation on accusation , till they are stunned like cattle , and drop astonished to the ground :  --  You will be at my house in an hour and examine my dress , to see if its sufficiently rusty and plebeian to make me presentable at this court of loafers at Works 's . Retiring . And I say , Crowder , if you have a coat out at the elbow a little , bring it around ; my worst , I am afraid , is a month or so too much this side of shabbiness to be popular . Returns . Bring your iron snuff-box too filled with Lorillard ; and , hark you again , I must borrow that catskin cap of yours that 's moth eaten .  --  Meantime I 'll let my beard grow . Exit BRISK . SCENE II . Enter Glib . GLIB . Glib Well , Crowder , we are going to try another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall I hope there 'll not be an earthquake . CROWDER . Crowder Oh , we promise there shall be no such thing , provided you will pledge yourself to raise no hurricane harangues during the election ; nor to strike down our tallest men with your tornadoes of speech and tempests of windy declamation . No noise , no corruption  --  that 's our motto . GLIB . Glib Sly , deep , and dangerous , like a wily river ; that is the way you undermine what you wish to overthrow . CROWDER . Crowder You think that we manage it so , do you ? we that are behind the scenes and in the secrets . GLIB . Glib You behind the scenes ! you in the secrets ! Why , Crowder , you are one of those fellows in every party , who are allowed to make a noise in proportion to their real want of confidence and information ; in the same way as poor Bill Baffin the stevedore thumps and whistles and plies his mallet on the outside of a ship on the stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin-window . CROWDER . Crowder We are not hoodwinked so easily , my kind Gudgeonite ! We do n't allow ourselves to be mystified like your money-ridden citizens . GLIB . Glib Oh no , you prefer to be mystified more after the manner of a cartman 's horse with his head in a feed bag , who , if he can get a sufficiency of oats , does n't mind how much he 's in the dark . CROWDER . Crowder Darkness and light are the same to us , if we can but serve the interests of the people and protect them from the fangs of knaves and intriguers . We could pass our lives in dens , dungeons , yea , even in stalls and stables  --  GLIB . Glib With well-filled mangers and perpetual drippings from the public reservoir , to keep you in mind of your dear friends the people . Roast beef is the altar on which you swear to sustain that cause ; and at whatever sacrifice of bread and beer , you will uphold it  --  while the supplies last ! Eh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know you do  --  as if he were a monster :  --  We love paupers  --  we have an affection for them , and mean to establish the city government on a pauper basis as solid as the graywacke foundations of the island , for it is our honest belief that the deeper you go in the scale of society the richer grows the soil . GLIB . Glib And you poor gentlemen in office are the husbandmen that cultivate it ; the tillers of this arable land of salary , perquisite , and plunder . CROWDER . Crowder Sir , I 'd have you know , with us no man 's integrity is tampered with . GLIB . Glib Who ever dreamed such an absurdity ? You disdain a resort to such petty meanness  --  and what with dinners , and contracts at high rates , and a privilege to dip fifty per cent . deep into the public pocket , a worthy man 's virtue is no more exposed with you than a sea-captain 's wife whose husband has gone the Canton voyage ! CROWDER . Crowder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing offensive . We will finish this discussion at the Polls . Exit CROWDER . GLIB . Glib Ha ! ha ! ha ! upon my soul I forgot that his own aunt had been tempted in this way , and that our little alderman would-be , Mr. Brisk , was the supposed serpent in the garden . Hereafter , I must avoid such subjects  --  for to make virtue a topic with a professed politician is sure to give offence ; and if one of these fellows gets by chance among the saints in the next world , he will be as much out of place as a painter in a mob . Exit . SCENE III . A room in Gudgeon 's house . GUDGEON . Gudgeon What a glorious thing it is to be a candidate for alderman ! One wakes up in the morning , and the first thing he hears is some little politician under his window , shouting , hurrah for Gudgeon ! and the young rascal , in his enthusiasm throws his cap so high , the shadow in the dressing-glass almost makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises ; every shutter swings open with a proclamation of his virtues ; and there 's not a dead wall in the ward that does not announce his glory in the largest capitals ;  --  nor a dumb hogshead that is not vocal in approval of his nomination .  --  I shall have another seal put to the bunch at the end of my watch-chain , that 's flat , and I think I will have my calves padded . Robert Gudgeon , Esquire , Alderman ! I 'll get me a stamp cut with a flock of goslings in the centre , to show that I was reared in the country and am not ashamed of my origin ; and with this I 'll mark all the corporation documents I can lay hold of ! Enter Botch . BOTCH . Botch Have you heard this rumor , sir ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon What rumor , for Heaven 's sake ? They have n't bought up all the large flags in the ward ? BOTCH . Botch No , sir . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Have they got in a new barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I spoke to him myself last night . They have n't engaged Murphy 's two starved horses , that always operate so on the popular sympathies and bring up so many voters ? BOTCH . Botch None of these , sir ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon What then , Botch ? Be quick  --  what then ? BOTCH . Botch Why , sir , the Brisk party is going to use the belfry of the church to distribute tickets from , and they intend to employ the sexton to read prayers every morning of the election from the small window in the steeple . GUDGEON . Gudgeon This must be counteracted : it will have an overwhelming effect . We shall have the whole religious community moving against us in platoons , pew by pew ! BOTCH . Botch Something must be done , sir ; I see clearly something must be done . What shall it be , sir ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon Yes , something must be done . BOTCH . Botch Certainly  --  something must de done . GUDGEON . Gudgeon What then , in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Glib to climb the steeple above the window and deliver an harangue ? It might do away with the evil influence of the proceedings below and give us a tremendous ascendency at once . BOTCH . Botch I doubt whether Mr. Glib would undertake it , even if he could snatch a notary 's commission from the weathercock , as the chances of being made a martyr of by stoning would be considerable . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Ca n't you think of any thing else , then , Botch ? BOTCH . Botch Why , yes , sir  --  a little suggestion strikes me . How would it do if you were to be seen walking down the street by the poil , between two men drunk ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon Arm-in-arm with two drunkards ! What do you propose to gain by that ? BOTCH . Botch The finest series of popular effects ever produced . See , sir , how it operates ! You in your new blue coat , sir , with bright buttons , clean ruffles , and well-polished boots  --  looking as handsome as Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adze the tippling cooper hanging on one arm , and Ike Luff , for instance , pulling at the other , and pitching about like a scow straining at her moorings . Everybody 's attention is immediately directed to you . " Gudgeon is friendly to tavern-license  --  we 'll vote for him , " says a dealer in Hollands , " obvious from his respect for our customers . " GUDGEON . Gudgeon That fixes the tavern keepers and the tipplers ; very well . BOTCH . Botch " What a big-souled man Gudgeon is ! " says a tailor . " He 'll need a new coat every other week , when he 's made alderman  --  He knows how to use a coat , " as Ike Luff wipes his mouth on your shoulder . GUDGEON . Gudgeon That gives us the tailors and their journeymen , I suppose , and might have its effect with the cloth dealers . BOTCH . Botch Then the temperance people are your 's to a man , for if you put your mouth cunningly to the ear of your sidechampions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will suppose you are warning the poor wretches to refrain from their cups ; while the common mob will laugh , taking the whole spectacle for a very tolerable joke . GUDGEON . Gudgeon It shall be done , Botch ; and to aid the effect , I 'll have some tracts against drunkenness sticking from my coat-pockets , while you can have a few large handbills setting forth that I am in favor of retail liquor shops , posted against the opposite fence . BOTCH . Botch In favor of retail liquor shops and the new water-works ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon No , not the new water-works  --  you had better put that in a separate handbill by itself . Exeunt severally . SCENE IV . An ante-chamber at Blanding 's lodgings . OLD CRUMB . Old Crumb Somehow this young man has touched me strangely . Ever since I heard him play those plaintive tunes , my heart has been with him : he is poor  --  a mere flute-player at the theatre  --  but I love him , for he reminds me of my own youth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pathetic breath gives me back delicious moments , that are otherwise vanished for ever ; sweet evenings , tranquil noonday hours , and long , long afternoons , when the sun set with a light that can never rise again . Child and changeling of poverty as he is , he can do more for this old wearied soul of mine than any one beneath the degree of my Creator .  --  I hear him now  --  his door is ajar , and I will listen before I enter . BLANDING . Blanding ( From within . ) A city life , a city life for me  --  Far , far from the shade of the greenwood tree ! The sights and sounds that stir the nimble brain Beyond the speaking stream  --  the golden grain . The thundering shout of the gathering rout When the town goes mad and its wrath is out  --  Has more that fires the true red blood in me Than the crash of a forest in every tree . The glorious light of the city night When the stars are quenched and the lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me Than the pale round moon and all her company . CRUMB . Old Crumb A lover , and not a word of his mistress in twelve lines of poetry !  --  I am afraid this is not the true lunacy . BLANDING . Blanding ( From within . ) Fol  --  la  --  my heart  --  andino  --  has gently  --  sa  --  felt  --  allegro  --  allegro  --  sweet Kate  --  piano  --  the sharp and sure revenge of fate  --  La  --  mi  --  fol  --  sa .

That goes badly in andante  --  so  --  fa  --  me  --  fi  --  so . CRUMB . Old Crumb It 's rising . ( Tapping his forehead . ) BLANDING . Blanding If sire or shackle bind your hand , Break , break , oh break the cursed band ! CRUMB . Old Crumb He suggests elopement , on my word . BLANDING . Blanding And fly  --  too slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . Prestissimo . CRUMB . Old Crumb ( Breaking in . ) Heigh-ho ! how is this , sir  --  are you trying to set a runaway match to music ? BLANDING . Blanding I beg your pardon , sir  --  but  --  CRUMB . Old Crumb You may well do that , and the pardon of the whole city council , if you please . Meditating a rhym 'd elopment with Miss Brisk , daughter of John Brisk , candidate for alderman of the ward ! Why this is an audacious breach of ordinance . BLANDING . Blanding I  --  I  --  beg to be excused , sir  --  but her name was not mentioned by me ; it was a fancy piece that I was preparing for an opera . CRUMB . Old Crumb Yes , very pretty and very fanciful , and would answer as well as another for an opera : if there were such a thing as an opera of real life . ( Mimics him ) " Oh fate , " " sweet Kate "  --  " your hand , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised me you would not think of marriage  --  much less marriage with the heiress of an alderman  --  without my consent : and the first news I hear is , that that young scapegrace , Blanding , hath a snare set at the house of goodwife Gudgeon for Miss Kate Brisk . BLANDING . Blanding To tell the truth , my kind friend , my calculations have been thwarted by an impudent , meddling , presumptuous hussy , who took the liberty to blot out all my resolves and put her own handwriting in their place . CRUMB . Old Crumb Now I 'll warrant you will say this busybody was Nature , for we father on her all the children of our Fancy , that good Sense , the rugged overseer , refuses to provide for . If a lawyer cozen a young orphan of his patrimony , people never think to lift their hands for a curse upon the dark rascal  --  for it 's Nature , Nature ! If a stout young fellow knock down a week old man , and filch his purse and papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Or if a sly young dog , like yourself , play the incendiary with a pretty girl 's heart , and set it all-a-blaze  --  Oh , it 's Nature : if you have any fault to find , blame her . BLANDING . Blanding And if a kind old man takes an undeserving , thriftless young knave to his heart , as if he were his own child  --  whose folly is that ? CRUMB . Old Crumb Mere whim  --  mere whim  --  the world says . But I thought you were not to be a rich man , that I might take my seat in the pit for this many a long year , and always hear you play those touching old tunes , which I am sure you will never play as well when you become rich . BLANDING . Blanding I shall lose none of my success on that score , for not a penny comes with Miss Brisk unless she marries with her father 's consent , and that never will come to me CRUMB . Old Crumb Well , sir , I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my will  --  a serious ground of displeasure ; but  --  mark me  --  you shall have them both , the girl and the fortune , or I 'm an old fool . Now play me " Oh , live again , sweet time of youth "  --  ( Sits in an armchair and weeps while Blanding plays , then : ) I am an old fool after all ; an old fool ! Exit CRUMB . BLANDING . Blanding God bless the kind old man ! His promise is as sure of ripening into performance ( in this case I know not how ) as the dawn of day into a true and glorious meridian . Of all the thousands that have heard me play , he is the single one in whom music , as far as I can learn , has performed its real office , of begetting generous thoughts and kindly actions . Kate ! Kate  --  thou art mine , for in this good man 's promise I am no infidel . Exit . END OF ACT I. ACT II . SCENE I. A room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE . Kate Brisk You say you love the city , and would always live within its bounds ? BLANDING . Blanding I do , Kate , as dearly as the brown-thrasher loves the green tree that sheltered its young ! Enter Mrs. Gudgeon . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Come , come , children , you have been long enough in the orchard  --  the paradise orchard , as I call it : When Robert courted me by the well or the big walnut tree in the lane , it was always " Margery , Margery , you are awhile foddering the turkeys  --  is the Muscovy gander got among them agin and troubling you ? " from father 's house . Or it would be , " Where are you ? Robert  --  Rob  --  ert , I wish you 'd pen that ewe , or stop that cackling hen ! " or something of that sort from the stone-house across the road , where Mr. Gudgeon 's grandfather lived  --  ( he was a sad old wag ! ) and then we 'd flutter !  --  Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am looking for Mr. Gudgeon home from the meeting every minute . But what 's that you were saying about sheltering your young ? Your pin-feathers grow fast ! BLANDING . Blanding Not our own progeny , Mrs. Gudgeon  --  it was of young brown-thrashers , and not young Charles 's or Kates . Our fancies are not quite so rapid travellers , are they Kate ? KATE . Kate Brisk But , Blanding , there is no beauty and freshness in a city , I am sure , like that of the branching tree and the cloudless air :  --  the spotted flower and the sweet silent nook where the mower sits at noontide , belong not to the angry Babel that you love . What is there in a dull city to please the eye , brighten the fancy , or mend the heart ? MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Ah ! I see you are disputing the old question , whether you shall live in town or out of town ; and , if you 'll allow me to answer , Miss Kate , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ; the City Hall and the old Bridewell , to please the eye ;  --  and as to kindling up the fancy , I defy flesh to go beyond a hundred dollar Cashmere shawl in that particular  --  Besides , there 's the privilege of having the street sprinkled twice-a-week , that keeps the dust out of the parlor ! BLANDING . Blanding Yes , and there are the fops , Mrs. Gudgeon , and rogues , sharpers , and money-lenders ! all the proper children of the city . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon And a very precious family it makes ! BLANDING . Blanding Here I take my seat quietly by the wayside , under the shelter of fresh and pleasant thoughts , and look forth upon the little busy , knavish world , and see it bustling and hurrying and fretting itself like a great schoolboy behind his time , and filling its huge green satchel with all kinds of fruitless rubbish , and teasing its heart with the thought of yesterday , to-day , and to-morrow . KATE . Kate Brisk But these thoughts may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . BLANDING . Blanding They may  --  but there they come to us only like the sound of far-off bells , at intervals ; here the mighty hum of life continually tolls us on to musings and meditations like these . Here every man 's face is the frontispiece to a history . KATE . Kate Brisk Yes , and to a very dull one often :  --  BLANDING . Blanding The features I speak of need no interpreter , but are of themselves loud as an organ , in expounding their own significance or insignificance , as it may happen . There is , for example , Botch , Mr. Gudgeon 's assistant in the present election  --  a character as impossible in the country as a three story house or a roaring demagogue . He must have a hand in every thing that happens in the city : if a murder occurs , he runs and takes minutes for his own satisfaction ; he writes paragraphs for the newspapers , about street nuisances , the Navy Yard , and city finances , and signs the " Old Tar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ; " if he hears a call to organize a new party , he is on the spot to act as secretary . In a word , he 's every where and every thing , and yet he remains the same credulous little creature that the Lord made him at first  --  in spite of his scribblings , juntos , and secretaryships . KATE . Kate Brisk And I think he is the person that got an innocent butcher hanged by introducing at court a memorandum , which he had taken from the hat of the accused at the time of the fray , of a method of slaughtering a bullock , instead of his proper notes of the homicide . BLANDING . Blanding Although he was a bosom friend of the prisoner , and had boasted out of doors he could and would save his life with a word as easily as hem-stitch a navy-jacket ! KATE . Kate Brisk That 's a city character ; and no other place on the earth could confuse a man 's brains to such a pass as to have his friend hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanding Then we have politicians quarrelling who shall be crowned with most dust and honor , packet captains contending which shall run the closest chance of shipwreck , that he may soonest make a jeweller 's shop of his parlor with presentation pitchers , mugs , and goblets ;  --  men , monkeys , and monsters , sent as representatives from the four quarters of the globe : a snug birth in a belfry , with the power to enjoy all these , makes an illustrated book of life , where joy and sorrow , power , pomp , death and laughter , pass us in a perpetual pageant . Oh , how dull , how tomb-like dull are your fields and turnpikes , compared with this !  --  dull , Kate , as the very inhabitants themselves , that talk from October to August of the last camp-meeting or the next new moon ! KATE . Kate Brisk Well , Blanding , you are the better pleader , and all I can say is , that your cause requires your ingenuity  --  but the country still has charms , honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanding Faces uniform as sheep , and one everlasting pair of linsey-woolsey pantaloons . The manners are simple enough for there the three acts of man 's life are , to cut hay in summer , fodder his cattle in winter , and attend a town-meeting in spring to elect overseers of the poor . The poor !  --  they are all poor , in spirit , if not in pocket , and deserve nothing better to look out upon than one huge , green page , with a half-dozen dreary-looking trees by way of interjections ! MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon There , go  --  go , children  --  I hear Mr. Gudgeon 's hem down the street ; I 'm sure it 's his , for he has a hem of his own , like our preacher :  --  Kate , this way  --  Mr. Blanding , that if you please , for you mus n't be seen in the street any nearer together than the two sides of a pond , or my character 's ruined , and Mr. Gudgeon would , as like as not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 Enter Mr. Gudgeon . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Well  --  well  --  I am satisfied , this is certainly the proudest hour of my life . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon What now ? what now ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon You may well ask what now  --  it will astonish you , woman . Go up stairs and get your best cap on , and I 'll tell you . Mrs. Gudgeon retires and returns . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Well now , Mr. Gudgeon , ( I 'm afraid to call him Robert , he looks so grand  --  aside , ) do n't overwhelm a body . GUDGEON . Gudgeon No  --  I 'll not overwhelm you , but I 'll astonish you furiously .  --  They have appointed a committee to have my portrait taken ! MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Your own portrait ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon Yes , my own portrait of my individual self  --  Robert Gudgeon . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon And what 's to be done with it ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon What do you suppose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fire-screen , or use it to wrap cheese in ? Eh ! No , it goes into the great Hall where we hold our meetings , and it only costs me fifty dollars . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Dog-cheap  --  but do you pay for it yourself ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon Not altogether  --  but I headed the subscription list in gallant style , and they were all so well pleased with my promptness , they laughed outright with joy .  --  That must be a thorn in Brisk 's side  --  How do you think the election 's going now , Mag ? Am I safe , do you think ? quite safe  --  MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon I hope so  --  I truly hope so ; and , to make a short matter of it , I have felt a sort of presentiment that it must be . GUDGEON . Gudgeon And so have I. Some great event is clearly at hand . We have had a meteor the other night that whizzed round the sky , like a large Catharine-wheel  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Barnegat  --  and the Rain-King , only last week , caught a storm on a lightning-rod , and held it there two days , notwithstanding the entreaties of the neighboring county , that was suffering sorely under a drouth.  --  What do these things mean ? what do they refer to ? The approach of the comet foretold in the Farmer 's Almanac  --  or  --  it may be so  --  ( for I recollect the birth of my father 's five-legged calf , in Danbury , was brought on by an early sun-rise )  --  the election of Robert Gudgeon as alderman .  --  I think I shall sleep sound to-night , unless disturbed by that vexatious dream again . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon That dream , if it 's the same you told me of , is lucky . If it comes to you again , encourage it  --  give it welcome , and in order to provide a substantial welcome for it , you had better finish the cold turkey and the other half of the goosepie before you retire . Exeunt . SCENE II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brisk . OLD CRUMB . Old Crumb Perhaps the young man is my equal or yours , sir ! BRISK . Brisk My equal ! Sir , he is a paltry flute-player at the theatre  --  a twelve-shilling-a-week whistler and inspirer of dead wood ! CRUMB . Old Crumb But he is a man . ( In an under tone , ) I will strive to restrain myself , although human patience is a frail thing . BRISK . Brisk A man ! not be ; I will warrant now , though I have never seen his person , he is a tall , lank , thin-chopped fellow , that hath blown his brains out with his flageolet , as effectually as if he had applied a pistol to his skull : CRUMB . Old Crumb You are exceedingly happy in your illustrations . ( Under tone , ) I rise fast  --  I am already at blood-heat . BRISK . Brisk That he goes simpering about , like a feeble oysterman , sliding out his quavers and crotchets , and tapping on tables and hat-crowns with his fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving the wear and tear of instruments . CRUMB . Old Crumb Well , sir ! ( Under tone , ) Summer is coming on me swiftly . BRISK . Brisk And when he talks to you , he drops his breath and sighs as if it were a pity to rob his dog's-pipe , the flute , of so much good inspiration . Now of what use can such a fellow make himself as my son-in-law ? Can he control twelve votes ? Would a bill-sticker , or even the distributor of a quack-doctor 's puffs , change his mind to please this upstart ? CRUMB . Old Crumb Now hear me , sir ! ( Under tone , ) I am in the torrid zone ; I burn . BRISK . Brisk You show me no consideration : CRUMB . Old Crumb You deserve none  --  BRISK . Brisk No equivalent : CRUMB . Old Crumb As for that , I 'll furnish you forthwith . This abused young gentleman , then , sir , is an honester man , in my poor judgment , than your vile office-seeker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from porter-house to porter-house , like a collector of tavern-rates ; haunts barber-shops , as if he were a wig-block ; plants himself on corners and curbstones , as if he were fixed there to supply citizens with light at noonday  --  and at length  --  BRISK . Brisk Yes , at length ? What at length ? CRUMB . Old Crumb When he is birthed in an office , the poor rascal 's heaven , he fattens like a dull young bullock on grass wet with the precious night dew ; rents a whole pew on Sunday ; allows his wife to keep two servants and to wear three-shilling calico . Pah ! the fellow smells odious of tobacco ! BRISK . Brisk With all this , sir , your Mr. Blanding , I repeat , is not my equal , nor a proper suitor for my daughter . He is not in the same rank  --  in the same station with me . CRUMB . Old Crumb No  --  no . His station is at the zenith , where there is shining virtue , truth , integrity , honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base , dull nadir , where knavery , fraud , cozenage , and double-dealing abide . He is a zodiac , a living zodiac of many manly qualities ; you a mere wooden imitation , a hollow mockery of these true planets that govern man 's life . He has not a mercenary particle of earth about him  --  BRISK . Brisk No , for I doubt if he is worth a shilling in the world . CRUMB . Old Crumb You , sir , since you have forced me to the truth , if coach-wheels were but spoked with gold , would be an active running footman all your life , for the sake of enjoying the glitter . BRISK . Brisk A noble object , sir , in my view , a coach with pure golden wheels ; at mid-day it could be seen a league off . CRUMB . Old Crumb He , sir , looks upon Nature and society with the eye of truth and fancy  --  gathering out of them the true purposes of life , and food to feed those purposes ; you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the credulity of the world ; set your follies out for sale ; call about you gaping chapmen , who are in the market for a ranting demagogue , in sound mouthing condition , and warranted kind in harness ! In a word , he has a soul  --  because he is a man ; you have none , because the cost of keeping is too high in these trying times !  --  So  --  good day to your aldermanship ! Exit Crumb . BRISK . Brisk Well , although I am somewhat astonished  --  this old Whirlwind may blow as much as he pleases , but he can not blow me out of my present opinion of this fellow , Blanding . Presumption ! Brazen-faced hardihood ! a paltry musician , without rank , fortune , or title , to lift his eyes upon my daughter ! Why , if it were uttered in the open air at night , it would make the very man in the moon , who has outstared a thousand generations , blush deep scalret . My equal ! my superior !  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own house and controller of my daughter 's motions ; and if he crosses the threshold of the one , or gets within eyeshot of the other , why he 's welcome to her hand I 'll assure him , and I 'll lend him my ears to make a nice satchel of to carry his flute in ! This is disposed of , and now I must dress for the supper . Exit . SCENE III . The kitchen of Works 's Hotel . A table spread , lights , &c.; Landlord , Tom Lug , and others . To them enters Brisk . LANDLORD . Landlord Gentleman , here 's Mr. Brisk ! TOM LUG . Tom Lug Where ? where ?  --  Three cheers for his excellency ! BRISK . Brisk Ah , Thomas , it does me good to take you by the hand , you hearty old fellow  --  William  --  James  --  Surge , are you here too ?  --  On my soul it 's as fine for the eye as a visit to the Museum , to see so many honest friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and odorous mummies are as pleasant . TOM LUG . Tom Lug How 's Mrs. Brisk ? BRISK . Brisk Dead these ten years , Tom . TOM LUG . Tom Lug Beg your pardon  --  then she 's as dead as old Adam himself ; but how 's your daughter ? BRISK . Brisk Well , I thank you , Thomas . How is your family , Mr. Surge ? SURGE . Joe Surge ( Laughing . ) Your honor 's jokin ' with me now  --  now confess your honor  --  playing the crab , eh !  --  comin ' the blind eel over us ?  --  How 's your family ! now that 's too good ! BRISK . Brisk Well , how is your family ? LANDLORD . Landlord You must excuse him from answering that question  --  any other , I have no doubt , he would with pleasure  --  but ( whispers , ) he 's been in the penitentiary ever since he was of marriageable age . BRISK . Brisk Oh ! ( Aside )  --  I thought as much ;  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the same continent with such a fellow . He is enough to infect an entire hemisphere , like the plague . LANDLORD . Landlord Mr. Brisk , will you be good enough to take the head of the table , with the respects of the company ? BRISK . Brisk No  --  no  --  you must excuse me , if you will ; let one of these worthy gentlemen preside , if you please . ( Aside , ) And save me from neighborhood to Mr. Surge . LANDLORD . Landlord Well , Tom Lug , come this way . Here , put your face between these two bottles of porter , and keep your eye steadily on the water-cresses , and you may hold sober till we are through . They take their places at the table . TOM LUG . Tom Lug Alderman , what do you think of this alistockingcy that 's agin us at the Polls ?  --  They say I ai nt fit to be governor of the state because I 'm out at elbows , and have had a little quarrel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I seen figureheads of Romans and other gentlemen in the bows of as big ships as ever floated out of this port ? and was n't they naked , excepting a little roll of linen over their breasts , and a sprig of poplar in their hand ? BRISK . Brisk You not fit for governor ! that 's a pretty joke . You are fit for any thing . ( Aside )  --  Among others , from a peculiar conformation of neck , for the gallows .  --  The man that says a pauper  --  yea , a vagabond , Tom  --  is not suitable to hold the highest dignities in the gift of the people , is a traitor and a scoundrel . TOM LUG . Tom Lug That 's a noble sentiment  --  a high-minded sentiment . Let 's have his health  --  Gem'men , the health of our next alderman , Mr. John Brisk . Drunk standing , boys . They drink it . BRISK . Brisk ( Rising . ) In return , gentlemen , for this flattering toast , let me offer you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal more genuine honor and virtue beneath their rags , than King Solomon in his Sunday clothes , or a Fourth of July orator in his new-bought ruffle and wristbands ! " SURGE . Joe Surge ( Maudlin drunk . ) They call me names , alderman  --  they abuse poor Joe Surge  --  and one of the Gudgeon gentry called me a tadpole . Weeps . BRISK . Brisk Why did he call you tadpole , Joseph ? SURGE . Joe Surge Because  --  because  --  your honor , I have n't had  --  a clean shirt on these three year . Tadpoles lives in mud , your honor knows . BRISK . Brisk And what do they call you , Tom ? TOM LUG . Tom Lug Why , your honor , one of the canvassers returns me as a resident turkle ! BRISK . Brisk How is that ? TOM LUG . Tom Lug ' Cause I never comes out of this old corduroy jacket of mine . BRISK . Brisk What name have these worthy gentlemen ? I suppose you are all christened . TOM LUG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they always have dirty faces .  --  Now , alderman , give us a song for answering a these questions . BRISK . Brisk One more  --  Has your worthy landlord no title ? COOK . Cook ( Speaks up . ) Yes , an it please Alderman Brisk , your honor  --  we call him the chimbly-swallow , for he 's for everlasting poking about the hearth and smelling the smoke and the dishes . TOM LUG . Tom Lug Now for the song ! ALL . All Yes , now for the song ! BRISK . Brisk How many stevedores and wharfingers do you know , Tom ? TOM LUG . Tom Lug Let me see , there 's Zeke Oakum , tarpaulin Tom  --  two ; Bill Baffin ; but poor Bill 's deadly sick  --  I doubt whether he 'll get up to vote : say a score and a half . But give us the song , if you please . ( Aside )  --  Hark'e , my boys , if he does n't come down with his song , we 'll pitch our votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brisk ( Aside . ) I hear that , and although I would as lief sing in a musty fish-keg , I must try it . The Song . Were mine a head as high as is the highest steeple , A tongue as loud as it 's far-sounding bell , The one I would raise to the sky for the people  --  The other would echo of tyrants the knell ! ( Aside )  --  Oh , would n't I raise a devil of a yell ! Were my arm but as long as the great Mississippi , My bosom as broad as the Prairie-du-Chien , With the one , for their sake , how , ye tyrants ! I 'd whip ye , And breast with the other your torrents of spleen ! ( Aside )  --  Blast my eyes ! Jack Brisk , if I know what you mean ! If my legs were as long as the tall Alleghanies , Like Barclay , I 'd walk the wide world roundabout  --  And rescue , wherever , I found them , poor royalist zanies , And put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  Do n't , for Heaven 's sake , gentlemen , make such a shout ! Oh , give me a breast that expands like the ocean , And eyes like the vigilant planets above , Then , oh then to my heart I will hug with emotion The people I smile on  --  the people I love ! ( Aside )  --  Provided the perquisite pay , I approve . TOM LUG . Tom Lug ( Aside . ) Now he must give us the hornpipe he danced at the Fancy Ball with aunt Peggy on his back . Cook will do for aunt Peggy , if she brushes up a little .  --  Come , alderman , another favor to your constituents ! BRISK . Brisk What 's that , Tom ? Any thing you can ask  --  you know I am the servant of the people . TOM LUG . Tom Lug Nothing much : I 'm a'most ashamed to ask you , it 's such a mere trifle .  --  Joe , you ask him , you ai nt afraid of the penitentiary keepers . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you must give us your Fancy-Ball hornpipe around the table with cook on your back . BRISK . Brisk ( Feigns sudden sickness . ) Landlord , what have you put in these lobsters ? They have made me sick as death  --  Give me fresh air  --  There , so ; now lead me to the door : I shall be well in a minute . ( Is conducted to the door , and makes off . ) TOM LUG . Tom Lug What a kind good man Mr. Brisk is  --  he 's broke his constitution working at dinners and suppers and cold collations for the people ! That was a capital song , as good as the quirister himself could give us ; but I 'm afraid the idea of cook and he in a hornpipe was too much for his nerves ! Any how , three cheers and our votes to a man for little Jack Brisk ! END OF ACT II . ACT III . SCENE I. Gudgeon 's house . Gudgeon and Glib . GUDGEON . Gudgeon I begin to feel the anxieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision of six constables standing around me with staves , and with their hats in their hands , bowing to me  --  thus . After this , a fellow in a white apron came in with a large green turtle , which seemed to be lying on it 's back and struggling with it 's hands and feet to turn itself over . I suppose the poor thing was troubled with indigestion . GLIB . Glib You should n't give way to these feelings , Mr. Gudgeon : they will unman you before the election . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Not they ! I was no more scared by the sight of the six constables and their staves , than if I had been an alderman all my life , or if they had been so many plain farmers , with ox-gads , viewing a prize-bullock , in my own native town of Danbury . GLIB . Glib I think it would have a good effect to mention that in my address to the citizens at one of the meetings : they 'll call you the fearless Gudgeon  --  What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes , it might . Well , sir , you may try it  --  but not as if it came from me . You can state , for instance , that my man William overheard me talking in my sleep , as he came in for my boots this morning . GLIB . Glib And the remark about the ox-gads ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon You might add , that William thought I lay as proud and unconcerned as if the constables had been  --  had been  --  what would occur to him ?  --  so many puffed bladders ! GLIB . Glib And you one of them . GUDGEON . Gudgeon And I one of them . GLIB . Glib That will produce a sensation in the meeting ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon Unquestionably  --  I expect it . Had n't I better be present , so that they can come up and shake hands with me , after the allusion . I do n't see how I can avoid it . GLIB . Glib Perhaps it would be more proper for to remain at home , looking out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their enthusiasm , they shall adjourn to meet in front of your house .  --  That 's always a great stroke of policy , to make a speech to people in the streets , when the boys are hooting , and the carts rattling up and down , and the engines puffing by with trumpets ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon But how will my voice answer ? It 's hardly a two-story voice . GLIB . Glib Capitally , capitally : you have a good round bass , and if , when you see a ragged fellow shivering in the farthest edge of the crowd , with his hands in his pockets , you address your remarks to him , as if you were standing in a cold entry , and calling for your overcoat , you will succeed in making a happy effort of it . GUDGEON . Gudgeon With a night-cap on , as if I had rushed straight from my bed , to meet my constituents ? GLIB . Glib Without a night-cap . Positively without a night-cap  --  that is aristocratic ; but you might , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican . GUDGEON . Gudgeon That 's a mystery . GLIB . Glib So it is  --  and so is the connection between democratical principles and threadbare indispensables ;  --  but that 's the ground on which they 'll beat us , if any : Brisk dresses shabbier than you . GUDGEON . Gudgeon But then consider , my dear sir , Brisk has n't my form , arm , leg , my back and bust . GLIB . Glib Allow me to suggest , sir , that during an election we none of us have backs or busts to be thought of . I entreat you , as I have before , to abandon these fancies : I ask it as the greatest favor you can confer on me , on your party , on the community , to put on corduroys at least , my own wishes are for fustain , during the contest . Wear a pea-jacket with a few rents in it , and an appearance of being soiled with cigar-smoke and tar . GUDGEON . Gudgeon I will do my uttermost . GLIB . Glib And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , darken your astral lamp , and take down your damask curtains . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Well , sir ,  --  I will consider of it . In the mean time , I trust you will exert yourself in your harangues at our public meetings . Ride high , sir  --  ride high . Express your willingness to die for your country  --  in the last  --  the deepest ditch  --  GLIB . Glib I shall do my endeavor . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Sternly and fearlessly . GLIB . Glib I will . Enter Boy . BOY . Boy Tom Lug , sir , the bully 's round the corner , and says he 'll drop Mr. Glib , if he catches him , like a shot hawk  --  and he 'll curry him , he says , like a bull 's hide  --  and he 'll skin him like a weasel ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon This is unpleasant news . GLIB . Glib I wonder if I could get out by the back fence , without being observed ?  --  It 's unpleasant to meet that man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOY . Boy There 's nothing but a clothes-line and a cistern , sir , on the other side . GLIB . Glib I 'd rather run the risk of drowning and hanging combined , than encounter that barbarous fellow . Retiring . GUDGEON . Gudgeon I believe you address the proscribed lamplighters tonight ? Calling after him . GLIB . Glib The proscribed watchmen and lamplighters . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Give it to them vigorously , if you please . GLIB . Glib I shall . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Do n't spare words ! GLIB . Glib Depend upon me : I 'll lay the dictionary waste ! I 'll ravish it ! Exit GLIB . SCENE II . Blanding 's apartments . BLANDING . Blanding My mistress might as well be at Nova Zembla or the North Pole , as far as I am concerned ; she is as much to the cham of Tartary ( now that I am forbidden her presence ) as she is to me . Where is the difference , I would like to know , between a lady and a whale or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her society : to smile with her , muse , meditate , and talk .  --  Now if I were in the country , I should hang myself ;  --  but the city , the glorious city , warms one 's brain like a November sun , and sets it all in a ferment with contrivance and strategy .  --  I am not to see Kate Brisk any more  --  ha ! ran it so ? at the penalty of a chastisement . Now see , Master Brisk , how soon your rod of chastisement turns into a serpent of revenge , and your bully is cozened by a gentler man in his wits . Here , ye old badges of obscurity , I throw ye off ! I disdain the name and the vocation of Charles Blanding , and am , henceforth , at least to this threatening father , Mr. Jefferson Goss , grand-nephew to the United States senator , by the mother 's side .  --  I think this weak fish will run into this net , and while he is floundering and flourishing , we will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a more certain cast . Exit . SCENE III . A public room . The Committee and Crowder . CROWDER . Crowder I agree with you , as to the muscular arm on the banner , with a hammer aloft ; I think the addition of a stout leg would be judicious : there are many cordwainers in the ward , that would be won over by the device . A stout leg in a neat pump , and no stocking , to show the calf distinctly . This will please the butchers too , who are proud of their legs . FIRST COM . MAN . First Committee Man The stout leg , then ; shall it be set down ? ALL . All Agreed . CROWDER . Crowder But , mind me , mark it down to cost not more than one dollar and a half . SECOND COM . MAN . Second Committee Man ( Writing . ) One stout leg , naked and in a pump , twelve shillings . CROWDER . Crowder We must be economical this campaign , for the freeholders begin to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an election , are getting to be as bad as the plunderings of the corporation  --  What noise was that above ? FIRST COM . MAN . First Committee Man I heard nothing . CROWDER . Crowder They say to run a sewer through a man 's pocket and drain it to the last cent , is as bad as to cut a street through his domicil and leave him the rubbish to pay damages . SECOND COM . MAN . Second Committee Man How , in the name of Heaven , can an election be conducted without money ? Joe Surge must be hired to fight , and must be paid his fists ' worth .  --  Tom Lug must make himself a nuisance , to keep decent voters of the other side back ; and he must have a percentage on the disgust he excites . We must have Blaster to blow the trumpet and to brow-beat and be scurrilous when he 's off duty , and I 'm sure he should be handsomely remunerated for the use of his person . He works as cheap as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crowder Very true  --  every word ;  --  but we can diminish our committee expenses a little , at-least , for the sake of appearances . We can smoke half a box and carry none away : we can leave the candle-ends for next evening , and not throw them at any clean person we may see passing in the street : a quart of beer a-piece should satisfy us , and we can be more strict with our landlord , and have him rende a nightly account of charges . I hear that noise again  --  what can it be ? Eaves-dropping ? FIRST COM . MAN . First Committee Man I hear it this time  --  it 's overhead . SECOND COM . MAN . Second Committee Man Let 's hunt the rascal , and if we capture him , we 'll have a roasted goose to insert in the bill . The Committee go out and return . CROWDER . Crowder Strange  --  that we could find nothing , not so much as the tip of a nose or an ear to levy on ; but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tropical climate , and I believe could even hide himself in the knot of a pocket handkerchief , or the crack of a wainscot . SECOND COM . MAN . Second Committee Man I saw Botch in the shadow of a house over the way as we came in . CROWDER . Crowder When I sounded the chimney to ascertain if he might be ambushed there , I heard some frail thing crash , which might have been Botch 's skull . It yielded like a hollow thing , whatever it was .  --  To avoid any further chance of listeners , let 's call in the landlord 's bill and adjourn till to-morrow .  --  Landlord ! landlord ! LANDLORD . Landlord ( From without . ) Coming ! CROWDER . Crowder We want your bill . That will-bring him up with it , short and quick . LANDLORD .

Crowder Beans , bread , and beer ! LANDLORD . Landlord Six lobster and two pound sage-cheese : likewise a splendid pork-pie made of chops . CROWDER . Crowder A splendid pork-pie made of chops !

Landlord This may be as it may , Mr. Crowder ; but you sent down for the things  --  CROWDER . Crowder Sent down for the things ! LANDLORD . Landlord Yes , sir , in a very unpleasant , and , begging the committee gentlemen 's pardon , a very uncivil way  --  you might have found a better messenger nor a stone bottle as big as my two fist . CROWDER . Crowder Ah ! I begin to see how it is  --  that cursed experiment of mine . LANDLORD . Landlord Yes , sir , that experiment of yours  --  it came bouncing down the chimney like mad , and first it strikes my cook , poor hunchback Jenny , in the small , or I should say , in the big of the back , as she was stooping over a dish of prawns for Tom Lug  --  FIRST COM . MAN . First Committee Man Bad enough ! LANDLORD . Landlord Yes , gentlemen , bad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hump an it had been a horse-hair cushion , away it flies on to the table where the alderman had been sitting just a minute before  --  it 's a mortal mercy his life was spared  --  and smash  --  smash it goes , like artillery , ' till every living dish on the board was fragments and scatterings . FIRST COM . MAN . First Committee Man We must practise economy , Crowder . SECOND COM . MAN . Second Committee Man We must be prudent this campaign , for the freeholders begin to complain  --  sewer through the pocket  --  cigars and candle-ends  --  and we must be a little frugal in our beer . CROWDER . Crowder Mr. Works , you 'll be good enough to charge your bill to the ward  --  as usual : and you 'll oblige me by smothering this unhappy breakage under the general expenses . SCENE IV . Crumb 's house . Old Crumb and Citizens . FIRST CITIZEN . First Citizen But , sir , it is the wish of a large body of the people of this ward , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these squabbling office-seekers , and wish to have for their alderman , once more , a plain , honest citizen . Crumb . Old Crumb I am plain , I know  --  and , I believe , honest ; but I have no other claims for this honor . I have never harangued at public meetings : given charity at noon-day ; clutched the skirts of great men ; sat on midnight caucuses ; walked prominently in processions or at celebrations : nor have I been seen at public dinners , thundering out toasts and sentiments that sounded loud with patriotism and the name of the people . How can I be your candidate ? You had better look elsewhere  --  the creature grows in every street . FIRST CITIZEN . First Citizen You are a plain , true citizen , as we said before , and for that we choose you . We are satisfied with your private acts , your way-side charities to the sick , the orphan , and the oppressed : some of us have seen you , in the storm and at the dead of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of a single star upon a good deed , dear sir , is worth more than the bloze of the sun or the approval of a thousand eyes . We will take you as you are and for what you are , if you will allow us . CRUMB . Old Crumb Give a moment , and I will answer you . Citizens retire . CRUMB . Old Crumb ( Alone . ) I care not for the honor  --  that is certain : I have no private end to answer  --  that is certain ; nor will it suit my habits to wrangle by the hour , or to sit at late feasts , where man shows but as a creature of one sense  --  more appetite . Again  --  the city needs friends . Her revenues are wasted , her foundations sapped with unthrift and neglect : an old man 's voice may be listened to when younger tongues would sound idle : the gray-haired pilot may be heard and heeded , when he attests that the rock is at hand and the ship fast foundering.  --  Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the candidate !  --  The honest enthusiasm of the ward shall elect me  --  our Master Brisk 's tone will change when I am in the council . He will seek my influence , and hope to get it , and , perchance , will yield to my old wish about Blanding and his daughter . That perchance  --  that happy , bright-omened perchance , fixes me . ( Aloud )  --  Gentlemen , come in ! Enter CITIZENS . FIRST CITIZEN . First Citizen Your answer ? Crumb . Old Crumb I will act ! FIRST CITIZEN . First Citizen And so will we !  --  We thank you , sir ,  --  and when the sun rises on Thursday morning , read our thanks in our recorded voices . Good day , good sir . Crumb . Old Crumb I bid you all , good men , good day . They retire.  --  And an early sun thereafter shall shine upon a happy bride and groom , if old Zachary Crumb is a true man and alderman ! SCENE V. An apartment at Brisk 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servant A gentleman with great black whiskers is below , sir ! He swells and ruffles an he were the governor 's son . BRISK . Brisk Ask him up  --  immediately . Exit Servant . It 's Jefferson Goss , from the description : my heart flutters like a young pigeon 's . I am in the same house  --  under the same roof with the grand-nephew of a senator .  --  I hear the creaking of his boots ! Hark  --  he coughed ! He is on the stairs . Was I entitled to expect this ?  --  What weight and character this will give to my canvass , that I have been closeted with a functionary 's near relative ! Besides , my daughter Kate  --  now that that fellow , Blanding , is out of the way  --  But I must be prepared to address him formally . Walks up and down the stage reciting , " Sir , it affords me , &c.";  --  When Blanding enters , advances , and addresses him : Enter Blanding , as Jefferson Goss . BRISK . Brisk Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . I will not disguise the pleasure it gives me to receive under my humble roof so near a connection of so distinguished a character . BLANDING . Blanding ( Aside  --  Now a little figurative impudence , for the great man 's nephew  --  who may be supposed to have been reared in pot-houses at the capitol . ) Sir , you do me proud ! Proud , sir , as if I sat on Chimborazzo , with a bald cagie in my lap . BRISK . Brisk ( Aside  --  What a ward-meeting orator he would make ! ) Be good enough to be seated  --  This way , sir , if you please  --  and condescend to partake of these humble viands . BLANDING . Blanding Thank you , sir , I will gorge . BRISK . Brisk ( Aside  --  What a happy style of expression ! ) I keep this table spread for my friends during the election .  --  You wilt find this beef 's tongue exceeding nice . It is sound policy , it strikes me , this of overpowering a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLANDING . Blanding But do n't you think it best to skirmish a little at first , about the outskirts , with bottled ale and cogniac ? BRISK . Brisk Decidedly , sir .  --  This shakes the outer walls  --  then you come up with your heavy troops , Turkey and the Porte , and in a few minutes you have possession of the man . BLANDING . Blanding Between ourselves , Brisk , this mutton of yours is d  --  d nice . It 's almost as fine as I have ever known to be raised on the old senator 's farm .  --  Were these cranberries reared in the hothouse or in beds ? BRISK . Brisk In beds , I think ;  --  they are Long Island berries . BLANDING . Blanding They make an excellent sauce with woodcock.  --  I believe this is woodcock . BRISK . Brisk Yes , sir , that is woodcock , and considered very choice ; it 's from the Jersey meadows . ( Aside  --  The young man has a keen appetite  --  but , what penetration , what insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have no doubt he 'd appreciate Kate at once . I 'll call her . ) Kate ! Daughter  --  BLANDING . Blanding I beg your pardon , sir , but I hope there are no ladies about the house  --  I 'm excessively timid  --  timid as a  --  rhinoceros . Enter Kate Brisk . BRISK . Brisk My daughter , sir : Kate , let me introduce you to Mr. Goss , the senator 's nephew . KATE . Kate Brisk ( Aside , not looking at him )  --  Some disgusting politician , no doubt , with his tariffs and currencies , high rates and low rates , and scurrilities both high and low .  --  I wish he would carry his conversation among the Hottentots and other heathen , rather than bring it into this house . ( Pouts . ) BRISK . Brisk Kate , will you be good enough to observe  --  it 's Mr. Goss  --  Mr. Jefferson Goss . BLANDING . Blanding ( Aside . ) I can advise her better who it is . ( Hums a tune in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him  --  aside )  --  As I live , it 's Charles Blanding.  --  Ah , I understand the knave ! ( Aloud , and in a different tone )  --  Good evening , Mr. Goss  --  you are welcome . What is the pleasant news , sir ? BRISK . Brisk ( Aside . ) I knew she must change her line of behavior , the moment she obtained a glimpse of his fine person ! BLANDING . Blanding Nothing , madam , stranger or pleasanter , than that a solan goose was seen crossing the sound yesterday in pursuit of an eagle who fled  --  KATE . Kate Brisk This way  --  nearer , if you please , sir  --  and give me the nicer particulars of this singular history . Draws him apart . BLANDING . Blanding The eagle fled , Kate , till he got as near heaven as he thought proper , when he turned and struck his talons into the thin pate of the stupid bird , and it fell out of the sky like a leaden fool , as it was . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Brisk Oh the assurance of the thing called man ! How could you venture to practise in this way on my good father ? BLANDING . Blanding Venture , Kate ! there is no venture in it : he expends his industry in contriving bars to his garden ; I employ my agility in leaping them ; and the mutual operation is aided by our being cits and strangers . KATE . Kate Brisk How will you make that appear ? BLANDING . Blanding Easily . Now , if we had lived in your favorite rural vicinity , where every boor and ploughman is classed in the memory of his neighborhood , like so many bugs and beetles in the Linnan system , I might have as well attempted to borrow your father 's head of hair , with his eyes open , for a fancy wig , as to get access to you without his knowledge . KATE . Kate Brisk Then you ride your old packsaddle , the city , still ; making that a carry-all for your tricks and stratagems , your knavish doings and impudent disguises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now confess , Kate , that the town is the place for lovers  --  their true and natural hive . KATE . Kate Brisk What they lose in simplicity , is not  --  BLANDING . Blanding Is gained in quickness of wit and variety of expedients for their mutual enjoyment : the lecture to be criticised ; the mountebank to be stared at ; the theatre to be dazzled with ; the concert of sweet sounds heard together . KATE . Kate Brisk Ah , if you knew my honest father 's prejudices just now against sweet sounds , you would scarcely venture to remain here , even in your disguise . His prejudices show themselves dreadfully . BRISK . Brisk ( Aside . ) Love at first sight , I verily believe . They are already as intimate as a pair of assembly men . Just what I could desire . BLANDING . Blanding Dreadfully :  --  see what faces he is making at me this very minute ! But in what ways , I pray ? A politician that takes all the world to his bosom should scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror of your occupation , he has sold my piano to a lady going into the country , at half price . BLANDING . Blanding Well . KATE . Kate Brisk He has had lids put upon all the key-holes , because they whistle . BLANDING . Blanding Well . KATE . Kate Brisk And the chimney-pots taken down , because they sing . BLANDING . Blanding And further ? KATE . Kate Brisk He has sacrificed the old tortoise-shell cat , because he was told her purr was a musical concord in A. BLANDING . Blanding What a passion for music the pleasant old gentleman must enjoy ! Shades of Bethooven and Mozart , look upon the melodious old creature kindly !  --  I should like to have his opinion of the disputed solo in Handel 's Creation . Takes his flute from his pocket and sounds a stave . BRISK . Brisk ( Rushing forward . ) Good God ! did you hear that , Kate ? Did you , Mr. Goss ?  --  The sound of a flute ; there must be incendiaries about the house . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player  --  to shut him from my ears and my house  --  I am afraid he has obtained an entrance . It seemed as if he was in this very room . Let 's search every nook , corner , and cranny . Be good enough to assist us , Mr. Goss ; for this , is , really , a serious matter . They search under chairs , behind paintings , &c.];  --  Why , sir , the trouble I have taken to silence that fellow and his cursed serenading flute , is really astonishing . Sir , ( panting . ) I have planted two approved bull-dogs in my yard ; I have employed a private watchman , with a club of double the ordinary dimensions in front ; I have had a vacant ground to the northeast , in which he practised his discordant stick , declared a nuisance by the corporation ; and , moreover , I have ordered my servants , sir , if they detected a squinting , limping , awkward fellow , loitering about the house , to assail him from the upper stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand . BLANDING . Blanding Why , sir , your benevolence is unbounded , for you have offered him every variety of death  --  drowning , throttling , and knocking in the head . An ungracious scamp he must be , if he does n't accept your kindness in one shape or the other ; an ungrateful , pudding-headed villain ! BRISK . Brisk Extermination is the best he deserves : if I had my way . I would annihilate the brood , and make room for men of merit , like yourself , Mr. Goss . BLANDING . Blanding The devil blast my stars , but you flatter me , Mr. Brisk , beyond my merits , entirely beyond my merits . But I must bid you good-day , Mr. Brisk  --  good-day , sir  --  I shall be with you early again . Good-day , Miss Brisk . Exit BLANDING . BRISK . Brisk A charming young man ! KATE . Kate Brisk ( Dubiously . ) Charming , indeed ! BRISK . Brisk What a contrast to that odious Blanding ! You must confess a vast distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too palpable , sir . BRISK . Brisk Do you think you could love him , Kate ? KATE . Kate Brisk I think I might , if I had time . I am not sure . BRISK . Brisk Well , Kate , strive hard : turn your thoughts diligently that way  --  and perhaps I will forgive the old offence ; perhaps  --  recollect ! END OF ACT III . ACT IV . SCENE I. The open street . Kate Brisk and Mrs. Gudgeon , meeting . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Well , Kate , poultry flies high in market this morning , and eggs are only four to the dozen . I really believe the times have reached our roosts and hen-houses , and that hens and turkeys have become so dissolute and idle , with long holding of warm nests and abundance of good feeding , that they care not a straw for the public interest ! However , this is a large-built and fine-looking pullet that I have bought , and if it makes the dish it should make , we shall know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kate Brisk It 's certainly a noble bird ; and these pigeons ' eggs , where did you purchase them ? MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon From my old One-and-Eleven pence , the fat huckster , who says that twelve pigeons ' eggs made into an omelet , with four strips of bacon , bring health and luck to the man that eats them : what will Mr. Robert Gudgeon say to that ?  --  Here 's a sheep 's gizzard too , to be taken at ten o'clock in the evening , made into a pie . KATE . Kate Brisk What is that for ? MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon To make Mr. Gudgeon amiable during the election . And here are two peacock feathers to lay under his pillow to make him dignified . The boy is coming on with two rounds of beef and a dozen strings of Bolognas to feed his friends with , to keep them in good-humor ; and I 've told him to buy some fresh chick-weed and goose-grass to carry in his pocket ; they say it draws voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Poor boy !

Sweet , sweet young man ! MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Who is he ? Who is this Mr. Goss ? KATE . Kate Brisk This Mr. Goss  --  Mrs. Gudgeon , I am astonished  --  Mr. Jefferson Goss , the grand nephew of the senator . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon What look has this young man ? I think I know the Gosses . KATE . Kate Brisk Firstly ; a blue , smiling eye . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Well : all young men have smiling eyes . KATE .

Mrs. Gudgeon And a mole on his chin ?  --  I know the Gosses as if they were blood relations  --  what is the young man 's gait and aspect ? KATE . Kate Brisk Gentle  --  and he sometimes looks up and sometimes down . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon The very marks ! And his height ? KATE . Kate Brisk Middling , you might say : neither tall nor short . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon True again . There can be no doubt he is one of the Cross-River Gosses . But you have not given him your heart , Kate , as you seem to say by sighing ? KATE . Kate Brisk I must confess a partiality , Mrs. Gudgeon . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KATE . Kate Brisk Willingly , and I think Blanding would second it , for Goss is his particular , in fact , his bosom friend . However , have one or the other of them , I am determined : I think it will be Goss ; at least , father wishes it to be so . You shall come to the wedding , Mrs. Gudgeon , and be pleased with the bridegroom too ! Exit KATE BRISK . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Pleased with a cross child , or a horse in over-alls sooner ! Foolish , fickle thing ! Kind Charles Blanding must be abandoned , for this lacquered upstart , that professes to be his friend , for the purpose of seducing his mistress . That Goss is a rascal I 'll warrant , for the Gosses always was said to have bad blood in their veins from their grandfather , the tory quarter-master . We 'll see whether poor Blanding 's to be cast off in this way , like so much foul linen . I 'll have Mr. Gudgeon in this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken from the family record as Margaret Cox , now Gudgeon ! Exit . SCENE II . The street . Botch and Gudgeon . BOTCH . Botch Oh ! this is dreadful news : support yourself against the wall , Mr. Gudgeon  --  you had better . Shocking ! Shocking ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon What is it ? For mercy 's sake , what is it , Botch ? BOTCH . Botch They 've got Old Crumb up for a candidate . GUDGEON . Gudgeon What , for alderman ? BOTCH . Botch Yes , sir . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Against me ? BOTCH . Botch Yes , sir , and he 's as popular as the baker before breakfast , or the brewer after dinner . Whole flocks of people are winging their way to the polls , like so many pigeons in autumn . GUDGEON . Gudgeon This must be put a stop to . BOTCH . Botch They come out of the houses by hundreds : all the carriages have got Zachary Crumb on them , and the minister has voted for him already . GUDGEON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Botch I doubt whether there be such a thing as an end to it . Enter Glib . GLIB . Glib I have just halted to tell you that the whole lower section of the ward has gone for Crumb , in a body . GUDGEON . Gudgeon You know that 's a poor part of the ward . GLIB . Glib It 's rumored that the Quakers are moving in his favor , and I 'm afraid the plague will get among the lamplighters and watchmen , for these bodies lie near each other , and the Quakers chiefly furnish for the public lamps . So look to yourselves .  --  I am off , to address the meeting of proscribed citizens of this class . Exit GLIB . BOTCH . Botch I forgot to tell you , sir , that they have planted a great liberty-pole on one of the corners . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Thank heaven ! that has n't a vote . BOTCH . Botch No , sir , that 's not a citizen  --  although it carries it 's head so high .  --  And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Crumb 's name on in large letters  --  twice as big as ours . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Who could have done that ? Our painter was ordered to put my name in the very largest possible capitals . BOTCH . Botch Besides this , sir , they have brought out two immense wagons that carry twenty-four deep  --  and they are both hurrying voters up five in a row , breast-wise , like so many fish packed in a firkin for market . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Botch , this is certainly the most astonishing thing I have ever known . I have heard of wild buffaloes rushing down rocks a hundred and fifty feet high ; but for human kind  --  why , it 's sheer madness . Was it a full moon last night ? BOTCH . Botch It was . GUDGEON . Gudgeon It must be that  --  their brains are turned . I consider the city is ruined ; it never can recover from this shock . I shall have no documents to sign for the corporation  --  that 's clear . I am sorry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a great inconvenience . BOTCH . Botch Do n't despair , sir ; I beg you not to despair . GUDGEON . Gudgeon I must despair , Botch ; there 's no other enjoyment left to me . BOTCH . Botch Ca n't you walk between the two men drunk , as we agreed  --  that might cheer you up . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Thank you for the suggestion . I 'll do it . It must have an exhilarating effect , and may turn the tide . Get the men ready . Botch retiring . But , Botch , be good enough not to have them overdone ; not too drunk , if you please . Exeunt GUDGEON and BOTCH severally . SCENE III . The same . Brisk and Crowder . CROWDER . Crowder We must carry this election , or I am undone . They have levied on the liberty-pole in front of my door as personal property ; and the glorious cap , with all those mottoes that please the mob so much , will be struck off with the greatest rudeness , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty ! I had better have clothed my back , or lined my belly , than have spent my substance in planting liberty-trees that are as barren as crabs . BRISK . Brisk Poh ! Crowder  --  you know better ; its a perfect breadplant to the office-seeker , and more poor Christians have gained a living by shaking it , and opening their mouths and throwing up their caps under it , than all the peach , plum , apricot , and greening trees in Christendom . Forty thousand worthy gentlemen , in this noble republic of ours alone , climb this tree annually , and furnish their families a very pretty livelihood . Think of that ! CROWDER . Crowder I do think of that , and if I only had a snug government berth during one president 's term , I 'd whistle at Fortune , and rattle my silver with the best men in the land . BRISK . Brisk If we succeed , as we must  --  look at the prospect , it 's almost enough to bring tears into one 's eyes  --  You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice little profit on every morsel that goes into a pauper 's mouth : a perfect prince of a contractor : and not a candle shall be snuffed in the establishment , nor an eyelid dropped , without your having clipped the tallow and discounted the drug for both . CROWDER . Crowder I am then to have the furnishing of physic as well as food to my poor children on the island ? BRISK . Brisk Of course , for medicine is a natural part of the diet of a pauper . He requires scouring as much as pewter pots , and takes sulphur as freely as if he had been educated in a match factory .  --  The very poorhouse dog , Crowder , shall not dare to shake himself in the yard without your permission , and a collar of your providing , to make it known that he 's the slave of King Crowder , and owes him a per percentage . And so we will reward you . CROWDER . Crowder And how will you reward yourself ? BRISK . Brisk Very simply .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my great-uncle , the bachelor , owned a small plot of ground there , in the heart of a block , which he used as a circus , and made a tolerable income therefrom , with a bear and fiddle , two stunted shetlands , and a loafer clown ; but , since that lively period , and a different current of population , the ground has n't paid taxes , and has , in fact , been a dead-weight at the end of my pocket . Now , mark me , when I become alderman , we will have that same Greenwich lane broadened into an avenue , which will just take the short front lots away , and bring my pretty plot of ground upon the street , without a penny 's assessment . All this shall be done for the good of the people , the health of the neighborhood , or any other patriotic and high-minded considerations . CROWDER . Crowder Nobly contrived ! But here 's a new difficulty  --  Old Zachary Crumb , who has been started by the citizens you know , is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A weak old man , who will make about as much headway as a superannuated race-horse brought out upon the course ten years after he has lost his natural beat and powers of motion . CROWDER . Crowder The people , they say , are gathering for him in great numbers . BRISK . Brisk Have no fears ! it 's only a device of our own friends to blind the enemy . Two-thirds of the votes that go in the boxes for Gudgeon and Crumb , will come out , mark my word , for John Brisk , and no other ! Exeunt severally . SCENE IV . A public room .

Citizen His flags , if such a thing be possible , is better than his trumpets . GLIB . Glib Far up on high , where still it shall be held , Until to fibres heaven 's winds have whistled it No larger than the small spool-cotton threads . Yes , yes , my fellow-citizens , inspired With large and noble thoughts , and in a cause That sun-lit planets might be jealous of  --  The cause of lamplighters extinguished , Of watchmen wakened  --  burst beneath the feet Of these stern men , like to an earthquake Underneath a factory of earthenware , And into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizen Good !

Second Citizen Did you mark when the sky was overcast this morning , how the sun shone on Crumb 's name on the banner , while all the rest was in darkness ? OLD CITIZEN . Old Citizen I did , and it 's a sight I saw but once before in my life , and that was when this old soldier that voted to-day , was baptized  --  the sun fell through the upper church-window on his white old head as he went down into the baptistry , making a single golden spot in the midst of the congregation . SECOND CITIZEN . Second Citizen He deserves the heavenly approval .  --  He is too pure-hearted to be made a tool of politicians , and I was glad to see the old man , when he approached the poll , cast off the bandages and patches they had thrust upon him , pretending to draw down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . When he learned there was a third ticket , he exchanged his ballots at once , and voted for Zachary Crumb . THIRD CITIZEN . Third Citizen I entered with a crowd of thirty , and when they were asked , " What ticket do you vote ? " they all answered , like a corporation of deacons on a grant for new pew-cushions , " Old Crumb , " and shook hands as if they had met at a wedding . OLD CITIZEN . Old Citizen Yea , and I have seen old men like myself here to-day , that have not cast a ballot before for the last fifteen year . I have seen sick men , that apparently tarried in the world but to deposite a vote for Crumb , and young lads just of age , ( but who have been smiled on by this good man when they have borne satchels at their sides ) hurry up as eagerly as if it were a holiday business . SECOND CITIZEN . Second Citizen They say that when Brisk entered to give his own vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff above the door shrieked and dropped his wings ; but this I can scarcely believe , although I know of my own eye-knowledge , that a parrot which a sailor brought up with him , when his master was solicited to vote for Gudgeon , exclaimed in answer for the sailor , " Not so green ! " OLD CITIZEN . Old Citizen The bird was figurative , of course , for I marked the creature , and of a deeper literal green was no parrot 's jacket that I ever beheld . That sailor , I think I was told was one of a crew of fifty that came in only last night from the Friendly islands of the Pacific , and not one failed the true ticket . Enter a Fourth Citizen . FOURTH CITIZEN . Fourth Citizen Cheerly , friends , cheerly : the Brisk men and Gudgeonites begin to give way , and it 's said about the poll that Crumb has the day thus far by a hundred ! OLD CITIZEN . Old Citizen Let 's hasten to the ground , and , while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exeunt . SCENE VI . Blanding 's apartments . Old Crumb and Blanding . CRUMB . Old Crumb Well , Charles , how fares your wooing ? BLANDING . Blanding Strangely enough : the more my proposed father-in-law dotes on me as Jefferson Goss , the more he detests me as Charles Blanding . CRUMB . Old Crumb So you are likely to succeed as a pretender , and to come off poorly as a man-of merit ? Is n't that the way of the world ? BLANDING . Blanding I think it is  --  and while I am allowed to eat his cranberries and woodcock as the nephew of a senator that has no existence , I am regaled with curses as the child of my own mother . CRUMB . Old Crumb You are then faring admirably , I think , for in either event , you will have your mistress : if she marries you in the name of one of the logical postulates , what matters it so long as she gets the person she likes . BLANDING . Blanding But I imagine she would scarcely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city prison , and receive her wedding calls in the character of an indicted impostor 's wife with an alias ! CRUMB . Old Crumb Have no fears of that !  --  Do you rehearse the character you have assumed , carefully ? An error in the keeping might be disastrous . BLANDING . Blanding I believe I am doing myself justice there , for I read the Washington letter-writers every morning for politics , and visit Delmonico 's and bully the waiters , to acquire the right style of manners , in the afternoon . CRUMB . Old Crumb Do you , as the hypothetical great man 's nephew , disparage American institutions steadily when you are at Brisk 's ? BLANDING . Blanding No , I have n't brought myself to that perfection yet ; but I speak contemptuously of American habits , intellect , society , commerce , literature , and American things generally , which I thought would answer the same purpose . CRUMB . Old Crumb Of course you have not omitted a minute biography of the imaginary senator ? BLANDING . Blanding By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production with contempt , I always speak of the senator with the utmost reverence . I have given Brisk a particular history of his early life and struggles , his labors on a semi-weekly country newspaper , with a circulation of nineteen paying subscribers  --  CRUMB . Old Crumb Did n't you overstate the matter a little there ? BLANDING . Blanding His first speech on the occasion of a sheepshearing in the waters of a private pond , with the great questions involved therein , which were destined ( as usual ) to shake our institutions and jeopardize the union itself . Then I described to him the style of the senator 's congressional oratory  --  and how one day he came into the senate chamber without an idea , and spoke six hours on the establishment of a college for young Indians in Michigan  --  and how , when he was through , the audience were so astonished at his fluency they did n't recollect a word he had said . CRUMB . Old Crumb This must have made a vast deal of dry talking for you . BLANDING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moistened with gentle showers of Madeira and Perfect Love , and sustained by more solid supplies . In fact , I relied on my appetite more than any other single point to establish my character ; and the more I devoured , the more Brisk 's eyes dilated with admiration of my supposed connection with the distinguished senator . CRUMB . Old Crumb Well , brave it out , Charles , with a bold face  --  it pleases me to have this shrewd politician outwitted so cheaply . All will end well , for the charm is now brewing  --  this very hour  --  that shall give us the magician 's voice over the issues of this business . Exeunt severally . SCENE VII . A street near the poll . Gudgeon and Glib , meeting . GUDGEON . Gudgeon As I told you , you will find a house in Cherry street  --  GLIB . Glib Very likely  --  you will find houses in every street in the city , except the new-fangled streets that are no streets , but two parallels of speculative curbstone . GUDGEON . Gudgeon But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a lodging-house , ( I forget the number , ) with an exchange office at one side of it , and a toy-shop , a shop where they vend masks , at the other . GLIB . Glib Why , this must be the church that you are directing me to !  --  for there you will find false faces enough I 'll warrant , and money-changers too , at times . And I 'm sure there 's sufficient sleeping done there to earn for it the character of a lodging-house . So I have your direction .  --  What next ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon If it were a church , it would not be a wrong place , at a suitable season , to look for the man to whom I send you : in a word , you must go immediately and secure the vote of Bill Baffin , the stevedore . He is sick , and I 'd have you treat him kindly . GLIB . Glib It shall be done , sir ; the old whale shall flounder his vote in , if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Mr. Glib ; but bring him by all means . One vote may make or ruin us . GLIB . Glib Oh , he shall come , sir , if it 's on crutches , and if I am obliged to be as persuasive as Patrick Henry . He shall come . GUDGEON . Gudgeon And after that you will be good enough to come to me at the public room , where I shall be engaged buoying up our friends , and eating burnt crackers and old cheese with the voters , for effect . Exeunt severally . SCENE VIII . A sick chamber , Baffin in an armchair , &c.; BILL BAFFIN . Bill Baffin I am afraid my last hour is at hand ; and the old keel will have to be sunk in the earth forever , and left there to decay , like a dead root . The sun goes fast ; I begin to Page 91 lose my reckoning , and with the next round of the timekeeper , I shall be counted with the ships that have foundered . Well , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Who knocks ? In !  --  Enter Glib . GLIB . Glib Ah ! Mr. Baffin , this is a sad pass for one of your mould !  --  the stoutest stevedore on the river ! BAFFIN . Bill Baffin Aye , and the weakest on the death-bed . GLIB . Glib Not so bad  --  not so bad , I trust . But now that I look in your eye , there is something that shines like the next world . Any how , you carry a free heart out of this ? BAFFIN . Bill Baffin So I humbly hope . GLIB . Glib Is there nothing on your mind ? No single act to be performed ? No little duty undischarged ? BAFFIN . Bill Baffin None that my memory wots of . So help me God , not one ! GLIB . Glib Nothing that you owe to your family  --  your fellow-citizens  --  your country ? BAFFIN . Bill Baffin Nothing ! GLIB . Glib Bethink yourself  --  think of the present day  --  the present hour . Have you , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BAFFIN . Bill Baffin Yes , with the sexton  --  as a candidate for the other world . Another knock  --  who can it be ?  --  Come in !  --  My friends increase towards the extremity . Enter Crowder . CROWDER . Crowder Do n't listen to that man , Mr.Baffin ! I have the true ticket  --  Human rights , sir ! GLIB . Glib Have at you , sir ! Mine is civil liberty ! CROWDER . Crowder An unlimited democracy ! GLIB . Glib No taxes , pew-rents , ground rents , assessments  --  CROWDER . Crowder Sumptuous accommodations for paupers ! GLIB . Glib A bill of special privileges to stevedores ! ( In Baffin 's ear )  --  Gudgeon has a job for you . CROWDER . Crowder ( Whispers . ) The office of dock-master . Baffin . Bill Baffin ( Springs up , and with his crutch drives them from the room . ) Out , ravens and sharks ! Away with you , and let me yield my breath in peace . GLIB . Glib ( Returning . ) Your vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundown , send us word , and you shall have a coach to bring you to the poll . Exit GLIB . CROWDER . Crowder ( Looks in . ) Poor creature ! He begins to flush !  --  D  --  n me , it 's a vote lost . Exit CROWDER . SCENE IX . The open street . Brisk and Crowder , meeting , in haste . BRISK . Brisk Have you brought up the Shabby Volunteers ? CROWDER . Crowder I have , sir ; and they all discharged their oath like a drilled company of riflemen . BRISK . Brisk The Wallopers and Tag-end Ragamuffins ? CROWDER . Crowder Ay , sir ; and they came into the poll like the ghosts of so many pawnbrokers with all their stock in trade at their heels . BRISK . Brisk The man with the small-pox ? CROWDER . Crowder No , but he is hard by . BRISK . Brisk I think we had better throw him in . Matters look desperate , and a wholesome panic may relieve us of superfluous voters on the other side  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends . They have prejudices against contagion , whereas our men , you know , are smallpox proof .  --  You have not neglected the suburbs , I trust . CROWDER . Crowder Hardly  --  we have depopulated two taverns at the Walla-bout : a naval force of six oyster-boats has landed from Staten Island . We have scoured Newtown creek and taken captive four brace of honest countrymen , who are pledged to swear their tickets through ; with flying , excursions from time to time into Queen 's County and the Jerseys . BRISK . Brisk There 's a one-eyed man that tends the shot-tower at Kipp 's Bay ; I hope he 'll not be forgotten . He 's generally overlooked on account of his forlorn situation CROWDER . Crowder Had n't we better open a few fresh brandy bottles at Works 's ? There 's a danger of faint-heartedness coming on them towards night , unless some such thing is done . BRISK . Brisk By all means  --  and if necessary , broach a new barrel of beer .  --  The chief of our work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let every spigot tell on the canvass !  --  In the mean time I 'll go and talk Dutch with the German voters , and O'hone a little with the Hibernians . Exeunt severally . END OF ACT IV . ACT V. SCENE I. An old Citizen and others meeting in front of Crumb 's house . SECOND CITIZEN . Second Citizen Well , the day is ours , and a brighter has n't left the sky since this island was parcelled into wards ! OLD CITIZEN . Old Citizen Only one brighter , I admit , and that was the day George Washington crossed the river to take the chief magistrate 's oath . This is a true and joyful day . I shall not scruple to put it in the family Bible as a memorable day . SECOND CITIZEN . Second Citizen My girl Mary shall work it in a sampler , with evergreens over the top , and a great lion rushing out of a corner to devour a sneaking spotted zebra that I will have her figure on the other side of the sampler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted knave of politics , is whipped and vanquished , and the true-hearted one , honest Old Crumb , triumphant OLD CITIZEN . Old Citizen I suppose the citizens will have a procession , and if they do , I 'll lend them the old blade my father wore at Yorktown , with a pair of Hessian boots captured with his own hands from the owner , to carry as trophies above their banner . THIRD CITIZEN . Third Citizen I wonder whether Crumb is stirring ? FOURTH CITIZEN . Fourth Citizen I think not ; and if he were , he is but little of a speaker , and would thank us silently ; so let us give a good round shout , and leave . ALL . All Agreed . They shout and retire . SCENE II . In front of Brisk 's house . BRISK . Brisk Beaten !  --  After all our stratagems and schemings , the supper at Works 's , the slander at the poll ; after enlisting the uttermost rank and file of the earth , invading the canvass with the halt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening the inspectors themselves with infection  --  Beaten !  --  this is the very condensed abstract and story of the whole matter . Enter Crowder . BRISK . Brisk What say you to this , Crowder ? CROWDER . Crowder I say it 's the greatest damper that has happened since the Flood . BRISK . Brisk I suppose it has n't left you a cinder of spirit to contest the matter further ? You are completely quenched . CROWDER . Crowder Not altogether .  --  I proposed to the committee to battle it before the canvassers , but they groaned at the suggestion like whipped hounds ; and , by the Lord , they are no better than curs , or they would have made a rush for the ballot box , last night ; the inspectors passed through a by-street , and it might have been as easily done as kissing a wench . BRISK . Brisk Fie , fie , Crowder  --  We must move gently : any thing but a misdemeanor or open breach of law . You may scrawl on the glass as hard and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with my consent , make a flaw in it . CROWDER . Crowder The liberty-pole goes to the hammer at noon . BRISK . Brisk If that 's all , let it pass , it 's nothing but a stick of timber . CROWDER . Crowder That 's not all , for there 's my assortment of trumpets and banners  --  besides my extra wardrobe of electioneering coats with false pockets and spread-eagle buttons ; my crutches for lame voters ; a box of green shades for blind ones ; and my little book of facts in the private history of politicians . That 's the most cruel levy . BRISK . Brisk How , in the name of secrecy , were these things discovered by the officer ? CROWDER . Crowder Why , the cursed rascal 's a Gudgeonite , and instead of making a front-door levy as a gentleman should , the villain came in with his execution through the scuttle  --  and the first drag he made was this precious cargo , which lay in a pantry in the garret . BRISK . Brisk Unfortunate , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm now bankrupt , for , with that book in my hand , I could make myself acceptable to any set of politicians . But , my day 's over ; and now that I have exhausted my lungs and my ingenuity in this election to no purpose , I think I 'll return to my original vocation , of manufacturing bellows-snouts and hoe-irons . Retiring . BRISK . Brisk I think you are well advised in that . Politics is , after all , a poor trade : but you shall always have my custom , Crowder . I need a new snout a year , and I have two country-brothers that I have no doubt will take a hoe a piece annually .  --  Good-day . Exit CROWDER . BRISK . Brisk Now that clamorous Tom Crowder is disposed of , what shall we do with cunning Jack Brisk ? Is he on his back  --  flat on his back , think you ? Cudgelled out of all his contrivances , and beaten into the consistency of an addled egg ? Have his wits lost their saltness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into ditch-water ?  --  Not exactly  --  not altogether so . Zachary Crumb is alderman  --  old Zachary Crumb , and if I do not cozen his venerable understanding to my purpose , call me a stale herring . Why , has n't he a vote in the council chambers , the same as if John Brisk himself had been chosen ?  --  I 'll be the master of that vote , and to gain that mastery , I 'll humor the old curmudgeon 's whims . He wishes this Blanding to marry my daughter Kate : what reasonable objection can there be to that ? Kate is rich by legacy , and is destined to wed some poor fellow without a farthing  --  and why not this Blanding as well as another ? He is good-looking , they say , and accomplished .  --  It seems feasible  --  very extremely feasible .  --  But , there 's Mr. Goss  --  hard to part with so distinguished a connection , but the gruff dog self-interest shows his teeth , and we must part .  --  I 'll be quits with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . In front of Gudgeon 's house . Gudgeon , Glib , and Botch . GUDGEON . Gudgeon I thought it ill-advised  --  extremely ill-advised , not to allow me to exhibit my person more prominently during the canvass . I am satisfied it must have turned the tide . BOTCH . Botch It was only regard for your personal safety  --  GUDGEON . Gudgeon Regard for my personal safety , Botch ! Stuff ! Have I not been called the fearless Gudgeon by resolution of a public meeting  --  and am I to be prevented from throwing myself into bold relief at a critical time ? Who says that Robert Gudgeon should not have shown himself , like a man , at every conspicuous point , instead of being mewed up like a sick parrot , in a scanty room to receive hourly reports of the election ? GLIB . Glib If we had known that so much evangelical spirit was in you , we could have made a St. Stephen of you in a few minutes . GUDGEON . Gudgeon St. Stephen , St. Paul , and St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a plain man and no prophet , and I can tell you this , matters would have had a different ending if I had had my way . GLIB . Glib Why , sir , you had your way about the walk with the drunkards , and I must confess you made an admirable thing of it . GUDGEON . Gudgeon You think I did  --  Eh ? GLIB . Glib Most admirable : first , you were dressed in capital taste ; your glaring buttons made you the mark a hundred yards off , and you shone like Orion with his stars all about him ; then you pitched this way and that way so excellently , as your two friends swayed , that many thought you all three a little in liquor . GUDGEON . Gudgeon That was good  --  very good  --  but what did they say of my mode of taking snuff , as we turned the corner ? GLIB . Glib Admirable ! They never saw a point more nicely turned , than your emptying the contents of the box into your own hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ; it was the best practical joke they had ever witnessed . GUDGEON . Gudgeon So I thought myself ; but that affair of the balcony was not managed as it should have been . When they cheered for Gudgeon , I should have stepped out and waved my hat ; and when they sent the oranges through the window , it would have been proper for me to pick them up and say , " Thank ye , gentlemen  --  I 'll present these to Mrs. Gudgeon . " For that 's the way I understood it . GLIB . Glib It was a mere trick of the enemy , to draw you out and pelt you . BOTCH . Botch And drench you , too ; for I saw a great two-handed fellow with a huge syringe , loaded with dyers ' stuff  --  GUDGEON . Gudgeon They would never have dared to do it . The moment I had shown myself , they would have quailed like tame rabbits . Depend on it , that neglect of the balcony , and one or two like points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have satisfaction of Brisk , in one way . BOTCH . Botch Heavens ! I wish that could be done ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon Botch , it shall be done . I 'll have Blanding marry his daughter , in spite of his teeth :  --  and that will play the mischief with his projects , or I 'm an ass ! So Mrs. Gudgeon says . Exeunt . SCENE IV . Crumb 's house . Crumb and Brisk . CRUMB . Old Crumb This is certainly an age of miracles ; for instance , there is the old lady , my neighbor , whose eyesight , that 's been impaired these five years , is so wonderfully improved by one of the great oculists of the day , that she can now even distinguish a bankrupt 's carriage from the poorhouse hearse , that 's carrying his creditor to the grave ; an attorney from a tax-gatherer ; an officer of police from a pick-pocket ; and a physician from a criminal convicted at the Oyer and Terminer of a murder ! And now , at the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alderman , and gives me the pleasure of his society , as freely as a twin-brother . BRISK . Brisk I admit this is something out of the customary line of things , but it is as a brother , a twin-brother , if you please , that I wait upon you to-day . CRUMB . Old Crumb Well , here 's a miracle greater than them all ; a politician who but yesterday was as busy as a pawnbroker 's clerk putting out his greasy boxcoats , after the first cold nip in November , and as noisy as the Square a week after quarter-day , when all the old furniture in town comes under the hammer to pay rent  --  this self-same roaring gentleman subsiding to-day into the twin-brother  --  was it the twin-brother ?  --  of a decayed old man ! Oh ! it 's enough to burst one 's heart with melancholy ! BRISK . Brisk I hope you will be good enough to delay the bursting for the present , for I wish to enlist it 's kind services in a business that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any such business , if you could satisfy me of these conditions , I would be pleased to act . BRISK . Brisk It 's a business of a delicate nature , sir , and one in which you might scruple to be employed . But it has agitated me a long time , and I must move in it , or be miserable . CRUMB . Old Crumb If the difficulty has not been more than a century growing , and be not larger than a mountain in size , I think something may be done . BRISK . Brisk May I depend on you , sir ?  --  as brother depends on brother ? CRUMB . Old Crumb Perhaps you may . BRISK . Brisk It will require your whole ingenuity and kindness steadily employed ; in a word , ( whispering ) I am anxious to bring about a union between my daughter , Miss Catharine Brisk , and a young gentleman of great respectability , by the name of Blanding . CRUMB . Old Crumb Are you assured of his respectability ? BRISK . Brisk Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest . CRUMB . Old Crumb Of what family of Blandings is he ? There is an upper family of that name and a lower , I think . With which does he class ? BRISK . Brisk Upon my word , I never gave that a thought . The young man 's merit is so predominant , I entirely lost sight of every such consideration , and if he had been born and reared in a cave , it would not have struck me very forcibly . CRUMB . Old Crumb ( Pretending to remember . ) Blanding , Blanding  --  is his christian name Charles ? BRISK . Brisk It is , sir , and I had hopes you might know him ; in fact , I had some indistinct recollection of such a fact . CRUMB . Old Crumb Yes , yes  --  you have a sprightly memory , and you should cultivate it . But what kind of person has this young gentleman ? Is he comely ? BRISK . Brisk Oh , exceeding comely .  --  A picked man out of a thousand : a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trumpet , and a step and gesture full of majesty . He looks like one of the gods in the old painting . CRUMB . Old Crumb Hath he accomplishments ? BRISK . Brisk There he lacks not  --  for on the flute , his favorite instrument , he plays ravishingly ; every breath is an achievement , and as you listen , you regard his stick as sacred , like a fragment of the cross , or a splinter brought from King Solomon 's temple . I do believe if he had been Noah 's grandson , and had played in the ark , it would have gone far toward assuaging the wild Deluge . CRUMB . Old Crumb Now that you describe him so justly , I know the young man well . I will move him to second your wishes . BRISK . Brisk I shall be most happy .  --  Be urgent , if you please . CRUMB . Old Crumb I shall not neglect the proper means to impress on him the match you propose . ( Aside  --  Particularly as his mind is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brisk I shall regard it as a personal kindness of the highest obligation . CRUMB . Old Crumb It shall be speeded . BRISK . Brisk And will never forget the debt . CRUMB . Old Crumb ( Aside  --  If I vote for your project in the common council . I shall be satisfied if he pays the debt and relieves his memory of the burden of recollecting it ! ) It shall be looked to on the instant ; and you shall be freed quickly from your state of painful agitation . Sons-in-law grow on every bush , and I will out at once , sir , and pick one to your liking . Exeunt severally . SCENE V. The open street . Gudgeon  --  to him , Enter Botch . BOTCH . Botch It 's all arranged , sir ; Goss is to marry Miss Kate Brisk to-day at twelve ; Tom Scissors , the attorney , is to be trustee of the estate for her benefit , and immediately after the deed is drawn and the dinner over , they start for the capitol . GUDGEON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not some impostor or other under that name , it shall all be disarranged , and not a particle of the whole matter shall fall out as you have described it . BOTCH . Botch That would truly be a marvel ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon I grant you the parties shall be present at Brisk 's house as you have said , but there shall be another there they have forgotten to invite ; and that will be Mrs. Margery Gudgeon , my own spouse . BOTCH . Botch That will make a very pretty little wedding of it ! GUDGEON . Gudgeon Yes , a very pretty little wedding , Botch , but not exactly such a wedding as they contemplate . The manner of it shall be thus : you are to have my coach about the corner in the neighborhood of Brisk 's  --  the corner with the yellow front  --  precisely at eleven . BOTCH . Botch Am I to tell William to grain the horses before he comes out ? GUDGEON . Gudgeon Yes  --  let them be well filled with oats , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Hall gives out eleven .  --  You will be stationed in the baker 's yard , and when Mrs. Gudgeon shouts from Brisk 's window , you will rush along the church fence and order William about with the carriage in front of Brisk 's door . BOTCH . Botch This will be fine sport  --  something should come of all this shouting . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Something shall come of it , for I will rush instantly upstairs  --  But after that I 'll be present myself . Do you , Botch , be true to your time , and you shall see the upshot . Exit GUDGEON . BOTCH . Botch I think it will be worth something to see the upshot of all this .  --  I am to run along the church fence and up the steeple  --  no , not up the steeple , Mrs. Gudgeon does the steeple and shouts from the window of Brisk 's house ; and the coach-horses stuffed with oats run up-stairs  --  or is it William that grains the horses and Mr. Gudgeon that runs up-stairs ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's ended ! Exit BOTCH . SCENE VI . Brisk 's house . Brisk alone  --  Enter Servant . SERVANT . told you to reconnoitre through the sidelight , and not admit him . SERVANT . Servant We did , sir , but he took us by surprise , by ringing like the penny-post ; and now , sir , he 's making his way upstairs like the colossus of Rhodes in the spelling-book  --  Exit SERVANT . Enter Blanding , as Jefferson Goss . BLANDING . Blanding Good-morning to you , Brisk  --  Up with the lark  --  eh !  --  That 's your sorts . I wish I had a brace of the sky-scrapers broiled for a luncheon . BRISK . Brisk Why , really , sir  --  this is an unexpected pleasure , after the letters I sent you . You must have received them , sir , for I sent them by my attorney 's clerk , and he carries as true as a rifle . You must have misapprehended my meaning , sir . BLANDING . Blanding Not at all , sir  --  I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry me  --  and she agrees with both of us . BRISK . Brisk You have misread my letter , sir . I there stated that I regretted that a prior engagement prevented the honor of an alliance with you , and that I wished you to present my respects to your uncle , the senator , and name to him in the kindest possible way , that when he came in town to his public dinner , I would explain the business to his satisfaction . Did you read me so ? BLANDING . Blanding Something facetious of that sort I confess was handed to me  --  but it 's all a joke , Brisk . Now confess , Brisk , you wrote under the influence of excitement  --  the bottle perhaps ? Eh ? BRISK . Brisk Under the influence of the bottle , sir ! This is too much for you , even with your great connections . Am I a dunghill fowl , that you fling your spurs at me in this way ? I 'd have you know the Brisks have blood , sir  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , of Babylon , Jerico , and Hempstead , have as good veins as the president himself !  --  BLANDING . Blanding But , sir , the fun of the thing  --  BRISK . Brisk D  --  n the fun ! BLANDING . Blanding And the senator 's rage . BRISK . Brisk D  --  n the senator 's rage ! BLANDING . Blanding And my own feelings  --  BRISK . Brisk D  --  n  --  Enter Mrs. Gudgeon at one side , Kate Brisk at the other . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Bess my stars ! nere they are , and the diabolical tragedy will be perpetrated in a cock-crow . What a ferocious monster this Goss is ! I know him by the description . He looks for all the world like a buffalo that the droviers kept in my father 's woods , and fed on acorns and heifers ' milk .  --  I 'll shout to Mr. Gudgeon . ( Puts her head out at the window and calls )  --  Gudgeon ! Quick , or it will all be over  --  Gudgeon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CRUMB . Old Crumb Good-morrow , sir .  --  Ah ! a happy day to you , child . Blessed influences are abroad this morning  --  and depend on it , they will shine here before they set . BRISK . Brisk ( Aside  --  I wish I could get rid of this fellow , Goss  --  He has fixed himself upon me like the stamp-act , and I 'm afraid there 'll be a devil of an insurrection before he will quit the country . ) But where 's the bridegroom ? He travels slower than his tribe , not to be here by this time . CRUMB . Old Crumb Oh , sir , he will be here in good season , or there 's no attraction in two fair planets . Astronomy is at fault as well as witchcraft , if he tarries beyond the putting on of a glovefinger , or giving a new turn to his wedding-day smile in the looking-glass  --  ( Blanding removes his whiskers , &c.,; while Brisk 's back is towards him . ) Behold him , sir ! BRISK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely happy to see you . You need not blush , for you have not come about a business that we do not all understand , and take an interest in . BLANDING . Blanding Thank you  --  my old friend , here , has explained , I presume . BRISK . Brisk Oh yes , he has explained all . Nothing could more exactly meet my wishes . From this day forth , I shall write myself down , " the contented man . " CRUMB . Old Crumb ( Aside . ) If Greenwich lane cuts into the proper avenue ! Otherwise  --  The baffled manager ! Enter Gudgeon  --  after him Botch . GUDGEON . Gudgeon ( Shouting . ) I forbid the match ; I forbid the match . It 's arson and burglary  --  He has broken in and stolen your daughter 's affections , and he has set fire to her poor heart as he went out . Goss is an impostor , sir ; it 's case for the police court . Besides , there will be murder added , for ought I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pining this very minute in a lonesome attic , and does nothing all day , but wrap his head in a cotton handkerchief and write sonnets and madrigals and pennyroyals . BOTCH . Botch And I heard just now , as I came along , sir , that the neighbors were afraid he mediated something , because they have seen him several nights looking out of the skylight at the moon , and then running down the ladder and putting his quill in swifter motion over foolscap paper , than it ever had in the bird 's wing  --  even when the bird itself was out of its wits with fright from a double-barrelled gun . BRISK . Brisk I knew something must come out  --  I was quite sure of it .  --  Mr. Gudgeon , my intended son-in-law , Charles Blanding . GUDGEON . Gudgeon Your intended son-in-law ! That was just what I had my carriage got up for  --  and a chaplain waiting at St. Thomas 's  --  and Botch running about all the morning to effect : that very connection in the family . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this business , as Mr. Gudgeon guessed : for Goss was here a minute ago , and he has stolen off with himself ; and Blanding was n't here a minute ago , and he has come out of the earth , like Samuel 's ghost for the witch of Endor . CRUMB . Old Crumb A very pretty witch of Endor , too , you must allow has conjured him up : but there 's no ghost here , Mr. Brisk  --  so do n't tremble  --  it 's only the senator 's nephew . KATE . Kate Brisk Nor any Charles Blanding : one of the Gosses of Cross River , Mrs. Gudgeon . You are as familiar with him as a blood relation ; but it must be very cold blood , for he has almost petrified you . MRS . GUDGEON . Mrs. Gudgeon Now , Kate , I knew all the time  --  there was something about the eyes that said they did n't belong to that family . I suspected it was Charles Blanding , all the time . BLANDING . Blanding Will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to the senator  --  when I see him ? BRISK . Brisk Yes  --  when you see him : for I suppose he is as imaginary as his own nephew .  --  I deserve to be buried in lead for my stupidity in not seeing through this before ; but it was your voracity at the table that deceived me  --  I confided in that to establish your character . It might have deluded any one into the belief in your congressional connections  --  might it not , Mr. Crumb ? CRUMB . Old Crumb It might unquestionably ; particularly if , as Blanding informs me , he was vociferous about port wine and canvassbacks . BRISK . Brisk Yes , and Long Island cranberries in the bed or in hothouses ? and mutton raised on the senator 's farm . That overturned my sagacity , I admit : it was enough , you must all confess  --  for was there ever an American great man , that had n't his flocks of Merinos and Durhams and Derbyshires  --  his long naps and short naps , as well as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Gudgeon Happiness be with you , children ! and that you may start with the true principle of matrimony  --  compromise  --  I shall make Mr. Gudgeon let you have his snug two-storied house in the suburbs , where you , Kate , can look out upon green fields , grasshoppers , and chirping birds , and rivulets ; and you , Charles , by mounting to the upper windows or the roof , can catch frequent glimpses of city buildings , citizens , and gashouse smoke , and can even steal a glance into Broadway and its fantastic crowds . On the one side you will be visited by the farmer with fresh eggs and asparagus , and on the other by the taxgatherer with his annual demand , and the captain 's orderly with his half-yearly notice of parade . BRISK . Brisk And to be able to entertain these gentlemen , and others of their fraternity , such as duns and milliners , Kate shall be invested with her own property forthwith . Glib shall prepare the papers . CRUMB . Old Crumb It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , so with his consent we will call his carriage , which I saw at the corner , pack our party in , and relieve the chaplain at St. Thomas 's from the painful state of suspense which he must be in by this time ; unless the fee was paid in advance . GUDGEON . Gudgeon I took that precaution , sir . BRISK . Brisk That was lucky , and we shall all be happy without a drawback . CRUMB . Old Crumb And now I think we are all agreed on one point ;  --  whatever wranglings or differences may distract houses of Congress or Legislature , may the debates of this young house be always kindly , and have happy issues ! Whatever suffrages may be cast for other " Politicians " out of doors , may we always have your votes ( to the audience ) at the end of the evening 's canvass in favor of the candidates we venture to present ! THE END .                   @ @
