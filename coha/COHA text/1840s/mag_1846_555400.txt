txt A CENTURY has rolled away since Lord Chesterfield reached his highest point of worldly elevation , and now comes a republication of his letters , in a collective form , to press upon us the question , how his reputation stands the wear of time . It is not often that a nobleman born leaves much trace of his existence , out of the pages of a peerage-book . Still more rarely is it that he exerts a decided influence over the generations that come after him . Chesterfield is , then , an exception to the general rule . Although one of the genuine aristocracy , owing his title to no modern creation , he made himself a reputation which few of his countrymen equalled in his own day ; and , which is perhaps more remarkable , he left his mark upon the mind and manners of the English race so deep , that it will be long before it is entirely effaced . No man ever put into more attractive shape the maxims of a worldly Epicurean philosophy . No man ever furnished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory which he recommended . If Cicero came more nearly than any person ever did to the image of the perfect orator which he described , Chesterfield is universally considered as having equally sustained his own idea of the perfect gentleman . Notwithstanding his character has been often discussed , and not long ago in this Journal , we will not omit the present opportunity of noticing it once more . Lord Mahon has done for us what has never been done before , in placing the whole man most distinctly in our view . The applause of an admiring circle , and the censure of malignant enemies , of his own day , will now pass for exactly what they are worth . It has been the lot of few distinguished persons to be stripped so bare to the public gaze after death . And , strangely enough , this has happened to him of all others , who spent his life in labors to appear other than he was . The man who systematically wore a mask better than his natural face , whilst on earth , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hold up a glass , magnifying eyery deformity of his // mind , to the observation of the most distant posterity . Such is the first moral which we draw from the history of the Earl of Chesterfield . Let us , then , proceed to look at this figure more in detail . Here is a man who , without being ambitious in the highest sense of that term , was nevertheless an eager aspirant for distinction , in more than one field of exertion . He aimed to be a statesman , an orator , a scholar , and a gentleman , - in brief , a sort of model man , yet " hackneyed in the ways of the world . " And it must be conceded too , that , if his success was not entirely equal to his own expectations , it was nevertheless very far beyond the average of that of men in general . The reasons why it was not greater we intend to try to explain in the present article . If we can make it appear that they come directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to he not without success in checking the tendency of some minds to be misled by his example . If we can show by the example of Lord Chesterfield himself , that the foundation upon which he built his own edifice , which he also earnestly recommends to be adopted by his son , is , in itself , so insecure as not to be worthy of reliance , - and still more , if we can prove that it creates the difficulties which , beyond a certain point , render further progress next to impracticable , it may be that we shall turn the direction of some aspirants for distinction to other and better sources of knowledge of the paths of life . To illustrate our idea , it will be necessary to assume that the lessons which he taught , in his letters to his , son , were those upon which he practised himself . That this is not in itself an unreasonable inference can be shown by many passages in which the writer refers directly to his own case as a practical illustration of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all conveyed in this tone - " See what I did . Go thou and do likewise ; better , if possible , - hut still after my model . " In this there was no undue vanity or self-conceit . Lord Chesterfield knew that he possessed qualities which entitled him to claim a good share of worldly applause , and he also knew the labor it had cost him to make all those qualities as effective as possible . He had a right , from what he found he could do , to infer that others could succeed even better than he , if they would only take the pains which he had done . No other course than his seems to have occurred to // his mind , as likely to insure success . It is , then , proper to review his life by the light which he himself has furnished , and to trace the causes of his success or failure , so far as he may be judged to have succeeded or failed , to the rules which he lays down . The first point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading motive to exertion that is held out by his Lordship . We find but one , and that is worldly success in other words , the exaltation of the individual himself to rank , and power , and consideration among his fellow-men . This is the great end , to compass which merits that every faculty should be taxed to its utmost . In order to reach this , knowledge is to be acquired , the common every-day morality of men is to be mastered , the manners are to be inoulded , and even religion is to be respected . To reach this , we are to make ourselves all things to all men , that we may gain them all , not to their good , but to ours . Yet , in this laborious process , it does not seem absolutely required , however desirable it might be , that we should really be exactly what we appear . It is sufficient , if we can succeed in making every body else believe that we are what we profess . Lord Chesterfield expressly tells his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was " to make every man he met like him , and every woman love him . " He says , moreover , that " he often succeeded ; but why ? By taking great pains . " Yet he did not mean to be understood that these pains were taken in an endeavour really to merit such affection , but rather only to appear to merit it , which would answer the purpose quite as well , and be more easily compassed . To cultivate very high qualities of character must be the labor of a life , among even the best natural temperaments. 7f o acquire the power of assuming the appearance of them for the moment may be gained in much less time , " by taking proper pains . " Although Lord Chesterfield doubtless would have valued the genuine coin far the most , he was yet too " hackneyed in the ways of life " to require more than that the counterfeit should escape detection . According to his theory , considered apart from his own practice , it is not essential , provided only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really be so or not ; nor does it matter that he should be amiable , or just , or even honest , if he can succeed in concealing the evidence of his ill-temper , or his injustice , or his fraud , from the condem // nation of the public . His morality thus proves to be but skin deep , in fact , though he occasionally claims to show much more . We see it in the summary manner in which he despatches his orders about all the more serious parts of education . It always sounds as if he spoke thus - " As to religion and morals , a respect for the church catechism and the ten commandments , you , my son , must take it for granted that I advise all that , even though I never mention them , since my whole strength I reserve to enjoin upon you , over and over again , line upon line and precept upon precept , the necessity of always keeping in mind the graces. *** We understand , then , by the cultivation of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes the approbation of others the standard of all merit , and the advancement of one 's self the end of all exertion . A man is to learn to treat his neighbour well , not because it is due to him that he should , but rather because he may himself lose something by it if he do not . His civility is the result of a calculation of profit and loss in his own mind , by which he has arrived at the conclusion , that the balance will show a net gain to himself in not being rude . Neither is it essential that this civility to others should be carried one step farther than is needful to secure the prol ) osed object . It has its ascending scale , which is regulated by the estimation in which persons are respectively held , and consequently by the power they can wield , either to advance or to retard him . To the pauper , for example , it may be allowed to behave as roughly as possible , provided nobody is looking on , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his resentment will avail nothing whilst t'o the prince no reasonable amount of exertion is to be spared to manifest a degree of devotion that may earn a substantial recompense from his good-will . All intermediate positions have their share of regard regulated , as the custom-house would say , by a tariff ad valorem . Neither is indulgence in all the vices forbidden by the decalogue denied by this system , provided they be not practised in a manner offensive to those who are able to compel the payment of penalty for so doing . The fault of every action will be estimated , not by the nature of the act itself , so much as by the want of skill manifested in concealing it from the public . To be maladroit , as it is fatal to one 's reputation , becomes here , as it was in Sparta , the highest crime . // Now in making such an exposition of the Chesterfield code , we do not pretend to the merit of saying any thing new much less do we mean to find fault with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first published , down to the preface of Lord i'iahon to this edition , the objection has been perpetually repeated , that it converts hypocrisy into the first of virtues . How that may be is aside from the present purpose . The difficulties attending the system , as one of morals , all lie upon the surface . We propose to go a little around them , and maintain that even for the great end proposed to he gained by the adoption of it , worldly success , it is altogether unsafe , and not to he relied on . Even in the hands of a master like Chesterfield himself , the instruments it furnishes are not always sure in their operation . Sometimes they even turn injuriously upon him who uses them most skilfully and when otherwise used , as they are more than half the time by those who undertake to practise with them , they are apt to he attended with an effect upon their own prospects of advancement as well as of happiness the very opposite of what they had so sanguinely anticipated . if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case in the history of his Lordship himself , as it is now given us from his own lips , our main purpose will he fully answered . Philip Dormer Stanhope does not seem ever to have been a young man . His letters written from Cambridge betray the acuteness and discretion of an old head . rrhoe addressed to 1 ) i5 tutor , before he was of age , show that the artificial bent of his nature was even then already fixed . He devoted himself to his studies , not because he had any passion for knowledge , or any adequate idea of its uses , but because he aspired to shine by the possession of it . The consequence was early pedantry , which he got rid of only by changing the object of his aspirations . He left off quoting the classics , which he never either loved or understood , as soon as he found himself at the shrine of fashion in its citadel of Paris . The faults of the French character then became the objects of his new admiration , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own nature , that this attachment went with him to his grave . He studied to make himself a Frenchman with as much deliberate earnestness as he had done at college to become a pedant ; and his later labors were crowned with even greater success than the former ones . For the fact , that he // imitated the French so exactly in his outward manners as to he often taken hy themselves for one of them , we must rely upon his affirmation alone . But there is before us another indirect proof of his proficiency , which is more convincing , even , than this . We see under his own hand how he had learned to overwhelm his tutor , M. Joubeau , with professions of attachment which he did not feel , and to promise him many future letters in that which he meant to be his last . Let us , however , be exactly just to Lord Chesterfield . He was not insensible to the merits of the English national character , however highly he might value that of the French . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the person of his son , was the union of what he deemed most valuable in each nation . This was a union which he admits he never met with anywhere in life . After such an admission , the idea ought to have occurred to him , that there might be , and probably was , an incongruity at bottom , which made the process lie desired to effect impracticable . That he did not succeed with his son is well known . Probably the best example ever brought forth was himself . And what was the result ? certainly not such as to make it expedient to repeat the experiment . Lord Chesterfield had wit , and knowledge , and good-breeding , and tact , and eloquence , and spirit ; and yet , with the possession of all these qualities , he never secured a hundredth part of the confidence of his king or country that was enjoyed by rivals who possessed few of his accomplishments and nothing of his polish . Sir Robert Walpole was proverbially coarse . The Duke of Newcastle was almost ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successively controlled the government , whilst he wasted his time and pains in futile efforts to obtain it ; and even at last , when it appeared within his reach , the event only proved to him most convincingly that it was his fate to clutch at the mere shadow of power , whilst the reality rested in other hands . National character is the result of so many concurring causes , that it is difficult precisely to define how it grows up . The circumstances which imniediately surround a people demand of the flexibility of the human species a certain degree of adaptation to them . To the French people , who are constitutionally ardent , impulsive , and susceptible of rapid emotions , an artificial system of manners is not without its // advantages . With them , strong habits of restraint are essential to the peace and safety , not to say tl ) e happiness , of society . If we knew that a passionate individual had forced himself to cultivate the minor graces of life hecause he believed that otherwise he might be liable , occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him which would breed nothing but quarrels , and perhaps bloodshed , we should be apt to praise his resolution , even though sensible that an evil consequence might follow in his learning to be insincere . Such insincerity may be palliated so long as it is associated with the notion of regulating human passion . But when it becomes allied with coldness , when we know that the person practising it has no occasion to do so for self-control , and that he resorts to it solely for the purpose of concealing the icy condition of his own heart , making it appear warmer than it really is only to deceive us , the vice becomes in the highest degree revolting . The great body of the English race are , relatively to their continental neighbours , sluggish in their temperament , and moderate in their passions . With them , therefore , the endeavour to cultivate the graces leads to a vitiation of moral principle attended by no compensating benefit . If there be one thing for which that race is distinguished above most others , it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady admiration of examples of truth and sincerity . This virtue goes a good way to compensate for the want of quick susceptibility . And so long as the experience of the world tends to show the impracticability of uniting these qualities of the respective nations , it will be better for ea*h not to run the risk of spoiling what it has , in the vain quest of what it has not . XVe have said , that , at the age of twenty , the young Lord Stanhope had already acquired the peculiar character which ever after marked him when he was known as Lord Chesterfield . His leading trait was then , as afterwards , want of a heart . From this source flowed his merits as well as his faults . Hence sprang the coolness of his judgment , and the absence of generosity . Hence arose his aversion to intemperance in drinking , - the vice of warm and convivial natures , - and his passion for gaming , the tendency of the selfish and the cold . The same cause that polished his exterior effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working within . It made him brilliant , but superficial , // extravagant and yet not generous , captivating and yet treacherous . It secured him hosts of admirers , hut very few supporters , - crowds of flatterers , and no devoted friends . It has not often happened to a young man to start in life under fairer auspices than his Lordship . Descended from some of the best families in the United Kingdom , heir-apparent to an earldom , he came forward at the very moment when the crown had devolved upon the Brunswick family , and George the First was manifesting his gratitude to General Stanhope , the kinsman of the young nobleman , for his eminent services in bringing about that result , by placing him at the head of the government . Before the youth was of age , the doors of the House of Commons were opened to receive him , and a place in the household of the heir to the throne was secured for his acceptance . The road to power seemed invitingly open to him . That which others toil through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain , if at all , at so late a period in life as to make it scarce worth the struggle it has cost , appeared almost to throw itself into his hands at once . Little remained for him to do but to confirm the favorable impressions towards himself which his first address might create , and to convince the public , through his position in parliament , of the extent of his capacity to be at the head of affairs , should the time arrive that might require his services . Surely , if the cultivation of the graces , the elegance of high breeding , the fascination of external manner , were ever likely to avail for the benefit of their possessor so much as his Lordship would have had his son believe that they do , no opportunity could be more favorable to prove their efficacy than this which had arisen in his own case . Now let us observe what the result was . Young Lord Stanhope rushed into the House of Commons , eager to exercise his carefully trained powers in the arena of debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanover by supporting the strong measures devised in order to establish it upon the throne . Here , however , he soon discovered that the graces , a finished manner of delivery , and polished diction were not all that was essential to secure the affection of a popular body . While the gladiator was studying his attitudes , a much inferior combatant was at work effectually to shake his standing before the House . rrher was a mem15 * // ber of the party to which Chesterfield was opposed , who was gifted in a high degree with the dangerous power of mimicry . The oratory of his Lordship , depending in a great degree upon manner , if we may judge of it by his own estimate of its power , was exactly of that kind which lies most open to imitation and caricature . Whilst , therefore , we are noxvhere informed that the faculty of the mimic had any effect whatsoever in weakening the almost despotic power of Walpole , of William Pitt , or Pulteney , we learmi on the other hand that it almost sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availed to expose him to the withering shaft of ridicule , whilst they furnished him no adequate shield for his defence . Had he remained for the rest of his life in the lower branch , he would in all probability have been set down among dumb legislators , the pedarii of whom he so often and so contemptuously speaks . That an ( 1 every popular body requires a more nervous and masculine mode of address than he was found to possess . It is the place for earnest contention , and not for the make-believe sports of a tournament . Here , then , is the first example which his history furnishes , that mere manner is not so sure of success as he himself appears to imagine . For even when fortified , as in his case , by a greater coincidence of personal qualities than usually falls to the lot of public speakers , it did not enable him to overcome the most trivial obstacle that fortune could well throw in his path . Neither was the success of the young lord greater from the opportunities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family , than from his exertions on a more public field . The first event that happened to mar his prospects , one indeed for which no address can be in any manner prepared , was a quarrel between the king , George the First , and the Prince of Wales , in whose immediate service Lord Stanhope had been placed . This quarrel grew out of the circumstance , that the Duke of Newcastle had been appointed to stand godfather to the prince 's child , - which the prince thought proper to resent . The king , on his part , became violently offended . From words he proceeded to acts ; he banished his son from the palace , forbade any public honors to be paid to his rank , and separated him from his children . Neither was this all . The friends of the son were compelled to make their election // between adherence to him and a reception at St. James 's . As one of his immediate household , Lord Stanhope was thus driven to take a side . On the one hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily cut off all prospect of present promotion . On the other was the rising sun , to neglect which might lead in no very long time to consequences far more serious and lasting . iDisagreeable as the choice might he , his Lordship decided on the right side . Whatever may have been his motives for so doing , and his own theory forhids us from believing that they were disinterested , he determined to hold to the heir-apparent , in spite of every solicitation to the contrary . It is even said , that , in order to detach him from his connection , an offer was made to create his father a duke , and that by rejecting it he not only cut himself off for the time from office , but offended his parent , who would have been gratified by the title . The merit of this self-denial must he estimated , according to Chesterfield 's philosophy , by the age of the sovereign , which was then only fifty-seven . And as his constitution gave no signs of decline , it must be admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . And if done generously and without qualification , it should , upon every principle of gratitude , have secured the lasting attachment of the person in whose behalf it was made . Such was not , however , the result . Lord Stanhope became Earl of Chesterfield not very long before the Prince of Wales succeeded to his father 's throne . A new field seemed to open before him , and one in which he was much better fitted to succeed . There was no malicious mocker in the House of Lords to mar the effect of his elegant playfulness . Here was no sharp encounter of masculine minds to be apprehended . Their Lordships rather courted that state of repose which delights in gentle , as it is unfriendly to violent , emotions . Lord Chesterfield commanded their attention not merely by his positive qualifications to l ) lease , but by his relative superiority over most of them . The oratorical ability of that body has always mainly depended upon those newly created peers who have received their titles as a reward for service rendered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family had been ennobled for more than two centuries was a recommendation . // Chesterfield knew how to avail himself of this advantage . He , who as a member of the lower house had made little impression as a speaker , was listened to as a peer with the most profound attention and delight . Yet , although his altered position in this regard had thus materially contributed to enlarge the sphere of his influence , the accession of George the Second was not attended with the results which perhaps he had a right to expect . The reasons for this must in a degree be left to conjecture . So far from there being any manifestation of gratitude for past sacrifices , on the part of the sovereign , it is very certain that Chesterfield was a marked object of dislike , whilst the Duke of Newcastle , the very person about whom the original quarrel arose , managed to establish himself as a favorite during the king 's life . And here again we find an opportunity to observe the fallacy of the theory , that a cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is the surest road to worldly elevation . His Lordship had probably not been wanting in his efforts to conciliate the good-will of those whom he considered most likely to produce an effect upon his success ; hut lie doubtless overshot his mark , as worldly people are apt to do . One of his maxims , which he most earnestly presses upon his son , is that every person , whatever may be his situation about a court , may have some means of influence upon one 's fortune , and is therefore worth pleasing . " Merit at courts , without favor , " he says , " will do little or nothing ; favor without merit will do a good deal ; but favor and merit together will do every thing . Favor at courts depends upon so many , such trifling , such unexpected and unforeseen events , that a good courtier must attend to every circumstance , however little , that either does or can happen ; he must have no absences , no distractions ; he must not say , I did not mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought both to have minded and to have thought it . A chambermaid has sometimes caused revolutions in courts , which have produced others in kingdoms . Were I to make my way to favor in a court , I would neither wilfully , nor by negligence , give a dog or a cat there reason to dislike me. " - Vol. ii. , p. 267 . Nothwithstanding all this , the converse of the proposition is sometimes true , - that there is quite as much risk of injury from a mistake in paying court to the wrong persons , as iii not paying it to the right ones . Without having any posi // tive authority for affirming it to be true , we are yet strongly inclined to ihe opinion that this was the rock upon which Chesterfield found himself wrecked . It was iii his character to suppose that the mistress must have some influence over the king 's actions . Such is the lesson uniformly taught in the experience of the French monarchy , a history that had not been lost upon the observing nobleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queen all power , was an anomaly reserved for the age of George the Second . It is very certain that Chesterfield did take pains always to maintam a friendly and intimate relation with Lady Suffolk , even before the accession of the king . And his own sketch of that lady , long afterwards written , whilst it admits her want of influence , betrays the fact that he was himself privy to some of the instances in which her endeavours to exercise it had proved vain . Is it , then , unreasonable to infer , from our general knowledge of the man and the ordinary springs of his action , that he bought his own experience of its extent ? Sir Robert Walpole was a coarse and ill-bred person in comparison , and yet he gained a complete victory over his rival by neglecting the wrong and going at once to the right source of power . When the question was in agitation , at the commencement of the reign , what the provision in the civil list for the queen should be , and Sir Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 50,000 , it is said that Walpole came forward with an offer to double it . From that moment to the end of Caroline 's life , vehement as was the opposition against him , no person , and least of all Chesterfield , was able to shake this minister in the possession of the royal confidence . Such was the result of the second effort to curry favor by the cultivation of superior graces . Still another illustration of the insecurity of the Chesterfield theory to obtain the end proposed is to be found in different portions of his history relating to this same period . George the First caine over from Hanover without his wife , and with two or three mistresses , a sketch of whom is now printed for the first time among the characters which his Lordship has admirably described . Of these mistresses , the most noted was the Duchess of Kendall , with whom the monarch is described as passing most of his time , and who had all influence over him , though she was very little above an idiot . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he nevertheless preferred above all others to form intimate relations . This lady brought with her to England a young female , whom she chose to call her niece , Melusina de Schulemburg , hut whom the ill-natured world , and Chesterfield doubtless among the rest , presumed to regard as her daughter by the king . Not long after her migration , this young lady was created Countess of Walsingham in her own right , and the belief was general that she would prove the heiress of a large property . To her , then , Lord Chesterfield decided to pay his addresses , and solicit her hand in marriage . Was his motive love ? Who that reads any of his productions could ever suspect such a thing ? *Tas it pride , to seek to connect his ancient line with a person of suspected legitimacy ? But if not love nor pride , what could have been his reason but the hope of securing the ear of the sovereign through the person described by him as almost an idiot , - namely , the Duchess of Kendall ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend the cause of the feeble gratitude manifested by George the Second upon his accession . For all the expectations of Melusina de Schulemburg , which may justly be supposed to have also weighed in the balance with Chesterfield , were unquestionably regarded by the heir-apparent as likely to deduct just so much money from his own legitimate patrimony . In point of fact , the very first act of the new sovereign was to destroy that will of his father upon which the lady 's hopes depended . Yet so little did these courtly arts avail in favor of his Lordship , that even George the First refused to consent to this marriage . The reason assigned was his addiction to the vice of gaming , a vice of which the king probably foresaw the effect upon any provision which he might he likely to make for his daughter . Yet Lord Chesterfield did not on this account relax in his suit . The lady , captivated by his manners and his reputation , persisted in adhering to the object of her choice . But the marriage did not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , and when , as a connection , it had become of little value . In the interval , Chesterfield , being too important a person to be entirely neglected , had been removed from the stage of domestic contention by an appointment as envoy to Holland , receiving soon afterwards the office of high steward of the king 's household . The policy of Walpole was to put him out of sight and out of // reach . Chesterfield , flattering himself upon his possession of peculiar qualifications for diplomacy , eagerly embraced the offer thus made , and acquitted himself , it must be admitted , with great credit . But whilst doing so , he let slip the best opportunity he ever had of gaining the supreme power at home . The four years spent by him in Holland had been sedulously employed by Walpole to confirm his master 's habits of dependence upon himself . So fixed had they become , that a desperate push made by Townshend to unseat him , most probably with the connivance of Chesterfield , ended only in the disgrace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for his friend hut to join in opposition , in which , upon his return home , his Lordship accordingly embarked . It can not , then , be denied , that up to this time reliance upon courtiers ' arts had been productive to his Lordship of little beyond successive disappointments . He had not only failed to be first , but he had seen those preferred to him who were weak in the points in which he was strong and upon which he most relied . In despair , he now for the first time changed his course , and determined to trust to his general abilities more than to his address . He came back from Holland only to throw his weight into the scale against a favorite measure , and one severely testing the popularity of the minister . Sir Robert Walpole was not a man to forgive opposition , so he punished the votes of Chesterfield and of his connections upon the excise bill by immediate removal from their posts . From this date , until the minister fell , an open and active war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient party leader , not merely as a speaker in the House of Lords , but as a writer and the contriver of political combinations . Most particularly was there one topic , not often touched in vain with the British public , upon which he lavished his ample stores of wit , as the elder Pitt exhausted upon it the whole artillery of invective . This topic was the royal predilection for Hanover , and its effects upon the foreign policy of the minister . Ridicule is , of all modes of attack , that least readily forgiven , particularly when directed by an inferior . George the Second , incapable of wit himself , relished it little in others , but least of all in Chesterfield . Probably no man in the kingdom was so cordially hated by him at this time ; and to crown all , the marriage long talked of with // Melusina de Schulernburg was just then decided upon , with intimations that not even royalty itself should be a protection against a scrutinizing inquiry after the suppressed will . George is said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand pounds , though he could scarcely have felt much softened by receiving this additional evidence of his Lordship 's good-will . It betrayed something of the cat disposition , after long courting the monarch , thus to threaten him with his claws . Yet , after all , we very much doubt whether the hostility did not advance his prospects much faster than the smooth and fair seeming . fhere was manliness about it , and manliness is of all qualities the most indispensable to the success of a politician . When Sir Robert Walpole was at last hunted down , and arrangements were entered into for the purpose of reconstructing an administration out of the heterogeneous *naterials which had only coalesced to effect his overthrow , there were but two persons designated by the monarch as utterly inadmissible to his cabinet . Those two were William Pitt and Lord Chesterfield . Yet so far was this exclusion from proving an insurmountable barrier to either , that the former actually forced his way into it soon after , on his own terms , and the latter obtained , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured to him all the posts of influence which he ever acquired . In the mean time , however , the political career of his Lordship , if it kept him out of office , was not without some solid compensation . Sarah , the old Duchess of Marlhorough , had not ceased to take an active interest in public affairs , though she no longer wielded the power of her earlier days . Her hatred of Sir Robert Walpole had been intense , and proportionate was her gratitude to those who distinguished themselves in violent opposition to him . To William Pitt she left , by her will , the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling whilst to Lord Chesterfield she gave , in the same instrument , her best and largest diamond ring , twenty thousand pounds in cash , and the reversion of her Wimbledon estate in failure of the Spencer family . With this support , he could well spare two years more in opposition to the ill-assorted combination , which , at the expense of the popular favor , had succeeded to Walpole 's power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new arrangement took place , which ended in what was then // called " the broad bottom , " Lord Chesterfield owed his admission into it to almost any cause more than to his manners and address . His audience of leave-taking , upon going the second time to Holland , granted to him by the king most reluctantly , was only one continued insult . It seemed as if the occasion presented itself only to manifest the royal resentment of the peer 's courtly good-breeding . Dr. Maty tells us , that , in return for the elaborate civility and offers of service which the earl made , the king vouchsafed no other answer than the cold words , " You have your instructions , my Lord . " It rarely happens to politicians to be perfectly consistent . The man who had distinguished himself above all others by ' his opposition to that system of foreign alliances which drew the country into continental wars , was now to reopen his path to court favor by his efforts " to bring the Dutch roundly into the war " against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Cumberland to be chief of the confederate army , which , if it cost his country the defeat of Fontenoy , at any rate earned for himself some title to his sovereign 's regard . Yet even after his return from his mission , and before he went over to assume the post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland , he obtained no personal interview with the king . It was not until the rebellion of 1745 took place , in the tnidst of which George found himself deserted by his ministers , when they knew he must submit to their dictation of their own terms , as he could not do without them , that his Lordship 's disapprobation of their course seems to have entirely removed the burden of prejudice that had weighed against him in the royal mind . His services had also been of no slight value in keeping Ireland tranquil throughout the period of commotion in the neighbouring kingdom , and they were appreciated . After the lapse of a few months , his Lordship found himself at last in the king 's closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the secretaries of state . The avenue to power seemed once more perfectly open to him . He had regained it by services , and not by his address ; yet here seemed another chance by which to show how much the cultivation of insinuating manners might avail to fix a growing impression . Once more did his Lordship resort to his favorite theory to sustain him . The queen was no longer living to embarrass him , so that he felt // safe in devoting his attention to the Countess of Yarmouth . Yet , little as he spared exertion , the expected effect did not follow . His Lordship continued in office long enough to be convinced that he was overruled in every thing , down to the smallest appointment , by his colleague , the Duke of Newcastle , the man who made no pretension to " the graces and he then resigned . The result of this last experiment seems to have been so decisive with him , that he never attempted another . At the early age of fifty-four , he retired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , and he wished to be nothing less . And in his want of success he gave to posterity the most convincing proof , that , after all , polished manners can not be relied on as the basis of a political career , even though they be connected with wit , eloquence , and knowledge of the world . It will be perceived , that , even upon the mere utilitarian view of the system of his Lordship , we maintain , from a review of his own history , that it is good for nothing . We have thrown all higher arguments out of consideration , with much the same coolness that he does himself . Yet we would not be understood to affirm , that refined breeding and manners are of no use in forwarding a man 's success on the contrary , we are willing to believe them to be of the greatest use , provided only there be a heart beneath . This little element is the important omission in his Lordship 's doctrine . He seems to have thought it unessential what the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal it . But by a compensating process of nature , men are rendered penetrating in proportion to the efforts made to deceive them . The suspicion of art destroys confidence in professions . Accordingly , we find in Lord Chesterfield 's case , that , though he was much admired , he was little liked . In his assiduous court to all whom he believed to possess influence , even his sagacity could not save him from betraying himself to the most inexperienced eyes . When one of the pages about the court found himself more than once made the object of unusual attention by the earl , the boy could not help , at last , intimating to him his suspicion that he had been mistaken for M. Louis , a youth who passed for the king 's son by Lady Yarmouth . His suspicion was well founded , and the misdirected civility , thus known to be hollow , had done his Lordship harm instead of // good . Thus we may see that he who learns to be civil to his neighbour solely for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a selfish hypocrite , whom the first accident that uninasks him will render contemptible . The cultivation of a general spirit of benevolence and charity is a far better foundation for refinement of manners , because it imposes no task of insincerity . It is rather unusual , we know , to go to the Scriptures for any rule of fashionable life , and it may from some expose us to the charge of writing sermon-fashion ; but we must say that we have never understood the reason why it was necessary to go farther for the very highest theory of good-breeding , than the broad principle laid down in the Holy Book , of doing unto others as you would they should do unto you . To be sure , we should *be prevented by it from saying flattering falsehoods , merely for the sake of deluding our neighbour 's vanity yet , on the other hand , we might be allowed the pleasure of using the truth to encourage and sustain his virtuous exertion . How much may be done in this way few people entirely understand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious consolation , under the inevitable mortifications and chill produced , on first entering into the conflicts of the world . To them , flattery is rank poison , whilst discriminating praise serves as the breath of life . But there is a higher reason why the Christian precept is a more perfect rule of manners . It forbids one from committing wrong or injustice of any kind . Had his Lordship followed it , he would have been saved from many mortifications , the consequence of such injustice . It would have held him back from the cold-blooded undertaking of seducing a weak woman , merely because it had come to his ears that she expressed a very natural indignation at his licentious habits , and from the equally cruel endeavour to train up the offspring of that connection to a place it was impossible for him to reach , except through the possession of a character and abilities as much above those of his father as that father 's were above the level of the generality of men of his time . Lord Chesterfield has much to answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he formed a school , the members of which , whilst committing the most immoral acts , have kept each other in countenance by quoting his specious maxims in their defence . We do not mean to say // that vicious and plausible men of fashion did not exist before his day . Such persons have always been found in every cultivated society . What we do mean is , that he laid down a code of rules which gained immediate currency in that society , whereby great latitude was , almost by consent , conceded to certain kinds of vice . According to him , it is a perfectly gentlemanly proceeding to corrupt another man 's wife , and much more advisable , as it saves the personal risk attending general licentiousness . Yet no consideration is given to the inevitable effects that follow , upon the happiness of families , and the peace of society itself . And generally it is , according to him , perfectly allowable to disregard the rights or feelings of the rest of the world , provided appearances be preserved , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us now consider one of the cases in which , as it appears to us , his Lordship fully exemplified the tendencies of his nature . He had married a woman whom he did not love , and he was not so fortunate as to have children by her , which might have awakened some interest in her welfare . On the other hand , it happened that he had a son by one Mrs. Du Bouchet , a French woman , already alluded to , and this son he determined to make the subject of a grand experiment . His own theory was , that differences of character depend more upon education than upon nature ; so he resolved to spare no pains in making , at all hazards , this unfortunate subject fill up his beau ideal of a man . In order to do this , he wilfully overlooked the enormous difficulty before him , at the very outset , of making an illegitimate son play a first part in the history of such a country as Great Britain . Nor was this all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for the poor young man . Who shall say how much of the awkwardness and bashfulness for which his father perpetually reproached him might have been owing to an impression early received , of inequality with those immediately around him ? Who that knows boys , and especially English boys , can fail to understand how soon the smallest difference of condition makes itself felt among them , to the depression of those who are suspected of laboring under a disadvantage ? How Mr. Stanhope was made to feel this in later life , both at Brussels , and in the fruitless effort to get the appointment of minister at Venice , we see and know ) // from the letters before us . It may be very well for his Lordship to glide over such mortifications lightly , and call them inevitable evils , to be remedied only by greater exertions ; but his duty was not the less plain to reflect , before he forced a young man into such a situation , how apt it is to break down the spirit and disable it from ever entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain have made head against such an early disadvantage ! Is it , then , to be wondered at , that Stanhope , who had not elements of character strong enough to succeed , even without it , should have failed so entirely whilst under its influence ? The fault surely was not so much in him as in his father 's heartless error of judgment in educating him . Neither is this all the penalty which the poor young man has been compelled to pay . Not only has the record of his failure to be a great man been made up against him on the book of history , but his memory is destined for ever to be associated with the evidence of the labor and pains expended in vain upon him to produce any extraordinary result whatever . As a matter of common justice , the readers of the present collection should have seen a few of Mr. Stanhope 's own letters , at least sufficient to give them an opportunity to judge him fairly . As it is now , his reputation fluctuates between those who call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dull pedant , whilst still a third party do not let him off even so easily as that . Yet , admitting all that may be said against him , who is most in fault for it ? Is it to be supposed that the young man was worse , in any respect , than ten thousand people of his own or of any age , who live out their appointed number of days , respectable citizens , and who go to their graves deeply regretted by the usual circle of afflicted relations ? Why is it , then , that he should be singled out for everlasting infamy , as a dunce and a cub , or as " Base , degenerate , meanly bad , " because his father chose in his person to immortalize his own crime , and his unfeeling ambition of making an experiment , against the success of which the chances were as a thousand to one ? A common remark is , also , that , if Lord Ch*sterfleld found his son a dull scholar in " the graces , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stanhope died , 16* // leaving his father no legacy but a wife and two children , of whose very existence he had not had the slightest hint . That under these circumstances he did not at once renounce them , thus visiting upon the third generation the sins of the second and the first , has been in some quarters regarded as praiseworthy . But let us examine this act a little more narrowly . These children were at least legitimate . They had no share in the failure of their father to be what he was never made for . That father had been put , by no act of his own , into a situation to which he was not adequate , and had been deprived of all opportunity to gain any other . How could his Lordship have done less than he did ? How could he avoid giving to the victims of his delusion at least the means of escaping from its worst consequences ? We do not perceive that he attempted any thing more than this . The boys were taken care of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , acted in life about as well as the average of their neighbours ; but the dream of making finished gentlemen statesmen , luckily for them , was entirely over . The earl reserved his last words of advice more suitably for the heir of his title , a distant connection by a collateral branch , whom he also made , to the exclusion of these grandchildren , heir to his estates . Lord Chesterfield 's system made him neither a good , a happy , nor a successful man . Such being the result in his own person , we see no reason why it should be further held rip to the imitation of posterity . Yet there is something in the man , invested , as he appears to us , with all the authority of wealth , dignity , rank , and title , calculated to impose upon the multitude . There is still more in the elegance of his style , conveying as it does just thoughts in a most clear and forcible way . There was a strange union about him , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corruption of his times , and the most strict adherence in his own case to personal integrity . Early in his career , when he was appointed to succeed Lord Townshend as captain of the yeomen of the guard , that nobleman advised him tG make the place more profitable than he himself had done , by disposing of the places in his gift . " I rather , for this time , " adroitly and properly replied Chesterfield , " wish to follow your Lordship 's example than your advice . " He never sold a commission* The same spirit appears to have followed // him throughout in the administration of ' official power . He had a thorough detestation of the jobbing temper so common in England , and not by any means unknown in the United States , among political men . There is another point in his history which is highly creditable to him . He took no presents from any one , nor did he approve of them when taken by others . There is a passage in his parting letter to his godson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own character and as full of sound doctrine , we can not resist the temptation to transcribe . " If you should ever fill a great station at court , take care above all things to keep your hands clean and pure from the infamous vice of corruption , a vice so infamous that it degrades even the other vices that may accompany it . Accept no present whatever ; let your character in that respect be transparent and without the least speck ; for as avarice is the vilest and dirtiest vice in private , corruption is so in public life . I call corruption the taking of a sixpence more than the just and known salary of your employment , under any pretence whatsoever . Use what power and credit you may have at court , in the service of merit rather than of kindred , and not to get pensions and reversions for yourself or your family ; for I call that also , what it really is , scandalous pollution , though of late it has been so frequent that it has almost lost its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange indeed are the inconsistencies of man . The same mind which in this passage seems to catch a glimpse of something above the cold and mercenary level of ordinary life , in another part of these letters , treats of one of the most sacred of human relations in the following thoroughly business-like manner . " Do not be in haste to marry , but look about you first , for the affair is important . There are but . two objects in marriage , love or money . If you marry for love , you will certainly have some very happy days , and probably many very uneasy ones . If for money , you will have no happy days , and probably no uneasy ones ; in this latter case , let the woman at least be such a one that you can live decently and amicably with , otherwise it is a robbery ; in either case , let her be of an unblemished and unsuspected character , and of a rank not indecently below your own . " - Vol. ii. , p. 45*7. // celh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even any very refined estimate of human duty . We much fear that we must resolve it into temperament . Avarice was not one of his Lordship 's vices . He was above the low arts to which it naturally resorts , and the dirty crimes to which it leads . But he was above them , not because he scorned them as wrong , but as mean ; not because he admired purity of purpose and singleness of heart , but because he deemed it unhecoming in a gentleman to put himself in the power of people that were beneath him . With him it was scandalous pollution to trade in pensions and reversions for himself at court , but it was right enough to trade with a woman for money in the article of marriage . Yet if we closely analyze the moral principle involved in the two operations , it will he scarcely practicable to lay down a rule of action which would justify his Lordship 's discrimination . Passing from this subject , let us hring the present article to a close by a brief review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of posterity , whether as an orator , a scholar , a patron of letters , a statesman , a writer , or a gentleman . Few of England 's nobility have tried to shine so variously ; and if he did not equally succeed in every thing , it is surely creditable in him that he wade the attempt . We have already mentioned the circumstances attending his first appearance upon the floor of the House of Commons ; how carefully he had prepared himself , and how all his preparation was defeated by the inopportune ridicule of a member who was a mimic . This incident is deserving of notice , because it lets us into a pretty accurate idea of his level as a speaker . With a highly artificial manner it is probable that his Lordship united the amount of wit and practical good sense which we see in the productions he left hehind him . These qualifications made him an agreeable and an elegant speaker , but they did not raise him above the reach of vulgar efforts at imitation . There was wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based upon solid and noble views of man 's duties , which commands the respect and fastens the attention even of the most scornful . We have never heard that the elder or the younger Pitt , Burke , or even Fox , in spite of defects of manner , were in any degree emharrassed by the attacks that were made upon // them . Some of these , and most particularly Lord Chatham , were remarkable for peculiarities not a little striking and easy to he taken off . Yet they continued to exercise their powers with effect , placing ridicule at defiance . From this we are unavoidably led to infer that Lord Chesterfield 's own account of his oratory is not an under-estimate , and that he owed the greater part of his success in it to his polish . That success was established after he had reached a congenial spot for the exercise of his faculty , in the House of Lords . Yet very few of his speeches have been handed down to us to give us the means of judging of his style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaks of one of them as the finest speech he ever listened to , which is saying a good deal for a man who witnessed the parliamentary struggles of half a century , - from the great Walpolean battle downward . It not infrequently happens , however , that this remark is made by a person just fresh from hearing a well delivered address , the greatest merit of which , after all , comes from the effect it momentarily produces . Very certainly the specimens which Dr. Maty furnishes , in his edition of his Lordship 's works , will not sustain any similar rate of commendation . They are in no respect above the level of middling performances , and sometimes sink even below it . For example , in the second speech upon the gin act , a species of temperance question , almost the same with that which agitated Massachusetts a few years since , what sort of force is there in the following extract , if considered as a piece of invective ? " This bill , therefore , appears to he designed only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of the multitudes that inhabit it , and is perhaps the strongest proof of political sagacity that our ministers have yet exhibited . They well know , my Lords , that they are universally detested , and that , whenever a Briton is destroyed , they are freed from an enemy ; they have therefore opened the floodgates of gin upon the nation , that , when it is less numerous , it may be more easily governed . " Surely this is not the tone which would overthrow a ministry . It wants force and sincerity . We can see at once , that it was only a pleasant literary exercise for the amusement of the auditors . It would do to make even the Duke of Newcastle himself , at whom it was directed , laugh very heartily . But as to any effect which it was likely to produce in staying // the passage of the bill itself , he might as well have hoped to get it by talking in an unknown tongue . Yet his Lordship was doubtless in earnest in his speech . Temperance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detested drunkenness because it was a coarse and vulgar vice . He constantly laments , in his correspondence , the extent to which his Irish friends were addicted to it . Yet , instead of treating it in the broad and noble way by which its evils can always he made palpable to the hearer , he sacrifices the truth to frivolous conceits . This we take to be the true reason and the whole reason why his Lordship did not in his lifetime obtain the influence , and why he has not since merited the reputation , that belong to the highest species of oratorical power . Ofhis Lordship 's merit as a scholar and a patron of scholars we have little evidence beyond the scattered opinions upon books to be gathered from the letters before us , and the memorable adventure with Dr. Johnson . To scholarship , in the extended sense of the term , he had no claim , - whilst his taste , even in the limited region of belles-lettres , was far from being accurate or pure . lit is very clear that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had studied . If he had , surely he would not have prefered the Henriade to the Iliad or ZEneid , to Paradise Lost , or even to the Jerusalem Delivered . The criticisms which he makes upon the works of his favorite Voltaire appear sometimes difficult to account for . At this day , we prefer the wit of Micromegas , even though not altogether original , to the History of the Crusades , or L'lEsprit Humain ; yet his Lordship considers the latter as excellent , and the former as wholly unworthy of the author . Through all these opinions , we think we can see prevailing the same cold , worldly way of viewing things , which we find predominating on other subjects . To his mind , the cui bono seems to have been perpetually present , whatever the topic in hand might be . He complains of Milton , that , " not having the honor to be acquainted with any of the parties in his poem , except the man and the woman , the characters and speeches of a dozen or two of angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above his reach as his entertainment . Keep this secret for me , " he adds ; " for if it should be known , I should be abused by every tasteless pedant , and every solid divine , in England . " Which means to say , we presume , that to admire Milton is characteristic // of bad taste ; - an opinion which we venture to say his Lordship will not have a great many at this day to join him in , whilst it gives us a pretty fair opportunity of estimating the extent of his own taste . But if his Lordship was not himself a scholar , he certainly assumed to himself to be the patron of scholarship in others . It was to him , as such , that Dr. Johnson ventured to address his project of an English Dictionary , and not merely because his Lordship happened at the moment to be high in office . We allude to this subject the more willingly because we have lately seen some effort made to deny this , and to excuse the coldness and neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor . It is pleaded in his defence , that in 1747 , the date of the dedication , the Doctor was comparatively unknown ; that he was himself then high in office , on which account alone the address was made to him ; and that he could scarcely be expected , merely because he was an earl and secretary of state , to patronize every clever Grub Street author who might think it expedient to try to raise money out of him by a complimentary dedication . Such is the argument of one of our leading contemporary journals upon the other side of the water . It appears to us ill supported by the facts . Lord Chesterfield was not regarded as a common lord or as a common secretary of state . He had a reputation of his own for taste and discrimination upon which he piqued himself . It was upon this reputation that Dr. Johnson rested his application , without pretending to claim a knowledge of the man . It unquestionably gave him a right to hope , not that he would be made an intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform his task would from its own merit attract the great man 's favorable attention , and earn his patronage . It is the peculiar province of a Mecarnas to distinguish by his own sagacity the proper objects in whose favor to exert his influence , from those who are not so . Had his Lordship pretended to no reputation in this way , his neglect of Johnson would scarcely have been deemed an error . But he must be judged by the standard which he furnishes for himself . There can now be little doubt , that he did not appreciate the merit of the Doctor 's proposal as he ought to have done ; that he gave him ten guineas , rather to get rid of him than from any idea of encouraging the prosecution of the great literary undertaking // ; and that it was not until after the Doctor 's reputation was firmly established , when the aid of a patron was no longer so essential as it had been , that he saw his mistake , and endeavoured to make a tardy reparation for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dictionary in the periodical called The World . Surely , under these circumstances , the vengeance which the Doctor took was not uncalled for . He felt that his Lordship had only meted out to him the same measure which he did to every one , the same which every mere worldly man who forms himself upon his model will always do to those about him ; - that is , he had neglected merit whilst nobody else had found it out , and only then acknowledged it when it was no longer a secret . Dr. Johnson expressed his sense of this in a noble and dignified manner . Chesterfield felt the rebuke to be too Just ever to indulge in such hollow excuses as have been lately set up in his defence . It was one of many legitimate consequences of that system of morals which makes appearances , and not the reality , the great object to be cared for . We now come to the consideration of his Lordship 's career as a statesman , - and here we find very little to object to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding views of public policy , he nevertheless held solid and judicious ones . He was , probably more than any one of his age , the exact representative of the common sense of the people of Great Britain , which strongly relucted against the whole of the Hanoverian policy , without being able to extricate itself from it . On that subject there have always been opposite opinions , and time must yet show which of them is abstractly correct . On the one hand , it must be conceded , that , had England kept herself wholly clear from continental alliances , she would never have arrived at the high point of power and glory upon which she now stands . On the other , it is equally undeniable , that she would not have so rapidly developed the seeds of internal disorganization , under the forming process of a monstrous public debt . Lord Chesterfield had little or no adequate conception of the resources of his country , when he pronounced it on the brink of ruin in 1757 , a moment at which it was just shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer a nation , " says he ; " I never yet saw so dreadful a prospect . " " Ruin is so near , " he writes in another place , " that , were // Machiavel at the head of affairs , he could not retrieve them . " Such was the state of despondency of his Lordship , and he was by no means alone in it , at the instant when the elder Pitt was called to the helm of state , and when he proved what all this croaking was good for . But it is the nature of timid politicians to be constantly looking at the dark side of things , whilst they are in active life , and to predict irretrievable destruction , after they retire . We have had many such on this side of the Atlantic , the non-fulfilment of whose gloomy prophecies has sadly disappointed themselves and their friends . From all which experience it is safe to arrive at the conclusion , that great bodies move slowly , and that it takes a good while and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to crush the energies of a prosperous nation . But it is in the administration of Irish affairs during the time his Lordship filled the post of viceroy , that he has gained his greatest reputation . So sadly had that country suffered from its connection with the neighbouring kingdom , that it hailed the accession of a man who did nothing more than abstain from wrong-doing , as if he were a saviour . Even this negative species of excellence required on his part the exercise of no small skill and discretion , as well as much firmness . These were qualities strictly within the compass of his Lordship 's character . Of greatness or goodness we expect to find little . But all that worldly prudence and calm , shrewd good-sense could dictate may very naturally be inferred . The moment at which he was called to the post was a critical one . It was in the midst of the great success of the Pretender , in the year 1745 . Yet not one of the man Papists who unquestionably wished well to that enterprise bestirred himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more tranquil than during this elsewhere turbulent year . It is due to Chesterfield that he should receive praise for having contributed to this great result . He was , besides , a steady patron of temperance , at a time when and among a people by whom that virtue was not regarded with the same favor that it now is . He was also a decided opponent to the corruptions which long prevailed in that country in the form of government jobs . All this , joined with the fascinations of his address , excited the admiration and enthusiasm of that impulsive people . But it may reasonably be doubted whether he does not owe the greater part of his apparent suc-. // cess to the fact that he remained in office so short a time . Experience teaches us , that it is seldom in the first , or even the second , year of a popular administration that it is most likely to have its strength put to the test . There must be time for discontent to find channels by which to vent itself , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public mind . Those interested in deep settled abuses do not take much alarm , so long as remedies are only talked of . Nothing more was attempted by Chesterfield . It can not therefore be said , that the intricate problem of Irish government has been solved , in opposition to the conjoined experience of all other lords lieutenant , solely because his Lordship succeeded in carrying it on acceptably for the space of eight months . Even in the midst of the praise which we would willingly accord to him for what he did or intended to do in this situation , some qualification must be made , as we now and then catch a glimpse of the principles upon which he acted . For an illustration , we must cite his reliance upon the gavel act to effect the decline of the Catholic faith . Now the gavel act proposed neither more nor less than to bribe the members of a family , with their own money , to sacrifice one another by betraying their religious faith . If the estate of a Papist was to be divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should share and share alike , unless some one of them would declare himself a convert to Protestantism , in which case he might take the whole . Such was the law which Lord Chesterfield , in a letter to a bishop of the church , recommended should be strictly adhered to . And the most remarkable circumstance about it is , that it does not seem to have entered into his conception what kind of public and private morality he was encouraging . To him , religion was merely a respectable and conservative civil institution . A conversion from one mode of faith to another was of little moment to him , who viewed them all with equal indifference . It remains to us only to consider his Lordship 's character as a writer . This will rest in the main upon those letters to his son , which he wrote in confidence and without any expectation of their ever coming before the public . Besides these , there are , however , a considerable number of essays , furnished for political and literary journals , from which we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others give one of // his unguarded style . 1 ' he essays are remarkable for grace and a species of gentlemanly humor very much in keeping with the idea we have of their author . We might point out as examples the papers on duelling , on pride of birth , and ladies ' fashions . Although it is difficult by an extract to give a full idea of them , yet we will venture upon the close of the Essay on Duelling , not only on account of its irony , but of the more valuable truth which lies concealed beneath it . " There is one reason , indeed , which makes me suspect that a DUEL may not always be the infallible criterion of veracity ; and that is , that the combatants very rarely meet upon equal terms . I beg leave to state a case , which may very probably and not even unfrequently happen , and which yet is not provided for , nor even mentioned , in the INsTITUTEs of HONOR . " A very lean , slender , active young fellow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who has , from his youth , taken lessons of HOMiCIDE from a murder master , has , or thinks he has , a point of honor to discuss with an unwieldy , fat , middle-aged gentleman of nice HONOR likewise , weighing fourand-twenty stone , and who in his youth may not possibly have had the same commendable application to the noble science of HOMICIDE . The lean gentleman sends a very civil letter to the fat one , inviting him to come and be killed by him the next morning in Hyde Park . Should the fat gentleman accept this invitation , and waddle to the place appointed , he goes to inevitahie slaughter . Now , upon this state of the case , might not the fat gentleman , consistent with the rules of HONOR , return the following answer to the invitation of the lean one " Sin , - I find by your letter that you do me the justice to believe that I have the true notions of honor that become a gentleman ; and I hope I shall never give you reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , I must suppose that you will not desire that we should meet upon unequal terms , which must be the case were we to meet to-morrow . At present I unfortunately weigh four-and-twenty stone , and I guess that you do not exceed twelve . From this circumstance singly , I am doubly the mark that you are ; but besides this , you are active , and I am unwieldy . I therefore propose to you , that , from this day forwards , we severally endeavour , by all possible means , you to fatten and I to waste , till we can meet at the medium of eighteen stone . I will lose no time on my part , being impatient to prove to you that I am not quite unworthy of the good opinion which you are pleased to express of , Sir , your very humble servant . // " P. S. I believe it may not be amiss for us to communicate to each other , from time to time , our gradations of increase or decrease towards the desired medium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less , on either side , ought not to he con-sidered " Yet , though his essays are all of them pleasing specimens of delicate humor , they would not of themselves have redeemed his memory from oblivion . For this he is indebted entirely to the letters to his son , which , as specimens of a particular style of writing , though not always perfectly correct , are not exceeded in their way by any thing in the language . Their principal merits are their perspicuity and elegance , without a shadow of affectation . In them will be found a great sum of worldly wisdom upon the minor morals , conveyed in the most direct and intelligible shape . Even Dr. Johnson admitted their merit , although he very justly put his seal of reprobation on their tendency . We can not , for instance , too highly approve of a passage like the following upon the employment of time . " You have , it is true , a great deal of time before you ; but in this period of your life , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a minute is precious to you now , whole days may possibly not be so forty years hence . Whatever time you allow , or can snatch , for serious reading ( I say snatch , because company and a knowledge of the world is now your chief object ) , employ it in the reading of some one book , and that a good one , till you have finished it ; and do not distract your mind with various matters at the same time . In this light I would recommend to you to read tout de suite Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis , translated by Barbeyrac , and Puffendorf 's Jus Gentium , translated by the same hand . For accidental quarters of hours , read works of invention , wit , and humor , of the best , and not of trivial authors , either ancient or modern . " Whatever business you have , do it the first moment you can ; never by halves , but finish it without interruption , if possible . Business must not be sauntered and trifled with ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to Paul , At a more convenient season I will speak to thee . ' The most convenient season for business is the first ; but study and business , in some measure , point out their own times to a man of sense ; time is much oftener squandered away in the wrong choice and improper methods of amusement and pleasures . " Many people think that they are in pleasures , provided they are neither in study nor in business . Nothing like it ; they are // doing nothing , and might just as well be asleep . They contract habitudes from laziness , and they only frequent those places where they are free from all restraints and attentions . Be upon your guard against this idle profusion of time ; and let every place you go to be either the scene of quick and lively pleasures , or the school of ' your improvements ; let every company you go into either gratify your senses , extend your knowledge , or refine your manners . Have some decent object of gallantry in view at some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemble ; get into others , where people of superior rank and dignity command respect and attention from the rest of the company ; but pray frequent no neutral places , from mere idleness and indolence . Nothing forms a young man so much as being used to keep respectable and superior company , where a constant regard and attention is necessary . It is true , this is at first a disagreeable state of restraint ; but it soon grows habitual , and consequently easy ; and you are amply paid for it by the improvement you make , and the credit it gives you . What you said some time ago was very true , concerning le Palais Royal ; to one of your age the situation is disagreeable enough ; you can not expect to be much taken notice of ; but all that time you can take notice of others ; observe their manners , decipher their characters , and insensibly you will become one of the company . " - Vol . II. , pp. 227 , 228 . There is not in this extract , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time should be improved . The idea , as usual with his Lordship , is limited within narrow and selfish bounds ; yet , so far as it goes , it is sound and well conveyed . No man had a greater contempt than he for the vagabond fops who have since affected to quote him as authority for their idleness and their indifference . He understood the truth of the maxim , that a man , in order to make himself respectable , must try to be employed . Neither did he imagine , like many of his rank in England , that a title and wealth excused him from the duty of exertion in something more respectable than the mere search after pleasure . His great defect was , that he did not rest his notions of that duty upon a basis sufficiently broad . They all come back to the benefit to be gained in some form or other of personal advantage . They looked forth neither upon society , nor upon one 's country , nor upon one 's God . They were of a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to himself , that at fifty-four he retreated from the public ser-j7* // vice , not again to return to it , though invited more than once . He retired tocultivate cabbages and pine-apples , and to wear out the patience of both medical men and quacks in unavailing experiments to remedy the infirmities of his constitution . There is no cheerfulness nor dignity in the scene of his old age . His views of life are narrow , cold , and gloomy . So early as 1755 , or nearly twenty years before his end , he indulges in the following strain of reflection , when addressing his friend , the Bishop of Waterford . " My deafness grows gradually worse , which in my mind implies a total one , before it he long . In this unhappy situation , which I have reason to suppose will every day grow worse , I still keep up my spirits tolerably ; that is , I am free from melancholy , which , I think , is all that can be expected . This I impute to that degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . I have enjoyed all its pleasures , and consequently know their futility , and do not regret their loss . I appraise them at their real value , which in truth is very low ; whereas those who have not experienced always overrate them . They only see their gay outside , and are dazzled with their glare ; but I have been behind the scenes . It is a common notion , and like many common ones a very false one , that those who have led a life of pleasure and business can never be easy in retirement ; whereas I am persuaded that they are the only people who can , if they have any sense and reflection . They can look back , oculo irretorto , upon what they from knowledge despise ; others have always a hankering after what they are not acquainted with . I look upon all that has passed as one of those romantic dreams that opium commonly occasions , and I do by no means desire to repeat the nauseous dose for the sake of the fugitive dream . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean that I have no remorse ; for a life of either business , or still more , pleasure , never was nor never will be a state of innocence . But God , who knows the strength of human passions and the weakness of human reason , will , it is to be hoped , rather mercifully pardon , than justly punish , acknowledged errors . - Vol. iv. , pp. 149 , 150 . This letter was written to one of those whom his Lordship somewhere else is pleased to designate as a species of constables " appointed by the sovereign power of a country to keep up decency and decorum in the church . " This may account for the unusual approximation to a religious feeling which we find in the extract . Yet what does this // amount to ? His Lordship , satiated with the pleasures of life , looks back upon them with much the same feeling that a man in the morning has about his last night 's debauch . He has no warming sense of services rendered to others ; of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hearty will ; of mutual kindness cultivated between himself and others ; of humble resignation to the will of God ! No ! the scene , as he looks hack upon it , is cold and wintry , showing marks only of scorching desolation from the heat of summer passions . And the present enjoyment , such as it is , proceeds from vacuity . Nor yet does he make it very clear , that his own history disproves the correctness of the common notion which he condemns . His retirement will scarcely furnish encouragement to any who may be anxious to leave the busy world in quest of ease . His letters form one continued lament , partly owing to his increasing deafness , partly to disappointment as to his son 's success , but most of all to the absence of all the nobler motives of action in life . This is the grand defect of his whole theory . The man is liable to outlive the system , and then the world becomes a dreary blank . Cut off from society , from public life , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious faith , Chesterfield was as much isolated at sixty as the blasted oak in the centre of a barren heath . Yet over all this wretchedness , there still remained , like a coat of steel upon a skeleton , the glazed and polished surface of good-breeding which his Lordship had laid on thick to conceal the deep defects of his early years . Even upon the bed of death , " Give IDayrolles a chair , " were the last expressed thoughts of this worldly earl . Not a single exalted sentiment fell from him , at that moment , to counteract the chill of a long career . He was indeed , what he describes himself , one hackneyed in the ways of life . We have endeavoured to show in hishistory the nature and the advantages of such a training . Let those who are inclined to be fascinated by his example take warning by his fate . In the vihw which we have taken , it will be seen that we have not dwelt upon the moral tendency of the advice to be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon in many former publications , as well as in the pages of this Journal , that little can be added . We shall therefore , avoiding the grosser passages , simply content ourselves // with extracting from the maxims addressed by his Lordship to . his son such of them as seem most briefly to embody the character of the author . " In your friendships and in your enmities let your confidence and your hostilities have certain bounds ; make not the former dangerous , nor the latter irreconcilable . There are strange vicissitudes in business . " " It is always right to detect a fraud , and to perceive a folly ; but it is often very wrong to expose either . A man of business should always have his eyes open , but must often seem to have them shut . " " If you would be a favorite of your king , address yourself to his weaknesses . An application to his reason will seldom prove very successful . " " A cheerful , easy countenance and behaviour are very useful at court ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make designing men think you an undesigning one . " " Flattery , though a base coin , is the necessary pocket-money at court ; where , by custom and consent , it has obtained such a currency , that it is no longer a fraudulent but a legal payment . " " The reputation of generosity is to be purchased pretty cheap ; it does not depend so much upon a man 's general expense , as it does upon his giving handsomely where it is proper to give at all . " - Vol. ii. , pp. 322 - 326 It would seem , by the care which his Lordship bestowed upon the sketches of the principal persons of his time , as if he must have meditated some extensive work of an historical kind , in which they would naturally have found a place . Had the whole been executed with any portion of the spirit to be found in these fragments , the author would have earned a still higher reputation than he is likely now to hold . Among them , one of the most curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maty , or his successor , thought proper to suppress , whilst he published in his edition most of the rest . The portraits of Sir Robert Walpole , of Lord Hardwicke , of the elder Pitt , of the Duke of Newcastle , and of Lord Bolingbroke , will continue for ever valuable to those who wish to understand the history of the early Brunswick princes . Chesterfield 's habits made him a keen observer of the virtues and vices , the merits and the follies , of other men ; whilst his judgment was not warped , as that of many is apt to be , by any excess of sympathy with or of hostility // to them . In this , as in all things else , he shows his great want to have been the want of a heart . We scarcely know how better to close this view of his character , than , without meaning to excuse him , to apply his own remark upon a much bolder person than he in both extremes ; we mean his friend , Henry St. John , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the whole of this extraordinary character , where good and ill were perpetually jostling each other , what can we say but , Alas ! poor human nature !
