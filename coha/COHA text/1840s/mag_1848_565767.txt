txt A WARLIKE as well as a lewd and effeminate age is known by its literature . We can not doubt that the reign of Charles II . was infamous for the licentiousness of the court and the people , when the hooks of that period so clearly evince the fact ; when history recorded , without a blush , the debauchery and vile intrigues of the King and his ministers , and biography celebrated the exploits of the most depraved characters ; when low satires and amatory songs *became the popular poetry ; when the drama exhibited , without a moral , shameful scenes of vice , and the performers were applauded in proportion to their skill in rep resenting the basest passions ; when the adventures of a Rochester and a Buckingham were themes of romance ; when the elegant arts partook of the general corruption , music lent its " voluptuous swell " to the lascivious dances of lords and ladies , and painting was employed in the production of obscene pictures and in displaying the beauty of the king 's mistresses ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , " his muse appeared like the chaste lady of the Masque-lofty , spotless and serene . " The age of chivalry was fruitful not only in deeds of valor and courtesy-in the adventures of roving knights , rapacious barons , * Washington and his Generats , by J. T. Headley . Baker &amp; Scriboer , *ew York . and the exploits of the crusaders but in descriptions of battles and totrnaments , tales of Arthur and Charlemagne , rules of chivalry , the martial l*gends of the monks , and the metrical flbt ions of the Trouveurs . The heroic periods of our own country are marked by corresponding illuminations along the path of her literature . The war of the revolution , undertaken for the establishment of colonial rights , waged for independence , and won through valor and patriotism , closed amidst the general rejoicing of an emancipated people . The writers of that day , sympathizing with the soldier , proclaimed their sentiments in pamphlets , sermons , orations , narratives , memoirs , histories , which furnished materials to subsequent writers for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1812 , prosecuted for the defense of " free trade and sailors ' rights , " when our navy won victories on sea and lake , and our chivalry renown behind logs and cotton bags , and our invincible columns marched up to Canada and then marched back again ,  --  the Browns , the Jacksons , the Woods , the Wools , the Scotts , the Ripleys , the Pikes , the Perrys , the Hulls , the Macdonoughs , the Decaturs , lived in countless volumes of heroic story , to mark the time of their achievements by the warlike tone of our literature . The " Peninsular campaign , " or the conquest of some live Indians , of the Seminole tribe , // by American troops , fighting side by side with the blood-hounds of Cuba , winning laurels with these illustrious " dogs of war " in the swamps of Florida , produced books on the military art , and the best methods of training blood-hounds ; diaries , and letters of officers , biographies of distinguished generals , lives of Indian chiefs , &amp;c. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in letters , as well as in arms . XVe now come to the last and most renowned campaign , which crowns its authors with more glory than the killing of Tecumseh , or the trapping of Oceola . This republic , cramped within the narrow limits of nine hundred thousand square miles , determined to stretch herself a little , particularly her southern limb , for the enlargement of the " area of freedom . " this movement arousing a jealous neighbor to the protection of her territorial rights , led to a serious misunderstanding between the two nations and to a declaration of war . Our troops are ordered to cross the Nueces-Palo Alto and iResaca de la Palma become famous battle fields . Soon our cannon are pointed across the Rio Grande-Matamoms , Camargo , Monterey and Saltillo yield to our arms  --  the ensanguined field of Buena Vista tells of unparalleled feats of bravery . The renowned Scott , " the hero of Lundy 's Lane , " vied with the invincible Taylor , " the hero of Okiechobee , " in martial exploits . Vera Cruz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulloa could not *vithstand our bomb shells . Our commander in chief , pausing in mid career of conquest , like a true knight of the temple , foremost in religious zeal as well as in valor , reverently entered a Popish cathedral , and in his inimitable style , gracefully receiving between the extremities of his thumb and fore finger a burning taper , in the plenitude of that charity which spurns sectarian bounds , bent at the shrine of the Virgin Mary . The embattled heights of Cerro Gordo could not resist the shock of our arms . Jalapa , Perote , Puebla , Contreras , Churubusco , Chapultepec , were speedily surrendered , and our triumphant soldiery have " reveled in the halls of the Montezumas . " True , this war has cost us a hundred and fifty millions of dollarsmore than thirty thousand human lives have been sacrificed-causing , throughout our land , a wail like that of Egypt for her first-born children  --  the manners , morals , sensibilities and principles of rulers and people have been corrupted , and the nation is condemned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition . But our regulars and volunteers have proved the native valor of the Anglo-Saxon race - that one of this stock is a match for five Mexicans behind intrenchments-Mexico has been taught the striking lesson that if we want any of her land we will have it-if she owes us any thing she shall pay in provinces , as well as in the blood of her citizens . Presidential candidates have been provided for the next twenty years  --  and a trophy of the conquest , the cork leg of Santa Anna , has been set up in our national museum . But the conquest of Mexico is not the only achievement of these days of glory-bookmakers , catching the spirit that is abroad , have multiplied their productions and supplied , in profusion , books for the times . " Grim visaged " warriors in gilded frames frown upon us in print shops , parlors and public places . The periodical press records the most remarkable incidents in the lives of American generals ; and a merchant 's clerk , or printer 's journeyman , turned out of employment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the seat of war as Texas , figures in half a column of newspaper , as the gallant // Capt . A. or LieuL B. of the - regiment . A list of " popular books for sale " runs something in this way-Napoleon and his Mar. shals-Life and Campaigns of Na. poleoa-Washington and the Gen. erals of the Revolution , ( Cary &amp; Hart ) ; Washington and his Gener. als , by Headly-Washington and his Generals , by Lippard-Taylor and his Generals-Polk and his Generals-Life of Santa AnnaLife of Ringgold-Life of Gen. Put . nam-Life of Marion-Life of Jack . son-Incidents of the RevolutionBook of the Army-Book of the Navy-The War of Independence - Knights of Malta-Life of Zachary Taylor-Indian Wars , including the discussion of the question , who killed Tecumseh ? The pains taken by authors of books of this description , to celebrate war and warriors , is the effect of that false opinion of military greatness which has so long enthralled the human mind . If warriors have generally held the first place in the esteem of the world , it is not surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enshrine the man who has commanded an army , or taken a city . We intend , however , in some of the following remarks , to question the claim of military heroes to such peculiar honor , and to show what place they should occupy among those who have acted a conspicuous l ) art in human affairs . " It is hard , to be sure , " says John Foster , " very hard , that what has been bedizened by the most magnificent epithets of every language , what has procured for so many men the idolatry of the world , what has crowned them with royal , imperial , and according to the usual slang on the subject , immortal honors , what has obtained their apotheosis in history and poetry , it is hard and vexatious that this same adored maker of emperors and demi-gods should be reducible in literal truth *f description to the occupation of slaying men , and should therefore hold its honors at the mercy of the first gleam of sober sense that shall break upon mankind . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest of them , are not so preeminently great as their eulogists seem to suppose . Their intellectual endowments are not of the highest order . We do not mean that rare warlike talents are never combined with first rate powers of mind , but , that from the nature of the case , the highest abilities can never be developed either on the field of battle , or in arranging the complicated machinery of human slaughter . It is affirmed by Marshal Saxe , that " the most indispensable qualification of a great commander is valor , without which all others must prove nugatory . " This language may mean that a general must be bold in the execution of his plans , fearless and self-possessed in the midst of danger , ready to face death at the cannon 's mouth if it is necessary to complete " a turning mano3uvre , " or to restore order to his wavering troops . Although valor , in this sense , is something more than brutal courage , which hurries men to destruction without reflection , or regard to consequences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the comprehension of a few facts , and firmness of purpose , will enable a general to lead his columns into action in gallant style , and to ride for a whole day in front of his line on a " milkwhite charger , " while bullets are whizzing a bout his ears , and cannon balls faMing around him eyery moment . It often exists in perfection in those who show little capacity for knowledge , or talent for intellectual pursuits , There have been great conquerors who seemed incapable of understanding the simplest principles of science , or of the condi.ict of public affairs . Dull on all subjects but those of the camp // and the battle-field-their scope of thought scarcely reached beyond the range of their cannon . Nor is valor an uncommon quality . Under different names , it belongs to masses of men . It is a characteristic of whole nations . A coward , in the ranks of an army , with the eyes of his comrades upon him , is a curiosity , and when in such circumstances , one soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred soldiers will rush upon it . If valor is the crowning excellence of a general , his " indispensable qualification , " he can not claim the hornage of the world for his intellectual greatness , though he is as valiant as was Alexander , or Publius Horatius , the one-eyed hero , who saved Rome on one occasion by withstanding a whole army . The application of " grand tactics , " is considered to be an exhibition of great powers . Of the elementary part of this art , including the principles of " right about face , " and " forward march , " and the formation and evolutions of companies , battalions and divisions , it is not necessary to speak . To form an army in the order of battle , and to bring it into action , are more complicated parts of the same business . The best positions for offense and defense are to be chosen ; masses of troops are to be arranged according to the relative strength of the opposinir forces ; different modes of attack or protection are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigency of the occasion may demand ; feints are to be made , surprises defeated ; and the whole force of infantry , artillery and cavalry , brought to bear upon the enemy with the greatest effect . These operations , conducted in the best manner , require skill , sagacity , penetration , judgment- " a quick eye , a ready conception , a prompt execution . " Writers speak of the transcendent display of genius in scenes of war-of " prophetic vision , ** " sublime conceptions , " " profound philosophy , " exhibited in dispositions and maneuvres : but when they come to particularize , the climax ends in terms of less lofty import ; - such as , " sound understanding with some genius , " " prompt arid vigorous resources ; " - " to accomplish all the purposes of war the judgment must be clear , the mind collected , the heart firm , the eye incapable of being diverted ; " " all offensive and defensive operations in the field require mobility , solidity , impulsion , and the greatest possible amount of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in simple or complex form , in " parallel order , " or " parallel order with a crotchet , " whether the enemy 's array is pierced , or turned , or the attack made in column , or in line ; on one , or on both wings ,  --  however great the " mobility , solidity , impulsion and amount of fire , " there is no exhibition of those powers and qualities which we shall presently speak of as belonging to the highest order of intellectual greatness . The greatest display of what is called military genius lies in the conception and execution of an extensive campaign , like some " master stroke " of Frederic or Napoleon . To form a plan of this kind , which , embracing half a continent , is to he carried out in the face of gigantic obstacles of nature and art ; to direct the march of large masses of troops , with all their material , by different routes to a prescribed position , so as to concentrate the several divisions of a grand army , with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking a decisive blow ; to anticipate the designs of an enemy , and to forestall his movements so as to meet him at a vital point with a superior force ,  - -  requires the action of no ordinary mind . It demands uncommon capacity , invention of expedients , comprehension of details , knowledge of physical science , clear discernment // of probable events , sound judgment and power of combination , but not the exercise of the highest intellectual powers , such for example , as are seen in the discoveries of science , the abstractions of mental philosophy , and the creations of poetry . We shall not attempt to prove this assertion by regular steps , but the common sense of mankind will judge correctly in the case , if it is not dazzled by visions of martial glory . Some achievements of the mind we place instinctively among its noblest efforts . Some things in nature inspire at sight the emotion of the sublime . Without argument mentation , we say that the cataract of Niagara is a grand object ; not only so , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary waterfall . We may of course compare things more unlike in their nature , yet having common qualities , and say , that poetry surpasses painting in its effects upon the imagination . By a kind of intuitive judgment of this sort , we say that an epic poem transcends the plan of a great campaign , and requires the action of a greater mind . They bear a certain resemblance to each other ; some of the same powers , though in an uneqisal degree , are employed in bothsome of the processes of thought and secondary results are the same - both , abstractly considered , excite admiration ; but the judgment which is formed of their comparative greatness , is in favor of the poem . Take one of the greatest military operations in the annals of war , the campaign of Napoleon in Germany in 1805 . Draw it out in form , and consider the ability displayed in its consummate manoeuvres . With what forethought this master of the art of war , foiled on the shores of the British Channel in his attempt upon England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling scheme a cover to his designs in the heart of the continent ; with what invention , comprehension , judgment and knowledge , he moved the several corps of his grand army , of two hundred thousand men , from different stations , to occupy certain positions with the precision and speed of a troop of cavalry ; with what skill , penetration , and combination of scientific rules , he disposed of these forces , so as to capture one army , paralyze another , defeat a third , and by these manoeuvres , to gain the advantage of dictating his own terms of peace in the Austrian capital . Take now Milton 's Paradise Lost - consider its plan , its scope , its theme , embracing " things unattempted yet , in prose or rhyme , " the melody of its numbers , the sublimity of its style , its wonderful creations , its heaven of truth , its depth of learning , its philosophy " to the height of this great argument , " to " justify the ways of God to men " - all indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts in any sphere of thought ; and tell us which is the noblest work of genius , which the production of the crreatest mind ? In reasoning about a the impressions and opinions caused by a comparison of this sort , one would say , I see in the first , only arrangements for surmounting physical obstacles , for moving one mass of human beings upon another mass of human beings , by means of the various appliances of war , so as to accumulate at eligible points the greatest possible number of men and guns . These operations require , indeed , the action of a mind " fertile in expedients , prompt in its decisions , and sound in its judgments ; " but I do not perceive that the employment of physical force to overcome physical force , so as to fulfill in the highest degree the conditions of that art which was defined by Napoleon to be " the art of dividing one 's self to subsist , and of multiplying one 's self to fight , " hoavever coml ) licated the machinery by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of its conquests , requires the exercise of some of the highest intellectual faculties , as *magination , taste , creative genius , or the profoundest action of the reasoning powers ; such as distinguish the poem , and the productions of the first class of orators , statesmen , philosophers , artists and men of letters . The difference then between a great poet and a great general , is a difference in the kind as well as the degree of mental power . One exhibits greater capacity , finer faculties , deeper research and nobler conceptions , than the other . The genius of the *varrior is concerned with gross forms of matter ; that of the poet acts upon the immortal mind . The one is tangible and circumscribed , the other is subtle and boundless ; one traces its way with uncertain steps , the other with assurance ; one reaches its results by calculation , the other by intuition ; one combines , shapes , invents , the other creates and brings to view new truths and new forms of truth one is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty divine ! " One is blasted by the frost of a single night , or buried in the snows of a Russian winter-the other endures forever . To accomplish all the objects of ordinary campaigns , no great talents are required ; only those who have been inventors in military science , or have so far improved the inventions of others as to claim equal honor , come near enough , in an intellectual point of view , to men of real genius , to deserve a comparison with them . In general , it is only necessary for commanders-in-chief , field marshals and officers of inferior grades , to follow approved rules , or obey instructions , making some allowance for accidents , in order to arrive at distinction in the sublime art which consists in " mobility , solidity , impulsion and the greatest possible amount of fire . " Its prac tice , so fettered by rules , necessarily requires only a scanty stock of ideas and a limited range of thought . To acquire its scientific principles may expand and sharpen the mind , as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but to apply these principles under the instructions of military discipline , does not admit of the same degree of inquiry and progress as other vocations of a corresponding rank . The profession of arms , therefore , can not claim the respect due to any of the learned professions , because these allow of independent thinking and acting , and of variety and range in the subjects of pursuit and contemplation . " Is the military character , " inquires Dymond , " distinguished by intellectual eminence ? - is it not distinguished by intellectual inferiority ? I speak of course of the exercise of intellect . I believe if we look around , we shall find that no class of men , in a parallel rank in society , exercise it less , or less honorably to human nature , than the military profession. ** If to acquire distinction in this vocation demands uncommon abilities , it can hardly be accounted for , that celebrated warriors have been so abundant , in all ages of the world and among all nations . They have come up in troops upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them by violent revolutions , or to cut their own way with the sword . They have come too , like Minerva , in full growth and panoply . While ancient history celebrates a few orators , poets , philosophers and artists , its pages are studded with the shining names of generals and conquerors . The same is true of all history . Among remote tribes having scarcely a gleam of intelligence to attract attention , there have sprung up mighty chieflains claiming a share of the common fund of glory . Every considerable war produces famous warriors to order , and the supply is always greater than // the demand They come from the plough , the shop , the counting-house , as well as from military schools . On every suspension of arms , marred and scarred they seek their homes , to excite " pitying tears " and to receive the choicest honors of the brave . But though it is true that great emergencies produce great men , and that some , without any regular training , work their way to posts of high renown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach tnaturity in a night . They stand " like a few light-houses along a thousand miles of coast , " and not as thick as markers in a regiment . If then men are to he judged of and applauded , according to their comparative intellectual greatness , we can not account for the distinction conferred upon military heroes by the acclamations of the multitude , and by those who record their exploits . The same difficulty occurs , when we come to consider the effect of their achievements upon the common interests of mankind . It is easy to point to acts of individual prowess in behalf of the suffering victims of oppression or calamityto life preserved , to liberty restored , by the gallantry of ancient and modern heroes . By armies and battle ships , a nation has maintained , for a season , her independence . A check has been given to the incursions of predatory hordes ; an oppressed people have arisen in their might , and cast off the rule of a tyrant ; civilization has been carried into the midst of barbarism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both new channels of wealth and knowledge . Though advantages like these have in a few instances been gained when all the bloodshed and desolation which war has produced , together with its effects , present and to come , upon the morals of nations and of individuals , are taken into view , even in these cases how much have its benefits exceeded its evils ? it is to be considered , besides , that in most of these cases , the advantages might have been secured by peaceful means . It is often said that the invasion of Mexico by our armies , will there result in important political changes , and the triumphs of pure Christianity . Says a southern divine , speaking of this war , " every soldier will be a colporteur , and every cannon-ball a tract . " One would think that a few millions of dollars well laid out , might have prepared a broader highway for the progress of the true Gospel in that country , than the military road opened by our troops . Major General Winfield Scott , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same communion , who fell while fitting himself for the holy order of deacons , in the trenches before Vera Crnz , at the head of twenty thousand devoted followers , making their way by prayers and alms-deeds , sustained by the vigoreus measures of government , would have done more for the evangelization of poor bleed ing Mexico , than Captain Walker 's Texan colporteurs , or Captain Bragg 's tracts . That a few instances , however , have occurred in which , all things considered , the effects of war have been apparently beneficial to society , and in which these advantages could not have been secured without a resort to arms , we are willing to admit . But apart from particular cases , what is to be said of war in general , of the " aid and comfort " that it bestows upon the human race ? It is conceded by the most reasonable advocates of the necessity of keeping alive a military spirit , that wars of ambition , undertaken for national glory and aggrandizement , wars of retaliation or revenge , predatory wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust wars , or as one of them affirms , " murder on a large scale . " How much then of armed violence , of strife , and mor // tal struggle of furious combatants , may be put under the comprehensive title of murder on a large scale . What blessings , on the whole , in return for these evils , have warriors brought into the common fund of human happiness ? Where , in universal history , we find an empire has been founded by them in one age , it has been destroyed in another-where civil liberty has been established once , it has been overthrown many times-where the arm of one oppressor has been broken , the arms of a thousand oppressors have been strengthened-where the life of one human being has been saved , a hundred thousand lives have been sacrificed . If the visible sway of Christianity has ever been extended by the sword , it has oftenor lost its power . If it has been the means of turning any to righteousness , how many has it sent , without a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of retri-bution ! True , warriors have done some good ; the convulsions which they have made the world pass through in tearful agony for its best blood and choicest treasures , have brought forth some changes , some improvements ; their march has not been all woe , all desolation . Some green things have sprung up among the ruins they have left-some useful changes have followed their footsteps ; so does a serene sky follow storms  --  a healthful breeze , the sirocco-population the track of the pestilence , and sculpture flourishes in grave yards . They have indeed added to the triumphs of art , but their monuments are tombs and their great works cities of the dead . Have these men then , done enough good , to be classed among the benefactors of their race ,  --  among those who , discerning the great principles of truth , and solving the difficult problems of their application to human conduct and to the productions of genius , have enlarged the realm of thought and multiplied the means of happiness , or among men of moral sublimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feeling that " like a wound , " have struggled hard in a good cause , and set enduring examples of patience and suffering for conscience sake . Why should not these men have the triumphs and wreaths , reserved for the successful warrior ? Why should he personify greatness ? Has he fairly earned his " apotheosis in history and poetry ? " Is not his profession " reducible , in literal truth of description , to the occupation of slaying men , holding its honors at the mercy of the first gleam of sober sense which shall break upon mankind ? " Entertaining these views of martial heroes , we are displeased with those books which represent Washington as chiefly distinguished for his military talents . Among the great men of modern times , he holds the first place . His high rank is his award by the consent of the friends and the enemies of that independence which he won and established by his achiev&amp; ments in the field and his counsels in the cabinet . It is the tribute of an admiring world to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our affection , we call the Father of his country , and who is known abroad as the great American . The times in which he lived , the nature of the contest in which he was engaged , the conspicuous field of its display , and the successful issue of that contest , have undoubtedly enhanced his fame . But no casual concurrence of events , no adulation of a grateful people , no admiration of military talon ts , can account for the fact that the world has departed from its usual estimate of greatness to do such peculiar honor to one not distinguished for what are called brilliant actions . The character of Washington has been so often ably drawn , that our brief remarks may seem a repetition of familiar thoughts ; but our aim is rather to keep his ex* // ample in view , than to present it in any new light . Sculptors , in chiseling the human form , do not copy any single specimen , since one faultless in every part , is not to be found in nature ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of one , the hand of another , and the foot of a third , the ideal of a Michael Angelo or a Canova , is realized . Since man came out of Eden , deformed by sin , it is by selection that a perfect character is delineated . But if we were to point to an individual combining the greatest number of model-traits , it would be to Washington . In him physical and mental power are seen in true proportion-strong intellect with fine sensibility-high moral principle equal to the control of impetuous passions , valor and consummate prudence , imagination tempered so as to allow of the clearest decisions of the reasoning powers-profound judgment-great firmness and great forbearance --  untiring zeal and great moderation-self-esteem with supreme reverence for God-unequaled disinterestedness , deliberation in counsel-promptness in action . He was a soldier without cruelty-a statesman without selfishness-a patriot without ambition-seeking , in all his actions , the approval of his conscience , rather than applause or emolument . He appears in time of war to save his country from foreign dominion , and in time of peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise administration of its affairs , and closes his official life by a renunciation of its honors , and spends his last days in preparing for the enjoyments of that world , which his Christian faith taught him to regard above earthly rewards . No act of his life as well illustrates so many points of character , as the position he assumed in view of the threatening aspect of our foreign relations at one period of the French Revolution . Here are seen his clear foresight of coming events-the deep political sagacity which devised means of relief without provoking to the last extremity the enemies of the government and the abettors of war  --  the skill which carefully adjusted the conflicting claims of England , France and Spain  --  the courage which withstood the clamors of faction , the arms of rebellion , and " the bravadoes of the Republican envoy "  --  and the stern regard for principle alone , which , encountering the hatred and defamation of his countrymen , risked an unrivaled reputation for the defense of right and the blessings of peace . At a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandly does this man appear , in his communication to the Senate of the United States containing these memorable words- " but as peace ought to be preserved with unremitted zeal , before the last resource , which has so often been the scourge of nations , and can not fail to check the advancing prosperity of the United States , is contemplated , I have thought proper to nominate , and do hereby nominate , John Jay as Envoy Extraordinary of the United States to his Britannic Majesty . " The rare combination of qualities in the character of Washington , is one reason why many persons who profess to admire his moral excellence underrate his genius . The powers of his understanding were in such harmony with each other and with his affections and moral faculties , that they do not appear in their real eminence without examination . Nothing is prominent where every thing is pleasing through symmetry . An edifice of the finest proportions is not at the first glance so striking an object , as one in which some defect , sets off the finer parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the singular beauty of an antique column or portico , in some rude specimen of architecture , strikes us at once . If // Washington had lacked some of the qualities of greatness , he would have appeared to ordinary minds as a more brilliant genius-like some of his compatriots whose faults showed off their excellences , or like some of those who in all ages of the world have excited admiration by dazzling strokes of war , dashing experiments in civil government , or splendid eccentricities . The untaught mind that , discerning the conservative principles of order and happiness , could apply them in the best manner to the objects of free legislation and executive control , and preside over the formation of a new government on an untried field , and prove its vitality , and test its strength , by conducting it safely through the severest trials , must have been a great mind . " To adjust , in the best compromise , a thousand interfering views , so as to effect the greatest good of the whole with the least inconvenience to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which insure the safety of public liberty ; to marshal opinion and prejudice among the auxiliaries of the law ; in fine , to touch the mainspring of national agency , so as to preserve the equipoise of its powers , and to make the feeblest movements of the extremities accord with the impulse at the center ,  --  is only for genius of the highest order . " Thus the hero sinks before the statesman , the science of war yields to the science of government , and the moral sublimity of good actions transcends the pomp of military exploits . In this view of the character of Washington , his military talents appear in their proper place ,  --  thrown into the shade of rarer and more excellent endowments . That he possessed the ability of the first order of generals , is proved by his conduct of the Revolutionary war , as well as by particular instances of skill , such as his operation after the action of Princeton , which is considered by critics one of the best of the kind on record . Though not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a difficult and untried field , as to merit the honor of invention . On the theater of Europe , at the head of the disciplined armies of France , he might have gained some of her most celebrated victories . If , indeed , to plan and manage campaigns in all circumstances , so as to secure the greatest possible success , constitutes the ablest general , Washington was superior to Napoleon . Washington might not have attempted some of his master-strokes , hut in a long and tedious campaign , or in a series of campaigns , extending through many years , he would have gained more real advantage than the " great Captain , " through his superior prudence and judgment , which were never perverted by the ardor of desire . He never would have plunged into the disasters of the Russian expedition , which was not only a political error , but a grand military blunder , conceived in a false estimate of the chances of war , and of what men and guns can do against the most formidable obstacles of nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the essential rules of warfare . Though Washington was a warrior , he had the true view of real greatness , and of the creed commonly adopted by belligerent powers . " How pitiful , " says he , " in the eye of reason and religion , is that false ambition which desolates the world with fire and sword for the purposes of conquest and selfish ambition , compared to the milder virtue of making our neighbors and our fellow men as happy as their frail conditions and perishing natures will permit them to be . " Lie appears in a bloody revoluition more like a savior than a hero , wielding a shield rather than a sword , as if sent , since the passions of men would stir them up to strife , and hurl them together in mortal combat , to check // their ferocity , to mitigate horrors which he could not prevent , and in the wisdom of a dear-bought experience , to utter a solemn protest against the motives and principles which commonly involve nations in war . In this , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is hardly to be mentioned in the same category . We see in one , magnanimity , dauntless courage , irresistible energy , connected with rashness , ferocity , besotting vices , and an insatiable love of conquest which spurned the limits of the habitable globe . In another , we see love of country , and all the qualifications requisite in so great a commander , connected with cruelty and implacable revenge . In Napoleon , we see tremendous destructive power , ceaseless activity , inventive genius , with a devouring ambition , which desolated the world . " He was a conqueror-he was a tyrant . " In all these we observe the warrior 's passion predominant-that love of glory , which must be gratified at any expense of human life and happiness ; but in Washington , the closest scrutiny can detect no such deformity , and the record of his achievements is without one stain . A true view of this great man , therefore , is not given in a military sketch-book-with the portrait of XVashington in regimentals for a frontispiece  --  and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , with effect , thrilling scenes and remarkable incidents , interspersed with allusions , carefully made , for the show of consistency , to such matters as " going to church " and wisely administering affairs of state , and to such traits as disinterestedness and self-control . His true history is one of moral changes and political events , affecting the interests of rnankind ,  --  of the start and and growth of a great nation protected by honesty and courage ,  --  of truth and justice and all the virtues . In the narrative. , his military career of course comes in , but subordinately both in importance and interest . A writer who spends the force of his descriptive talents in exhibiting Washington as a hero of rornance ; who dwells so long on his martial air , that we forget the majesty of goodness , which surrounded him , and gives such a lustre to his sword , that we see not the charmed rod of a peaceful authority , by which his greatest achievements were accomplished ,  --  does violence to history , and mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be taken for granted by a large class of writers , that every thing connected with our Revolution was of course right , and will bear endless repetition , in every variety of form and coloring . Is it perfectly clear , however , that this contest was delayed until all the expedients had been tried which Christian morality , ( we do not say national morality , as expressed in custom and law , ) required . Might not our cause have prevailed over the tyrannical measures of the British ministry and parliament , by peaceful opposition ? What if the colonists , without the show of armed resistance , had said , and had continued to say , to the king of England , " We are your children , our rights are the rights of British subjects , and we are determined to maintain them by all lawful means . We will use none of your stamped paperbut we will not pull down the houses of the stamp officers , ' and compel them to fly at midnight , with their wives and children , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect any revenue in these colonies without our consent , and will agree to non-importation and non-consumption , ' and make any sacrifices which the exigency of ' the country demands ; but we will not beat and bruise the officers of the customs , nor burn the ships of government . We protest against the quartering of troops in // Boston  --  but we will not provoke them by insult , nor assail them at their posts of duty , compelling them in defense of life to commit the Boston massacre . ' We will use no tea  --  but we xviii not protect Indians ' in destroying the tea of the East India Company . While we protest against the Boston port bill , we will not vote to enroll minute men , and warn every man to prepare himself with a good fire-lock , ammunition , &amp;c . ' To maintain these declarations , we pledge our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . ' With an American party in the House of Lords , an American party in the House of Commons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orators to plead for us , as Camden , Chatham and Burke , Great Britain can not be forever deaf to our complaints , or mistaken as to her own interests . We entrust the success of our cause , to a bloodless , self-denying opposition . " Lest this suggestion which may seem rather quakerish , should be misunderstood , we repeat it in a little different form . While it is conceded that there may be such a thing as an excusable war , and that a resort to arms might have been necessary , at a certain crisis of our colonial affairs ; we say that many of the measures which brought on that crisis were riot marked by the forbearance , the sacrifice of present good , the concessions , and every possible precaution , demanded by humanity and religion . The parliamentary debates , and indeed any impartial annals of the times , show that the riotin* , the burning , the pillaging , the " tarring and feathering ; " the insulting and wounding of the officers of the crown ; the destruction of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval , or secret connivance , of the mass of the people ; the show of weapons , and the " resenting , " says a standard historian , " with equal indignation , the most trivial , as well as the most serious attacks , " - all these things confirmed the British government in its system of oppression , and brought on the shock of arms . These measures , notwithstanding the petitioning and remonstrating of the colonists , exasperated the ministry , discouraged the friends of America in England , alienated more and more the inhabitants of the two countries , and prevente ( l reconciliation , until the pride , nourished by the victories of a thousand years , of a haughty conqueror , being fully aroused , it was declared in Parliament that the " question was no longer one of taxation , but of the redress of wrongs , of reparation for deeds of outrage . " Hence , the passage of those odious laws , including the Boston port bill , after the destruction of tea in Boston harbor , and by such large majorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence the unanimity of the British people in favor of these measures . Says Botta , " these new laws were received in England with universal applause ; as a general and violent indignation had been excited there , by the insolence and enormities of the Americans . " Dr. Franklin has given an explanation of the whole matter in a few words : " The preamble of the stamp act , " says he , produced the tea-act  --  the tea-act produced violence-violence , acts of Parliament-acts of Parliament , revolt . " By a reliance , then , upon the justice of our cause , in the spirit of firm resistance , marked by no acts of violence , if we had not obtained what cost us a seven years war , we might at least , have gone into that war without stain or reproach , having done nothing to provoke it-having tried every expedient , and made every sacrifice , which Christianity demanded . Besides , are we to forget the agency of the Supreme Being in human affairs ? Lie was appealed to , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " might He not have been // relied upon to turn the heart of the king , as well as to pierce the shields of the mighty ? His good Spirit , invoked to preside over the deliberations of hostile cabinets , might have accomplished as great a deliverance as the angel of death who smote the British host ; and though neither chariots of fire , nor horses of fire , had appeared round about our encampment , one like unto the Son of God , might have been seen in the midst of the fiery furnace of trial . What a beautiful page would now be opened in history had our independence been the pure concession of an arbitrary government to the principles of civil liberty and the rights of free citizens ; - what an example to the nations then waking up to the importance of asserting these rights , and beginning to feel around the old foundations of privileged establishments . By these remarks we mean not to disparage the men who bore the brunt of the Revolution . They loved liberty-they loved their country . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our feelings are alive to the stirring scenes connected with their history . In view of Lexington and Bunker 's Hill , our emotions are like those of every American . We are not royalists , nor tories , but New Englanders- " real Yankees . " We like , sometimes , to listen to an old soldier as he tells about that hard winter in Valley Forge , or how Washington looked as he rode up to some of his troops one morning with the intelligence that supplies for the army would reach the camp before night , and how it happened that he heard him praying one morning , in a retired place , that the Supreme Ruler of events would put an end to the horrors of war . But these men were not infallible . XVe may be allowed to question the soundness of some opinions , the expediency of some actions , deemed right and excellent in Their day . The world has rolled round many times since 76 . As we live in the midst of clearer illuminations of truth , and farther on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground on all subjects which concern the improvement and happiness of our race . Yet allowing all that can be claimed for the heroes of the revolution , what good is done by these fanciful exhibitions of their exploits , ten thousand times repeated , with only some slight variations of perspective and scenery ? What object of mental improvement , what useful art , what knowledge , what virtue , is to be secured by " illustrating the battles of the revolution , " which a popular author informs us was his " great labor , " in writing a book of seven hundred pages , in which such a desperado as Paul Jones is held up for admiration by the side of George Washington , and mere bravery is the charm of its heroes . Such representations serve only to exalt warriors and excite martial ardor . And whatever may be said of the revolution , such a war is not likely to occur again in all time ; and this excitement , kept alive as a reserved force for the great emergencies of our republic , must find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or spend itself in fantastic parades . If the last were the only evil to be apprehended from the heroic literature of the day , we would keep silence , content with what is gained in the department of letters by fancy sketching and poetic description ; but in view of greater evils we complain , and we intend to complain , of those book-makers who from desire of fame , or love of money , or wrong notions as to the tendency of their writings , send forth captivating descriptions of scenes of carnage , whether they are drawn from the battle grounds of America , or the charnel fields of the French Revolution . War is a dreadful evil-war , in its mildest form , is a dreadful evil . // Let it be described truthfully , so as to excite aversion instead of pleasure and applause , and the same dread as the ravages of disease , or a stroke of the pestilence . A band of painted savages at the sound of the war-whoop , rushing upon their enemies , is war ,  --  war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not in blue and buff-war without the usual accompaniments of starspangled banners , splendid uniforms , brass bands , and the consequent effusions of romancers and ballad-mongers . The flash of a scalping knife before the eye of a dying victim , and the loss of the scalp-lock , make but little difference with the thing itself . Is this more dreadful than some of the modes of killing practised by civilized nations-for example , than the exploits of the Texan Rangers in Mexican villages , or the sending of hot shot , bombs , and every sort of deadly projectile , into the midst of a populous city , wounding , crushing and killing men , women and children , for the mere purpose of " strikincr terror into its inhabitants . " Make some of the surviving sufferers of Atlixco poets and historians , instead of Campbell and Col. Stone , and we would have descriptions of scenes as dreadful as those of Wyoming and Cherry Valley . To represent a combat between two regiments in the style of some writers  --  to call a fight , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deadly passion , they rush together armed with long knives and loaded guns pointed with daggers , and after firing at each other 's hearts , cut , hack and stab , until half of their number lie gasping in the agonies of death  --  to call this " a splendid affair , " " a brilliant action , " " a glorious engagement , "  --  to say , as one of our generals , commanding in Mexico , said in his despatches , after giving an account of the storming of Chapultepec , in which a thousand men were laid in their blood on the slopes of that fortress , " no sight could be more animating or glorious , - seems to us , not only an abuse of language , but in this age of the world , unpardonable inhumanity . There is corning a better time than 76 or 48-when , cherished opinions yielding to Christianity the full control of human conduct , the differences between nations and individuals will not be settled by mortal combat , and men in the refinement and fellowship of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our times , at the pretexts assigned for acts of outrage and aggression , at our armaments and military engines , our howitzers , paixhans and " peace-makers , " our percussion guns , revolvers , and bowieknives , and the whole family of deadly projectiles . But the greatest wonder will he , as they turn over relics of these curious things , in museums and antiquarian halls , by what contrivance they were made to prevent the effusion of blood , and to " conquer a peace . " Notwithstanding the gloomy aspect of some passing events , especially in our own country , where we are to look for the first signs and the first fruits of this auspicious period ; there are some signs , and some sure words of prophecy , which foreshow its coming . Every lover of humanity , even if he regards not the highest happiness of man as a renewed and holy being , but simply the abatement of a dreadful scourge on the earth , hails the approach of such a day . Can authors then too soon begin to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false sentiment , no poetic coloring , shall weaken the natural impressions of actual war ? And can those who give the first lessons of morality to the young , too carefully shield them from the influence of those books which , keeping before their minds the visionary splendors of martial life , lead them to covet distinction in arms , rather than in the // pursuits of learning and the arts of peace ? The Spartan mother sent forth her son to battle , giving him his shield , and saying- " Go , my son , return with this , or upon it . " The Christian mother should teach her son another lesson : " If thine enemy hunger , feed him , if he thirst , give him drink . " This seems to accord with the sentiments of Washington , as appears from the following incident . While on a journey to the frontier settlements of NewYork , soon after the close of the revolutionary war , he stopped for a night in the valley of the Mohawk , at the house of a lady whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons to the General , with the remark , " I have devoted these sons to fight the battles of their country . " " I hope , madam , " replied Washington , " you will train them for a better service ; I have seen enough of war . " We intend to make particular allusion to only one of the books whose titles are prefixed to our article , viz. , Washington and his Generals , by Headley . Having before , in a review of Napoleon and his Marshals , ' expressed pretty freely our opinion of Mr. Headley as a martial biographer , we consider it unnecessary to say much of this work , which is marked by the same characteristics as its predecessor . There are in both the same indications of hasty and careless composition , the same slashing style , the same profusion of jumbled metaphors , crude expressions , and unfinished sentences , the same disregard of sense and syntax , the same mock-heroic sentiments and rash assertions , about the same number of earthquakes and thunderbolts , with a sprinkling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondness for battle scenes , and of his admiration of warriors . " Washington and his Generals , " however , is if possible , more loosely written than the other , while it lacks its vigor and freshness ; and its rapid passage through a number of editions is owing more to its subject and the popularity of its predecessor , than to any merit of the work . Its apparent inferiority in point of composition may arise in part from the fact , that Mr. Headley 's peculiar style is not remarkable for those qualities which wear well . The secret of this he has inadvertently revealed in his preface . In alluding to the charge of repetition , he says , - " The intense words of our language are soon exhausted , and one ' is often compelled , in describing thrilling scenes , to choose between a weak sentence and the repetition ' of strong words and perhaps similar comparisons . " Here lies the capital mistake of this writer . He tries to be intense , but not in the right way . A thrilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two extremes , and it being absolutely necessary that a thrill should be produced , it decides in favor of the intense ' words , and now they come down upon the reader " like an avalanche ; " as if beauty , or pathos , or sublimity , in writing , depended upon strong words and startling comparisons , and not upon clear conceptions expressed in natural language , and the indescribable touch of genius given to the whole scene . It is like the mistake of the painter who wishing to produce a striking portrait , makes ' every feature as prominent as he can , and loses the likeness , which depends not on a Roman nose , nor a Grecian forehead , but upon the expression , which comes from a mysterious combination of all the features , and which the talent of the real artist can alone impart . Mr. Headley 's repugnance to weak sentences is probably the reason why we have such strong ones as the following : - " With all his strong passions bursting , and nothing but themselves to burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which furnish the climax of rage . " " The water was charmed into foam by the raining halls . " " Those shattered veterans then swung , rent asunder , and rolled heavily to their camp . " " The smoke refused to lift in the damp air . " " The silent redoubt suddenly again gaped and shot forth fire like some huge monster . " This constant effort to produce effect hy the use of emphatic words and startling comparisons , running out sometimes into rant and nonsense , offends the reader 's taste and presents so often the sfime images to the mind that they become tame and wearisome . If , frequently in the course of a chapter , and sometimes twice on a page , a charge of troops or a stroke of a broadsword is compared to a thunderbolt ' - thunderbolts become as common as any sort of bolts and make no more impression , and thus tameness , the very evil shunned by the writer , comes round at last . For our own part , we prefer a weak sentence now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but thetnselves to burst upon . " The fault alluded to belongs not only to our author 's descriptions of scenes , but to his delineations of character . The impressions which his sketches make upon the reader are at best vague and unsatisfactory on account of much confusion in the plan and conduct of the narrative , and a want of connection between the several parts . We observe , for example , at the top of a page , such a topic as " His influence over others "  --  but in looking through the remarks under this head we find observations upon changes in a man 's style of writing , or some anecdote illustrative of patriotism or magnanimity , which , by no art of construction , can be made to relate to " his influence over others . " We find asserted on one page , what is denied on another , so that we are often unable to gain a distinct idea of the men brought before us or of the author 's opinions of his own heroes . This impression however is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they performed many wonderful exploits , but their individuality is lost in their greatness . The truth is , Mr. Headley is not a writer of lives . He has a talent for describing some scenes with much vividness and effect , but not for drawing characters . He repeats a great many facts , makes many sensible observations , and gives some characteristic touches ; he forms a gilded frame for a portrait ; he sketches , he l ) aints , he bedizens ,  --  but he does not portray . His volumes therefore are sketchbooks-fancy pieces : they give us the scenes of the Revolution , but not the men of the Revolution . As public observers and informers of the moral tendencies of popular books , besides expressing our own views of the subject of this work , and protesting against such delineations as are fitted to foster the war-spirit , we feel bound to notice certain dangerous statements inculcated here and there in its pages . We do not accuse its author of intending to teach anything contrary to sound morality . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong way , or his absorbing admiration of military chiefs , he , at times , confounds alt distinctions of right and wrong . We particularly refer to his manner of estimating character , by striking a balance between a man 's good and bad qtalities . He says , in speaking of General Lee , " The lamb can not become the lion , nor the lion the lamb , by any sort of cultivation . Therefore such a person is not to be judged by the extent and frequency with which he passes the line of right . " " His noble generosity , magnanimous self-devotion to the welfare of others , his hatred of oppression and scorn of meanness , are to be placed against his bursts of passion , sudden revenge , // and those faults which are committed in moments of excitement . Of Paul Jones- " he was an irregular character , but his good qualities predominated over his bad ones . " Of Arnold- " several stories are related of him to prove that he was dishonorable , many of which are doubtless true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in my estimation ; " " this noble and generous act offsets a thousand accusations of meanness . " Again he says of General Lee- " one ought always to average such a character as that of Lee , and let the good balance the bad . " Now let us look at our author 's own account of this man . " His hatred was intense and unsparing , and where it fell every green thing withered . The hostility he exhibited towards Washington , to the day of his death , is the only instance in his life when he seemed to be governed long by a revengeful feeling . " " With all his strong passions bursting , and nothing but themselves to burst upon , he became a prey to those self-lashings which furnish the climax of rage . " " It was this which fed and kindled into tenfold intensity , his wrath "  --  " he sprinkled even his letters with profanity " - " his vanity , ambition and self-confidence were enormous , his morals were as bad as his manners-he was terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions . " " His religious sentiments may be gathered from his will . After bequeathing his soul to the Almighty , he declares that he thinks a man 's religious notions are of no consequence-adding , a weak mortal can be no more answerable for his persuasive notions , or even skepticism in religion , than for the color of his skin . - - - I desire most earnestly that I may not be buried in any church , or church-yard , or within a mile of any Presbyterian or Anabaptist meeting-house ; for since I have resided in this country , I have kept so much bad company when living , that I do not'choose to continue it when dead . " This is the character " one ought always to average and let the good balance the bad . " It strikes us that such a rule of judgment confounds all moral distinctions , overlooks the ruling principle of conduct , and lessens our detestation of the most depraved characters . Every human being has good impulses , and does some things that accord with the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , according to this philosophy , may be neutralized by a hundred acts of bravery and munificence . We could multiply examples , if they were necessary , to show that such a rule applied to character , as in the work before us , is most pernicious . Of the historical inaccuracies in these narratives we shall say nothing , since our limits will not allow us to go into the necessary references and details , and other journals have already , to some extent , discharged that duty.
