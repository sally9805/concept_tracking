txt THE elements of human happiness are few , simple , and universal . We have bodily needs and spiritual longings in the gratification of which all enjoyment consists . We want the means of satisfying animal passions and desires , opportunities for indulging our soul 's sentiments , friendly companionship , intercourse , thought , a calm conscience , the attainment of our wishes or ambitions . Every man has more of what he is , in common with all others , than of what is peculiar to himself . Take us generally , as a race ,  - -  and we have settled it by the common consent of all generations that riches-a command over the material earth and its products-is the first great element of happiness . For this we strive daily and nightly ; for this we peril health , risk life , sacrifice self-respect ; the auri sacra fames is the first appetite of mankind . All the maxims of philosophy or the precepts of religion can not eradicate it . The reason is that it so plain to the human reason that riches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness , that not to believe so is to disbelieve our senses . Next to wealth perhaps we love power and place  --  but why need we enumerate these things ? Are not these truths all written in the book of the chronicles of the world 's history ? Do we not find in our own hearts , when we look deepest into them , that what we regard as the things that would go to make up a sum of happiness-those that enter into the realization of our ideal , are nothing more nor other than those same old bubbles that misers have toiled for , kings and generals braved death for , artists and poets wasted life for , and lovers gone crazy for ? We may speculate , and inystify , and iranscendentalize ourselves , *s much as we please , but when we come to the very essence , we are but plain men and women after all-very much alike in all essential particulars , agreeing on all questions that influence our actions , having the same general notions of the earth and of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palate , fine linen to the back , that it is better to ride than to walk , to live without labor than to depend upon it , to be rich , great , powerful , respected , feared , reverenced , than to be poor , little , weak , de spised , scorned , pitied , to be loved than to be hated , to have friends , than to be friendless , to have a good conscience than to live conscious of wrong-doing , to be all , in short , that we all would be than to be what we would not . The pictures of the means of happiness present themselves to be sure under as many different forms as there are individuals ; one wants this farm , another that , another 's heart is set upon a house , a horse , or merely a new Leary ; one wishes to rise in politics , another in letters , another more humble looks to establish himself in a home ; and so with the weaker sex , it is not the same shawl pleases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all men and all women taken together the tendency of opinion is unanimous in a certain direction . The elements of happiness are agreed upon , few , and simple , and the motives they give rise to equally so . Whatever difficulties the study of human nature *presents , whatever strange developments it exhibits , there is in this aspect , no difficulty in penetrating and reading through it as if it were transparent . God has made of one flesh all the nations of the earth , and however much it galls our pride to think so , we are of the same blood with the poor Fuegian ; the proudest senator may be in Heaven 's eye only even with the Dyak chief whose hut is hung with the skulls by which his greatness is reckoned , and the Brummel of Broadway may be no more exquisitely clad than the cannibal dandy of Feejee . We all tend one way ; the human heart is the same in all countries and ages . As in a fertile meadow that lies under the warm sun in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no two alike , no two bent the same way or surrounded by exactly the same influences , but all are growing upward , so it is with living men and women . The great burdens of life press more or less heavily on all . We have similar cares , hopes , desires . The same likeness prevails in our minds as in our bodies , and the motive powers of one are as easily recognized as those of the other . Desire for wealth , for power , for fame , for a city life , for a country lifewho shall classify all the shades of mo // tive ? It were as easy to describe individual limbs . Yet there is a general resemblance , and a general disposition to look for happiness to objects which may be enumerated almost on one 's fingers . This general and physical psychological likeness is also universally known and recognized by high and low , rich and poor , all qualities and conditions of men . We all know that we require food , raiment , shelter ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we love very much the same things in essence , however much we may differ in the means we take to obtain them , however much we may deceive ourselves , and fancy we are striving for one object while our hearts aim at another ; there is , in short , a universal consent among all mankind in relation to the few main purposes that move us most deeply ; in other words , there exists all the world over , and always has , in all the strange phases the race has gone through , some tests by which men have judged and decided upon what is sane and insane , reasonable or unreasonable , in relation to their motives and actions ; and these tests in all the wiser and more civilized families , have been applied in so nearly the same way that we may regard men 's opinions concerning what they mostly live for , and are impelled by , a& much the same in all times and conditions , and consider it a fixed fact that there is such an attribute of humanity as COMMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring to act in accordance with the decisions of this common sense must ever lie at the root of all that is excellent in character or achievement . That is , a man , whatever he is or achieves , must in the first place be a being of like passions with the generality of his kind , susceptible to common animal wants , desires , impulses and influences ; he must have the same eyes , " hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections ; he must be fed by the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed by the same summer and cooled by the same winter ; if you prick him he must bleed , if you tickle him he must laugh , if you poison him he must die .

The greatest genius that ever lived , ate , drank , lived with his wife , worked , made money , and spent it like other men . Doubtless a large share of his time and talk was occupied by these matters ; doubtless he that could make his Falstaff speak so musically and humorously of the virtues of " your good sherris sack , " had quaffed many a cup in his own proper person . Doubtless , ere the heyday in his blood was tame , he had " kissed the keeper 's daughter , " as well as stolen his deer . The age and place permitted more license than our new England does now . Or if he fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been because he had always more than ordinary control of himself , and could resist temptation with more than ordinary firmness . For , that good living , and all the bodily l ) leasures of life , would have been real temptations to him , there can be no question . And yet was there ever a purer soul than his , into whose calm depth there floated such living images of beauty , modesty and goodness as Miranda , Ophelia , Desdemona ? Was there ever a mind more busied with deep searching thoughts and subtle wisdom than his who produced Hamlet , Romeo , and Macbeth ? Or more capable of resolute reasoning , the craft of law , and politics , than that which gave us Wolsey , Antony , Ulysses ? God forbid that we should hold him up as an example of moral perfection . That he was but after all an erring man may he readily admitted , and yet we do believe that the substratum of sound common sense , the experience of actual life and mere every day notions , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only a healthy condition . It may be necessary now to publish family editions of his works , but , for all that , we believe that there are few living at this present time worthy to cast a stone at him as a greater sinner against purity ; and still more , we have no doubt it is this grossness of common life manifested in all his plays which has more than any other quality made them survive , and yet exert such // power over the hearts of the people . His thoughts are like those curious pictures in which any one may see the design and drawing and coloring broadly laid on in great effective masses , but which a closer examination shows to be wholly made of the rarest mosaic , gems , and precious stones of all lustres , fayed together with infinite art ; or rather like those choruses of Handel 's , where the untaught ear only hears the wide rolling volumes of sound , while the musician is listening to the different voices winding in and out , striving and contending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ever a more perfect picture of guileless , natural , ardent love , than is painted in Romeo and Juliet ? Two young hearts so loving and so like to each other ( by an instinct of Shakspeare 's healthy soul all his lovers and heroines are counterparts ) that if either had not met the other they could never have loved , and having met they can not be parted ; both so passionate and so childlike , so quick and yet so deep and tender - what lovers there may be in the Italian poets we know only by hearsay , but doubt if there be any like this unmatched pair anywhere but in Verona . Their minds are all refinement ; their talk is all poetry ; they are as delicate as can be , yet not fragile ; their lives are all passion ; and still they are actually alive , and the main motives which impel them the roughest mind that ever drank the music of their vows in the pit or gallery of the theatre can feel the truth of , if not understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be where no touch of nature moved him . They are , after all , common sense lovers ; they long to be married ; they talk to each other in a plain unmistakeable language ; their feelings appeal to universal nature ; they do not stop to sentimentalize over the matter ; they have actual purposes , and these tend the same way that they should do and must in all true lovers . The only difference is that they are all delicacy , tenderness and poetry ; their souls are finer , their hearts purer than ours ; but still they are real souls and hearts . There is none so stockish but a pure passion will wake in him some touch of poetry , and there is no lady worth loving that does not wish to be joined to her lover in actual wedlock ; yet there are few of us whom love or any passion could teach to discourse in gentle Romeo 's manner , and few damsels it may be without sin suspected , who meet the embraces of their young husbands with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we recall the glorious procession of lovers and ladies that walk through those bright pages , we shall remember that it is equally true of them all , that whatever phases their love appears under , whatever peculiarities of character they may have , they are all alike in this , that they live , move , and have their being , in the same simple passions , hopes , fears , motives that we recognize in ourselves . They are not automatons , male and female Frankensteins , made by art to seem like men and women ; they are not like the men and women of Kotze. hue , and those of that school , who are tortured to death from motives which while we acknowledge sufficient to produce such effects , we feel that we cOuld not be so moved by ourselves ; they do not oblige us to go upon another plane and assume as existing a sense which is not common , to conceive the sun rising out of the West , and men and women dying to save not a real honor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all the while see the folly of obeying ; they take us where we are , and come home at once to our " businesses and bosoms ; " the pure-minded among them are as pure as if they were " enskyed and sainted , " yet their purity is not a sentiment , a condition put on and worn like a garment , to conceal deformity ; their modesty is not prudery , it is not like much of our socalled in these refined times , an offensive modesty , nor even a defensive one ; it is a celestial atmosphere surrounding the soul , invisible , and impalpable , yet that can not be blown away ; like the foam at the foot of a waterfall , if you strike it it is is not injured , look ! it trembles there as pure and whole as it was before . The gross and vulgar that move among them do not soil them ; they are just such rude men and women as the world is full of ; and the villains , their villainy is not contagious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtuous they appear with , as does the smirking scoundrel dandy whom mamma tells her daughters to beware of , or the mean grovelling thriver whom she does not tell them to beware of , at an evening party make leprous the white souls of those daughters . They are possible and actual gross men and villains ; some almost unconscious // of their own deformity , others with the perception of purity and truth not quite gone , but dulled and dimmed , as it must be with all mere beasts or rogues . They do not sin like our sensualists and scamps in modern novels , from the best of motives , nor with such an oppressive consciousness of their sins as is intended to make us feel for and pity them . They have none of that high-souled French enthusiasm that loves to leap into the Seine , and is never so right as when it is most wrong-an enthusiasm about as real and manly as that maudlin grief displayed by Mr. Richard Swiveller , when he clings to . the lamp-posts and determines to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character which , though so often painted , never existed , by which the leaden dross of rascality and the steel of true manliness are fused together in one mould , so that the casting is at once the most ruthless and reckless spoiler , and the most exalted and tenderhearted gentleman . Even Macbeth , who was paltered with by fiends , and his infirm purpose all the way strengthened by the wife he loved ; even he , whose spirit was so clear , and thought " so brainsickly of things " at the first , becomes turbid and muddy after he has " filed his mind ; " and he shows not that creamfaced disposition to love virtue and purity which our novel villains betray so much of while they are plotting hideous crimes , but a resolute determination to stifle all thought ; he does not amuse his leisure by probing and scarifying the wounds he has inflicted upon his conscience , but he endeavors to tear out his conscience altogether ; his dreadful regrets are not sentimental musings , which it is his habit to indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of all his resolution ; he goes foundering on like a stout ship whose pilot is determined to wreck her , and cares not to turn his eye towards the safe channel he has willfully neglected to keep . In fine , whether gross , vulgar , criminal , or pure and virtuous , Shakspeare 's characters are all sane men and women ; their motives and actions are such as we can at once comprehend , and which seem at once not irrational . They speak a language that is universal ; they love and hate as we do ; they sin as we do ; they have the same cares , affections , griefs , ambitions , desires , hopes , that keep all the world in a fever . In all their forms they have , at the root , those broad and deep drawn touches of natural character that make the whole world ready to acknowledge them as their kin . There is not , for example , a rough sailor , of average perception , whose life has been all made up of long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main , the passion of Hamlet ; you ask him why Hamlet does not marry Ophelia and lie would say , " Because he is so sorry on account of his father 's murder he ca n't love the gal ; " true , if you ask him whether he himself would have done so , he would be very likely to say , " No , blast his eyes ; he would have anybody half as pretty as that actress ; "  --  and his analysis of the character would be quite as profound , though expressed in fewer words , than has been given by many great critics . He would understand the character as far as he was up to it ; how could he or the critics do more ? and yet Hamlet is a play stuffed with genius and the most subtle reflection , and surely there never was a more perfect gentleman than the Prince , or a more exquisite lady than Ophelia . Shall we not suppose that some faint rays of that real gentlemanliness and true delicacy penetrate even through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , there are faces and airs whose purifying influence is felt even in the crowded way , as there are also those that exhale an aroma of voluptuousness ! The only path to true refinement is through nature , and here , where nature is mirrored and yet excelled , ( for no complete Perdita , Jessica , Juliet , or Ophelia , ever was found out yet in the world , ) we are in this path ; whenever we go away from iiature we have mere fancy to build upon ; we may construct curious and incongruous combinations of qualities , but they will not be men and women ; we may write a novel , for example , on the principle that a man shall love his wife so well he shall desire to have her unfaithful to him , that she maybe happier , but it will not make it so ; we may " argufy , " for the sake of " argufying , " may bring out all our metaphysics in our characters , make them as witty or wise as we please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good and bad-all will not do-we shall never draw actual characters , only in so far as we follow a natural ideal ; we shall make no progress in the heart work especially , shall never paint greater virtue of any sort than exists , except // by so painting it that it shall be really virtue . And to do that , how can we help following common sense ? For common sense presides over us like the sense of moral accountability ; we can not escape it . If we will it away , as perhaps we may do , we will ourselves into madness . We undo ourselves just in so far as we disregard it . And with our utmost efforts short of insanity we can not shake it off ; we must eat or we die ; we can not walk on our heads , and think with our soles instead of our souls : we can not make our organs and senses as obedient as Petruchio makes his super-dainty Kate 's ; we can not make it what o'clock we say it is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we swear the heavens are hung with black , and the seasons will come , the snow , the rain , clouds , trees , air , the rose and the heart moving violet-all will still be the same , and so will the hearts of men , howsoever we may pret*r to shut our eyes and seek out vain inventions . There is no department of human labor where men are so apt to go astray from common sense as in the painting of characters from the imagination ; in writing novels , plays , and the like . For in this labor it is necessary to stand behind one 's own mind and send images from it upon the white sheet beyond ; and where one 's mind is full of scholarship , and also full of determination to produce , at all events , striking pictures , how very prone we are to be distrustful of the simple path of nature that seems to lie so open before us , that a wayfaring man even need not err in it ; how liable we are to pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way lost . Suppose we sit clown to write a novel with the sincerest purpose of making a true and good one ; our very earnestness stands in our way . Wishing to make some of our characters deep thoughted , refined , and that shall strike the world ; with what rigid nerve , sustained many weary days , must we work at them so as to bring out , not our wish , but what we wish . How perpetually must we keep ourselves in remembrance that the soul thinks the most profoundly and acutely with just as little pain and travail as the most superficially and dully ; that it is easier and more common to affect depth than simplicity , and that all fancies come and go on the mind like lightning flashes on a cloud . Thoughts that are really great and good strike through and inter-penetrate other minds as soon as they are brought in contact . And it is as true of them separately as combined , that the element of common sense must form the basis of their substance ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they unite , like opposite electricities , with all sane minds , the moment the two are brought together , as a mathematical truth does , for example , the instant it is evolved . Mental wealth consists not in mysteriously refined and laborious thinking , but in the multitude and vividness of common ideas , such as every one can un ( lerstand at least the broad odtlines of And so of goodness . We have also , in the case supposed , as well as in our actual life , to guard against refining over much in moral notions . The commandments are hut ten ; the great duties of life are all simple and plain ; we may attain more nice and elevated perceptions of them , but we can not change their essence . Chastity will still be chastity , though we write a whole library , showing how men and women could forget their vows and be all the while as pure as unsunned snow . Robbing and murder-all sorts of crime that can be devised-will still be the invariable opposites of virtues , though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's hearts by acupuncture , instead of reading them to them out of our own . What a wealth of manliness was layished on the drama in that golden age of art , the Elizabethan era ! Many of those great painters of souls were poor men , and lived in obscurity , by the toil of the mind , under great temptation to be untrue to themselves and to the world ; but their genius and the disposition of their time sustained them . They were not all alike perfect , nor any at all times so , yet it must be confessed that they sustained themselves in a higher and nobler because truer walk of art than has been reached by so many since . They were honest men ; they bent and yielded to the evil of the world ; they did not , like artists who write , not in the love of truth , but to gain little ends , and use art as the means for which they have most talent-not because they have a real enthusiasm for it-nurse the evil and so nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright intention shines through all their extravagance , their grossness , and folly . They set themselves // seriously to paint real men and women , and certainly they succeeded ; they were poets , and they drew such men and women as the poet 's eye only sees ; they were scholars and thinkers , and the men and women they painted talked like gods ; hut at the root of all they had common sense , and their men and women exhibit the common hearts of humanity . They are like great players who play divinely on instruments of music-we know the tune , it is the same old tui*e of joy and sorrow , passion , love , hope , all motives , the notes of which are engraven on our consciousness , but oh , how exquisitely touched ! Every note has a new and deeper meaning , and chords in our bosoms are set vibrating which we did not know before were attuned to such harmony . And of all these great artists , Shakspeare was the greatest , because , in addition to all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive soul . " He was not dilThrent from them , nor from other men in essence , but in stature . What Dryden says of biography in the preface to Plutarch , will apply to all Shakspeare 's plays ; in them " the pageantry of life is taken away ; you see the poor reasonable animal as naked as nature ever made him ; are made acquainted with his passions and his follies , and find the demi-god a man . " Yet still the man in Shakspeare is a demigod too ; he is nobler , purer , and wiser , than the actual man ; it exalts the soul to be made acquainted with him , as Shakspeare represents him in his high characters ; it makes us more refined to associate with Shakspearian gentlemen , with Hamlet , Benedick , Orlando ; and it makes purer minded to hold converse with such ladies as Rosalind , Hero , Portia and Jessica . They may talk as they please of the grossness of speech these beings indulge in , or hear about them , but surely there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is not willing to be so . It is not exciting ; libidinous youths do not find there that food for their mean imaginations which they look for in our cheap-literature shops , and while we would , with Ben Jonson , that Shakspeare " had blotted a thousand lines , " ( and in this sense the wisher had done well to make the wish the father to the deed with respect to his own plays , ) yet we do not know if the world would have been the gainer by it if he had . Those gross animal thoughts are certainly , after all , mere nature ; we have different customs now prevailing , but those thoughts still come and go through the purest minds , and there is as perfect an understanding between the sexes now as there ever was ; we can not , can not go beyond common sense . The Puritans tried that , and only made matters worse ; nature as well as murder will out. ; there are few men and women who would he content , with Sir Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagate like trees ; " we must not forget that we have bodies as well as souls , and that we are only to abstain from lusts which war against the soul , while marriage is honorable in all . It is impossible for us to attain to such a state that the body will perform all its functions as unconsciously as it breathes ; there is no true love that has not and should not have a large mixture of the animal , with the spiritual , and so long as we are framed as we are , in our best estate thoughts and fancies will pass over our minds neither delicate nor modest . But if we will , if our hearts are pure , they will pass off like the breath from a mirror that clouds reflection but an instant ,  --  as they always do in Shakspeare 's pure heroines , who walk unsullied through temptations that it is to be feared many of our most sentimentally delicate damsels would hardly resist in the same natural manner . No true man was ever made worse by reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing good in nature that may not be so used , for devilish purposes . The animal is there , hut so is the soul , and that in its highest combining proportion , and there is no honestly disposed reader but who will find there more to strengthen his intellect and enlarge his affections than to stimulate his appetites . God be thanked , this is true of the great body of English literature from Shakspeare down . There are exceptions without number , but the general current has set towards truth , like the Mississippi rolling to the Gulf-silently , spontaneously , and irresistibly . There is no civilized nation that inherits so sound and healthy a library-so many honest and manly authors . Shakspeare ( to go back no further ) is in himself a library of true health ; then comes Milton . In all his profound thoughts , how true he is to nature , common sense and common reason ; he could make his fallen spirits discourse of fate , free will , fixed fate , foreknowledge // absolute ; yet his Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a more manly man , she a more womanly woman , than we . Where was ever written a more beautiful picture of a pure chaste lady , than in Comus , and yet where were ever animal appetites more plainly set before us ? true there are no indecent words , as sometimes in Shakspeare , but where is shown " virtue her own feature , " vice " her own image , " in such majestic poetry - poetry whose lines are as bars of ir6n , incandescent with genius ? It might be said truly that below the HOLY BIBLE there are no books that go so near the truth , an ( l unfold and ripen the human heart and mind so much as Shakspeare and Milton . But we must not forget that we are not writing to convey our Shakspearian and Miltonic affection , ( which other writers have attempted before , " as much as once , " ) but have simply used those authors for illustration of the idea which it is the object of this article to bring out . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and appealed to memory , and the conscious hearts of our readers , to say whether they are not pure writers , full of nature , reason , common sense , as well as of the highest thoughts , and the most ardent poetry . Perhaps they had somewhat to do in forming our minds , and shaping the heart and reason they now address ; be that as it may , they certainly appear to us at this day all that we have said . We might now review all our great poets and novelists , and show how in respect of this common sense and right healthy feeling , they all tend the same way-are all sound and hearty-gross sometimes , indelicate , unrefined , but never tending to confound plain right and wrong , virtue or vice-always keeping up , with more or less success , the dignity of letters , not turning pander to low passidns and appetites , not as a general thing making themselves " court poets to Beelzebub , " nor , if one may use a flourishing figure for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed on them and pamper their own phagedenous appetites , that consume with their food their substance . There are men ( and women too ) who knowingly will take advantage of the weakness of their brethren , who to gain selfish ends , money or fame , will write anything under the sun that seems likely to accomplish the object , immorality that shall just escape blasphemy , illegality up to treason , and licentiousness only short of obscenity . These men and women are troubled by none of the difficulties we have enumerated as besetting one who sits down with a sincere purpose of writing what shall be true and good , and which the great geniuses we have referred to so nobly overcame ; they are too cruel and hard-hearted ; they care not to be true to others or to themselves . And it is peculiarly the characteristic of this age to abound in such writers . The " one progressive principle , " Democracy , is , just in these few centuries , in the ascendant . Authors less and less address themselves to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many . There is an earnest struggle to rise , not by reaching up , but by crowding down . There are demagogues in letters as in politics . And as the soul , like the dyer 's hand , becomes " subdued to what it works in , " so those writers who , under the temptation of ambition added , which in the days of Southampton it was not , to necessity , go down to the " many-beaded monster , " and condescend to please the hearts of the nit , as the old writers sometimes did their gross fancies , soon become lower than those they feed , and blinder than the blind they mislead . Let these few sentences suffice as an explanation of the reason why it comes that we have now so many detestable novels  --  but before speaking of them more particularly , let us go back and , calling to mind our English novel writing , observe how it has followed in the path laid out by the great poets , the path of truth , reason , and common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried article , to review at large this department of our literature , nor is it necessary to the purpose , since we only wish to consider it with reference to this particular quality-its sound common sense . All the better of the novels and fictitious writings original in our language , from the Pilgrim 's Progress down to Dickens , have this characteristic in greater or less degree ; they have all some simple manliness of feeling and are not palpably diabolical . Smollet and Fielding are as gross as can be imagined , but it is the grossness of coarse animal life , not of sensuality ; they were both men of strong minds , one was an eloquent describer , and the other a most unparalleled wit ; we do not like their manners , but we are invigorated by coming in contact with such mental activity . A // 477 man who can not read Joseph Andrews with infinite relish and profit too , can not relish the most fertile and pungent yet good-humored satire that ever was written ; yet one would not like to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any more than he would like to introduce to his house the strong and interesting characters he meets in his daily commerce with the world . But what man is there who would not rather ask a rough sailor to dine with him , that has stories to tell of " rich strands , " or a haunter of bar-rooms , that was full ofjest and whimsical fancy , than a man , such as there are many of in all walks of life , who would be perpetually looking at his wife in a way that would make him wish to cut his throat with the carving-knife ? Who is there that has not , while he felt very conscious of his own desires and appetites , shuddered to observe the eyes of some " unco guid " young men such as New England is full of ? who has not loathed the contact of their palms ? We would not speak too plainly , indeed we detest this subject altogether , but are perpetually driven to it , for that very reason - yet we must say , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant any man in thinking himself more than usually " crammed with observation , " that all we ever read or met with or done has never giveii us so vivid a sense of loathsome depravity as the faces and looks and tout ensemble of many who probably would think it would contaminate them to read Tom Jones or Roderic Random . Be it understood that we are not recommending the reading of these works , nor defending them ; there are many better books that may be read instead ; all we would say is that there is nothing in them to puzzle the reason and steal away the brains ; they are full of what is low and coarse ; so is the world ; and the man who chooses will walk through the Five Points daily , while another will prefer to stroll down Waverly Place , and only once go through the Five Points to gratify his curiosity . Books that are merely low , will not taint a man if they do not confound his judgment , and make him give up self-respect , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of rushing into that which we are taught to pray to be kept from , and it is wisest and best not to let the fancy run upon low scenes-hence we recommend Smollet and Fielding only to those who are determined to be gentlemen and scho lars , and who read to " weigh and consider . " We have not mentioned Robinson-Crusoe , which is rather a prose epic than a novel . Surely if we were to search the world over to find the book most remarkable for common sense , most full of every day character and maxim , we should choose this out of all . But perhaps some of our readers are accustomed to think of it merely as a patiently-written detail of adventures interesting only to children ; to such we must needs say , read it again . They will find that the narrative which amused their youth will still interest their age , and that there is as much in it to please a critical taste as to impress a childish fancy . There are nowhere more richly-colored landscapes , more natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a style in which the reader could so lose himself in the music of its eloquence . Here are no damned metaphysics , no foolish speculation about matters that are set at rest in the minds of all sensible persons by the natural course of life , no brilliant displays , no fine writing , or fine thinking , buta richly wrought work of art , emanating from a most luxuriant genius , trained and controlled by a watchful reason , and a simple earnest benevolent purpose . As much as we admire the rough rudeness of Smollet or the sparkling wit of Fielding , we can not but think De Foe was a much purer and nobler-minded man , and that his earnestness and power evince a more manly spirit , more genuine health , than any of their qualities . Yet even De Foe is not altogether exempt from coarseness in some of his stories . Thus far had we written last night , and were thinking what novels we should next allude to , when Q- at the breakfast table informed us of a singular conversation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by two house-maids who were sweeping the hall . One told the other how that she had been invited to a ball which was to come off at " Washington Hotel , " what she should wear , &amp;c . Presently they fell into an under-tone , and Q- dozed ; when he woke , the conversation had by a natural transition passed from balls to books , and one was saying what a beautiful novel the " Scottish Chiefs " was , and that she had it in her trunk " up-stairs . " The other said , " Had she ever read Evelina ? She had read it when she lived in - street , and // 478 never should she forget the story if she should live seven years . ' " She then proceeded to give an outline . " Oh , " she said , " such times as they had when Evelina came up to London ; they went to the theatre , and they had balls and parties every night , and there was lords and ladies , you know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the best novel she ever seen , and real affecting too ; she wished she had it . " Q- was astonished at first to hear so just a criticism from such a source , and could not help laughing to himself to think how FANNY would have been delighted by it , and gone and written it all down in her journal , and valued it doubtless more than even the praise of " the Doctor . " Perhaps our readers may think the incident coined for our purpose , but we can assure them on our veracity that ( with the exception of our friend 's name , which is not Q- ) every particle of it is strictly true , and actually happened not four hours ago from that which has just struck . The house-maid 's criticism of Evelina was just , so far as it went , and it went to the main incidents and characteristics of the hook  --  to the common sense of it ; these she could understand and relish . But there are many ladies far above house-maids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement in that charming old-fashioned novel , or in its successor Cecilia . And there are many young gentlemen whose minds can not but feel the purifying and freshening influence of the writings of Fanny Burney . To read those novels is like listening to the conversation of a sprightly sensible lady , half English , half French ; it scares away evil passions from the haunted soul as the song of the bird of dawning drives ghosts from yawning churchyards . With all the faults of these books , afliictation in style , and drawing of qualities rather than characters , they are certainly sensible , spirited , interesting . There are truly , as the house-maid thought , no livelier parties than Miss Burney 's , nor any more natural pathos than that with which she moves our sympathies in her heroines ' perplexities . Mrs. RADcLIFFE 'S delightful romances must be mentioned also among our sensible novels . These w* value for their picturesqueness and for the interest of the story . We seem , as we recall the names of some of them , to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious over some wide valley , embo somed in forest-crowned slopes , that slant up afar on either side to lofty mountains , and out of the woody champaign , and along the hill sides in the blue distance , rise the white turrets of ancient castles . We feel once more , in the midst of this agony of life , the sweet repose of St. Aubert 's cottage , and again have glimpses of the reveries of youth . Whether the Mysteries of Udolpho , or the Romance of the Forest , could again charm us , we can not tell , not having tried them for many a weary year , but we know that we still take pleasure in remembering their rich pictures , and regret the hours we wasted on them only because they are past . The thousand good novels of this school ( among which we remember the Romance of the Pyrenees and the Castle of Montalha as especial favorites ) have as little harm in them as so many picture galleries ; it is possible they may have made those who have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough actual world , but otherwise they do not corrupt the moral nature . They educate and refine the pure fancy , and expand , refresh , and invigorate the soul . But if we go on in this way , giving a paragraph to each of the good English novelists , we shall use up our space too soon . Let us fancy that we are examining an old book shop like Burnham 's in Boston , or -s , in New York , and that we pass our eyes along the array of familiar covers ; that we see Mandeville , St. Leon , Cloudesley , Pride and Prejudice , Northanger Abbey , Mansfield Park , The Five Nights of St. Albans , ( the favorite of ALsToN , ) the Waverly novels in forty-two volumes , Yalerius , Fatal Revenge , Hogg 's and Lewis 's Tales , &amp;c. &amp;c. , ad libilum . Let us fancy also that we have the same feeling we actually have in such circumstances ; suppose we feel as we did when on weekly library daysin college , we wasted adelicious hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take ; and looking back through the dim impression of a throng of heroes and heroines , let us remember how they impressed us . What picture gallery can compare with this , for visions of manliness , purity , and beauty ; for noble and gentle characters , and for poetic , true , and artist-like conceptions ? And all too , so full of Saxon sense-plain practical experience-the Shakspearian and Miltonic example followed . Of course there are plenty of exceptions ; so there are in ability , many // weak novels as well as many strong , yet the proportion of positively vicious is small , and even of them , as there are few *o weak as not to be acceptable to some capacities , so there are few so bad as to vitiate a sensible resolute reader . There is a prevailing honesty in this department of our literature , and any reasonable men or women , who choose to amuse themselves that way , and will select judiciously , and read understandingly , may read as many as they please without being at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For they are written by authors whose minds were so balanced that they could consi ( ler some things as settled ; they recognize the truth of the Christian religion , and the wisdom of the common law , and do not tend to unsettle and disturb the brains of us who find it easier to believe in these things as we find them , and were not made for pioneers of " progress . " ( Not but that we esteem ourselves wiser than many who now assume to be teachers in these matters ; but that it is no more than our duty to do . ) They recognize , in short , the existence of common sense ; and permit us who have not time to think out everything , to remain in religious ; moral , and political matters , in our bigotry . There are very few ladies among their characters so pure that they can do anything , very few saints pious from principles of honor , very few gentlemen cut-throats . In general there is a great deal of oldfashioned thinking and refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of brilliant power , which sounds and sounds but touches no bottom and brings up no fish ; very little of that refinement which is put on as a garment to conceal deformity . And at the very present even , when there is so much bad reading given to the public , all of our novel literature that is purely English ( and of course Amencan ) - all that bears the stamp of AngloSaxon parentage , has the same qualities . Cooper 's novels , whatever may be their defects of style , and latterly of temper , are excellent common sense stories . So too the tales of Irving , and the hosts of minnows that swim in his wake . So too of Scott 's successors , on the other side , James with all his weakness , Dickens with all his exaggerated sentiment , Bulwer with all his wit and his metaphysics , D'Israeli with all his feverishness , Ainsworth-but we will not go down quite so far-they have all some relish of the VOL . V-NO. v. 32 " antique world . " Buiwer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in all , and the reader will be likely to be tired of him before he is made much worse by him . He is a poor painter of true love ; his heroes and heroines reverse the natures of men and women , the men love to be loved , and the women love to love , and they each love rather their own fancies than each other . There s a sickly miasma round all of them . They live but in each other 's eyes , and their eyes look often towards the moon . They talk very fine words , hut are in reality worse minded than Lady Booby or Molly Seagrim ; for it is worse to daily with lusts than to gratify them . True love , animal or spiritual , never looks but to the end , and is never satisfied but with absolute possession . But Bulwer'ssentiment is not so bad as his metaphysics . He is a great wit , as Pelham proves ; full of acuteness and quick logic ; all that he lacks is the guiding manly purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else ; brilliant flashes blind and pain the eyes , and fireworks are not so good to see one 's way by as a dim lanthorn . To scholars , Bulwer will be pleasant reading , but his effect upon the many can not be so good as Scott 's , either for the politics or morals which he instils . He has lately published a defence of his villains , which is written with his usual force and subtlety . But we do not like his villains notwithstanding , and though his arguments are admirably put , they are worthless if , in such a question , common reason does not acknowledge them . The truth is , we do not judge of the propriety of characters from reasons , and reasons can not therefore defend them . We go by the feeling first ; the artist shows his own nature through his characters , and it is that after all which affects us ; we look for reasons *hy it did thus , this way or that , afterwards . The great test of common sense is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial is by an appeal to the world at large . We may observe in life as well as in books that it in the steady light which is most valued , and not that which , though often the ba*ightest , is fitful and flickering . Scott is never so subtle as Bulwer , but we feel more sure that his heart was in the right place ; the world has nt*ver doubted about his villains , and is not iikely to doubt . Bulwer paint* best men of strong will , hard and intellectual , // but withal very full of tragedy heroism ; we have no great affection for his gentlemen and precious little for his ladies . On the whole his best characters are so consciously proud as to be conceited , and too fanciful to be real , even when in love ; for those who are likely to be influenced overmuch by what they read , perhaps James even is an author with whom they would do better to waste their time than with one so full of questionable morality and unsound speculation . DICKENS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning in the main , but full of prejudice  --  a perfect specimen of a cockney genius . A great many people among us take delight in " talking him down ; " but for all that , we all make a point of laughing at something or other he is perpetually giving off-if it is only a poor girl 's signing her name to a legal instrument . The worst thing about him of late , is his constant whining about riches and poverty , and his laboring so much 10 show that poor folks are generally as good and happy as rich ones  --  a truth which needs no showing . All this radicalism does not much harm in England , but here it only encourages laziness and vanity , and it is high time some one should begin to write novels against poverty-showing that those whob ave the good luck to be born on the eaves of starvation are quite as pitiable as those astride the ridge-pole of affluence . But we must not forget , in the mirthful thoughts to which the mention of Dickens gives rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , and that all we have said hitherto has been to help along this purpose . We wish to enter our protest , as an admirer of good English novels , against the modern French ones that are now glutting this unhappy country . This Mexican war is killing a few thousands and spoiling more than it kills , but it is not doing the nation half so much harm , we fear , as the poisonous writings of SUE and SAND , et id genus omne . There are some things , even in this day , which must be taken for granted , and not reasoned ab*ut-some truths which appeal to common sense and can not but be believed . There are also someprejudices which it is good to have , and among these , one of the best is John Bull 's old prejudice against what he understands by French . This , we trust , we have in some degree inherited-not so much as to hate Frenchmen , or their country , but to have a firm conviction of the superiority of the Saxon over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the French character ; that human nature is one thing and French nature another , is a saylug that has to us the force of an axiom . We can not conceive of a religious Frenchman ; a revival in Paris , or an " interesting season " at Toulon would seem to us a solemn farce . Even when we hear of an " eloquent Parisian preacher , " we can not bring ourselves to credit his sincerity . French philosophy seems to us cold , acute , irregular ratiocination ; French art , fashion . Whoever saw a great French picture ? or since Baptiste Lulli , heard of a really great French composer ? Le Sueur , Gretry , and the rest , were great and good in their several degrees , but they do not come into our idea of Frenchmen . They are good , like every other artist now living , because and in so far as they are un-Frenchifted . There is something in the genuine French mind which makes it not equal to our Saxon thinking . They can reason in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they have not the heart to understand our poetry , nor have they a poetry of their own that is like ours . The relation between men and women among them is different , and though the idea of a true French lady is a very delightful image to bring into the mind , it seems impossible that a French gentleman should understand her . We can not bear the apprehension that the French should begin to do our thinking for us , should furnish us with philosophy , poetry and serious literature ; we are willing they should set fashions , get up dishes , write lively novels of society , vaudevilles , comic operas , and furnish plots , and all those ingenious contrivances in which they so excel . They may amuse us and keep down our bile , and make us wish we could be like them ( for your true Frenchman must be the happiest man that lives ) and slip as they can through the world , without sin ; and in return , we may give them some gravity and thoughtfulness-may curtail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so preserve them in the pale of humanity ; but further than this we do not think the two families , that have kept distinct so long , can ever exchange their peculiarities or fuse into one . // All this feeling , which we have here perhaps exaggerated , makes us distrustful when we hear French novels cried up as great , pure , deep , and the like . Yet we fancy it does not operate so strongly as to blind us to real merit ; it only throws the burden of proof on the novels . Good has come out of Nazareth , notwithstanding the proverb , and France may yet give the world a Shakspeare . But that a female Shakspeare has now arisen in the person of Madame Sand , we do not believe . We have read , we are happy to say , only one of her novels , and are therefore better qualified to speak of them than if we had read more , as hands that are but a little soiled are fitter to lay on white paper than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read more we should condescend to argue against them , which now appears absurd ; our common sense might have become obscured . We read only the one where a woman of the most exalted virtue aggravates a green young man through a reasonably sized volume , and never gives him any satisfaction ; but when she has fooled him to the top of his bent , turns him off forever . Consuelo we are yet innocent of , and from the work we read , and alt that we have heard of this , we feel almost so strong in resolution as not to need to pray to be preserved from it . When an inexperienced youth first comes to the city , he takes every man he meets who goes unshorn and wears frogs on his coat , for a foreign marquis , but by and by , he learns that one whom he thought most high in rank , is nothing but a poor barber , and his illusion vanishes forever . Whiskers and frogs have , with him , lost their charm . So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with poetry , philosophy , and chastity . A man of sense , accustomed to our grand old poets , and our better novels , needs to read but one of them-cannot read more . For with his mind stored with images of real natural beauty , how shall he find room for the false and halfmade creations of Parisian debauchees and harlots , thaf write they care not what , so it gives them the means to support their luxury or pamper their vanity ? How can he please himself with glitter of words , and tedious questionings of great truths that it goes against the stomach of his sense to doubt ? If these writers would only leave us dlone in our simple religious faith , in our common views of God , ourselves , and the world , their mere horrors and licentiousness would not be so bad , though still bad enough . But they muddle the mind , and make the voice of reason and conscience " an uncertain sound . " Observe the admirers of Sand . Are they not Sand-blind ? yea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they understand Shakspeare ? Do they relish anything in him after the manner of those that can see ? No ! they are all wildered ; nothing is too daring for them in speculation ; little common thoughts that have been thought over and over by every soul that lives , they seize upon as discoveries ; whatever subject they take up , they discuss with equal irreverence and defiance of sense ; there is no teaching them , and the more you argue with them The plainer it appears that they are incapable of being convinced by reasons ; and you are forced to the conclusion that either there is , and ever has been , nothing settled in the world or that they are crazy . The number of poor young gentlemen and ladies all over the country that are already in this deplorable condition , it is frightful to contemplate . They tell us " there is a good time coming ! " But we do n't believe it . We have yet hope that what they understand by the " good time , " will never come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice , vice , in the next generation as now . We trust too that the Bible , and the Christian religion , will be left so that simple-minded people may still rest secure in faith and hope , however much they that are compelled to choose a belief , may be at the mercy of indifference . We have yet confidence in the Saxon blood , in the reality of knowledge , and in the mercy of Heaven ; In a word , we have firm faith , that however these vagaries , and fevers , and fashions , may hinder growth and interrupt true progress , they will all yield in time to the silent influence of Truth and the invincible power of COMMON S*cNsx. // 482 The Life and Opinion8 THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF PHILIP YORICK , ESQ . WRITTEN BY HIMSELF . CHAPTER XIX . ( Continued. ) - DEMONOIIANCY . TOTSVANIM in quadrigemina creates infinite sense of smelling . Then can a man smell radishes in the moon , and tell the odor of Alexander 's breeches , though he be dead two thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irom a fool  --  a cat from a kitten ; conclude on the immortality of new poems , by smelling at their leaves ; tell the age of an old belle , the wealth of a millionaire , the soundness of a horse , the truth of a doctrine , the right of a cause , by smell . Neither in heaven nor in hades , in the earth nor on it , in sun nor planets , in sea nor air , shall anything escape your nose . I must not omit to tell you how deeply Slawkenberg smelt on one occasion ; for it is no ordinary nose that could do as much . Having hired himself to a prime minister to smell out conspiracies , he detected four at a sniff , and the ringleaders were.imriiediately seized and executed , so great confidence did he inspire by his trick of showing the whites of his eyes . He could criticise a volume by the smell of the binding , and by smelling the outsides of letters , concluded infallibly on the character of their writers . Sniffing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only smelt of the lamp , but had very much the scent of a Lucina Cordial , and would probably produce a similar effect upon their imitators . Yet this is but an exaltation of a power that is natural . For , as there is a physical so is there a spiritual smell . Does not the lawyer smell out his suit , and the lover his mistress ? The judge claps his nose to the books ; the divine to his sermon ; you pull your enemy 's nose to try his spirit-yo1* turn up your own , if he fails to resent it ; which , to my thinking , are proofs from the common belief of men , now taken to be the strongest of all proofs , that there is a spiritual nose and a spiritual smell ; and not only that , but even a spiritual odor apperceivable by them ; concluding by the great organon of analogons . I know there are certain skin-deep philosophers , who affect to deny this , on the ground that the spirit does but use and employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men use tweezers and snuff-boxes , without having analogical tweezers and snuff-boxes in their ears or noses . That if there be a nose within a nose , and an eye within an eye , and an ear within an ear , the soul itself , in its high tabernacle , is hut a convocation of representative eyes , ears , and noses , and no real or absolute essence ; that the mystery of creation lies in the multitude of the material objects , and the simplicity of the spiritual power which controls them ; and that if reason controls the appetites and passions , it is because in itself it ha* nothing of their specific nature , and is by that difference made king and lord over them all ; as being that out of which they proceed but not that which they specially are ; and the like , concluding , in fine , that neither the universe nor the soul of man is a nest of boxes ; nor Deity a jumble of the ghosts of analogons ; with other irrelevant stuff , very obscure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons practical , have the least concern , my dear doctor.
