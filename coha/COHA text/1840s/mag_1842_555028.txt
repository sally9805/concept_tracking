txt THE State of Connecticut has always recognised , in her practice and her legislation , the duty of a State to provide for the moral and intellectual education of all its children . The first enactment in her statute book on the subject of education bears the date of 1650 , and forms part of a body of laws compiled by Mr. Ludlow . In this compilation are found various provisions on the subject of education , the preamble to one of which we copy for the sake of its quaint phraseology . CC It being one chief * ) roject of that old deluder , Satan , to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures , as in former times , keeping them in an unknown tongue , so , in these latter times , by persuading them from the use of tongues , so that at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded with false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers ; and that learning may not he buried in the graves of our forefathers , in church and commonwealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &amp;c " Various other provisions were made from time to time , by the legislature , showing a laudable interest in the subject of education , and a wish to contribute to its improvement . In 1795 , the avails of the sale of certain Western lands , now forming part of Ohio , which had been reserved by the State in its deed of cession to the United States in 1782 , amounting to * 1,200,000 , were for ever appropriated to the support of common schools ; and , in 1818 , this legislative destination of it was confirmed , with the sanction of constitutional provision . This capital has been increased by judicious // management to more than two millions of dollars , and the interest , amounting to about one hundred thousand dollars , is annually distributed among the several school societies and districts , according to the number of children between the ages of four and sixteen . In 1836 , that portion of the surplus fund belonging to the United States , which fell to Connecticut , was , by an act of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective population , according to the census of 1830 , on condition that at least one half of the income thereof should be appropriated for the promotion of education in the common schools in such towns . Under this act , $ 764,67061 , have been deposited with the towns . The other expenses of public instruction are defrayed from society and local school funds , from taxes on property , and assessments on the parents of children attending schools . Of the whole expense , it is estimated , that property pays one ninth , parents who send children , three ninths , and permanent funds , five ninths . Thus it will be seen , that of the three modes of sustaining common schools , namely , by permanent and liberal State endowments , by the property of local organizations , or by a school rate paid by the parents of scholars , Connecticut has not adopted either entire . Her main reliance , however , is on the avails of permanent funds , and in this respect her system is peculiar , and has attracted much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable influence upon education ; but Mr. Barnard , the Secretary of the Board of Education , in his second annual Report , maintains , that great injustice has been done to the system in this respect , and he suggests reasons in favor of a judiciously managed fund , which are entitled to much consideration from their intrinsic good sense , and his own knowledge and experience . The example of Connecticut , however , and of many of her sister States , showed that neither wholesome laws nor liberal appropriation of money would create good schools , unless seconded by zealous , intelligent , and high-principled efforts in the people themselves . The attention of the judicious and thoughtful was called to the urgent necessity of improving the condition of common schools , and elevating the standard of public education . The subject was recommended to the consideration of the legislature by the Governor in his annual message in 1838 , and official information respecting // the condition of the common schools , was , for the first Lime , laid before the legislature , in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eleven school societies in the State . A select committee on the part of the House and Senate was raised , to whom these and other documents were referred . Their Report embodied the following conclusions ; that parents generally exhibit little or no interest in common schools by attending examinations or otherwise ; that school visitors and school committees , in some school societies , were not faithful in the discharge of their duties as prescribed by law ; that poorly qualified and inefficient teachers were employed in the schools , and that the rate of compensation was not adequate to their deserts or equal to the rewards of skill and industry in other fields of labor ; that the diversity of school books was an evil of alarming magnitude ; that school houses , in respect to location , structure , warming , ventilation , seats , and desks , were very much neglected ; that many children of the proper age to receive instruction , did not attend any school ; that this number , in 1837 , was not less than six thousand ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages of sixteen and twenty-one who could not read or write . With these facts before them , the committee unanimously recommended a bill for a public act " to provide for the better supervision of common schools , " which was passed into a law by the unanimous vote of the Senate and with but a single dissenting voice in the House . This act constitutes the Governor , the commissioner of the school fund , and one person for each county in the State , a " Board of Commissioners for Common Schools " ; and it aims to secure the better supervision of schools by bringing their condition , in the form of annual Reports , first before the school societies by the local visitors , and afterwards before the legislature and the State , in the communications of the Board . To make these Reports subserve the progress of the system , both the State Board and the local visitors are required to submit such plans of improvement , as their own observation and reflection may suggest . To enable the Board to ascertain the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are authorized to call for information from the proper local school authorities , and to appoint a Secretary , who shall devote his whole time , if required , // 1842 . Connecticut . /Innual Reports . 461 under their direction , " to ascertain the condition , increase the interest , and promote the usefulness , of the common schools . " The Board was clothed with no power to interfere directly with the organization and management of the schools . Its office is , by the agency of its individual members and its Secretary , to inquire into the state of the schools , to learn what their defects are , and the best means by which those defects can be remedied , and the further improvement of education secured ; and then , by their communications to the Legislature and the people , to sugge*t such modifications of the system , and of practices under it , as may lead to its more extensive usefulness . The Board met for the first time in June , 1838 , and chose their Secretary . His duties as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection of the schools , and by written communications from school officers and others , the actual condition of the schools ; to prepare an abstract of such information for the use of the Board and the Legislature , with plans and suggestions for the better organization and administration of the school system ; to attend and address at least one meeting of such parents , teachers , and school officers , as were disposed to come together on public notice , in each county , and as many local meetings as other duties would allow ; to edit and superintend the publication of a journal , devoted exclusively to the promotion of commonschool education ; and to increase , in any way practicable , the interest and intelligence of the community in relation to the whole subject of popular education . It will thus be seen , that the Connecticut Board of Commissioners of Common Schools , resembles very closely , in its organization and objects , the Massachusetts Board of Education , and that the duties of their respective Secretaries are exactly parallel . We have before us three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and three volumes of the " Connecticut Common School Journal , " edited by him ; and from the evidence , which these contain , of his talents , industry , conscientiousness , and ardent devotion to the great cause of education , we do not hesitate to pronounce the State most fortunate in having secured his services in that department . From his first annual Report , presented in May , 1839 , it appears , that in the previous year , the Secretary atter*ded a // 462 Cbmmon School Education . April , common-school convention in each of the eight counties in the State , addressed more than sixty public meetings in various parts of the State , inspected more than two hundred schools while in session , received official returns from school visitors respecting more than twelve hundred districts , had personal or written communications with school officers or teachers in more than two thirds of all the school societies , and superintended the publication of the " Connecticut Conmon School . Journal , " more than sixty thousand copies of the twelve numbers of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . And in the subsequent years substantially the same measures were pursued to awaken and enlighten the public mind , by the voice and the press . The condition of the schools , and of the public mind respecting them , as appears by the Secretary 's first Report , called most loudly for the quickening breath of a new life . The system was becoming paralyzed by apathy and want of interest in all its departments . The fatal dry-rot of indifference , - a foe the more dangerous from its working silently and unobservedly ,  --  was slowly eating into its heart . School meetings were thinly attended ; school officers neglected their trust , or were content with a mere formal discharge of their duties ; incompetent teachers were employed , without being subjected even to a nominal examination ; public money was appropriated to other objects than those specified in the law school-houses were imperfectly constructed and ventilated , and ill furnished ; there was a want of uniformity in books taught and studies pursued ; the late and irregular attendance of the children in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of their privileges ; the instruction given was imperfect , and of an inferior quality ; and , to crown the whole , as at once the cause and effect of the low state of the public schools , there was a profound apathy on the part of the public generally , and a want of that encouragement , sympathy , and codperation on the part of the parents , which are so essential to the success of a teacher . Though , of course , no great changes can be effected in the space of three or four years , yet we have in the documents before us , and from the testimony of gentlemen who have visited Connecticut , abundant evidence to show that much good has been done , and that more will be done . The proceedings of the Board and of the Secretary have been marked // by uniform good judgment and tact , and they appear to have met with the cooperation of the people in a manner creditable to both parties . No factious and short-sighted opposition seems to have embarrassed their path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ded their progress . The Legislature have done their duty , and by various enactments have brought the system to a greater degree of theoretical excellence , remedied its faults , and supplied its deficiencies . And above all , the public attention is called to the subject , a new impulse is given to the mind of the community , and a new sense of the value of public education , and of the necessity of elevating it , awakened . Parents , teachers , school committees have aroused themselves from their slumbers into life and action , and the good effects of the change are beginning to be perceived , and an earnest of future and continued improvement is given . This is the great thing . Let the public mind he interested in this paramount subject , and all will go right . There is such a capacity both for action and thought in the New England mind and character , that every thing is pretty sure to be well done , which is zealously and earnestly undertaken . Let the community feel deeply and fervently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is already half accomplished . The willing head and hand will never want instruments . We wish our sister Commonwealth a cordial God-speed in her generous enterprise , and earnestly desire that her progress may be rapid and uninterrupted in that good path in which her older New England sister has but a year 's start of her . We hope she may tread so closely upon our steps , as to make us quicken our efforts lest we should be outstripped . That is a noble strife , which we take pride in encouraging ; for all , who engage in it , win . There is neither the insolence of triumph , nor the chagrin of defeat . We commend Mr. Barnard 's three Reports as valuable documents , ably and carefully prepared , and worthy the attention of all who feel an interest in the literature of education . The " Connecticut Common School Journal , " also , is a useful and well-conducted work , containing many good original communications and a large amount of excellent selections . We would especially commend an elaborate sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Appendix to the second volume , // and sundry documents in the first and second volumes on popular education in the United States . We can not take leave of this subject , without recording our admiration of that singular disinterestedness which crowns Mr. Barnard 's other good qualities . For his setvices he receives three dollars per day , and his expenses are paid ; but it appears that he has expended for various purposes , in aid of the cause of education , an amount equal to the whole of his salary , and has consequently , in point of fact , devoted his whole time , gratuitously , for the last three years , to this interest . We record this fact with pride and pleasure , in the thought , that , in this age of loud profession and restless selfseeking , an individual has been found , with the magnanimity to enter upon , and the resolution to persevere in , this modest course of self-sacrificing usefulness . Let the State of Connecticut look to it , that she pays to such conduct its proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth a score of flatulent speechmakers and selfish politicians . We learn from an unobtrusive editorial notice , that he has suffered on account of the injustice done to his motives in assuming his office . To this he must make up his mind . It is the common lot . The privilege of abusing the men who serve us in public trusts is one of the last luxuries to be surrendered . Whether we do this as a sort of safety-valve for the escape of the ill-temper , that would otherwise find no lawful vent , or whether we think that the holding of a public office is a privilege so vast , a station so high , that the head would be turned without the wholesome medicine of carping and fault-finding , and we therefore apply it with that stern sense of duty with which a loving father corrects a froward child , we are not prepared to say . In either alternative , the victims will find appropriate consolation . We turn from Mr. Barnard , and his excellent services to Common-School Education in Connecticut , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in a sister State . We have , at different times , spoken at large of the indefatigable labors of Mr. Mann , Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts , and propose nothing more at present , than to lay before our readers a few facts , drawn from his " Fifth Annual Report , " presented to the Legislature of that Commonwealth , at its recent session . The following statements are undoubtedly of the most satisfactory character ; // " It is now four years since I prepared the Abstract of the School Returns for 1837 , and made my First Annual Report to the Board . " Since that time , the amount of appropriations made by the towns for the wages and board of the teachers , and fuel f*or the Schools , has increased more than one hun'dred thousand dollars . " During the same time , the schools have been lengthened , on an average , almost three weeks each , which , for three thousand one hundred and three , ( the number of public schools kept last year in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and seventy-five years . " The average wages of male teachers , for the same period , have advanced thirty-three per cent . ; those of females , a little more than twelve and a half per cent . I am satisfied , that the value of the services of both sexes has increased in a much greater ratio than that of their compensation . " There were one hundred and eighty-five more public schools last year , than in 1837 , which is rather less than the ratio of increase in the number of children between the ages of four and sixteen years . This favorable result is owing to the union of small districts . The number of male teachers has increased one hundred and twenty-one ; that of females , five hundred and twenty-one , which shows the growing and most beneficial practice of employing female teachers for small schools , and female assistants in large ones . " Many towns in the State , during the last year , completed the renovation of all the school-houses within their respective limits . " From a perusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears that the number of schools broken up by the insubordination of the scholars , was not more than one tenth part of what it was for the preceding year . This gain to the honor of the schools , - or rather this exemption from dis . grace , - is to be attributed to the combined causes of better modes of government by the teachers , more faithful supervision by the committees , a more extended personal acquaintance on the part of parents , and especially to the practice of making a report to the towns of the condition of the schools , and the conduct of the scholars . Few boys between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years are so depraved and shameless as not to recoil at the idea of being reported for misconduct , in open town meeting , and of having an attested record of their disgrace transmitted to the seat of government , with the chance , should they persist in their incorrigibleness for two or three years , of finding themselves historically known to other coun // tries and times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of schools brought to a violent termination , during the last year , by the insubordinatioii of the scholars , happened almost invariably in those towns and sections of counties in the State , where I have found the least sympathy and , cooperation in my labors *- pp. 23 - 25 . There is , however , a different side of the picture , presenting a subject for anxious reflection . " Much has been , and much still continues to be , both said and written respecting that equality in the laws , and equality under the laws , which constitutes the distinctive feature of a Republican government . By abolishing the right of primogeniture and entails , by the extension of the elective franchise , and in other ways , much has been done towards realizing* the two grand conceptions of the founders of our government , viz , that political advantages should be equal , and then that celebrity or obscurity , wealth or poverty , should depend on individual merit . But the most influential and decisive measure for equalizing the original opportunities of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been adopted . In this respect , therefore , the most striking and painful disparities now exist . One source of this difference , indeed , is to be found in the almost unlimited freedom of action exercised by the different towns in regard to their liberality or parsimony , in appropriating money for the support of schools , and their fidelity or remissness in the supervision of this great trust . In this respect , the towns resemble individuals . One parent will make all sacrifices , he will economize in his pleasures , dress , shelter , and even in his food , to save the means of educating his children ; while another , - perhaps his nearest neighbour , - will sell the services of his children for a few pence a day , through the whole year , that he may hoard their earnings , or spend them in dissipation . The towns have been left , substantially , to the exercise of the same free will . It is true , that the law , from time to time , has imposed certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed or neglected , at their option . Indictments against them for nonobservance of the law , have been very few , though their omissions to obey it have been many . The judicial records of the State will show a hundred prosecutions against towns for the defective condition of their roads or bridges , for one complaint on account of omissions or transgressions of the school laws . Some towns , through the influence of a few public-spirited and enlightened individuals , have not only observed , but gone far beyond , the requisitions of the law ; while , in other towns , // where a few men of an opposite character have gained a preponderating influence , the schools have fallen far below its minimum requirements . On a broad survey of the State , and an inquiry into the causes which have led to the superior intelligence and respectability of some towns , as compare4 with others , it will almost uniformly be discovered , that the foundations of their prosperity were laid by a few individuals , - in some cases , by a single individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Under these different circumstances , the most striking inequalities have grown up . According to the Graduated Tables , inserted at the end of the school abstract , it appears that , in regard to the amount of money appropriated for the support of schools , the difference between the foremost and the hindmost towns in the State , is more than seven to one ! " There were five towns which appropriated , for the last year , more than five dollars for the education of each child within their limits , between the ages of four and sixteen years . 11 other towns appropriated more than $4 for each child within the same years . 28 CC 3 CC 12.3 CC I 39 1 CC 1 lessthan 1 " The average of appropriations for the whole State , was two dollars and seventy-one cents , for each child between the abovementioned ages . No town , in the counties of Berkshire or Barnstahle , came up to the average of the State , and in the county of Bristol , only one town ( New Bedford ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of the Commonwealth , on which the several towns are delineated , and , with a pencil , enter the amount appropriated by each for the support oC schools , he will be astonished at the difference between towns situated in the vicinity of each other ; and , oftentimes , at that between contiguous towns . Let the county tables be referred to , and it will be seen that towns standing at or near the head of the column , and those , which could stand at the head only on condition that the order of precedence should be reversed , are towns which , geographically , lie side by side , or in the near vicinity of each other , and in regard to whose natural resources , or eligibility of location , there is but little difference . In taking the single step which carries us across the ideal line separating one town from another , we pass through an immense moral distance . We pass , as it were , from the fertility of the tropical zone to the sterility of the frozen , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geographers , for // illustrating the different degrees of civilization or barbarism existing in different parts of the globe , to variegate the surface of a map with different colors and shades , from the whiteness which represents the furthest advances in civilization and Christianity , to the blackness denoting* the lowest , stages of barbarism . A similar map has been prepared , representing the educational differences between the different departments in the kingdom of France . A map of the different towns of Massachusetts , drawn and colored after such a model , would exhibit edifying , though humiliating contrasts . It would show that , during the last half century , the most efficient cause of social inequality has been left to grow up amongst us unobserved ; and it would furnish data for the prediction , to a great extent , of the future fortunes of the rising generation , in the respective towns . If all that has been said by the wise and good men of past times , respecting the efficiency of our common schools to fit children for the high and various relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most instructive lessons concerning the future may be drawn from a comparison of present educational conditions . No other fact has ever exhibited so fully the extent of obligation which some towns are under to a few individuals , who have had the forecast and the energy , in the midst of difficulties and opposition , to sustain their schools . I have met many individuals , who , having failed to obtain any improvement in the means of education in their respective places of residence , have removed to towns whose schools were good , believing the sacrifice of a hundred , or even of several hundred dollars , to be nothing , in comparison with the value of the school privileges secured for their children by such removal . Still more frequently , when other circumstances have rendered a change of domicil expedient , has this principle of selection governed in choosing a residence . I doubt not there are towns , where parsimonious considerations relative to the schools have obtained the ascendency , which have actually lost more , in dollars and cents , by a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-sightedness , they supposed they had gained by their scanty appropriations , besides inflicting a sort of banishment upon some of their most worthy and estimable citizens . " - pp. 70-73 . But what we have rend in this Report with a surprise , which we ought rather perhaps to be surprised at feeling , is a collection of most interesting facts showing how the capacity of profitable manual labor is improved by the education afforded at these schools . Mr. Mann , from unquestionable data , has // shown to the tax-payers of Massachusetts , that these institutions , instead of being the heavy charge which at first view they appear to be , are , in proportion to their good condition , a rich source of wealth . He has made this appear , not from tiny vague considerations of the benefits of intelligence and knowledge , but by presenting circumstantial statements , obtained from the most competent witnesses , in the form of figure* , which can not lie . A letter from Mr. J. K. Mills , of a wellknown mercantile house in Boston , is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not deny ourselves the gratification of giving it almost entire . " The house with which I am connected in husiness , has had for the last ten years , the principal direction of cotton mills , machine shops , and calico-printing works , in which are constantly employed about three thousand persons . The opinions I have formed of the effects of a common-school education upon our manufacturing population , are the result of personal observation and inquiries , and are confirmed by the testimony of the overseers and agents , who are brought into immediate contact with the operatives . They are as follows 1 . That the rudiments of a common school education are essential to the attainment of skill and expertness as laborers , or to consideration and respect in the civil and social relations of life . " 2 . That very few , who have not enjoyed the advantages of a common-school education , ever rise above the lowest class of operatives ; and that the labor of this class , when it is employed in manufacturing operations , which require even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unproductive . " 3 . That a large majority of the overseers , and others employed in situations which require a high degree of skill , in particular branches ; which , oftentimes , require a good general knowledge of business , and , always , an unexceptionable moral character ; have made their way up from the condition of common laborers , with no other advantage over a large proportion of those they have left behind , than that derived from a better education . " A statement made from the books of one of the manufacturing companies under our direction , will show the relative number of the two classes , and the earnings of each . This mill may be taken as a fair index of all the others . " The average number of operatives annually employed for // the last three years , is twelve hundred . Of this number , there are forty-five unable to write their names , or about 3* per cent . " The average of women 's wages , in the departments requiring the most skill , is $ 250 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lowest departments is*$ P925 per week . " Of the forty-five who are unable to write , twenty-nine , or about two thirds , are employed in the lowest department . The difference between the wages earned by the forty-five , and th' average wages of an equal number of the better educated class , is about twenty-seven per cent . in favor of the latter . " The difference between the wages earned by twenty-nine of the lowest class , and the same number in the higher , is 66 per cent . " Of seventeen persons filling the most responsible situations in the mills , ten have grown up in the establishment from common laborers or apprentices . " This statement does not include an importation of sixtythree persons from Manchester , in England , in 1839 . Among these persons , there was scarcely one who could read or write , and , although a part of them had been accustomed to work in cotton mills , yet , either from incapacity or idleness , they were unable to earn sufficient to pay for their subsistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than half a dozen remained in our employment . " In some of the print works , a large l ) roportion of the operatives are foreigners . Those who are employed in the branches which require a considerable degree of skill , are as well educated as our people in similar situations . But the common laborers , as a class , are without any education , and their average earnings are about two thirds only of those of our lowest classes , although the prices paid to each are the same , for the same amount of work . " Among the men and boys employed in our machine shops , the want of education is quite rare ; indeed , I do not know an instance of a person who is unable to read and write , and many have had a good common-school education . To this may be attributed the fact , that a large proportion of persons who fill the higher and more responsible situations , came from this class of workmen . " From these statements , you will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , of the advantages even of a*little education to the operative ; and there is not the least doubt that the employer is equally benefited . He has the security for his property that intelligence , good morals , and a just appreciation of the regulations of his establishment , always // afford . His machinery and mills , which constitute a large part of his capital , are in the hands of persons , who , by their skill , are enabled to use them to their utmost capacity , and to prevent any unnecessary depreciation . " Each operative in a cotton mill may be supposed to re*resent from one thousand to twelve hundred dollars of the capital invested in the mill and its machinery . It is only from the most diligent and economical use of this capital that the proprietor can expect a profit . A fraction less than one half of the cost of manufacturing common cotton goods , when a mill is in full operation , is made up of charges which are permanent . If the product is reduced in the ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement , it will be seen that the cost will be increased in a compound ratio . " My belief is , that the best cotton mill in New England , with such operatives only as the forty-five mentioned above , who are unable to write their names , would never yield the proprietor a profit ; that the machinery would soon be worn out , and he would be left , in a short time , with a population no better than that which is represented , as I suppose , very fairly , by the importation from England . " - pp. 90 - 92 . To the same effect writes Mr. Clark , Superintendent of the Merrimack Mills , at Lowell . " During the last eight years , I have had under my superintendence upon an average about fifteen hundred persons of both sexes . I have found , with very few exceptions , the best educated among my hands to be the most capable , intelligent , energetic , industrious , economical , and moral ; that they produce the best work , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are , in all respects , the most useful , profitable , and the safest of our operatives ; and , as a class , they are more thrifty and more apt to accumulate property for themselves . " I have recently instituted some inquiries into the comparative wages of our different classes of operatives ; and among other results , I find the following applicable to our present purpose . On our Pay-Roll for the last month , are borne the names of twelve thousand and twenty-nine female operatives , forty of whom receipted for their pay by making their mark . ' Twenty-six of these have been employed in job-work , that is , they were paid according to the quantity of work turned off from their machines . The average pay of these twenty-six falls 18* per cent . below the general average of those engaged in the same departments . " Again , we have in our mills about one hundred and fifty // females who have , at some time , been engaged in teaching schools . Many of them teach during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average wages of these exteachers I find to be 17j per cent . above the general average of our mills , and about 40 per cent . above the ' wages of the Iwentysix who can not ws*ite their names . It may be said , that they are generally employed in the higher departments , where the pay is better . This is true , but this again may be , in most cases , fairly attributed to their better education , which brings us to the same result . If I had included in my calculations , the remaining fourteen of the forty , who are mostly sweepers and scrubbers , and who are paid by the day , the contrasts would have been still more striking ; but having no well-educated females engaged in this department with whom to compare them , I have omitted them altogether . In arriving at the above results I have considered the net wages merely , - the price of board being in all cases the same . I do not consider these results as either extraordinary , or surprising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of a better cultivation and fuller developement of the intellectual and moral powers . " - pp. 98 , 99 . We limit ourselves to one more extract , and we will take it from Mr. Mann 's admirable observations on this class of facts . " Why is it that , so far as this Union is concerned , fourfifths of all the improvements , inventions , and discoveries , in regard to machinery , to agricultural implements , to superior models in ship-building , and to the manufacture of those refined instruments on which accuracy in scientific observations depends , have originated in New England . I believe no adequate reason can be assigned , but the early awakening and training of the power of thought in our children . The suggestion is not made invidiously , but in this connexion it has too important a bearing to be omitted ,  --  but let any one , who has resided or travelled in those States where there are no common schools , compare the condition of the people at large , as to thrift , order , neatness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same characteristics of civilization in the farm-houses and villages of New England . These contrasts exist , notwithstanding the fertility of the soil and the abundance of mineral resources , in the former States , as compared with the sterile surface and granite substratum of the latter . Never was a problem more clearly demonstrated , than that even a moderate degree of intelligence , diffused through // the mass of the people , is more than an equivalent for all the prodigality of nature . It is said , indeed , in regard to those States where there are no provisions for general education , that the want of energy and forecast , the absence of laborsaving contrivances and an obtuseness in a4apting means lo ends , are the consequences of a system of involuntary servitude ; but what is this , so far as productiveness is concerned , but a want of knowledge , - what is it but the existence of that mental imbecility and torpor , which arise from personal and hereditary neglect ? In conversing with a gentleman , who had possessed most extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all degrees of intellectual developement , he observed , that he could employ a common immigrant or a slave , and , if he chose , could direct him to shovel a heap of sand from one spot to another , and then back into its former place , and so to and fro , through the day ; and that , with the same food or the same pay , the laborer would perform this tread-mill operation without inquiry or complaint ; but , added he , neither love nor money would prevail on a NewEnglander to prosecute a piece of work of which he did not see the utility . There is scarcely any kind of labor , however simple or automatic , which can be so well performed without knowledge in the workman , as with it . It is impossible for an overseer or employer , at all times to supply mind to the laborer .

The building had a great number of apartments , which were to be warmed by means of a furnace placed in the cellar , after the manner in which most of our hospitals and large public edifices are warmed . Accordingly , one set of flues had been constructed for conveying the heated and pure air into all the apartments , and another set for conveying the foul air upward into the attic . So far it was well . But unfortunately for the transmission of the air in an upward current and for its escape from the attic when it should arrive there , the roof was completely closed in , neither window , sky.light , nor aperture of any kind being left , through which it could find egress . The edifice had been built from a plan , and withqut a knowledge of principles .

The cost of machinery there , also , is but about half as much as the cost of the same articles with us ; while our capital , when loane , d , produces n*arly double the rate of English interest .

No explanation can be given of this extraordinary fact , which does not take into the account the difference of education between the operatives in the two countries . Yet where , in all our Congressional debates upon this subject , or in the discussions and addresses of National Conventions , has this fundamental principle * been brought out , - and one , at least , of its most important and legitimate inferences displayed , viz , that it is our *visest policy , as citizens ,  --  if indeed it be not a duty of self-preservation as men , - to improve the education of our whole people , both in its quantity and quality . I have been told by one of our most careful and successful manufacturers , that , on substituting , in one of his cotton mills , a better for a poorer educated class of operatives , he was enabled to add twelve or fifteen per cent . to the speed of his machinery , without any increase of damage or danger from the acceleration . How direct and demonstrative the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our law respecting the education of children in manufacturing establishments ! What prominency and cogency do they give to the argument for obeying it , if not from motives of humanity , at least from those of policy and self-interest ! I am sorry to say , that this benignant and parental law is still , in some cases , openly disregarded ; and that there are employers amongst us , who say , that if their hands come punctually to their work , and continue at it during the regular hours , it is immaterial to them what private character they sustain , and whether they attend the evening school or the lyceum lecture on the week day , or go to church on the Sabbath . " The number of females in this State , engaged in the various manufactures of cotton , straw-platting , &amp;c. , has been estimated at forty thousand ; and the annual value of their labor , atone hundred dollars each , on an average , or four millions of dollars for the whole .

We congratulate the friends of this cause upon two important measures of the last General Court of Massachusetts the provisions made for the support of Normal Schools , and for the establishment of School District Libraries . Three years ago , Mr. Edmund Dwight , of Boston , offered ten thousand dollars to the Commonwealth , on the condition that an equal sum should be furnished from the Treasury , for the maintenance , for three years , of three Normal Schools , for the instruction of common-school teachers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means being now exhausted , the Legislature , at its last session , appropriated six thousand dollars a year , for continuing these schools three years longer . This gives opportunity for the experiment to justify itself hy a full trial , and accordingly , in our opinion , amounts to an establishment of them in perpetuity . The other scheme , that of the establishment of School District Libraries , Massachusetts has not the praise of originating ; but , next to the merit of setting a good example , is that of following it promptly . New York established its common schools only thirty years ago , and already there is a small library in each of the ten or eleven thousand school dis // tricts of that State , embracing in the aggregate nearly a million of volumes , so that a traveller can not be stopped anywhere within its wide bounds , without being within two or three miles of some good reading . The appropriation , just mad*e by Massachusetts for the same purpose , timounts to between thirty and forty thousand dollars , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall contribute an equal sum to that furnished from the public fund@@184059052.txt NUMBERS of persons in the United States , at this day , cherish a general idea , that , during the revolutionary war , the people of the colonies were nearly unanimous in resisting the policy of the mother country . And , if they believe that rrories and Cowboys were now and then to be seen , whose malignity expended itself in vexing as much as possible the friends of the good cause , they nevertheless suppose , not only that the number of such people was positively inconsiderable , hut that it embraced all of the dissent to the opinion of the majority , that was entertained in America . Yet , should a curious inquirer cast but a glance upon the Catalogue of Graduates of Harvard University , or should an observing traveller , whilst wandering along the fine tract of country between Halifax and Annapolis , or Digby , in Nova Scotia , or crossing the Bay of Fundy to St. John 's , and from thence to St. Andrew 's , in the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region from whence they came , he would find something to shake his confidence in the soundness of the popular opinion . Civil wars will anywhere be attended with peculiar evils , and among the mildest of these , perhaps , is the expatriation of a large number of persons , who constitute the minority of that community in which they take place . A remarkable circumstance attending the process , in these States , was its thoroughness . Though not much more than half a century has elapsed since it happened , it is now next to impossible to obtain information , within their limits , respecting families known to have been in a flourishing condition but a short time before the Revolution . And many thousands are now found in the Provinces above mentioned , inheriting all the characteristics of New England people , who yet retain no recollection of or sympathy with the spot from which they were transplanted . How much bitterness of spirit there must have been to establish , in so short a time , so perfect a wall of separation between men // who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined . Even at this moment , the harshest censors of our public conduct as a nation , and the most willing hands to add fuel , from such materials as chance may supply , to the fire of contention between us and Great Britain , might probably be traced among the descendants of those , whose names , faces , conversation , and manners , would have proved them , without need of resort to a pedigree , kith and kin of the present inhabitants of New England . Neither have the prejudices of the latter , on their side , very materially changed . Not many citizens of the United States would now concede more merit to a being called an American Tory , than they would to a robber , or an incendiary . Such is the inveteracy of human passion , when men have been once fearfully excited against each other , during a period of deadly strife . We are not sure that any precise computation has ever been made of the number of those who left their ancient homes and firesides in consequence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been small . And the greater part of them could have been actuated by no discreditable motives in the course which they thought fit to pursue . Some were doubtless timid and wavering spirits , who could not bring themselves up to the point of open resistance to the great power across the water . Others were affectionate hearts , beating too nearly in sympathy with some connexions in the Old World , to relish the idea of a total separation . Others were held back from the movement by the dread of losing the estimation they had succeeded , after a life of honest exertion , in acquiring . If , in the conduct of these persons , at so great a crisis in public affairs , there is nothing to admire , still there is in it as little to censure . If they honestly believed , that the Revolution was nothing better than do*vnright rebellion to constituted authority , by which name it is now most frequently designated in Nova Scotia , their action may have been wrong , but it can scarcely be condemned as criminal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , which judges only by the event , would probably have been of their opinion . The emigration would then have been from the other side . Happy , indeed , would it have been for its members , if so mild a punishment bad been allotted them . The possibility of such a result , // should teach us in all cases of political struggle to deal in a spirit of charity with the vanquished . In truth , of the persons , who took part with the mother country in America , there were several distinct classes which ought not to be confounded together . There were the merely amhitious , who were willing to sell their country for a mess of pottage ; the greedy after office and patronage ; the hangers-on of all people in place , who cared nothing for the question at issue except as it affected their hread and butter . For such as these , who did their best to blow up in Great Britain the flame of discontent with the colonies merely for the sake of ingratiating themselves , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutchinson , whose education had taught him better principles than he chose to practise upon . The jack-o ' - lantern of official station misled him , as it has done many both before and after him without more justification , though with less dangerous consequences from their conduct . Mfith such men , who play gamesters ' tricks in politics , and hazard every thing for the mere chance of winning much , we can scarcely be expected to have much sympathy when they fail , or to concede to them any merit for their wicked daring , when they succeed . There was another class , and a wholly different one , composed of those who disapproved of the acts of Great Britain , but who did not think them of a character to justify extreme measures of resistance . They hoped that remonstrance would open a way to reconciliation , and they thought , that , whether it did or not , the hazard of loss , by attempting to set up a new system in the face of a powerful enemy , was greater than the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservatives of that day , timid and temporizing , perhaps , but perfectly honest , and by no means deserving of any censure like that which we have passed upon the other class . Under this description of persons , we must rank the subject of the work now before us , Peter Van Schaack . The present volume is the first attempt , that we know of , to present to the public of the United States a justificatory nlenoir of one of the Tories of the Revolution . As such we are glad to see it , more particularly as it will furnish to us some opportunity of reviewing the opinions of the vanquished party of that day . And , although we can scarcely be expected to entertain any sympathy with them , yet we trust // that time enough has elapsed to enable us to do them justice . We think nobody can i'ead this biography of Mr. Van Schaack , prepared by his son in an exceedingly modest and inoffensive form , without feeling respect for the man , even in his errors , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For domestic affliction came to add its pangs to those occasioned by political affairs , and physical suffering was joined in his person to the unhappiness of exile . We can scarcely imagine a more melancholy situation , and we think it shows the possession of no small share of the true spirit of Christian philosophy , that the patient should , through all these trials , have acted so well up to the significant motto of his own selection , " Superandctfortunaferendo . " Mr. Van Schaack 's temper was neither soured nor broken down . On the contrary , he presents in his example an edifying instance of how much a man can bear in this world , if he is only guided by the right principles of philosophy and religion . At the cornnencement of the Revolution , Mr. Van Schaack was a young lawyer , established in pretty extensive practice , in the city of New York ; and he had been engaged by the colony in the reponsible duty of collecting and revising the statute laws of eighty years preceding . He felt , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government at home , and became one of the first Committee of Correspondence appointed in New York , in 1774 . When this committee was dissolved , another and larger one was organized to carry into execution the non-importation agreement , and of this also Mr. Van Schaack was a member . Thus far it appears that he was willing to go with the country but , when the progress of events showed , that nothing short of a total separation from Great Britain would do , he was unwilling to keep pace with it . He removed from New York to Kinderhook in 1775 , partly for change of scene , after the loss of several children in their infancy , and partly on account of the troubles ; and at the latter place he seems to have been willing to rest in a state of neutrality between contending parties , so long as they would suffer it . He had examined his mind and his heart , and they forbade him to rush into what he thought unjustifiable opposition to legitimate authority . That the conclusion to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appears clear from a paper which we find in the present volume , written at his // place of residence in January , 1776 , and in which are embodied the arguments , that weighed most heavily on his mind in favor of the course which he ultimately took . Although somewhat long , we will extract the principal l ) art of it , as giving a tolerable clue to the character of the author . " The only foundation of all legitimate governments is certainly a compact between the rulers and the people , containing mutual conditions , and equally obligatory on both the contracting parties . No question can therefore exist , at this enlightened day , about the lawfulness of resistance , in cases of gross and palpable infractions of the governing power . It is impossible , however , clearly to ascertain every case which shall effect a dissolution of this contract ; for these , though always tacitly implied , are never expressly declared , in any form of government . " As a man is bound by the sacred ties of conscience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the government exists , so , on the other hand , he owes it to the cause of liberty to resist the invasion of those rights , which , being inherent and unalienable , could not be surrendered at the institution of the civil society of which he is a member . In times of civil commotion , therefore , an investigation of those rights , which will necessarily infer an inquiry into the nature of government , becomes the indispensable duty of every man . " There are , perhaps , few questions relating to government of more difficulty , than that at present subsisting between Great Britain and the colonies . It originated about the degree of subordination we owed to the British Parliament ; but , by a rapid progress , it seems now to be , whether we are members of the empire or not . In this view , the principles of Mr. Locke , and other advocates for the rights of mankind , are little to the purpose . His treatise throughout presupposes rulers and subjects of the same state , and , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reasonings , if not inapplicable , will be found rather to militate against our claims ; for he holds the necessity of a supreme power , and the necessary existence of one legislature only in every society , in the strongest terms . " Here arises the doubt ; if we are parts of the same state , we can not complain of a usurpation , unless in a qualified sense ; but we must found our resistance upon an undue and oppressive exercise of a power we recognise . In short , our reasonings must resolve into one or the other of the following three grounds , and our right of resistance must be founded upon either the first or third of them ; for either , first , we owe no obedience to // any acts of Parliament ; or , secondly , we are bound by all acts to which British subjects in Great Britain would , if passed with respect to them , owe obedience ; or , thirdly , we are subordinate in a certain degree ; or , in other words , certain acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Upon the first point I am exceedingly clear in my mind , for I consider the colonies as members of the British empire , and subordinate to the Parliament . But , with regard to the second and third , I am not so clear . The necessity of a supreme power in every state strikes me very forcibly ; at the same time I foresee the destructive consequences of a right in Parliament to bind us in all cases whatever . To obviate the ill effects of either extreme some middle way should be found out , by which the benefits to the empire should be secured arising from the doctrine of a supreme power , while the abuses of that power to the prejudice of the colonists should be guarded against ; and this , I hope , will be the happy effect of the present struggle . " The basis of such a compact must be , the securing to the Americans the essential rights of Britons , but so modified as shall best consist with the general benefit of the whole . If , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges of the inhabitants of Great Britain , ( as , for instance , a representation in Parliament we can not , ) this must not be an obstacle ; for there is certainly a point in which the general good of the whole , with the least possible disadvantage to every part , does centre , though it may be difficult to discern it , and every individual part must give way to the general good . " If the principles upon which such a union should be formed are difficult of discovery , will it not initigate the severity of the acts we complain of ? If the line between authority and dependence has never been drawn , will it not render the offence less heinous if the Parliament has transgressed it ? It may be said , that these principles terminate in passive obedience ; far from it . I perceive that several of the acts exceed these bounds , which of right ought to circumscribe the Parliament . But my difficulty arises from this , that , taking the whole of the acts complained of together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery ; but may fairly be imputed to human frailty , and the difficulty of the subject . Most of them seem to have sprung out of particular occasions , and are unconnected with each other ; and some of them are precisely of the nature of other acts , made before the commencement of his present Majesty 's reign , which is the era when the supposed design of subjugating the colonies began . If these acts have exceeded what is and ought to be declared to be the line of // right , and thus we have been sufferers in some respects by the undefined state of the subject , it will also , I think , appear from such a union , when established , if past transactions are to be measured by the standard hereafter to be fixed , that we have hitherto been deficient in other respects , and derived benefit from the same unsettled state . " In short , I think those acts may have been passed without a preconcerted plan of enslaving us ; and it appears to me , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of our rulers . I can not therefore think the government dissolved ; and , as long as the society lasts , the power that every individual gave the society when he entered into it , can never revert to the individuals again , but will always remain in the community . " If it be asked , how we come to he subject to the authority of the British Parliament , I answer , by the same compact which entitles us to the benefits of the British constitution , and its laws ; and that we derive advantage even from some kind of subordination , whatever the degree of it should be , is evident , because without such a controlling common umpire , the colonies must become independent states , which would be introductive of anarchy and confusion among ourselves . " Some kind of dependence being then , in my idea , necessary for our own happiness , I would choose to see a claim made of a constitution which shall concede this point ; as , before that is done by us , and rejected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regard for my country , which will authorize me in taking up arms , as absolute dependence and independence are two extremes which I would avoid ; for , should we succeed in the latter , we shall still be in a sea of uncertainty , and have to fight among ourselves for that constitution we aim at . " There are many very weighty reasons besides the above , to restrain a man from taking up arms , but some of them are of too delicate a nature to be put upon paper ; however , it may be proper to mention what does not restrain me . It is not from apprehension of the consequences should America be subdued , or the hopes of any favor from government , both which I disclaim ; nor is it from any disparagement of the cause my countrymen are engaged in , or a desire of obstructing the present measures . " I am fully convinced , that men of the greatest abilities , and the soundest integrity , have taken parts in this war with America , and their measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious a matter , implicitly to yield to the authority of any character , however respectable . Every man must exercise his own // reason , and judge for himself ; for he that appeals to Heaven must be sure that he has right on his side , ' according to Mr. Locke . It is a question of morality and religion , in which a man can not conscientiously take an active part , without being convinced in his own mind of the justice of the cause ; for obedience while government exists being clear on the one hand , the dissolution of the government must be equally so , to justify an appeal to arms ; and whatever disagreeable consequences may follow from dissenting from the general voice , yet , I can not but remcmber , that I am to render an account of my conduct before a more awful tribunal , where no man can be justified , who stands accuscd by his own conscience of taking part in measures , which , through the distress and bloodshed of his fellow-creatures , may precipitate his country into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper like this , bears internal evidence of the honesty and conscientiousness of the writer . He had applied to the momentous question before him the best lights of his understanding , and the result was , that he could not sanction resistance by force . Mr. Van Schaack was not of the number of those who considered the British policy justifiable in itself ; but he was unwilling to believe , that the ministers systematically pursued it with hostile intent towards the colonies . And , moreover , he had little faith in the capacity of his countrymen to substitute a good plan of self-government , arid to adhere to it . His mind was of the cautious , perhaps slightly timid kind , which foresees more danger than good in sudden change . For the scruples of such a man we must entertain respect , even where we see them to be excessive . His argument was fully answered in the Declaiation of Independence , and his apprehensions were subsequently shown to be unfounded by the adoption of the Federal Constitution . But no person , who has observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of anarchy and general confusion , can deny that he had great justification for entertaining them . Mr. Van Schaack retired to the country apparently , with a desire to avoid taking an active part on either side in the great struggle . And this wish was doubtless heightened by the happening of personal nisfortune . He irrecoverably lost the tise of one eye , and was threatened with losing that of the otliei- also ; an event which did ultimately take f ) lace , although not until a great while afterwards . His father died about this time , and the health of his wife began rapidly to // fail . Under such circumstances , it is not much to be wondered at , that he should have felt as if , what with the public , what with private troubles , there was not a gleam of light to relieve the prospect . Yet he was too important a man to be left entirely alone at such a crisis . His influence , even though tacitly operating , was too great among relations and friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him to take an oath of allegiance to the new State of New York , and he refused ; in consequence of which he was ordered to quit the jurisdiction within ten days , and go directly to Boston . To that place he accordingly went . He appears to have considered this sentence as very harsh treatment , and to have renrnnstrated very earnestly and with some effect against it . But what could the insurgent party have done if they had acted upon the principle of encouraging neutrals ? The struggle proved severe enough , notwithstanding the great inequality of the parties to it in America , to strain every nerve of the majority . There were many people in the Middle States anxious to remain neutral , and some who did continue so through the war , as far as the folly of the British commanders in harassing them , would permit . It certainly was not expedient to hazard enlarging the number by permitting distinguished persons with such dispositions to pass without censure . Mr. Van Schaack doubtless suffered some hardship under the rule , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wife , to be transported to the city of New York , then within the British lines ; but such things are incident to war , and particularly to civil war , where treachery must always be apprehended in addition to its ordinary evils . In point of fact , he was not at all severely dealt with , for he was allowed in a few weeks to return home , and there to remain on his parole of neutrality . His petition to leave the country for the sake of procuring medical aid in England for his eyes was granted , and his property was not included in the list of confiscations on account of his adherence to the mother country . So that he did in reality suffer no inconvenience from his refusal to aid the cause of America , other than a banishment of a few years to the land whose government he had sustained . We will venture to say , that not many of the patriots got out of the war so lightly . But the long residence of Mr. Van Schaack in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political opinions . We have already observed the fact , that , in 1776 , he differed from his patriot friends Jay and Benson , Morris and Sedgwick , rather in degree than in quality . He was more willing than they to give the British government credit for general goodness of intention , and therefore to pass lightly over what he agreed with them in considering arbitrary and unjustifiable acts . Opportunities of closer observation very soon induced him to modify his opinions . He found little sympathy with any party in America , among the British . He found the colonies regarded , as insolent dependents often are in the family of a haughty man ,  --  as people who are to be whipped into good behaviour . And all this had a great effect in cooling his respect for British authority . rrhe real truth is that John Bull , with all his excellent qualities both of head and heart , is not over civil or friendly in his external manners , either towards neighbours , or people whom he thinks a make them regret the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of them who had not committed themselves beyond hope of pardon ,  --  to seize the earliest opportunity to return to America . In this number was the gentleman whose biography is before us . Of the other class , was Hutchinson , who pined for the breezes of the land of freedom without a ray of hope that he should ever he ahle to enjoy them . His punishment was not greater than he deserved ; but Mr. Van Schaack was relieved from paying any similar penalty . He did return to enjoy , to the end of a long life , the fruits of institutions , which no man admired more than he , when he saw them established , dispelling all his anxious fears , and far better even than his hopes . That Mr. Van Schaack never intended to expatriate himself is made evident , we think , by the fact that he left his children behind him . He was not unmindful of them in his absence , but addressed to his son , the author of this memoir , letters which show , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the peculiarly kind and affectionate temper of the individtial . As illustrative of his familiar manner , we will extract one of these . // " London , 12th June , 1784 .

Mr. Van Schaack was evidently a man fitted for peaceful // times , and possessed of that quiet and solid character which shines brightly only at such seasons . His classical attainments appear to have been good , if not very extensive , and what he did know well , he was fond of communicating to the young around him . His familiar letters are full of kindness and of consideration for the youths to whom they were addressed . But these are not qualities with which to make much headway in turbulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons of danger , when the executing hand must follow immediately after the devising head . It was only when the peace opened the way for his return to the United States , that he again settled himself down at Kinderhook , married a second time , and exhihited to the world an edifying example of respectable and venerated old age , without complaint as to the past , cheerful even under the privation of sight , and ever willing to communicate to succeeding generations , the lessons of wisdom which he had been gathering from adversity and the past . It is one marked peculiarity of the subject of this memoir , that his feelings did not turn into gall under affliction , and had not the effect of perverting his judgment of passing events , as was too often the case with the refugees in England . He soon saw that the contest must terminate favorably to the American side , and his foresight appears to have done him little service with his English friends . They had been accustomed to bear an opposite opinion confidently expressed hy loyalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the general contempt they entertained for those who were styled the rebels . lie thought more favorably of the capacity of the colonists for self-government , for he knew them better than they ; and yet he also understood , perhaps even overrated , the nature of the evils which would flow from their independence . This is what he wrote in his Diary at the close of 1779 ; " America will perhaps never see such happy days as the past . They may be a great empire , and enjoy opulence ; but that mediocrity between extreme poverty and luxurious riches made their condition substantially happy . There being but few offices , there was no scope for bribery , corruption , and the numerous train of evils which attend the venality in this country . Henceforth , having an empire of their own , the numerous train of offices will produce like effects as the same causes do here // " Whether the contest is at an end or not , is a question of fact , the affirmative of which is not to be assumed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sinister motives of interest in regard to temporary ease , nor because government can not protect every part of its dominions . " But , on the other hand , neither is the negative to be taken up when the mind , upon an impartial inquiry , is fully satisfied ; when a series of events and of attempts for years have only increased the probability of want of success , and the difficulty of the object ; when in various instances government has confessed this ; when the object of the war is changed ; when to persevere is infatuation ; when the view is only to weaken our country without hopes of regaining it ; when the arguments for allegiance now will equally operate fifty years hence . Duty to myself , to my posterity , to my native country , then call upon me , and my connexion with the parent country is dissolved . " I am to consider the happiness of that country , not the aggrandizement of this . Perpetuation of animosities , - Devastation , - End of the war ; the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aversion of the Americans to the religion , government , and manners of the French , will make them unwilling to admit French troops among them . My opinion has been uniformly against this idea . The great object of America is independence . Her hatred , her religious hatred , is against Great Britain . This is her ruling passion , which swallows up all others as of inferior consideration . Whatever the motive of France was , the action was materially good in the eye of the Americans . The external profession of one religion or another could not stand in competition with benefits and injuries , and these depend upon opinion . The wounds of a friend strike deeper than those of an enemy . It must be a work of time to recall her affections . ' " Dec. 1779 . The instance of the Restoration , is often adduced by those who expect the Americans will return to their allegiance . 1 . This is a singular case , a prodigy in history , from which no general conclusion can be drawn , or any rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . The genius of the English led them to a preference of monarchy , whereas the Americans ( especially New England ) are disposed to a republic . 3 . The government in England had been fluctuating between a variety of forms till it settled in the Protector , whose powers , in fact , were those of a king , without the name . The American constitutions are fixed , and totally different from their colony dependence . The transition at the Restoration was easy ; that of the Americans would be from one extreme to another . // 4 . The English effected the Restoration without any sacrifice of national dignity . The Americans would have to sacrifice all the pride of empire , which every whig there now fees as sensibly as a monarch his power . 5 . Those who opposed royalty in England , were the most contemptible of the community . " In one case , prejudice in favor of an old form , - in the other , never any settled constitution . " - pp. 244 , 245 . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lawyer 's heads for an argument , but they are deserving of consideration for the insight which they give into the mind of the writer . He was of that class of men , who are slow to make up a positive opinion , who consider both sides of every question , and hesitate so long before they decide , that they are driven to take the wrong one by losing the all-important moment for choosing the right . Thus it seems to have been at the breaking out of the Revolution . He would have been a Patriot , if lie had had time enough to consider well the matter . His feelings , his principles , and his friends led him that way ; but events crowded upon eae.h other too fast for his process of conviction . He wanted further time when that time could not be granted to him . He thus was ranked among the Tories , because he would not declare himself a Whig ; and , when the day caine that his opinions were made up , and he really was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to retrace his steps , or do any thing but await the result of the contest . No sooner was that result declared , than he signified his disposition in a letter to his brother in the following words ; " I have all along , and in all companies , freely declared my intention of returning to America , whatever might be the issue of the contest ; and , though I believe I would be as averse as any man to purchase an advantage at the expense of my honor , yet I can not agree with those whose high and towering spirits could not brook to live under the government of people they dislike , &amp;c . I am much surprised if some of these people would not stoop lower than you or I would . Power has no such charms to me as to make me care much who possesses it . Revolutions have happened in all countries , and the weaker must submit to the stronger . " For my part , I believe America will be as well governed as any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of America more debauched and corrupt , or less sensible and well informed than the Europeans ? Alas ! I am not to be persuad // ed to this . For my part , if I can return , which hitherto I do assure you I have not taken one preparatory step to bring about , I shall be as good a subject of the new government as I ever was of the old . This declaration I shall not scruple to make without lessening myself in my own opinion at all . If they have magnanimity enough to accept this as an atonement , I shall be happy ; if not my heart is not broken by this or , I believe , any other disappointment . " - pp. 321 , 322 . His first movement after the treaty of peace was signed , was to write to his old friend , Mr. Jay ; and it is a signal testimonial of his worth , that that gentleman , second only to Washington , in our estimate of the men of the Revolution , should at once have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purse . Of pecuniary aid he stood in no need , and , as it turned out , he experienced little difficulty in his restoration to his property and right of citizenship at home . Yet he felt that he had committed himself so far as to render it inexpedient for him to enter public life , or mix very actively in the politics of the country ; - a decision which was probably favorable to his own peace , as popular prejudices have always run high against all , who were even suspected of lukewarmness to the Revolution , and these would scarcely have been allowed to sleep in party times , let his merit and services have been what they might . He did however interest himself in favor of the adoption of the Federal Constitution , and was a candidate in his county for a seat in the ratifying convention of New York ; hut , the majority being anti-federal , he was not elected . He returned , however , to the practice of his profession , in which he frilly sustained his early reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the age of eighty-five , at his home in Kinderhook . On the whole , we have been much more interested in the present volume than we expected when we took it up . It has enabled us to judge of one class of our countrymen more discriminatingly than we have been wont to do , and to appreciate the conscientious scruples of some whom the American public sets down too generally as wilful traitors . We can readily understand the desire of the author to relieve the memory of his father from any such imputation , and are glad to be able to express our opinion that his attempt has been successful . // We can not close this article , without noticing the exceedingly favorable opinions occasionally expressed by Mr. Van Schaack and his brothers , of the people of Massachusetts . We cite , as an example , a passage from a letter of Mr. Henry Van Schaack , written immediately after the close of the war . " This Commonwealth has to boast , what perhaps no people on earth could ever say before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the confederacy in carrying on the war , and , after a struggle of seven years , they have established a good government , and never executed a single man for his political principles . When this fact is handed down to posterity , by the faithful pages of history , ages hence will rank the Massachusetts among the first people in the world . " - p. 355 . We do not insert this passage for the mere purpose of glorification , albeit we do think that no just estimate has ever been put upon the relative share of merit , which the people of Massachusetts had in the support of the revolutionary war . But we quote it to show , if that State manifested , sixty years ago , so laudable an example of attachment to the principles of liberty and good government combined , as to make it an object of admiration to its neighbours , how great is the duty incumbent upon its citizens , now and at all times , to continue to maintain the same reputation . There are always in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , needing only a congenial spot in which to catch , that they may germinate into dissension , and riot , and public distractions . Sometimes these find their way into a community through disorder in the money relations between individuals , sometimes they grow out of the agitation of political demagogues , sometimes they spring from the mere impatience of legal control , felt by headstrong , arrogant , and daring individuals . Examples are not wanting to illustrate these positions , if it were worth our while at this period to enter into such a discussion , which it is not . But they all go equally to prove , that the liberty of a self-regulated community is not the only element of its social prosperity , and that , if it seeks to make itself respected as well as happy , its members must , even in the midst of trial , manifest a profound regard for order also . Those States of the Union will be ultimately able to retain the largest amount of population and property , which shall succeed the best in bindVOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fabric of society . It can not he denied , that in many cases they have been already deeply shaken . The consequence must necessarily he , that citizens will begin to scan more narrowly , than they have done , the principles at the bottom of the policy of the separate States , and to select for residence , those which appear likely to protect them best . It should be the great aim of the States , then , to vie with each other in holding forth to the public gaze , not the most striking novelties , which terrify even whilst they dazzle the imagination , but the most permanent and the best settled social system , founded at once upon the most comprehensive principles , and the most uniform practice of them . With this and this alone , can Massachusetts hope to stand under the competition of a more favored soil and a happier sky in other States , and to merit the panegyric which we find to have been made upon her at the cornmencement of her independent career.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
