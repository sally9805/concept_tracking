Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : Rely on Right . from Rely on Right 1846 If sorrow come , resist it not , Nor yet bow weakly to it ; Look up to meet the heaven-sent storm , But see the rainbow through it . And seek not bliss on airy heights , Whose dizzy power doth rally ; The fragrant little heart's-ease lights The lowliest , humblest valley . The gem that clasps a royal robe , The worldling 's eye may dazzle , But love will light his glow-worm lamp In cot as well as castle . If comes a blow from friend or foe , With earnest good avenge it ; " The sandal-tree , with fragrant sigh , Perfumes the axe that rends it . " Be like the sun , whose eye of joy Ne'er on a shadow lay , love ; Be like a rill that singeth still , Whate'er be in its way , love . If once a purpose pure and high You form , for naught forego it ; " The mulberry-leaf to silk is changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
