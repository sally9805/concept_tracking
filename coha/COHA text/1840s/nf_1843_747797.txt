txt IN preparing this work the author has endeavored to present every important fact contained in the Constitution and Laws of the State of New York , in such a manner that the pupil will be able to understand , fix and secure it in his mind at once . If in the Roman Republic the very children , as Cicero informs us , were obliged to learn the twelve tables by heart , as a carmen necessarium , or indispensable lesson , to imprint on their tender minds an early knowledge of the Constitution and Laws of their country , should we not profit by their example ? Our Constitution and Laws are the charter of our religious and political liberty . The knowledge of them should be as diffusive as the sun-light . Every man should " teach them to his children , speaking of them when he sits in his house , when he walks by the way , when he lies down and when he rises up . He should write them upon the doer-posts of his house and upon the gates . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are entirely ignorant of the penalty . Let our laws be thoroughly instilled into the minds of the young , and we may write on our State prisons and Bridewells , " To Let . " It is much easier and much cheaper to prevent crime than to punish it . In a country , and under a government like ours , where all , directly or indirectly , make , apply and execute the laws of the land in a country inhabited by a " Nation of Kings " in a country where every native citizen is a member of the " Royal Family , " and every young man " an heir apparent to the crown , " the blush of shame should mantle the cheek of every child who does not understand our Constitution and Laws . The Secretary of State , a few years ago , in his report to the Legislature , as Superintendent of Common Schools , uses the following language /z/ " The primary schools are most intimately connected with the success and stability of our free system of government . Every citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is essential that universal instruction should be the companion of universal suffrage . The course of education in common schools ought to be adapted to the duties which may devolve upon the person instructed ; and it is to be regretted that in most of the schools there is no attention paid to giving a young man instruction in regard to the peculiar duties which devolve upon him as a free citizen of a representative government . Each scholar ought to have an opportunity in the schools , of becoming acquainted with the principles of our Constitution and Laws , and be enabled to understand something of our State and national government . " Every man who loves his Constitution and Laws , will readily respond to the language of the Hon. Secretary , " that universal instruction should be the companion of universal suffrage . 5 ' When the voice of every citizen is heard in determining the most important questions , upon which often hang the issues of life and death , that voice should come from those who know what they are doing .. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mass of our citizens ? They can not study to advantage our Constitution and Laws in the form in which they are laid down in our law-books ; besides , the price of these books precludes their use in schools or families . Then some one must submit to the task of reducing the whole to a cheap , attractive form . He must adapt the whole to the capacity of the learner . He must critically analyze the whole , and lead the mind of the learner clearly to every important fact . He must present this fact in such a manner that the learner will be able to perceive , fix , and secure it in his mind at once . It is indeed a laborious task . The spirit and the letter of the law must be retained as far as possible , but the capacity of the learner must never be lost sight of . In preparing this work I have kept these ideas prominently in view , and how far I have succeeded in my undertaking the public will judge . I would gladly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found those willing to undertake it . This work is not without its errors , and fair and manly criticism is earnestly solicited . I shall gladly hail any effort from a more skilful pen from an author who better understands the human intellect who loves his country and his laws more ardently than I do to prepare a work which shall supersede my humble effort .
