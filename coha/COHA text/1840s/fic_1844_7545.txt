Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : TO LITTLE HENRY , LISTENING TO A POEM BY THE AUTHOR . from To little Henry ( 1844 ) Dear must be his country 's praise , To the bard she crowns with bays ; Sweet the echo of his name , From the clarion voice of Fame :  --  Mine a tribute dearer still , For a holier flattery flows From thy voice , that , like a rill , Music makes where'er it goes . Child of Genius ! in thine eyes , I can see thy soul arise ; All the poetry of feeling , In their changeful depths revealing ; And the verse that wins from thee Earnest look  --  approval free  --  Playing on a lyre so fine As that guileless heart of thine  --  Waking , from its softest sigh , Melody in low reply  --  Must have music in its flow , Purer , truer than I know ; Gifted with a grace divine , By a Higher power than mine .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
