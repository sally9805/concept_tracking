PREFACE TO THE DRAMA . The author of the following dramatic sketch has been induced ( although the term may seem a strange one ) , to minds wedded to the popular opinions of Richard Third 's character ; from a Christian motive , to endeavor to rescue it from some of the odium which now rests upon it : thus , somewhat aiding the research , and amiable idea of Mr. Heseltine in his very interesting romance , " The Last of the Plantagenets . " The anathema of Shakspeare , on him who should touch his ashes , would seem , at the first view , to apply with equal force to his writings ; but Shakspeare , though the first of geniuses , was a mortal ; therefore , liable to error and prejudice . Historians differ in their estimate and catalogue of Richard 's crimes ; and experience of the human heart , its strange mixture of good and evil ; its generous throb ; its cold or dark intent , moving it simultaneously , would preclude the possibility , that such a monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he in crime thus branded and alone ? Henry Eighth , for instance , what plea had he to urge for murders , cruel and unjust ? None . With regard to the authenticity of the existence of such a person as Richard Plantagenet , son of Richard Third , Mr. Heseltine offers nothing , but that manuscripts were found in some old castle , setting forth that such a person lived , and sustained a life of obscurity , by manual labor . There is nothing impossible in the statement ; but as Mr. Heseltine clothes his hero with romance , your dramatist may be allowed the same privilege . New York , November , 1844 . PROLOGUE . ( SPOKEN BY RICHARD PLANTAGENET . ) A Statue , or Bust of Shakspeare , is seen , to which Richard kneels , saying : Pardon ! blest shade ! that step of mine should dare To tread  --  where imprints of thy footsteps are  --  I tremble  --  falter  --  yet a whisper hear  --  " Thought , is Heaven 's gift ,  --  and never should know fear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind  --  Could doubt , one moment so my judgment blind ?

Shakspeare ! worshipping of Thee ! Richard rises , and addresses the audience and stage . Ye ! who have opened Nature 's teeming page , And given the readings of a long passed age , Blent with the notes of ages more refined  --  Though not with choicer visions of the mind  --  Here rest ! the memory of your touching " Lear , " Your " Fair Ophelia "  --  " Juliet , " ever dear ; Byron 's frail " Werner " in Macready 's vein , Kean !

One comes to me , like her we bury now  --  her voice is sweet , and says , farewell ! there is a warrior , too , a dazzling robe he wore , and ( shuddering ) there is a dark , dark woman , that did frown upon me , and chide dear Bridget , for loving me so well  --  explain these memories to me , dear , dear Walkelyn !

I 'll go to sound the widow queen , for though she hates this twig of Lancaster 's reviving tree , her weeds hang cumbrous round her heart , where wasted power still prays upon its core ; there is a yesty quality within these Woodvilles , that fain would leaven the whole land , and she consume its loaf . Elizabeth remains unto the House of York  --  she is my niece  --  what would the Abbot good of Bermondsey declare if I should wed her Anathema ! But I would whisper in his ear , that my loved Clara , my angel wife ! most strangely died  --  her close attendants but himself and lady queen .

Enter Queen Elizabeth . Queen . Queen Elizabeth What sound like minstrely , was that I heard ? I fear some foolish thought is in your heart , like unto Bridget 's , who can ne'er forget the childish days she passed with that dead boy , some think the Crook-back 's son . Elizabeth . Princess Elizabeth I 've read of such a thing as love , but , gentle mother , you have ta'en good care its accents sweet should never reach my ear  --  no , I am doomed to wed , and patch a crown , so worn and dimmed with blood , no gem is seen ; if my good Uncle will but take the shred , and eke it out with my poor thread of life  --  so runs your plan  --  but are you sure , Richard , the boy , is dead ?

Lord Stanley My friends ! the times call forth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who feigning , boasts of truth , upheld this realm ; dark acts of guilt appal our souls ! and bid us seek another hand to guide ; which , if it hold not that we wish , at least will for a time , suspend our shame . Sir Wm . Stanley . Sir William Stanley A shame that rests upon ourselves , and history will hand to ages down . First Citizen . First Citizen Men differ widely in their view of this  --  what are the crimes that call for vengeance ; princes have died , ' t is true , but who can say that was the hand which sent them to their reckoning ? Second Citizen . Second Citizen Another cries usurper ! while he they would should fill his place , claims no fair title to a vacant throne . Lord Stanley .

Bridget . Bridget ( Weeping . ) I may not say . Richard . Richard Thus , thus I 'm ever answered  --  tell me , dear Bridget , if you know  --  who am I  --  ? Bridget . Bridget I 'm taught to think , the son of one whose hand has doomed my house to death . Richard . Richard Then I am not his son , for I would give my poor , poor life , to bring it once more into being . But you speak riddles to me , Bridget . I was an infant when we parted ; and ten years in a monastery 's shade has given me nothing of the world 's employments . Aye ! I can have no place there , wrapped in the mystery that I am . Bridget . Bridget That world believes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridget My answer , dearest , would betray my promise to my mother , and , perhaps , bring wo , nay death upon our head .

Bridget Elizabeth ! late Queen of England ! Richard . Richard The wife of him whom Richard murdered . Bridget . Bridget ( Covering her face with her veil . ) Curse ! curse him not ! he is  --   --  my uncle  --  Convent bell rings for Vespers , Richard remains in stupor and silence . Farewell ! dear Richard  --  much too long I 've staid ! Richard ! hear you not steps ? Away ! away ! Exit the Lady Bride . Richard .

Earl of Richmond Fly ! fly , ye hours ! which bring me to the day , whose close , I trust will see the Rose of Lancaster once more wreathed round the crown of England ; ' t is true , the Princess , if kind unto my suit , must blend the hated one of York . She yet denies me access to her favor , and courtesy but small she 'll have from me , if I 'm her husband ; she , so reluctantly , my wife ; these tonsured monks , too short time they 'll have to drain the purses of the land , when I am king  --  Enter Earl of Oxford .

Earl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your success , my Lord , the Stanleys are your own , there 's much revolt among the people ; whispers , that many of King Richard 's friends , thus far , desire a change ; I , at the least , doubt not the Field of Bosworth holds a crown for you . Richmond . Earl of Richmond God speed and bless the issue ! And now unto a gentler theme , the fair Elizabeth ; deigns she , at last , to see her minstrel knight ? ha ! ha ! we made but slight escape , the first time that we wooed in song ; fine theme it would have been for Richard 's wit , if we 'd been trapped a singing to our " Lady Love . " Oxford .

Richmond . Earl of Richmond Does the boy live ? Oxford . Earl of Oxford Some say he does , some not , it would seem strange , if living , that his father thus keeps him out of view , but then he knows the hatred of the queen unto the boy ; why so strong none guess . Richmond . Earl of Richmond It had been as well , if this poor boy had ne'er been born . Oxford . Earl of Oxford Should you wish so , my lord , I 'll seek what information I may get upon that head .

Richmond once king , and your fond husband , might set aside my mother 's dark intent , to bury me while living . Elizabeth . Princess Elizabeth Ah ! dearest one ! you reason with hope 's argument ; no doubt the knowledge that poor Richard lives , your mutual love revealed , would only speed the thought of closing you within these walls for ever , and give him to death ; neither the Queen , nor Bermondsey would hesitate at either deed . One only hope remains , the king may conquer in the coming struggle ; but could you , dearest , wed with Richard , son of him , they say , dyed his foul hands with our dear father 's and our brother 's blood ? Lady Bride . Bridget He did it not ; or , if he did , Richard 's no son of his ; so pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother ; no trait of mind or person is King Richard 's .
