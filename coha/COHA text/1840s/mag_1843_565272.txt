txt THOSE were stirring times in old England two hundred years ago . The controversy between Charles I. and the Long Parliament had been submitted to the dire arbitrament of war ; and each of the three kingdoms of the British empire was convulsed with the progress of a bloody revolution . Let us briefly recollect the occasion , the elements , and the progress of that controversy . The ancient feudal system of government in England , had answered a purpose during the middle ages . By a rude balancing of powers , it had secured the barons against the sovereign , and had prevented the crown from becoming absolute , while at the same time it had limited the authority of the barons by making them , to some extent , dependent on the king . It had guarded by charters and prescriptive rights the corporate liberties of cities and boroughs , and had thus encouraged industry and the progress of civilization . It had recognized the church as one great power in the state , a power in a great measure independent of the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops and mitred abbots , of the universities and the clergy , were acknowledged as definitely as those of lay barons or of burgesses . It had accustomed the entire people to the idea of being governed by laws and not by arbitrary power . It had fixed in the popular mind the notion , that laws were to be made by the parliament with the consent of the king , and not by the king without the parliament , and that the laws were of the nature of a compact between the sovereign and his subjects . It had trained the English to regard themselves as a free people , and to glory in their freedom as the great distinction between them and their neighbors of those continental kingdoms , in which the power of the sovereign had swallowed up , in whole or in part , those old Gothic institutions which had once maintained the spirit of liberty . But from the reign of Henry VII , England had been outgrowing her ancient ill-defined system of feudal government . The peerage , once so powerful against the throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wars between the houses of York and Lancaster ; and the policy of the avaricious and unwarlike Henry VII , while it enriched the crown , gave opportunity for industry and the arts of peace to enrich those towns which were the seats of trade , and brought forward those " middling classes , " which , during the long era of feudal violence , had hardly begun to exist . The invention of printing , the revival and expansion of commerce , the discovery of America , were indications of the commencement of a new order of things . In the following reign , the reformation as introduced into England by the monarch-throwing off the old allegiance of the church of England to the church of Rome , transferring all the powers of the pope to the king , abolishing the monastic institutions , and seizing on no small portion of the immense possessions of the clergy-disturbed still farther the old balance of powers in the state , by bringing the bishops and the entire ecclesiastical system into an immediate and absolute dependence on the crown . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so inauspicious in itself to English liberty , England was unavoidably placed in communication with the true reformation which had been commenced // on the continent by Luther and Zuingle , and which was there asserting in the boldest manner , the principle of private judgment and of the supreme and sole authority of the Scriptures , as opposed to the authority of the church ; and the principle of justification by faith , as opposed to justification by the church , by ceremonies and observances , or by any human endeavors . Beside this , the very change which the king made in seizing on the pope 's supremacy , while it was highly acceptable to at least a large portion of the people , as relieving England from a hated dependence on a foreign power , and from great taxes and contributions which had gone to fill the coffers of the pontiff at Rome , or had been expended in the support of idle and often profligate monks-could not but lead on to other changes in the popular mind . The doctrine of the pope 's supremacy being rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a matter of course for the people to inquire , whether other doctrines , once venerable , rested on any better foundation . The Scriptures being translated into the vulgar tongue for the people to read , why were not the people to judge as to the meaning of what they read ? England having become a Protestant kingdom , why should not the people become a Protestant people ? and why should not the church of England be reformed in doctrine and discipline , according to the Scriptural standard , like the churches with which she agreed in protesting against Rome ? All these tendencies towards a progressive and thorough reformation , were increased by the fact , that the personal quarrel between Henry VIII . and Luther , brought the reforming ecclesiastics of England into immediate connection with the divines of Switzerland , rather than with those of Saxony , with Zurich and Geneva , rather than with Wittemberg . Still , the reformation can hardly be considered as having made much progress during the reign of Henry VIII . For though the timid , supple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that place by his diligent and able subserviency to the tyrant 's wishes in respect to his divorce of Catherine , and retaining his mitre by a meaner compliance in respect to the divorce and condemnation of Anne Boleyn  --  and though the heroic Latimer was for a season bishop of Worcester  --  and though by the influence of the Protestant party at court , anxious for their newly acquired church property , and therefore disposed to take away all possibility of a reconciliation with Rome , some preachers of the reformed religion enjoyed an irregular and perilous toleration , the authorized doctrines and ritual of the church suffered no material change , save in the one great point of bringing the clergy to a complete dependence on the king . The actual reformation of the church of England , so far as it was reformed , is to be ascrihed , under God 's providence , to the accident that the immediate successor of Henry VIII . was a boy in his tenth year ; and that those who had the guardianship of his person , and who swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their interest or by their conscience , on the side of a thorough reformation . The king 's supremacy over the church , in the hands of this reforming junto of nobles and bishops , was employed to great effect for six years . Then it was that Latimer , Ridley , Coverdale , Ilooper , Rogers , and the like , obtained not only liberty to preach the gospel , but high places of honor and influence in the ecclesiastical establishment . Then it was that Peter Martyr and Martin Bucer were , by the government , invited into England from Switzerland , and placed in the chairs of theology at // Oxford and Cambridge . Then it was that on account of the popish ignorance and incapacity of the clergy , and as the best substitute for a preaching ministry , the first book of homilies was published to be read in the churches , and a copy deposited with every parish priest . Then it was that the images were ordered to be removed from places of worship ; and the order went forth that every church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it was that the old Latin forms of public worship were collated , revised , expurgated , and translated into English . Then it was that one great and noisome abomination of the ancient or popish Christianity , was swept away by legalizing the marriage of the clergy . Then it was that the reformation of the church was continually regarded , not as a work completed and incapable of advancement , but as a work in progress , to be carried on from one degree of purity to another . These six years of the reign of Edward VI . are the years in which the foundation was laid for whatever of real Protestantism pertains to the church of England as by law established . On the accession of Mary , when the reforming prelates and statesmen found their own engine of the king 's supremacy turned against themselves , it was soon manifest that the measures of the preceding reign had not been ineffectual ; and the three hundred victims , of all ranks , from the aged primate of all England to the simple peasant and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyrs to the reformed faith , " lighted such a candle in England as shall never be put out . " Yet the facility with which almost the entire nation was turned back from the religion of Edward and Cranmer to the religion of Mary and Bonner  --  the pliableness of Parliament to repeal all the reforming laws of the two preceding reigns , and to re-enact those old bloody statutes which brought the martyrs to the stake , showed too plainly how little progress had then been made in that reformation of the people without which all reformation of doctrines and of forms is of no worth . On one point , however , the Queen found her subjects less flexible . The very act repealing all laws against the see of Rome , could not be carried without a proviso that the plunder of the monasteries and bishoprics , which Henry had so profusely distributed among his courtiers , and by which he had made the reformation so acceptable to them , should remain undisturbed with those who then possessed it . The Queen indeed gave back all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and testified her zeal by repairing old monasteries and erecting new ones ; but when it was proposed in Parliament that the abbey lands should be restored by law to the uses from which they had been alienated , the English temper was up in a moment ; and even in that obsequious assembly there were those who significantly laid their hands on their swords , and said they knew how to defend their own property . Had the Queen , or rather had the Pope her master , been wise enough to abandon the claim on the alienated property of the church , and to confirm that property to the actual possessors , trusting to the power of superstition and of priestcraft to make up all losses , the cruelties which have gained for Mary so unhappy a preiiminence in English history , would have been far more effectual toward suppressing the Protestant party . But while the alienation remained unsanctioned by the Pope , all that property , amounting to perhaps a fifth part of the rental of the kingdom , was a " vested interest " against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reformation gave to the tenure of so // large an amount of property , together with the personal unpopularity of Mary , gloomy , bigoted , austere , better qualified for an abbess than a queen , which , more than any general conviction of the truth of the reformed doctrine , made the accession of Elizabeth so acceptable to the majority of the nation . Elizabeth 's title to the throne being exclusively Protestant , and depending on an act of Parliament empowering her father to settle the succession by his will , she could not but adopt the Protestant policy , especially as in the person of her cousin Mary of Scotland there was a Popish pretender to the crown . Accordingly , in a few months , the laws relating to the ecclesiastical establishment were restored nearly as they stood at the death of Edward VI . The great difference was not that in a few things the service book was made less exceptionable to the adherents of the old superstition ; nor was it that the taste of the " head of the church " affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference lay rather in that pregnant fact , that the reformation as Edward left it was a reformation in full progress , a reformation carried as far as the exigencies of those times would allow , and to be carried farther when the times should be more propitious ; whereas the reformation as restored by Elizabeth was a reformation already completed , a reformation sealed and hallowed by the blood of the martyrs , and never to be called in question without the guilt , at least of " temerity . " From that time the church of England has been , in the estimation of all her true disciples , not infallible , for that would not be Protestant , but alalways and perfectly in the right ,  - -  theoretically fallible , but in fact never erring ,  --  a church " without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. ** In the circumstances and method of the English reformation , we see the elements of that strife in relation to religious affairs , which agitated England from the days of Elizabeth to the revolution of 1688 . On the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , far more than the aristocracy , the great support and bulwark of the throne ; its patronage being , for the most part , directly or indirectly at the king 's disposal ; its bishop barons , with their power over the inferior clergy , and with their votes in the house of lords , being his creatures ; and all the highest honors of the national church , with whatever influence such honors can have on opinion or action , being absolutely at his disposal . On the other hand , there was among the people , and had been from the days of Wycliffe , a leaven of that true Protestantism which bids every man read the Scrip . tures for himself , and teaches every man that he is to be saved , not by the mediation of the church or of its priesthood , but by the grace of God in Christ freely pardoning his sin and forming his soul anew . To this remnant of Lollardism , and to the influence which Wycliffe and his followers had left upon the popular mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days of Edward , gave impulse and development . Thus while the church , considered as a political institution , was reformed into so complete a dependence on the king , a reformation of another kind was going on among the people . New spiritual ideas-ideas which are the germ of popular liberty and of boundless activity and improvement , began to spread rapidly . Especially in the reign of Edward VI , when Bucer at Cambridge , and Peter Martyr at Oxford , were the authorized teachers of theology , forming the opinions and character of the young clergy-an arrangement not unlike what might he seen now in England if Merle D'Aubign6 were placed at the head of theological instruction in one of those universities , and // 254 Two Hundred Years ago in England . Tholuck or Neander in the otherthe principles of a true and thorough reformation took root in the universities ; and thence were propagated , as the men educated under such an influence went abroad to their various employments in church or state . The towns , essentially republican in their constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new opinions . The two reformations  --  the one proceeding from the king , and the other proceeding from the people were for a while prevented from coming into active collision , by the presence of an enemy equally dreaded by each . Yet even in the reign of Edward VI , there was an omen of a coming controversy when the excellent Ilooper refused to be consecrated bishop in the " Aaronical habits , " as they were styled , and was consequently imprisoned till he consented to a compromise , and accordingly made his appearance in his prelatical character " like a new player on the stage , " his upper garment a long scarlet chimere down to the feet , and under that a white linen rochet " that covered all his shoulders , and a four-square cap upon his head . " The disgust which Ilooper , with his thoroughly Protestant tastes , must have felt in being compelled to make this mountebank appearance even once or twice , and the sympathy which all of his way of thinking must have felt with him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have shown to wise men what was to be expected when the reformation should be less in danger from any dissension among the enemies of Rome . In the reign of Mary , " the troubles at Frankfort , " where a little congregation of fugitives from England had adopted , instead of the book of common prayer , modes of worship more in accordance with the usages of the Protestants around them , till new comers made a schism among them by insisting on the prayer-book as the very thing for which their brethren in England were then suffering martyrdom , were a demonstration of the opposing tendencies which needed only time for growth , and opportunity for development , to agitate all England . Of the eight hundred fugitives , lay and clerical , who during that bloody reign found refuge in Geneva , and in other cities where the reformation after the Swiss model had prevailed , only a few came home without the earnest desire of seeing the ecclesiastical order of their native country carried back , much farther than Edward 's counselors had ventured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doomed under Elizabeth , had no tendency to make them satisfied , and did little to prevent their views from spreading among the most religious portion of the people . The Puritans began to be a distinct party as soon as the exiles returned . The supreme head of the church of England , Queen Elizabeth , was determined that all the forms and circumstances of worship throughout the kingdom , should be exactly according to her ideas of dignity and decorum . The prayers prepared and set forth in the service book , and no others , were to be offered in all churches . The clergy , according to their degrees and functions , were not only to be distinguished by their dress , like the soldiers and officers of a military establishment , but were to wear the same vestments which had been worn by the popish clergy of old , and which in the popular mind were inseparably associated with the old superstition . The communion table in every church was to stand , not as might please the taste of the congregation , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had directed . Several of the bishops were at first much inclined to Puritan opinions , or at least to a reasonable and Christian moderation . Desiring to see // the people instructed and made better by the preaching of the Gospel , they were slow in adopting those measures which tended to perpetuate the reign of popular ignorance by silencing the most intelligent and conscientious , as well as the most zealous and popular of the preaching clergy . Could those bishops have exercised , at that time , their own judgment , many of the objectionable ceremonies and vestments would have been dispensed with . But the queen was inflexihle , and her power over the church as its head brought the bishops , after a while , to a zeal for " the ceremonies and the habits " to which some of them , at the beginning , were strangers . The great personal popularity of Elizabeth as a sovereign , the energy of her administration in the hands of such statesmen as Cecil and Burleigh , the eclat attendant on the repulse of the Spanish invasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established forms of the English constitution as it then was , enabled her to carry her people along with her in what she did , and in what she refused to do for ecclesiastical reformation . Thus under her long reign , the religious differences among her Protestant subjects , though continually becoming deeper and more ominous , never assumed such a form as to di turb the peace or check the prosperity of the kingdom . No equal period since the Norman conquest , had been more brilliant or more prosperous . But that very prosperity was preparing the way for revolutions . The aristocracy , enriched by the spoils of the suppressed monastic institu* tions , were gradually recovering something of their ancient weight in the nation . Commerce and the arts were giving increased importance to the towns . The middling class between the sluggish peasantry and the proud nobility-that great class embodying so much of indus try , skill , enterprise , and so rapidly acquiring both knowledge and wealth , was beginning gradually to feel its strength . A philosophic and enlightened mind might have foreseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long be re-adjusted , either gradually or suddenly , either peacefully or violently . When James I. came to the throne , the constitution of the church of England had been arranged long enough to produce its legitimate results . The bishops and other dig . nitaries had learned their depend . ence on the sovereign , and generally were no longer tainted with any suspicion of Puritanism . Strange would it have been , if a church which had made them peers of the realm , and had placed their order nearest to the throne , and which gave them pomp , equipage , revenues and palaces , such as princes might envy , had seemed to them to require farther reformation . The church , as an establishment , had become the ally of the court . And thus , if for no other reason , it came to pass that the Parliament , and especially the house of commons , representing the public sentiment of the towns and of those smaller landholders who had little connection with the court , naturally favored the Puritan demand for a farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of commons had repeatedly manifested a disposition to interfere with the affairs of the church , much farther than agreed with the Queen 's inclinations . And when James , in his blustering and insolent way , began to promulgate and to put in practice his preposterous claim of a divine right to govern with absolute power , a right superior to all laws and inalienable by any compact , and it grew evident to all thoughtful men that a great struggle for the ancient liberties of England was approaching , and that the royal prerogative which was so fast overshadowing // the laws must be bounded by new and more effectual limitations , the Puritans who demanded a reform in the church , and the patriotic party who withstood the usurpations of the court , became more and more identified . There is a connection , deeper than Cranmer or Jewel ever suspected , between Romish forms and institutions on the one hand , and Romish doctrine on the other . In the latter part of the reign of James , when the influence of Laud began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be industriously obscured and discountenanced ; and a doctrine more consonant with the idea of a priesthood and of justification by some other process , besides a simple and undivided reliance on Christ 's intercession , became the doctrine of the church as allied with the court . From this time , popish innovations began to be a distinct theme of complaint on the part of the Puritans . And in proportion as men were convinced , that under the existing system the doctrine of the church was going back , not only from the mark to which Latimer and Ridley attained , but even from the standard of the Elizabethan reformation , they naturally reasoned about the church , as they were already reasoning unconsciously about the state , that some new reform was needed ; men , who sincerely believed and loved the Gospel , the doctrine of salvation by the grace of God , could not but feel that adequate security against a return of the whole body of popish doctrines , must be found in some new and more thorough reformation . And then , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and to blend all voices of dissatisfaction against usurpation in the state or superstition in the church , into one swelling chorus of complaint and threatening , the court , and the church as swayed by the court , began to stigmatize with the name of Puritans , not only those who were zealous against the habits ' and the ceremonies , but all who opposed the introduction of Arminianism , all who desired to see the Lord 's day kept holy , all who were dissatisfied with an ignorant and scandalous clergy , and all who were alarmed at the outrageous principles on which the government of the kingdom was conducted . The reformation in Scotland had been from the beginning a movement of the people . It was an insurrection and revolution . There , as in England , the reforming nobles had grasped in one way and another a great portion of the wealth , with which the priestcraft of the clergy and the superstition of the laity had been for ages enriching the church . Not only had the inonasteries been dissolved , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops reduced to mere nullities , though the office had not yet been formally abolished by law . Scotland was in effect , though not in form , a Presbyterian kingdom , from the moment in which the reformation triumphed there . And when the kings of Scotland became by inheritance possessors of the throne of England , the Scotch , in their jealousy lest their country might become a mere dependency of the greater and more powerful kingdom , were more zealous than ever for their own ecclesiastical institutions as distinguished from the loftier hierarchy and the more or . nate worship of the English church . The measures of James and of his son and successor , Charles I , both of whom were bent on gradually carrying the Scotch reformation backward into a conformity with England , irritated the religious sympathies of the northern kingdom , and made not only the enlightened and devout , but the masses , cling to their particular type of Protestantism , as the badge and the very // essence of their nationality . The restoration of the bishops , after their cifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil dignities , was particularly offensive to the nobility and to the people . It seems like a judicial infatuation , that in such a state of things , Charles , even under the advice of so narrow and short-sighted a mind as Laud , should venture on the mad enterprise of reinstating in the church of Scotland , the system of doctrine , worship and government , which in the dialect of Oxford is now called " Catholicity . " From the beginning of his reign , this illtaught and ill-advised king had maintained a constant quarrel with his English subjects . Having found successive Parliaments sternly bent on the redress of grievances , and reluctant to afford supplies without some security for a better administration of the laws and for a better protection of the rights of Englishmen , he had undertaken to reign without Parliaments ; and for twelve years he had governed in absolute defiance of the ancient constitution of the realm . During those twelve years , it seemed likely that the Teutonic liberties of England would go the same way with those of France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some four thousand Englishmen emigrated to America , and planted here a new and fairer England than that which they left behind them . During those twelve years it was , that such patriots as Sir John Eliot , were wearing out their weary lives in prison ; and such as J-lampden appealed in vain to servile judges , the mere minions of the crown . The only hope for England was , that some occasion might arise which should make the calling of a Parliament a matter of inevitable necessity . At such a crisis , Laud and his master ran the risk of an experiment on the jealousy and turbulence of the Scottish nation . A service-hook was prepared , with a few variations from that of England , some of which were calculated to make it more obnoxious to Protestant minds ; and without consulting either the Parliament of the kingdom , or the general assembly , or any of the synods of the kirk , the king attempted to introduce it simply by his absolute authority . Sunday , the 23d of July , 1637 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new liturgy in all the churches in Scotland . On that day , an immense concourse appear . ed at St. Giles 's church in Edinburgh , where archbishops , bishops , and high officers of the kingdom , were to aid by their presence in securing for the new book a favorable reception . The dean began his reading . Instantly there arose among the populace that thronged the old cathedral , such a noise of clapping , cursing , and crying , that nothing else could be heard . The bishop of Edinburgh ascended the pulpit to appease the tumult , " whom , " says Fuller in his quaint way , " a stool aimed to be thrown at him had killed , if not diverted by one present , so that the same book had occasioned his death and prescribed the form of his burial . " That stool , we may say , in its parabolic flight , took off the heads of Strafford , Laud , and Charles . It was the signal-shot of what Oxford politicians in this country , as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immediately all Scotland was in commotion . The old " NATiONAL COVENANT " against popery , which had been adopted in 1581 by King James and his court , and in 1590 , by the nation generally , was revised and enlarged to ad apt it to the times , and was enthusiastically sworn to by all classes of people . This covenant became a bond of union , a test of partisanship , an oath of allegiance to the liberties of the // kingdom and to the Presbyterian reformation . In the progress of the disturbances , the king was induced to call a general assembly of the kirk  --  a body which for many years had not been permitted to convene . The assembly , notwithstanding the efforts of the government , and of the bishops with their dwindling party , was made up of covenanters ; and after seven days , the king 's commissioner attempted to dissolve it . But it would not be dissolved . It went on , annulling , rescinding , renouncing , reforming , with a high hand , till not a vestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James and Charles had been so sedulously rearing , and of which the new liturgy was to have been the topstone . Nothing remained but war . The king , in the exercise of the despotic power which he had assumed , found means to raise an army in Engla 1d , with which to subdue his unmanageable subjects in Scotland . The Scotch , on the other hand , raised an army in the name of the king and covenant , to defend the kingdom against English invaders . Should the king succeed in the subjugation of Scotland by an English army , England itself would thenceforward be held in more complete subjection . On the border the two armies came near enough to look each other in the face ; whereupon the king , perceiving no doubt that his army could hardly be relied on , suddenly agreed to a pacification , and both armies were disbanded . But as the Scotch had no intention of surrendering their religion or their liberty , so the king had no intention of giving up his designs . In a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was renewed ; and so necessary was the subjugation of the covenanters deemed , and so much confidence had the king and court in Strafford 's power of overawing and swaying a representative assembly , that it was resolved to try once more the temper of an English Parliament . A Parliament was called . Its tables were immediately covered with petitions for the redress of grievances in church and in state . it began with the consideration of grievances . The king importuned the commons to begin with a grant of taxes , and to leave the grievances to him ; and because the Parliament was inflexible , it was suddenly dissolved , before a single act had been passed . Again the most desperate efforts were made , and all sorts of arbitrary and illegal measures were adbpted , to raise money and an army for carrying on the war against Scotland . The Scotch , knowing that the great body of the English nation was on their side , did not wai.t to be invaded , but passed the Tweed with their army , and suddenly found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this prosperous state of their affairs , they renewed their addresses to the king , and one point of their petition was , that a free Parliament might be called in England , to aid in the establishment of a lasting peace . The king , thus humbled and defeated , and at the same time assailed with clamorous petitions from all quarters , was compelled to agree to an arrangement by which an English Parliament was immediately to be summoned ; commissioners from Scotland were to proceed to London for the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty ; the Scotch army , remaining at Newcastle , was to receive eight hundred and fifty pounds a day for its support ; and neither that army nor the king 's , was to be disbanded , till the treaty should be concluded . Accordingly , on the third day of November , 1640 , the Parliament , memorable in history as " the Long Parliament , " was assembled to aid in the work of restoring and confirming peace between the two kingdoms . // No man could expect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the most strenuous endeavors to reform the constitution , hy limiting the royal prerogative which recent usurpations had greatly extended , and hy ohtaining such securities for the faithful administration of the government , as might make the Magna Charta no longer a dead letter . The Scotch covenanters ' army , quartered at Newcastle , was a security , that till the conclusion of the treaty between the kingdoms , this Parliament would not he subjec t to that sudden dissolution which had arrested the endeavors of so many preceding Parliaments . Thus the Scotch felt , that England owed to them all its hopes of liberty and reformation . Their commissioners for the treaty could not hut he admitted to the councils of the parliamentary leaders . Their manner of proceeding , their covenant , their assembly , their form of ecclesiastical order , the persons of their principal men , were regarded with a sort of grateful complacency . Their preachers , who came to London with the commissioners , and who performed the services of the Scotch kirk every Lord 's day at St. Antholin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to a rule of international courtesy-were heard with enthusiastic admiration . From that time the Scotch were excited with the idea of bringing the English church to a conformity with their own ; and no one influence on the proceedings of Parliament was more inauspicious to the success of their endeavors in behalf of English liberty , than the necessity of not offending the spirit which reigned in the covenanting realm of Scotland . Improving the advantage which the dilatory progress of the treaty afforded them , the Parliament proceeded to a series of reforming enactments , which if they had been carried into effect in good faith on the part of the executive , would have made the constitution of England very much what it now is in respect to the securities which it creates for justice and liberty . Had the king understood his actual position , and submitted to it ,  --  could he have seen that his attempt to change the constitution and to make himself absolute , had failed forever , and that the only safe policy was to concur heartily in such changes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indemnity for the past , it would not have been difficult to satisfy the expectations of the nation . But it soon became manifest to the Parliament , that in dealing with the king , they were dealing with one who was capable of any treachery ; and that nothing could be safely trusted to his fidelity . Funds for the great expense incurred during the progress of the slow treaty with the Scotch , were obtained in London on the credit of the Parliament . But what if this Parliament should be suddenly dissolved as preceding Parliaments had been ? As the court and the Parliament became more openly hostile to each other , and the probability of an early dissolution was increased , it was found that the credit of the Parliament was regarded as an inadequate security for new loans ; and the king , in a fatal day , fatal for himself and for his subjects , was induced to give his assent to a bill hastily carried through both houses , by which he divested himself of the power of dissolving that Parliament without its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedying a present inconvenience , he consented to make that Parliament perpetual . Thenceforward , the house of commons instead of being merely a representative body , was a perpetual corporation , admitted by the king , under all the forms of law , to a partnership in the sovereignty . Of a body of men possessed of such powers , // and entrenched in so complete an independence both of the king and of their several constituencies , what could be expected but that they would regard themselves as called to the great work of remodeling at their leisure , and to their own complete satisfaction , the constitution of the kingdom ? In reforming the government , and especially in limiting the abused prerogative of the sovereign , one of the first things to be thought of was the ecclesiastical constitution . The church was in effect a great dependency of the crown , quite as much so as the army or the navy ; and as things then were , far more likely than either to answer the purposes of an arbitrary and usurping sovereign . The multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the church , which were involved in such an arrangement , had become a matter of sad experience . During those twelve years of systematic and settled usurpation , the king 's prime minister in England was William Laud , at the beginning of the period bishop of London , and at the close archbishop of Canterbury . His successor in the see of London sustained , in addition to the spiritual superintendence of that great diocese , whatever secular cares were involved in a diligent and able administration of the office of lord high treasurer of England . Nearly all the bishops , and the great majority of the ten thousand clergymen of the establishment , had been found to be the willing tools of the usurping king , on the principle that the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master 's crib . When the king was resorting to illegal methods of raising money , the clergy were employed to preach to the people his right , by God 's appointment , to the property of the subject . Thus for example , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - not the laws of the land made according to the constitutionbut " if PRINCES commanded any thing which subjects might not perform , because it is against the laws of God or of nature , or impossible , yet subjects are bound to undergo the punishment , without resisting , or railing , or reviling , and so to yield a passive obedience where they can not yield an active one . " Another ( Manwaring ) used such language as this , " The king is not bound to observe the laws of the realm concerning the subject 's rights and liberties ; but his royal will and pleasure in imposing taxes , without consent of Parliament , doth oblige the subject 's conscience on pain of damnation . Those who refuse obedience transgress the laws of God , insult the king 's supreme authority , and are guilty of impiety , disloyalty and rebellion . The authority of both houses of Parliament , is not necessary for the raising of aids and subsidies , as not suitable to the exigencies of the state . " This bold doctrine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the house of lords in that Parliament , as the highest judicature of the realm , had passed sentence upon the author , and condemned him to fine and imprisonment , disabling him from preaching at court and from holding any ecclesiastical or secular preferment , he was not only pardoned by the king as soon as the Parliament had been dissolved , but he and others who had signalized themselves in the same way , were selected to receive from the government distinguished tokens of regard . Such were the doctrines of the court ; and such might be expected to be the doctrines of the church so long as the church should continue to be a dependency of the crown . Accordingly the whole enginery of the ecclesiastical establishment was brought to hear in the great enterprise of subverting all the limits of the monarchy , and of making the king 's power absolute . Of the canons which under the advice of Laud , // and with corrections from his pen , were attempted to be imposed upon the church of Scotland , the first pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogative of the king not to be equal with that of the Jewish kings . And in 1640 , just before the emergency which occasioned the Long Parliament , a convocation of the clergy of all England , in a session the lawfulness of which was , at the best , very questionable , adopted a body of canons additional to those previously established by law , the first of which laid down a doctrine " concerning the regal power " which deserves to be distinctly commemorated , as showing to what a depth of political baseness the clergy had been brought by the dependence of the church on the king . The canon ordains and decrees that " every parson , vicar , curate , or preacher , " shall once every quarter publicly read on Sunday in the place where he serves , " the following explanation of the regal power : That the most high and sacred order of kings is of DiVINE RIGHT , being the ordinance of God himself , founded in the prime laws of nature and revelation , by which the supreme power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That they have the care of God 's church , and the power of calling and dissolving councils both national and provincial : That for any persons to set up in the king 's realms an independent coercive power , either papal or popular , is treasonable against God and the king ; and for subjects to bear arms against their king , either offensive or defensive , UPON ANY PRETENSE WHATSOEVER , is at least to resist the powers ordained of God ; and though they do not invade , but only resist , St. Paul says they shall receive damnation : And though tribute and custom , aid and subsidy be due to the king by the law of God , nature and nations , yet subjects have a right and property in their goods and estates ; and these two are so far from crossing one another , that they mutually go together for the honorable and comfortable support of both . " That is , in fewer words , though the king by the law of God , nature and nations , has a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left of their goods and estates after the king has taken what he judges to be necessary for the uses of government . Thus in the controversy between a usurping king and a people who for ages had gloried in the idea of their freedom in the controversy whether the king 's power was absolute and the immediate gift of God to him , or a power circumscribed by the laws of the land , and bounded by the existence of coordinate powers-in the controversy whether the king had a right to " tribute and custom , aid and subsidy , " without a grant from Parliament , the church , which even in the darkest ages of popery had been to an honorable extent the antagonist of tyrants and the friend of the masses , deserted the cause of right and law and liberty , and became the handmaid of royal usurpation . Who can wonder that the patriotic party were bent on some searching and thorough reformation of the ecclesiastical establishment ? It is common with a certain class of writers , to speak of the Long Parliament as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of episcopacy , and determined to introduce into England the same system which was then so triumphant in Scotland . could be farther from the truth . The great bo dy of the house of commons were undoubtedly Puritans , as the word was then used by the court party ,  - -  that is , they were opposed to archbishop Laud 's opinions and practices ; but that they came together with a preconceived determination to introduce presbyterianism , there is no evidence . On the contrary , a // few days after the commencement of the session , the commons passed an order that none should sit in their house but such as should receive the communion according to the usage of the church of England . And having observed a day of fasting , nil the members on tlv. next Lord 's day received the sacrament in Westminster abbey at the hands of bishop Williams , dean of that church . They felt that they were entering on a great and serious business ; and they chose to begin their work as religious men , and with such acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a body . If we observe the manner and the successive stages of their proceedings in relation to ecclesiastical affairs , we shall find additional reasons for rejecting the idea that they were presbyterians . Among the proceedings of the first business day of the session , an arrangement was made that on one day in each week the house should sit as a " grand committee for religion . " A few days afterward , this grand committee named a sub-committee of forty , subsequently increased to eighty , " to inquire into the causes of the great scarcity of preaching ministers , and to consider of a way for removing scandalous ministers , and putting others into their places . " The next thing done in relation to the church , was the adoption of a series of resolutions respecting the obnoxious canons framed by the late convocation . It was unanimously voted that the clergy in convocation or synod had no power to make any enactments which should be binding on laity or clergy without being ratified by act of Parliament ; and it was resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fundamental laws and statutes of the realm , to the rights of Parliament , and to the property and liberty of the subject . Immediately afterward it was resol ved to impeach Laud as the author and imposer of those canons , while at the same time the Scotch commissioners preferred their complaint against him as one of the " incendiaries " or authors of the war between the two kingdoms . Meanwhile , the known determination of the Parliament to enter upon some thorough ecclesiastical reform , had opened the door for the freest and boldest discussion , in the city and throughout the country . The press having been emancipated from the strict censorship which Laud had maintained over it , there was immediately a running fire of pamphlets from all sorts of writers , for and against the established system . The good Bishop Flail , and those five Puritan clergymen whose initials made up the word Smectymnuus , were carrying on their memorable controversy  --  a controversy the more memorable , inasmuch as John Milton came to the aid of the Puritan divines , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in all that gorgeousness of imagination and of diction , which makes his ephemeral prose writings hardly less interesting than his most elaborate poems . But the discussion was not confined to the press . The pulpits resounded with it . Every place where intelligent men met each other , was a place for inquiry and debate on the great question of the day . It was in the expectation of such a discussion , that the Scotch commissioners , one of whom , Alexander Henderson , was a preacher , the John Knox of his day-brought with them in the capacity of chaplains , three of the ablest champions of Presbyterianism which their country could afford . One of these , Robert Baillie , afterwards principal of the University of Glasgow , left to posterity , in the shape of a voluminous series of letters to his presbytery , to his wife , and to his friends , one of the liveliest descriptions now extant , of that age of // revolution . In a letter to his wife , dated Newcastle , November 5 , 1640 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " At our presbytery , after sermon , both our noblemen and ministers in one voice thought meet , that not only Mr. Alexander Henderson , but also Mr. Robert Blair , Mr. George Gillespie , and I , should all three , for divers ends , go to London : Mr. R. Blair , to satisfy the minds of many in England , who love the way of New England better than that of presbyteries used in our church ; I , for convincing of that prevalent faction , Laud 's party , against which I have written ; Mr. Gillespie , for the crying down of the English ceremonies , for which he has written ; and all four to preach by turns to our commissioners . " In the first letter after their arrival in London , he says , " On Thursday last November 19 was here a fast . Mr. Blair and I preached to our commissioners at home ; for we had no clothes for outgoing . A predicament somewhat like that in which Mr. Dickens found himself , on the first Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty than ever here was heard of . Episcopacy itself beginning to be cried down , and a covenant cried up , and the liturgy to be scorned . The town of London and a world of men , minds to present a petition , which I have seen , for the abolition of bishops , deans , and all their appurtenances . " Writing to the presbytery , December 2 , he says , " The courage of this people grows daily , and the number not only of people but of preachers , who are for rooting out of Episcopacy . All are for bringing them bishops very low ; but who will not root them clean away are not respected . " In the same letter he builds much on the hope , that Lords Say and Brook , and some leading men in the house of commons , who were known to have some sympathies with those who had separated from the church of England , and who were therefore inclined towards congregationalism , would give their aid in the effort to abolish the office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city of London , praying for the abolition of the episcopal system , " root and branch , " and thence called the root and branch petition , was presented to Parliament ; and Baillie , writing to his presbytery , the next day , says , " Yesterday , a world of honest citizens in their best apparel , in a very modest way , went to the house of commons , and sent in two aldermen with their petition , subscribed , as we hear , by fifteen thousand hands , for removing episcopacy , the service-book , and other such scandals out of their church . It was well received . " He adds , that " sundry petitions of several shires , to every one whereof some thousands of hands are put , will be given in against episcopacy . " In another part of the same letter , he speaks of the convocation of the clergy which was then sitting twice a week , but doing nothing , for want of a commission from the king , empowering it to transact business . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them well minded for removing of episcopacy , and many more for paring of bishops ' nails , and arms too . " " The less good they intend , the better , " so men of a thorough partisan spirit always reason , " the more easily they will be got overthrown . " And again he expresses his fears , " that the separatists are like to be some help to hold up the bishops through their impertinency . " In his Scotch presbyterian acrimony , he knew not how to trust those who were so far in advance of their age , as not to believe in national churches . This may suffice to show , how , from the beginning of this Long Parliament , the expectations which men had of some thorough reform // in church and state , occasioned free and bold discussion in all quarters . The odium which the great ecclesiastical dignitaries had incurred , in consequence of their dependence on the king and their subserviency to his designs , created a popular prepossession against episcopacy itself . Tbe success of presbyterianism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had there shown itself capable of the most energetic and rapid achievements ; and nothing was more natural , than to suppose that the same system might be equally triumphant in England . The sudden popularity of the Scotch among the English , and the adroit intermeddling of the commissioners from Scotland and their chaplains , gave a great impulse to the preshyterian party . Yet , if Baxter 's testimony may be received  --  and what witness can be more worthy of credit , especially on such a question ? - the great body of the English Puritans had not made up their minds , long after this time , in favor of presbyterianism , as preferable to some reformed and primitive system of episcopacy . Even the authors of Smectymnuus , while they denied that the superiority of bishops to other ministers was by any Divine law , were at that time so far from the Scotch temper , that they were willing to petition Parliament , " that if episcopacy be retained in the church , it may be reduced to its primitive simplicity . " Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aimed rather against English episcopacy in the concrete , than against episcopacy in the abstract ; - it spoke of " the government of archbishops , lord bishops , deans , and archdeacons , " and its prayer was , " that the said government with all its dependencies , roots and branches , might be abolished , " and that " the government according to God 's word " might be established . In Parliament , the London , or " root and branch " petition , remained for some time on the table , no party being quite ready to begin the discussion . Meanwhile , another petition was in preparation , which expressed the wishes of the body of the Puritan clergy who had not yet been expelled from the establishment . This , which was called the ministers ' petition , was presented to the house of commons on the 23d of January , 1641 , signed by seven hundred beneficed clergymen . It asked distinctly not for the abolition of episcopacy , but for the reformation of certain corruptions and abuses in the system as then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things complained of in detail , filling , as Baillie says , twenty sheets of paper . Other petitions came in from all parts of the country , some for episcopacy , others against it . But , so far was presbyterianism , in the Scotch sense of the word , from being the thing demanded by the reforming party , those who petitioned against episcopacy had no other platform agreed upon among themselves ; and this notorious fact was forcibly objected against them in the counter petitions . Baillie appears to have been a watchful , but by no means a cool ohservcr of the progress of events . His passionate , Scotch prejudices often led him to presume that what was done for Puritanism , and was not done for the separatists , was of course designed to promote the identical thing for which he and his colleagues were so industriously laboring . He notices the ministers ' petition , while it was " posting through the land for hands to make it stark , " and he says that by the time it returns , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole number , will be ready , against the bishops ' corruptions in doctrine , discipline , life and all . " And flattered by the idea that his book against Laud  --  a work which he re // garded with the same amusing affection with which the good vicar of Wakefield regarded his own famous treatise against deuterogamyhad " given good help " to the framing of that remonstrance , he thinks that when the remonstrance is presented to Parliament , " the root of episcopacy will be assaulted with the strongest blast it ever felt in England . " He goes on to say that " the primate of Ireland " - archbishop Usher , one of the greatest and best men of that age , whose views were as large and his feelings as free and catholic as those of the illustrious Irish archbishop of our day- " and a great faction with him , will be for a limited good , " that is , a " reduced episcopacy , " an episcopacy with small dioceses and without lord bishops ; but he " trusts they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The far greatest part , " he says , " are for our discipline for all the considerable parts of it ; they will draw up a model of their own , with our advice , to be considered upon by commissioners of the church , and others appointed by Parliament , and ( if God shall bless this land ) by these commissioners to be settled in every congregation at this extraordinary time , till afterward the church being constitute , a general assembly may be called to perfect it . " flow far this scheming Scot misunderstood , at that time , the designs of those who swayed the Parliament , he himself was afterwards a witness . On the same day on which the ministers ' petition was presented to Parliament , it so happened that the king summoned the two houses to meet him at Whitehall , and delivered them a speech or lecture on various matters in their proceedings , giving them to understand what he would consent to , and what he would reject if enacted by them . Among other things which he discoursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so many petitions had been presented . He charged the petitioners with malice ; and as to the proposed reduction of episcopacy by taking away temporal power from the bishops , he declared his determination " not to consent that their votes in Parliament should be taken away ; for , " said he , " in all the times of my predecessors , since the conquest and before , they have enjoyed it as one of the fundamental constitutions of the kingdom . " This speech was one of those many ill advised movements on the part of the king , which had no effect but to accelerate the approach of revolution . Baillie says of it , " This declaration will do no evil . Many who inclined to keep bishops being put out of state and brought low , while they see they must continue lords of Parliament , will join themselves more heartily to those who will essay to draw up their roots . " On the next business day , the house of commons showed how little they regarded the king 's impertinent interference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' petition with the remonstrance accompanying , and the petition from the country for church reformation . The London petition was afterward assigned to be considered at the same time . The slowness of the proceedings shows something like a reluctance to grapple with a subject in respect to which none could foresee the result , and few perhaps were settled in opinion . On the 6th of February , Baillie says to his wife , " About them the bishops we are all in perplexity . We trust God will put them down , but the difficulty to get all the tapouns of their roots pulled up , is yet insuperable by the arm of man . " " The ministers ' remonstrance these days by-gone bath been read in the house by parts , for it is long . They desire not an answer in haste , for fear their friends in the house be not strong enough to pull up that old oak , but many tears here are weekly sown for that // end . " " We pray , preach and print against them the bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women thronging in to our sermons . " On the 9th of February , after a sharp debate , in which some who afterward sided with the king insisted that the root and branch petition should be cast out without a hearing , all the petitions were referred to a large committee , who were " to prepare heads out of these petitions for the consideration of the house , " but were not to meddle with the question about removing the office of bishop ; " the house reserving to itself the main point of episcopacy , to take it into their consideration in due time . " " Before this committee , every other day , " says Baillie , " some eight or ten of the remonstrants appear . Dr. Burgess afterward one of the assessors or vice presidents of the Westminster Assembly commonly is their mouth . We suspected him as too much episcopal , and wished he had not been of the number , but he has such a hand among the ministry and others , that it was not thought meet to discard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repent of our suspicions . The passages of the remonstrance that have yet been called for , he has cleared to the full contentment of all the committee , except Mr. Selden the avowed proctor for the bishops . How this matter will go the Lord knows . All are for the erecting of a kind of presbytery , and for bringing down the bishops in all things spiritual and temporal , so low as can be with any subsistence ; but their utter abolition , which is the only aim of the most godly , ah ! Baillie , " the most godly " are those that agree best with thee ! is the knot of the question ; we must have it cut by the axe of prayer . " After this protracted hearing of the petitioners , the committee reported to the house three heads of matter to be considered ,  --  the secular employments of the clergy ; the sole power of the bishops in ecclesiastical affairs , and particularly in ordinations and church censures ; and the large revenues of deans and chapters of cathedrals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much debate ensued . On the 10th of March , it was resolved that the legislative and judicial power of bishops in the house of peers , is a great hindrance to the discharge of their spiritual function , prejudicial to the commonxvealth , and fit to be taken away by a bill . The next day , a similar resolution was adopted in regard to bishops or other clergymen being justices of the peace or having judicial power in any secular court , thus determining to sweep them out of the star chamber . Eleven days later the same condemnation was voted against their being employed as privy counselors , or in any temporal office . Such were the results of consideration and discussion on the first head reported by the committee . For more than a month after the date of the last named resolution , both houses were chiefly occupied with the trial and attainder of the Earl of Strafford . Yet during that period , the three resolutions concerning the secular employments of the clergy were put into the form of a bill , which was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was sent up to the lords on the first of May . This most reasonable and moderate measure of reform , the want of which secularizes and dishonors the church of England at this hour , was rejected in the house of lords . So much hope was there , of any substantial improvement with the consent of the court prelates and their party . The majority of the lords expressed by resolution their willingness to pass every part of the bill excepting that part which was to take away // the bishops ' votes in Parliament . On this point the commons insisted , and the lords refused to recede , and so the bill was lost . This sealed the fate of the bishops . It became more apparent than ever , that the prelacy on which their consciences were fixed was their secular pomp and power , and not merely their spiritual rank as a distinct order of Christ 's ministers . As soon as this determination of the lords was ascertained , a bill was introduced into the house of commons for the abolishing and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their offices , out of the church of England . The mover of this bill said on presenting it to the speaker , " I never was for ruin , as long as there was any hopes of reforming , and I now profess that if those hopes revive and prosper , I will divide my sense upon this bill , and yield my shoulders to underprop the primitive , lawful and just episcopacy . " Scotch presbyterians never talked in such a strain . The bill for the abolition of the hierarchy having had its second reading on the day on which it was introduced , was referred to a committee of the whole for consideration . Fifteen days afterward , ( June 11 , ) it was taken up in the committee , to be discussed by parts . On the first day the preamble was voted ; on the second it was resolved that the abolition of the several offices of archbishops , bishops , chancellors and commissaries , should be one clause of the bill ; on the third , the abolition of deans , archdeacons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proviso that a competent maintenance should be secured to the incumbents of such offices except in cases of personal delinquency . Proceeding thus from one particular to another , the house at last on the 17th of July voted to adopt a new form of church government , to be substituted for that which they were proposing to abol ish  --  a system almost as different from the Scotch as it was from the hierarchy of Rome itself . Instead of resting upon the divine right of presbyteries and assemblies , it was to rest upon the law of the land , and was to be introduced and settled by parliamentary commissioners , none of whom were to be clergymen . Every county in England was to be a distinct diocese or church , except Yorkshire , which was to be divided into three . In each diocese there was to be a stated presbytery of twelve theologians . Over every presbytery there was to be a president , of the nature of a bishop . Each superintendent or bishop , assisted by some of his presbytery , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to excommunicate offenders . No superintendent was to be translated from one diocese to another . There was to be a diocesan synod annually , and a national synod once in three years . This system instead of being presbyterianism , was nothing but a reformed episcopacy , an episcopacy much like that which was prevalent in the second and third centuries . Such a system , we venture to say , was , at that time certainly , far better suited to the structure of English society and to the genius of the English people , than the presbyterianism which the Scotch were so anxious to impose upon their neighbors . The progress of this bill was arrested by a movement on the part of the king , which made it necessary for the Parliament to give all their attention for a while to other matters . Charles seeing the close alliance between the parliamentary leaders and the commissioners from Scotland , an alliance occasioned by the identity of their interests , had determined to concede to the Scotch every thing they might ask , and thus winning them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects separately . With this design he announced // his determination to make a journey into Scotland . The Parliament saw the reach of his design , and proceeded in all haste to secure the conclusion of the treaty between the two kingdoms , and the disbanding of both armies , and to adopt other measures , made necessary at that crisis . After the king had proceeded on his journey , commissioners from Parliament followed him , ostensibly to superintend the ratification of the treaty , but really to watch his movements and to see that a good understanding was kept up with the Scotch . The result was that the Scotch became in their own view , and in fact , of more consequence than ever ; and their hope of being able to impose their own presbyterian uniformity upon the English people was greatly strengthened . While the king was in Scotland , a bloody insurrection was commenced in Ireland . Thousands upon thousands of the Protestant population of that unhappy country were massacred by the insurgents . A chill of horror at the announcement of so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the papists in Ireland were capable of such atrocities , who could tell how soon the papists of England might strike some sudden and secret blow equally dreadful ? Suspicions which history has not to this day completely removed , rested upon the king , as to some extent implicated in the plans of the Irish insurgents . The panic of aifright , of horror , of indignation , which seized upon the public , prepared all minds for the most desperate measures . The king returned in haste from Scotland , having pleased the people there by his concessions , but not having gained their confidence . And his next plan was to raise an army for the suppression of the Irish rebellion , which he might afterwards use for the suppression of the English Parliament . The house of commons being thus diverted by the progress of events from the bill for reforming the government of the church , and knowing very well that while the bishops retained their places among the lords no measure of that kind could be carried , were watching for some opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirteen of the twenty six bishops were impeached for their share in the late unlawful canons , but the impeachment was not prosecuted . At the close of the year 1641 , twelve of the bishops , alarmed at the insults which they daily experienced from the rabble , signed a paper expressing their purpose to absent themselves from their seats , and protesting against the validity of any thing that might be done in their absence . On the reception of this paper , the lords , who had been their fast friends , were indignant , and communicated it to the commons with an expression of their displeasure . The twelve protesters were impeached of treason and confined in the Tower . Another bill for preventing clergymen from exercising temporal jurisdiction , which had passed the commons sometime before , and had lain unnoticed in the house of lords , was called up by a message from the commons . After some delay the bill was passed , and on the 14th of February , 1642 , it was sanctioned by the king . But before the date just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in progress , the king had taken that fatal step which may be regarded as the commencement of the war between him and the Parliament . From the time of his return from Scotland , the commons had been suspicious that some attempt would be made to subdue them , or break them up by violence . The guard with which they had surrounded themselves on the breaking out of the Irish insurrection , had been removed ; and to their repeated // expostulations the king had answered by offering to surround them with a guard of ' his own appointingthe very thing against which they were most desirous of protection . Under these alarms , they had proceeded so far as to order halberts to be brought into the house , that in case of any sudden attack , they might defend themselves . At last , on Monday the 3d of January , 1642 , the first business day of that year , the king sent a sergeant at arms to the bar of the house , to demand of the speaker five of the most distinguished members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treason . The proceeding was entirely irregular , dispensing with all those legal formalities without which there is no security for justice ; the king had no more right to arrest any man by such a process than to kill an offender with his own hands . Of course the individuals thus demanded-one of whom was the illustrious Hampden-were not surrendered . The house appointed four of their members-one of whom , Lord Falkiand , afterwards died in battle for that monarch  --  to inform his majesty that the matter was of great consequence , and that they would take it into serious consideration , holding the members ready to answer any legal charge made against them . The next day , the king put himself at the head of his household guard of gentlemen pensioners , and of an armed array of some hundreds of courtiers and disbanded soldiers and officers , who had been the night before enlisted and equipped for the undertaking ; and with this force he marched from his palace of Whitehall to the door of the house of commons . Leaving his followers without , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast one glance towards the place where Pym was usually seated , he proceeds to the speaker 's chair ; the speaker drops upon his knee ; the king mounts the platform ; the mace , that badge of the speaker 's authority , is removed ; the members are all standing uncovered ; the king from the speaker 's chair , but without sitting down , looks earnestly over all the benches , to discover the individuals whom he has come to seize . What a moment was that ! The king himself was not deficient in personal courage , and his followers at the door were rash enough and desperate enough for any bloody work . That old chapel of St. Stephen never saw a more exciting moment . There are arms within reach of the members , and at a moment 's warning the house may flash with the glitter of steel . As the king 's eye traverses those benches , it is met by glances as keen and fearless as his ; and many a voice that is afterwards to cheer , as with a clarion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moor , can hardly suppress itself from uttering defiance . Cromwell is there  --  the Cambridgeshire farmer , with that ill fitted country-made coat , with that soiled neckcloth , with that slouched hat held in a hand clenched with indignation ; and perhaps it is the excitement of this very moment that is waking within him the mighty energies of which the world as yet has no suspicion . The first act of violence on the part of the king or his followers  --  the first movement towards seizing the person of any member , will make that floor a battle-ground ; and Cromwell is one so little imposed upon by the chimera of royalty , that in a fight he would strike the king himself as quick and as bard as he would strike a peasant . But the commons have had information of the king 's designs and movements ; and to prevent the conflict which might take place , and at the same time to baffle the king most completely , the five members whom he expected to take by force out of their seats , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addresses a few words to the // house , and says , " I have come to know if any of those persons that I have accused for treason are here . " " I have come to tell you that I must have them wheresoever I can find them . " He then calls two of the accused persons by name , " John Pym ! Denzil Hollis ! " But there is no answer . He turns to the speaker . " Are any of those persons in the house ? Do you see any of them ? Where are they ? " The speaker on his knees replies that , in that place , he has neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak , but as the house is pleased to direct him . " Well , " says the king after surveying the house once more , " I see the birds are flown ; " and then with a few words more about his intention of doing justice , and his expectation of their obedience , he retires , taking off his hat till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the suppressed emotions of the members break forth in the cry of Privilege ! Privilege ! From that day forward , all parties saw that the controversy must soon be tried by an appeal to arms . A week afterwards the king , in defeat and shame , left his palace of Whitehall , in London , to return no more till he returned a prisoner . He retired to the palace of Hampton court , about thirteen miles distant , leaving the Parliament in possession of all the influences that centered in the metropolis . And though he continued to hold intercourse with Parliament by the exchange of messages ; and though he gave his assent to several bills , and particularly to that most distasteful one for taking away the votes of bishops in the house of lords , it was done only to gain time or some other advantage ; and all men knew that at whatever moment he might feel himself strong enough , all these enactments would be absolutely disregarded , or set aside as null from the beginning . Both parties were arming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king made a formal commencement of war , by setting up his standard at Nottingham . Of course , while these measures were in progress , the good will of the Scotch nation grew more important to the Parliament . And the more nearly balanced the parties were in England , the more did that nation enjoy the hope of imposing their admired uniformity upon their neighbors . Their commissioners offered to mediate between the king and Parliament . The king rejected the offer ; but the house of commons thanked them for their kindness , and persuaded the Scotch to send an nrmy into Ireland against the insurgents there , which was in effect relieving England and embarrassing the king . In April , both houses united in a declaration , in which they professed that they intended " a due and necessary reformation of the government and discipline of the church , " " and for the better effecting thereof speedily to have consultation with godly and learned divines . " In the same declaration they promised , that they would " use their utmost endeavors to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance , throughout the kingdom . " Thus , without promising any thing more than what all Puritans united in demanding , and without committing themselves at all for the Scotch discipline , they gave room for the promoters of that discipline to hope for ultimate success . In accordance with this declarntion , when the Parliament , as one of the last measures before the commencement of actual hostilities , sent the king their nineteen propositions , showing , in compliance with a request of his , the sum of all their desires for the reformation and security of church and state , one of their propositions was , that he should consent to such a reformation of the church government and // liturgy , as both houses should advise , after the consultation with divines of which they had spoken in their declaration ; and that he should give " his best assistance for the raising of a sufficient maintenance for preaching ministers throughout the kingdom . " In the month of May , the Scottish council , the executive government of the kingdom , sent their chancellor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same as before . The king rejected the proposal ; while the Parliament gave it a favorable reception , and even wrote to the general assembly of the kirk , desiring their advice and assistance in the reformation of religion . The assembly in their reply , insist on their " desires for unity of religion , that there might be one confession of faith , one directory of worship , one public catechism , and one form of church government , " throughout the British empire . They advise the Parliament to begin with a uniformity of church government ; for there is no hope , they say , " till prelacy be plucked up root and branch , as a plant which God bath not planted . " The Parliament in their reply , reciprocate the assembly 's desire of a religious unity , that in all his majesty 's dominions there may he but one confession of faith and form of church government . But careful not to entangle themselves by pledges , they add , that " though this is hardly to be expected punctually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same spirit , they shall be so directed as to cast out every thing that is offensive to God , and so far agree with the Scots and other reformed churches in the substantials of doctrine , worship , and discipline , that there may be a free communion in all holy exercises and duties of public worship , for the attaining whereof , they intend an assembly of godly and learned divines as soon as they can obtain the royal assent . " They also declare to the assembly , not that episcopacy in every sense of the word is evil , but " that this government by archbishops , bishops , their chancellors and commissaries , deans and chapters , archdeacons , and other ecclesiastical officers depending on the hierarchy , is evil , " and that they are resolved " the same shall be taken away ? They conclude with desiring their brethren of Scotland to concur with them in petitioning the king for an assembly of divines , and to send some of their own ministers whenever the assembly should be called , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The king on the other hand , sent a remonstrance to the Scotch council , in which he assured them that the leaders of Parliament , whatever professions they might make , were at heart as much opposed to presbyterianism as the Scotch were to episcopacy . But the king was one of those unfortunate persons , who are not believed even though they speak the truth . Whatever may have been the intentions of Parliament respecting the presbyterianism on which their brethren of Scotland were insisting , they had no intention of retaining the established episcopacy of England . Accordingly , in the month of September , they redeemed their pledge on that point by passing a bill " for the utter abolishing and taking away of all archbishops , bishops , their chancellors and commissaries , " &amp;c . Unlike the former bill which had been dropped in the house , it made no provision for the introduction of a new system , but left that matter open for subsequent legislation .

The way was thus open for Scotland to unite with the Parliament , if they were willing to give // their aid on any terms short of actually imposing their uniformity on the people of England . The hattie of Edgehill on the Lord 's day , October 23d , when the king , marching from the north towards London with fifteen thousand men , met the earl of Essex with nearly an equal force-was the first encounter of armies in the war , towards which all events had so long been tending . That Sabbath evening , four thousand Englishmen lay dead upon the bloody field . And the blood of thousands more must needs he shed , sometimes in battle , sometimes upon the scaffold , sometimes with a more dreadful atrocity under the gallows , before the axiom , that England with all its people was made for the king , could he superseded by the axiom , that England with its king and all its institutions was made for the people .

War , civil war , had begun with all its horrors for the present , and all its perils for the future . What was to be the result of the conflict-whether new and adequate barriers were to be erected against absolute power ; or whether laws , liberties , charters , were all to be overthrown in some disastrous battle-whether the ecclesiastical polity of the state was to be so reformed , as that the church with its endowments , inslead of existing only to surround the throne with the pomp of a compliant hierarchy , should exist only for the moral instruction and spiritual illumination of the whole people ; or whether the pure gospel was to be trampled down , and lost to England , in the triumphant return of dark and cruel superstitions-none could foretell from all the omens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
