txt /q/ception of their ultimate capabilities is yet crude and imperfect , mankind has , in every instance , been completely satisfied with the mere exhibition of design or art . Thus in Sculpture the first statues were only attempts to imitate rudely the form of a human figure , or in painting , to represent that of a tree : the skill of the artist , in effecting an imitation successfully , being sufficient to excite the astonishment and admiration of those who had not yet made such advances as to enable them o appreciate the superior beauty of expression . Landscape Gardening is , indeed , only a modem word ; first coined , we believe , by Shenstone . /z/ The most distinguished English Landscape Gardeners of recent date , are the late Humphrey Repton , who died in 1818 ; and since him John Claudius London better known in this country , as the celebrated gardening author . Repton 's taste in Landscape gardening was cultivated and elegant , and many of the finest parks and pleasure grounds of England , at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his designs . His published works are full of instructive hints , and at Cobham Hall , one of the finest seats in Britain , is an inscription to his memory , by Lord Darnley . Mr. London's* writings and labors in tasteful gardening , are too well known , to render it necessary that we should do more than allude to them here . Much of what is known of the art in this country undoubtedly is , more or less directly , to be referred to the influence of his published works . Although he is , as it seems to us , somewhat deficient as an artist in imagination , no previous author ever deduced , so clearly , sound artistical principles in Landscape Gardening and Rural Architecture ; and fitness , good sense , and beauty , are combined with much unity of feeling in all his works . As the modern style owes its origin mainly to the English , so it has also been developed and carried to its greatest perfection in the British Islands . The law of primogeniture , which has there so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual improvement and embellishment of those vast landed estates , that remain perpetually in the hands of the same family . Magnificent * While we are revising the second edition , we regret deeply to learn the death of Mr. Loudon . His herculean labors as an author have at last destroyed him ; ind in his death we lose one who has done more than any other person that ever lived , to popularize , and render universal , a taste for Gardening and Domestic Architecture . /z/ buildings , added to by each succeeding generation , who often preserve also the older portions with the most scrupulous care ; wide spread parks , clothed with a thick velvet turf , which , amid their moist atmosphere , preserves during great part of the year an emerald greenness studded with noble oaks and other forest trees which number centuries of growth and maturity ; these advantages , in the hands of the most intelligent and the wealthiest aristocracy in the world , have indeed made almost an entire landscape garden of " merry England . " Among a multitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer the reader to the celebrated Blenheim , the seat of the Duke of Marlborough , where the lake alone ( probably the largest piece of artificial water in the world ) covers a surface of two hundred acres : Chatsworth , the varied and magnificent seat of the Duke of Devonshire , where there are scenes illustrative of almost every style of the art : and Woburn Abbey , the grounds of which are full of the choicest specimens of trees and plants , and where the park , like that of Ashbridge , Arundel Castle , and several other private residences in England , is only embraced within a circumference of fron ten to twenty miles . On the continent of Europe , though there are a multitude of examples of the modern style of landscape gardening , which is there called the English or natural style , yet in the neighborhood of many of the capitals , especially those of the south of Europe , the taste for the geometric or ancient style of gardening still prevails to a considerable extent ; partially , no doubt , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical and architectural accompaniments of vases , statues , busts , etc .. /z/ the passion for which pervades a people rich in ancient and modern sculptural works of art . Indeed many of the gardens on the continent are more striking from their numerous sculpturesque , ornaments , interspersed with fountains and jets-d'eau , than from the beauty or rarity of their vegetation , or from their arrangement . In the United States , it is highly improbable that we shall ever witness such splendid examples of landscape gardens as those abroad , to which we have alluded . Here the rights of man are held to be equal ; and if there are no enormous parks , and no class of men whose wealth is hereditary , there is , at least , what is more gratifying to the feelings of the philanthropist , the almost entire absence of a very poor class in the country ; while we have , on the other hand , a large class of independent landholders , who are able to assemble around them , not only the useful and convenient , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of individuals among us who possess wealth and refinement sufficient to enable them to enjoy the pleasures of a country life , and who desire in their private residences so much of the beauties of landscape gardening and rural embellishment as may be had without any enormous expenditure of means , is every day increasing . And although , until lately , a very meagre plan of laying out the grounds of a residence , was all that we could lay claim to , yet the taste for elegant rural improvements is advancing now so rapidly , that we have no hesitation in predicting that in half a century more , there will exist a greater number of beautiful villas and country seats of moderate extent , in the Atlantic States , than in any country in Europe , England alone excepted . With us , a /z/ feeling , a taste , or an improvement , is contagious ; and once fairly appreciated and established in one portion of the country , it is disseminated with a celerity that is indeed wonderful , to every other portion . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art are more numerous than its professors , that there will be , in devising and carrying plans into execution , many specimens of bad taste , and perhaps a sufficient number of efforts to improve without any real taste whatever , still we are convinced the effect of our rural embellishments will in the end be highly agreeable , as a false taste is not likely to be a permanent one in a community where everything is so much the subject of criticism . With regard to the literature and practice of Landscape Gardening as an art , in North America , almost everything is yet before us , comparatively little having yet been done . Almost all the improvements of the grounds of our finest country residences , have been carried on under the direction of the proprietors themselves , suggested by their own good taste , in many instances improved by the study of European authors , or by a personal inspection of the finest places abroad . The only American work previously published which treats directly of Landscape Gardening , is the American Gardener s Calendar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art , of any note , was the late M. Parmentier of Brooklyn , Long Island . M. Andre Parmentier was the brother of that celebrated horticulturist , the Chevalier Parmentier , Mayor of Enghien , Holland . He emigrated to this country about the year 1824 , and in the Horticultural Nurseries which he established at Brooklyn , he gave a specimen of the natural /z/ style of laying out grounds , combined with a scientific arrangement of plants , which excited public curiosity , and contributed not a little to the dissemination of a taste for the natural mode of landscape gardening . During M. Parmentier 's residence on Long Island , he was almost constantly applied to for plans for laying out the grounds of country seats , by persons in various parts of the Union , as well as in the immediate proximity of New York . In many cases he not only surveyed the demesne to be improved , but furnished the plants and trees necessary to carry out his designs . Several plans were prepared by him for residences of note in the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially near Montreal , were , we believe , laid out by his own hands and stocked from his nursery grounds . In his periodical catalogue , he arranged the hardy trees and shrubs that flourish in this latitude in classes , according to their height , etc. , and published a short treatise on the superior claims of the natural , over the formal or geometric style of laying out grounds . In short , we consider M Parmentier 's labors and examples as having effected , directly , far more for landscape gardening in America , than those of any other individual whatever . The introduction of tasteful gardening in this country is , of course , of a very recent date . But so long ago as from 25 to 50 years , there were several country residences highly remarkable for extent , elegance of arrangement , and the highest order and keeping . Among these , we desire especially to record here the celebrated seats of Chancellor Livingston , Wm . Hamilton , Esq. , Theodore Lyman , Esq. , and Judge Peters . Woodlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was , so long ago as 1805 , highly celebrated for its gardening beauties . The refined taste and the wealth of its accomplished owner , were freely lavished in its improvement and embellishment ; and at a time when the introduction of rare exotics was attended with a vast deal of risk and trouble , the extensive green-houses and orangeries of this seat contained all the richest treasures of the exotic flora , and among other excellent gardeners employed , was the distinguished botanist Pursh , whose enthusiastic taste in his favorite science was promoted and aided by Mr. Hamilton . The extensive pleasure grounds were judiciously planted , singly and in groups , with a great variety of the finest species of trees . The attention of the visitor to this place is now arrested by two very large specimens of that curious tree , the Japanese Ginko ( Salisburia ) , 60 or 70 feet high , perhaps the finest in Europe or America , by the noble magnolias , and the rich park-like appearance of some of the plantations of the finest native and foreign oaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuylkill , Woodlands has fallen into decay , but there can be no question that it was , for a long time , the most tasteful and beautiful residence in America . The seat of the late Judge Peters , about five miles from Philadelphia , was , 30 years ago , a noted specimen of the ancient school of landscape gardening . Its proprietor had a most extended reputation as a scientific agriculturist , and his place was also no less remarkable for the design and culture of its pleasure-grounds , than for the excellence of its farm . Long and stately avenues , with vistas terminated by obelisks , a garden adorned with marble vases , busts , and statues , and pleasure grounds filled with /z/ the rarest trees and shrubs , were conspicuous features here . Some of the latter are now so remarkable as to attract strongly the attention of the visitor . Among them , is the chestnut planted by Washington , which produces the largest and finest fruit ; very large hollies ; and a curious old box-tree much higher than the mansion near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the still remaining grand old avenue of hemlocks ( Abies canadensis ) . Many of these trees , which were planted 100 years ago , are now venerable specimens , ninety feet high , whose huge trunks and wide spread branches are in many cases densely wreathed and draped with masses of English Ivy , forming the most picturesque sylvan objects we ever beheld . Lemon Hill , half a mile above the Fairmount waterworks of Philadelphia , was , 20 years ago , the most perfect specimen of the geometric mode in America , and since its destruction by the extension of the city , a few years since , there is nothing comparable with it , in that style , among us . All the symmetry , uniformity , and high art of the old school , were displayed here in artificial plantations , formal gardens w T ith trellises , grottoes , spring-houses , temples , . statues , and vases , with numerous ponds of water , jets-d'eau , and other water- works , parterres and an extensive range of hothouses . The effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lovely banks of the Schuylkill , admirable ; and its liberal proprietor , Mr , Pratt , by opening it freely to the public , greatly increased the popular taste in the neighborhood of that city . On the Hudson , the show place of the last age was the still interesting Clermont , then the residence of Chancellor Livingston . Its level or gently undulating lawn , four or /z/ five miles in length , the rich native woods , and the long vistas of planted avenues , added to its fine water view , rendered this a noble place . The mansion , the greenhouses , and the gardens , show something of the French taste in design , which Mr. Livingston 's residence abroad , at the time when that mode was popular , no doubt , led him to adopt . The finest yellow locusts in America are now standing in the pleasure-grounds here , and the gardens contain many specimens of fruit trees , the first of their sorts introduced into the Union . Waltham House , about nine miles from Boston , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest places , as regards Landscape Gardening . Its owner , the late Hon. T. Lyman , was a highly-accomplished man , and the grounds at Waltham House bear witness to a refined and elegant taste in rural improvement . A fine level park , a mile in length , enriched with groups of English limes , elms , and oaks , and rich masses of native wood , watered by a fine stream and stocked with deer , were the leading features of the place at that time ; and this , and Woodlands , were the two best specimens of the modern style , as Judge Peters ' seat , Lemon Hill , and Clermont , were of the ancient style , in the earliest period of the history of Landscape Gardening among us . There is no part of the Union where the taste in Landscape Gardening is so far advanced , as on the middle portion of the Hudson . The natural scenery is of the finest character , and places but a mile or two apart often possess , from the constantly varying forms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of home landscape and distant view . Standing in the grounds of some of the finest of these seats , the eye beholds only the FIG. 1 . View in the Grounds at Hyde Park . FIG. 2 . The Manor of Livingston . /z/ soft foreground of smooth lawn , the rich groups of trees shutting out all neighboring tracts , the lake-like expanse of water , and , closing the distance , a fine range of wooded mountain . A residence here of but a hundred acres , so fortunately are these disposed by nature , seems to appropriate the whole scenery round , and to be a thousand in extent . At the present time , our handsome villa residences are becoming every day more numerous , and it would require much more space than our present limits , to enumerate all the tasteful rural country places within our knowledge , many of which have been newly laid out , or greatly improved within a few years . But we consider it so important and instructive to the novice in the art of Landscape Gardening to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we shall venture to refer the reader to a few of those which have now a reputation among us as elegant country residences . Hyde Park , on the Hudson , formerly the seat of the late Dr. Hosack , now of W. Langdon , Esq. , has been justly celebrated as one of the finest specimens of the modern style of Landscape Gardening in America . Nature has , indeed , done much for this place , as the grounds are finely varied , beautifully watered by a lively stream , and the views are inexpressibly striking from the neighborhood of the house itself , including , as they do , the noble Hudson for sixty miles in its course , through rich valleys and bold mountains . ( See Fig. 1 . ) But the efforts of art are not unworthy so rare a locality ; and while the native woods , and beautifully undulating surface , are preserved in their original state , the pleasure-grounds , roads , walks , drives and new plantations , have been laid out in such a judi- /z/ cious manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly hot-houses were erected by Dr. Hosack , with also entrance lodges at two points on the estate , a fine bridge over the stream , and numerous pavilions and seats commanding extensive prospects ; in short , nothing was spared to render this a complete residence . The park , which at one time contained some fine deer , afforded a delightful drive within itself , as the whole estate numbered about seven hundred acres . The plans for laying out the grounds were furnished by Parmentier , and architects from New York were employed in designing and erecting the buildings . For a long time , this was the finest seat in America , but there are now many rivals to this claim . The Manor of Livingston , lately the seat of Mrs. MaryLivingston ( but now of Jacob Le Roy , Esq. ) , is seven miles east of the city of Hudson . The mansion stands in the midst of a fine park , rising gradually from the level of a rich inland country , and commanding prospects for sixty miles around . The park is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble simplicity of its character , and the perfect order in which it is kept . The turf isf everywhere , short and velvet-like , the gravel-roads scrupulously firm and smooth , and near the house are the largest and most superb evergreens . The mansion is one of the chastest specimens of the Grecian style , and there is an air of great dignity about the whole demesne . Blitliewood , formerly the seat of R. Donaldson , Esq. , ( now John Bard , Esq. ) , near Barry town , on the Hudson , is one of the most charming villa residences in the Union . The natural scenery here , is nowhere surpassed in its enchanting union of softness and dignity the river being four miles wide , its placid bosom broken only by islands and gleaming sails , and the horizon /z/ grandly closing in with the tall blue summits of the distant Kaatskills . The smiling , gently varied lawn is studded with groups and masses of fine forest and ornamental trees , beneath which are walks leading in easy curves to rustic seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to openings affording most loveiy prospects . ( See Frontispiece . ) In various situations near the house and upon the lawn , sculptured vases of Maltese stone are also disposed in such a manner as to give a refined and classic air to the grounds . As a pendant to this graceful landscape , there is within the grounds scenery of an opposite character , equally w T ild and picturesque a fine , bold stream , fringed with woody banks , and dashing over several rocky cascades , thirty or forty feet in height , and falling altogether a hundred feet in a distance of half a mile . There are also , within the grounds , a pretty gardener 's lodge , in the rural cottage style , and a new entrance lodge by the gate , in the bracketed mode ; in short , we can recall no place of moderate extent , where nature and tasteful art are both so harmoniously combined to express grace and elegance . Montgomery Place , the residence of Mrs. Edward Livingston , which is also situated on the Hudson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present limits allow , for it is , as a whole , nowhere surpassed in America , in point of location , natural beauty , or the landscape gardening charms which it exhibits . It is one of our oldest improved country seats , having been originally the residence of Gen. Montgomery , the hero of Quebec . On the death of his widow it passed into the hands of her brother , Edward Livingston , Esq. , the late minister to France , and up to the present moment has /z/ always received the most tasteful and judicious treat nent . The lover of the expressive in nature , or the beautiful in art , will find here innumerable subjects for his study . The natural scenery in many portions approaches the character of grandeur , and the foreground of rich woods and lawns , stretching out on all sides of the mountain , completes a home landscape of dignified and elegant seclusion , rarely surpassed in any country . Among the fine features of this estate are the wilderness , a richly wooded and highly picturesque valley , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , intricate , and mazy walks , along which are placed a variety of rustic seats ( Fig. 4 ) . This valley is musical with the sound of waterfalls , of which there are several fine ones in the bold impetuous L stream which finds its course through the lowtrig. 4 . One of the Rustic Seats at Montgomery Place. er P ai *t * the wilderness . Near the further end of the valley is a beautiful lake ( Fig. 5 ) , half of which lies cool and dark under the shadow of tall trees , while the other half gleams in the open sunlight . In a part of the lawn , near the house , yet so surrounded by a dark setting of trees and shrubs as to form a rich /z/ picture by itself , is one of the most perfect flower gardens in the country , laid out in the arabesque manner , and glowing with masses of the gayest colors each bed being composed wholly of a single hue . A large conservatory , an ' exotic garden , an arboretum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable residence . Including a drive through a fine bit of natural wood , south of the mansion , there are five miles of highly varied and picturesque private roads and walks , through the pleasure-grounds of Montgomery Place . Fig. 5 . The Lake at Montgomery Place . Ellerslie is the seat of William Kelly , Esq . It is three miles below Rhinebeck . It comprises over six hundred acres , and is one of our finest examples of high keeping and good management , both in an ornamental and an agricultural point of view . The house is conspicuously placed on a commanding natural terrace , with a fair foreground of park surface below it , studded with beautiful groups of elms and oaks , and a very fine reach of river and /z/ distant hills . This is one of the most celebrated places on the Hudson , and there are few that so well pay tiie lover of improved landscape for a visit . Just below Ellerslie are the fine mansion and pleasing grounds of Wm . Emmet , Esq. , the former a stone edifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most agreeable point on the margin of the river . The seat of Mrs. Gardiner Howland , near " New Hamburgh , is not only beautiful in situation , but is laid out with great care , and is especially remarkable for the many rare trees and shrubs collected in its grounds . Wodenethe , near Fishkill landing , is the seat of II . W. Sargent , Esq. , and is a bijou full of interest for the lover of rural beauty ; abounding in rare trees , shrubs , and plants , as well as vases , and objects of rural embellishment of all kinds . Kenwood , formerly the residence of J. Ratlibone , Esq. , is one mile south of Albany . Ten years ago this spot was a wild and densely wooded hill , almost inaccessible . With great taste and industry Mr. Rathbone has converted it into a country residence of much picturesque beauty , erected in the Tudor style , one of the best villas in the country , with a gate-lodge in the same mode , and laid out the grounds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres in this estate , and pleasure grounds , forcing houses , and gardens , are now flourishing where ali was so lately in the rudest state of nature ; while , by the judicious preservation of natural wood , the effect of a long cultivated demesne has been given to the whole . The Manor House of the " Patroon " ( as the eldest son of the Van Rensselaer family is called ) is in the northern suburbs of the city of Albany . The mansion , greatly Fi ; . 0 . Beaverwyck , the Stat of Wm . P. Van Ilonssolaer , Ksq. /z/ Fi ; . T. Ottage Evidence of Wm . II . Aspinwall , Esq . /z/ enlarged and improved a few years since , from the designs of Upjohn , is one of the largest and most admirable in all respects , to be found in the country , and the pleasuregrounds in the rear of the house are tasteful and beautiful . Beaverwyck , a little north of Albany , on the opposite bank of the river , was formerly the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole estate is ten or twelve miles square , including the village of Bath on the river shore , and a large farming district . The home residence embraces several hundred acres , with a large level lawn , bordered by highly varied surface of hill and dale . The mansion , one of the first class , is newly erected from the plans of Mr. Diaper , and in its interior its hall with mosaic floor of polished woods , its marble staircase , frescoed apartments , and spacious adjoining conservatory is perhaps the most splendid in the Union . The grounds are yet newly laid out , but with much judgment ; and six or seven miles of winding gravelled roads and walks have been formed their boundaries now leading over level meadows , and now winding through woody dells . The drives thus afforded , are almost unrivalled in extent and variety , and give the stranger or guest , an opportunity of seeing the near and distant views to the best advantage . At Tarrytown , is the cottage residence of Washington Irving , which is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cottage ornee . The charming manner in which the wild foot-paths , in the neighborhood of this cottage , are conducted among the picturesque dells and banks , is precisely what one would look for here . A little below , Mr. Sheldon 's cottage ( now Mr. Hoag 's ) , with its pretty lawn and its charming brook , is one of the best specimens /z/ of this kind of residence on the river . At Hastings , four or five miles south , is the agreeable seat of Eobt . B. Minturn , Esq . About twelve miles from New York , on the Sound , is Hunter s Island , the seat of John Hunter , Esq. , a place of much simplicity and dignity of character . The whole island may be considered an extensive park carpeted with soft lawn , and studded with noble trees . The mansion is simple in its exterior , but internally , is filled with rich treasures of art . The seat of James Munroe , Esq. , on the East river in this neighborhood , abounds with beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cottage residence of William H. Aspinwall , Esq. , on Staten Island , is a highly picturesque specimen of Landscape Gardening . The house is in the English cottage style , and from its open lawn in front , the eye takes in a wide view of the ocean , the Narrows , and the blue hills of Neversink . In the rear of the cottage , the surface is much broken and varied , and finely wooded and planted . In improving this picturesque site , a nice sense of the charm of natural expression has been evinced ; and the sudden variations from smooth open surface , to wild wooden banks , with rocky , moss-covered flights of steps , strike the stranger equally with surprise and delight . A charming greenhouse , a knotted ? flower-garden , and a pretty , rustic moss-house , are among the interesting points of this spirited place . ( See Fig. 7 . ) The seat of the Wadsworth family , at Geneseo , is the finest in the interior of the state of New York . Nothing , indeed , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is more than a thousand acres in extent , lying on each side of the Genesee river , and is filled with thousands of the noblest oaks and elms , many of which , but /z/ more especially the oaks , are such trees as we see in the pictures of Claude , or our own Durand ; richly developed , their trunks and branches grand and majestic , their heads full of breadth and grandeur of outline . These oaks , distributed over a nearly level surface , with the trees disposed either singly or in the finest groups , as if most tastefully planted centuries ago , are solely the work of nature ; and yet so entirely is the whole like the grandest planted park , that it is difficult to believe that all is not the work of some master of art , and intended for the accompaniment of a magnificent residence . Some of the trees are five or six hundred years old . In Connecticut , Monte Video , the seat of Daniel Wadsworth , Esq. , near Hartford , is worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its grounds , and is one of the most tasteful in the state . The residence of James Hillhouse , Esq. , near New-Haven , is a pleasing specimen of the simplest kind of Landscape Gardening , where graceful forms of trees , and a gently sloping surface of grass , are the principal features . The villa of Mr. Whitney near New-Haven , is one of the most tastefully managed in the state . In Maine , the most remarkable seat , as respects , landscape gardening and architecture , is that of Mr. Gardiner , of Gardiner . The environs of Boston are more highly cultivated than Jiose of any other city in North America . There are here whole rural neighborhoods of pretty cottages and villas , admirably cultivated , and , in many cases , tastefully laid out and planted . The character of even the finest of these places is , perhaps , somewhat suburban , as compared with those of the Hudson river , but we regard them as furnish- /z/ ing admirable hints foiia class of residence likely to become more numerous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The owner of a small cottage residence may have almost every kind of beauty and enjoyment in his grounds that the largest estate will afford , so far as regards the interest of trees and plants , tasteful arrangement , recreation , and occupation . Indeed , we have little . doubt that he , who directs personally the curve of every walk , selects and plants every shrub and tree , and watches with solicitude every evidence of beauty and progress , succeeds in extracting from his tasteful grounds of half a dozen acres , a more intense degree of pleasure , than one who is only able to direct and enjoy , in a general sense , the arrangement of a vast estate . Belmont , the seat of J. P. Gushing , Esq. , is a residence of more note than any other near Boston ; but this is , chiefly , on account of the extensive ranges of glass , the forced fruits , and the high culture of the gardens . A new and spacious mansion has recently been erected here , and the pleasure-grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrubs on a pleasing lawn ( Fig. 8 . ) The seat of Col. Perkins , at Brookline , is one of the most interesting in this neighborhood . The very beautiful lawn here , abounds with exquisite trees , finely disposed ; among them , some larches and Norway firs , with many other rare trees of uncommon beauty of form . At a short distance is the villa residence of Theodore Lyman , Esq. , remarkable for the unusually fine avenue of Elms leading to the house , and for the beautiful architectural taste displayed in the dwelling itself . The seat of the Hon. John FIG . S. Belmont Pla ? - , -. , near Boston , the Seat of J. P. Gushing , Esq . I ' , , - . ( ) . Mr. Dunn 's Cottage , Mount Holly , N. J. /z/ Lowell , at Roxbury , possesses also many interesting gardening features. * Pine Bank , , the Perkins estate , on the border of Jamaica lake , is one of the most beautiful residences near Boston . The natural surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is varied by two or three singular little dimples , or hollows , which add to its effect . The perfect order of the grounds ; the beauty of the walks , sometimes skirting the smooth open lawn , enriched with rare plants and shrubs , and then winding by the shadowy banks of the water ; the soft and quiet character of the lake itself , its margin richly fringed with trees , which conceal here and there a pretty cottage , its firm clean beach of gravel , and its water of crystal purity ; all these features make this place a little gem of natural * We Americans are proverbially impatient of delay , and a few years in prospect appear an endless futurity . So much is this the feeling with many , that we verily believe there are hundreds of our country places , which owe their bareness and destitution of foliage to the idea , so common , that it requires " an age " for forest trees to " grow up . " The middle-aged man hesitates about the good of planting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even many who are younger , conceive that it requires more than an ordinary lifetime to rear a fine wood of planted trees . About two years since , we had the pleasure of visiting the seat of the late Mr. Lowell , whom we found in a green old age , still enjoying , with the enthusiasm of youth , the pleasures of Horticulture and a country life . For the encouragement of those who are ever complaining of the tardy pace with which the growth of trees advances , we will here record that we accompanied Mr. L. through a belt of fine woods ( skirting part of his residence ) , nearly half a mile in length , consisting of almost all our finer hardy trees , many of them apparently full grown , the whole of which had been planted by him when he was thirty-two years old . At that time , a solitary elm or two were almost the ( nly trees upon his estate . We can hardly conceive a more rational source of pride or enjoyment , than to be able thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of umbrageous woods and groves , planted by our own hands , and whose growth has become almost identified with our own progress and existence . /z/ and artistical harmony , and beauty . Mr. Perkins has just rebuilt the house , in the style of a French maison de campagne ; and Pine Bank is now adorned with a most complete residence in the latest continental taste , from the designs of M. Lemoulnier . On the other side of the lake is the cottage of Thomas Lee , Esq . Enthusiastically fond of botany , and gardening in all its departments , Mr. Lee has here formed a residence of as much variety and interest as we ever saw in so moderate a compass about 20 acres . It is , indeed , not only a most instructive place to the amateur of landscape gardening , but to the naturalist and lover of plants . Every shrub seems placed precisely in the soil and aspect it likes best , and native and foreign Rhododendrons , Kalmias , and other rare shrubs , are seen here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the surface here , and while the lawn-front of the house has a polished and graceful air , one or two other portions are quite picturesque . Near the entrance gate is an English oak , only fourteen years planted , now forty feet high . The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden , and there is nothing in America , of the sort , so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage , or villa , to another . No animals are allowed to run at large , and the open gates , with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs , give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment . These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery , often almost to the carriage tracks , and curve and wind about , in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone ; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes , than /z/ we ever saw assembled together in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many beautiful residences . Among these , we desire particularly to notice the residence of James Arnold , Esq . There is scarcely a small place in New England , where the pleasure-grounds are so full of variety , and in such perfect order and keeping , as at this charming spot ; and its winding walks , open bits of lawn , shrubs and plants grouped on turf , shady bowers , and rustic seats , all most agreeably combined , render this a very interesting and instructive suburban seat . ( Fig. 11 . ) In New Jersey , the grounds of the Count de Survilliers , at Bordentown , were very extensive ; and although the surface is mostly flat , it has been well varied by extensive plantations . At Mount Holly , about twenty miles from Camden , is Mr. Dunn 's unique , semi-oriental cottage , with a considerable extent of pleasure ground , newly planted , after the designs of Mr. Notman . ( Fig. 9 . ) About Philadelphia there are several very interesting seats on the banks of the Delaware and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The country seat of George Sheaff , Esq. , one of the most remarkable in Pennsylvania , in many respects , is twelve miles north of Philadelphia . The house is a large and respectable mansion of stone , surrounded by pleasure-grounds and plantations of fine evergreen and deciduous trees . The conspicuous ornament of the grounds , however , is a magnificent white oak , of enormous size , whose wide stretching branches , and grand head , give an air of dignity to the whole place . ( Fig. 10 . ) Among the sylvan features here , most interesting , are also the handsome evergreens , chiefly Balsam or Balm of Gilead firs , some of which are now /z/ much higher thairthe mansion . These trees were planted by Mr. SheafF twenty-two years ago , and were then so small , that they were brought by him from Philadelphia , at various times , in his carriage a circumstance highly encouraging to despairing planters , when we reflect how comparatively slow growing is this tree .

This is one of the most agreeable places within a few miles of Philadelphia . The house is a picturesque cottage , in the rural gothic style , with very charming and appropriate pleasure grounds , comprising many groups and masses of large and finely grown trees , interspersed with a handsome collection of shrubs and plants ; the whole very tastefully arranged . ( Fig. 11 . ) The lawn is prettily varied in surface , and there is a conservatory attached to the house , in which the plants in pots are hidden in beds of soft green moss , and which , in its whole effect and management , is more tasteful and elegant than any plant house , connected with a dwelling , that we remember to have seen . * The farm is 300 acres in extent , and , in the time of De Witt Clinton , was pronounced by him the model farm of the United States .

There is a large and excellent old mansion , with paved halls , built in 1731 , which is preserved in its original condition . This place was the seat of the celebrated Logan , the friend of William Perm , and is now owned by his descendant , Albanus Logan . The villa residence of Alexander Brown , Esq. , is situated on the Delaware , a few miles from Philadelphia . There is here a good deal of beauty , in the natural style , made up chiefly by lawn and forest trees . A pleasing drive through plantations of 25 years ' growth , is one of the most interesting features and ' there is much elegance and high keeping n the grounds . Below Philadelphia , the lover of beautiful places will find a good deal to admire in the country seat of John R. Latimer , Esq. , near Wilmington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The place has all the advantages of high keeping , richly stocked gardens and conservatories , and much natural beauty , heightened by judicious planting , arrangement , and culture . At the south are many extensive country residences remarkable for trees of unusual grandeur and beauty , among - which the live oak is very conspicuous ; but they are , in general , wanting in that high keeping and care , which is so essential to the charm of a landscape garden . Of smaller villa residences , suburban chiefly , there are great numbers , springing up almost by magic , in the borders of our towns and cities . Though the possessors of /z/ these can scarcely hope to introduce anything approaching to a landscape garden style , in laying out their limited grounds , still they may be greatly benefited by an acquaintance with the beauties and the pleasures of this species of rural embellishment . When we are once master of the principles , and aware of the capabilities of an art , we are able to infuse an expression of tasteful design , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most humble works , and with very limited means . While we shall endeavor , in the following pages , to give such a view of modern Landscape Gardening , as will enable the improver to proceed with his fascinating operations , in embellishing the country residence , in a practical mode , based upon what are now generally received as the correct principles of the art , we would desire the novice , after making himself acquainted with all that can be acquired from written works within his reach , to strengthen his taste and add to his knowledge , by a practical inspection of the best country seats among us . In an infant state of society , in regard to the fine arts , much will be done in violation of good taste ; but here , where nature has done so much for us , there is scarcely a large country residence in the Union , from which useful hints in Landscape Gardening may not be taken .

Fig. 12 . The Geometric style , from an old print . The beauties elicited by the ancient style of gardening were those of regularity , symmetry , and the display - of. labored art . These were attained in a merely mechanical manner , and usually involved little or no theory . The geometrical form and lines of the buildings were only extended and carried out in the garden . In the best classical models , the art of the sculptor conferred dignity and elegance on the garden , by the fine forms of marble vases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the /z/ Dutch school , prevalent in England in the time of William TV . ( Fig. 12 ) , the results evince a fertility of odd conceits , father than the exercise of taste or imagination . Indeed . as , to level ground naturally uneven , or to make an avenue , by planting rows of trees on each side of a broad walk , requires only the simplest perception of the beauty of mathematical forms , so , to lay out a garden in the geometric style , became little more than a formal routine , and it was only after the superior interest of a more natural manner was enforced by men of genius , that natural beauty of expression was recognised , and Landscape Gardening was raised to the rank of a fine art . The ancient style of gardening may , however , be introduced with good effect in certain cases . In public squares and gardens , where display , grandeur of effect , and a highly artificial character are desirable , it appears to us the most suitable ; and no less so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out of the question . Where a taste for imitating an old and quaint style of residence exists , the symmetrical and knotted garden would be a proper accompaniment ; and pleached alleys , and sheared trees , would be admired , like old armor or furniture , as curious specimens of antique taste and custom. * * There has been a great revival of this kind of garden in England the pnat ten years more , perhaps , inclining to the Italian school than the Dutch . Chatsworth , Woburu Abbey , Castle Howard , Bowood , Eaton Hall , and , in fact , most of the great places , have more or less adopted the Italian or Architectural school on one or more sides of the house , as a sort of connection between art and nature . Trentham ( the Duke of Sutherland 's ) is , we believe , especially rich in architectural gardens . Both here and at the other places above-mentioned , the grade between the house and the park is let aown , as it were , by a series of terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surmounted , at regular intervals , with vase- ? , planted either with Geraniums , or with Yucca , Aloe , Bonapartias , and other formal plants . Flights of broad , heavy stone or marble steps conduct from one terrace to the other , and finally /z/ The earliest professors of modern Landscape Gardening have generally agreed upon two variations , of which the art is capable variations no less certainly distinct , on the one hand , than they are capable of intermingling and combining , on the other . These are the beautiful and the picturesque : or , to speak more definitely , the beauty characterized by simple and flowing forms , and that expressed by striking , irregular , spirited forms . The admirer of nature , as well as the lover of pictures and engravings , will at once call to mind examples of scenery distinctly expressive of each of these kinds of beauty . In nature , perhaps some gently undulating plain , , covered with emerald turf , partially or entirely encompassed by rich , rolling outlines of forest canopy , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roundheaded trees , or there interspersed with single specimens whose trunks support heads of foliage flowing in outline , or drooping in masses to the very turf beneath them . In such a scene we often behold the azure of heaven , and its silvery clouds , as well as the deep verdure of the luxuriant and shadowy branches , reflected in the placid bosom of a silvan lake ; the shores of the latter swelling out , and receding , in gentle curved lines ; the banks , sometimes covered with soft turf sprinkled with flowers , and in other portions clothed with luxuriant masses of verdant shrubs . Here are to the Park . The flat of the terrace , being laid out either in the most formal and precise parterre , or in extremely rich and intricate beds of arabesque patterns in scrolls , to resemble carpets . In either case , great use is made of statues and fountains , very elaborately and artistically designed and executed , and of Portugal Laurel , trimmed up to imitate orange-trees in tubs ; as , also , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either planted in the ground , or in boxes , and , also , of different-colored gravel in the division of the beds , the whole producing , when seen from the windows of the house , a brilliant combination , which , with the soft , verdant park as a background , is inexpressibly gay and effective . H. W. S. /z/ ail the elements of what is termed natural beauty , or a landscape characterized by simple , easy , and flowing lines . For an example of the opposite character , let us take a stroll to the nearest woody glen in your neighborhood perhaps a romantic valley , half shut in on two or more sides by steep rocky banks , partially concealed and overhung by clustering vines , and tangled thickets of deep foliage . Against the sky outline breaks the wild and irregular form of some old , half decayed tree near by , or the horizontal and unique branches of the larch or the pine , with their strongly marked forms . Rough and . irregular stems and trunks , rocks half covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to dark masses of bold shadowy foliage , form prominent objects in the foreground . If water enlivens the scene , we shall hear the murmur of the noisy brook , or the cool dashing of the cascade , as it leaps over the rocky barrier . Le . the stream turn the ancient and well-worn wheel of the old mill in the middle ground , and we shall have an illustration of the picturesque , not the less striking from its familiarity to every one . To the lover of the fine arts , the name of Claude Lorraine can not fail to suggest examples of beauty in some of its purest and most simple forms . In the best pictures of this master , w r e see portrayed those graceful and flowing forms in trees , foreground , and buildings , vhich delight so much the lover of noble and chaste beauty , compositions emanating from a harmonious soul , and inspired by a climate and a richness of nature and art seldom surpassed . On the other hand , where shall we find all the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscapes of Salvator Rosa ! In those rugged /z/ scenes , even the lawless aspects of his favorite robbers and banditti are not more spirited , than the bold rocks and wild passes by which they are surrounded . And in the productions of his pencil we see the influence of a romantic and vigorous imagination , nursed amid scenes teeming with the grand as well as the picturesque both of which he embodied in the most striking manner . In giving these illustrations of beautiful and of picturesque scenes , we have not intended them to be understood in the light of exact models for imitation in Landscape Gardening only as striking examples of expression in natural scenery . Although in nature many landscapes parlake in a certain degree of both these kinds of expression , yet it is no doubt true that the effect is more satisfactory , where either the one or the other character predominates . The accomplished amateur should be able to seize at once upon the characteristics of these two species of beauty in all scenery . To assist the reader in this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we hope we shall be able fully to illustrate the difference in the expression of even single trees , in this respect . A few strongly marked objects , either picturesque or simply beautiful , will often confer their character upon a whole landscape ; as the destruction of a single group of bold rocks , covered with wood , may render a scene , once picturesque , completely insipid . The early writers on the modern style were content with trees allowed to grow in their natural forms , and with an easy assemblage of sylvan scenery in the pleasure-grounds , which resembled the usual woodland features of nature . The effect of this method will always be interesting , and an agreeable effect will always be the result of following the /z/ simplest hints derived from the free and luxuriant forms ot nature . No residence in the country can fail to be pleasing , whose features are natural groups of forest trees , smooth lawn , and hard gravel walks . But this is scarcely Landscape Gardening in the true sense of the word , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we understand not only an imitation , in the grounds of a country residence , of the agreeable forms of nature , but an expressive , harmonious , and refined imitation In Landscape Gardening , we should aim to separate the accidental and extraneous in nature , and to preserve only the spirit , or essence . This subtle essence lies , we believe , in the expression more or less pervading every attractive portion of nature . And it is by eliciting , preserving , or heightening this expression , that we may give our landscape gardens a higher charm , than even the polish of art can bestow . Now , the two most forcible and complete expressions to be found in that kind of natural scenery which may be reproduced in Landscape Gardening , are the BEAUTIFUL and the PICTURESQUE . As we look upon these as quite distinct , and as success in practical embellishment must depend on our feeling and understanding these expressions beforehand , it is necessary that we should attach some definite meaning to terms which we shall be continually obliged to employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from * " Thus , there is a beauty of nature and a beauty of art . To copy the beauty of nature can not be called being an artist in the highest sense of the word , as a mechanical talent only is requisite for this . The beautiful in art depends on ideas ; and the true artist , therefore , must possess , together with the talent for technical execution , that genial power which revels freely in rich forms , and is capable of producing and animating them . It is by this , that the jierit of the artist and his production is to be judged ; and these can not be /z/ the vague and conflicting opinions of most preceding writers on this branch of the subject ; some , like Repton , insisting that they are identical ; and others , like Price , that they are widely different . Gilpin defines Picturesque objects to be " those which please from some quality capable of being illustrated in painting . " Nothing can well be more vague than such a definition . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the picturesque scenes painted by Salvator . No one can deny their being essentially distinct in character ; and no one , we imagine , will deny that they both please from " some quality capable of being illustrated in painting . " The beautiful female heads of Carlo Dolce are widely different from those of the picturesque peasant girls of Gerard Douw , yet both are favorite subjects with artists . A symmetrical American elm , with its wide head drooping with garlands of graceful foliage , is very different in expression from the wild and twisted larch or pine tree , which we find on the steep sides of a mountain ; yet both are favorite subjects with the painter . It is clear , indeed , that there is a widely different idea hidden under these two distinct types , in material forms . Beauty , in all natural objects , as we conceive , arises from their expression of those attributes of the Creator infinity , unity , symmetry , proportion , etc. which he has stamped more or less visibly on all his works ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual is a harmo- properly estimated among those barren copyists which we find so many of our flower , landscape , and portrait painters to be . But the artist stands much higher in the scale , who , though a copyist of visible nature , is capable of seizing it with poetic feeling , and representing it in its more dignified sense ; such , for example , as Raphael , Poussin , Claude , &c."; WEINBREUNEK. /z/ nious and well balanced development of a fine type . Thus , taking the most perfect specimens of beauty in the human figure , we see in them symmetry , proportion , unity , and grace the presence of everything that could add to the idea of perfected existence . In a beautiful tree , such as a fine American elm , we see also the most complete and perfect balance of all its parts , resulting from its growth under the most favorable influences . It realizes , then , perfectly , the finest form of a fine type or species ot tree . But all nature is not equally Beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see on all sides evidences of nature struggling with opposing forces . Mountains are upheaved by convulsions , valleys are broken into fearful chasms . Certain forms of animal and vegetable life instead of manifesting themselves in those more complete and perfect forms of existence where the matter and spirit are almost in perfect harmony , appear to struggle for the full expression of their character with the material form , and to express it only with difficulty at last . What is achieved with harmony , grace , dignity , almost with apparent repose , by existences whose type is the Beautiful , is done only with violence and disturbed action by the former . This kind of manifestation in nature we call the Picturesque . More concisely , the Beautiful is nature or art obeying the universal laws of perfect existence ( i. e . Beauty ) , easily , freely , harmoniously , and without the display of power . The Picturesque is nature or art obeying the same laws rudely , violently , irregularly , and often displaying power only . /z/ Hence we find all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infinity , * of grace , and willing obedience : and all Picturesque forms character ized by irregular and broken lines lines expressive of violence , abrupt action , and partial disobedience , a struggling of the idea with the substance or the condition of its being . The Beautiful is an idea of beauty calmly and harmoniously expressed ; the Picturesque an idea of beauty or power strongly and irregularly expressed . As an example of the Beautiful in other arts we refer to the Apollo of the Vatican ; as an example of the Picturesque , to the Laocoon or the Dying Gladiator . In nature we would place before the reader a finely formed elm or chestnut , whose wel balanced head is supported on a trunk full of symmetry and dignity , and w T hose branches almost sweep the turf in their rich luxuriance ; as a picturesque contrast , some pine or larch , whose gnarled roots grasp the rocky crag on which it grows , and whose wild and irregular branches tell of the storm and tempest that it has so often struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful confounded with the Picturesque . Yet they are quite distinct ; though in many subjects they may be found harmoniously combined . Some of Raphael 's angels may be taken as perfect illustrations of the Beautiful . In their serene and heavenly * Hogarth called the curve the line of beauty , and all artists have felt instinctvely its power , but Mr. Ruskin ( in Modem Painters ) was , we believe , the first to suggest the cause of that power that it expresses in its varying ten dencies , the infinite . f This also explains why trees , though they retain for the most part their characteristic forms , vary somewhat in expression according to their situation . Thus the larch , though always picturesque , is far more so in mountain ridges where it is exposed to every blast , than in sheltered lawns where it only finds kwft airs and sunshine . /z/ countenances we see only that calm and pure existence oi which perfect beauty is the outward type ; on the other hand , Murillo 's beggar boys are only picturesque . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not their rags or their mean apparel , but a certain irregular struggling of a better feeling within , against this outward poverty of nature and condition . Architecture borrows , partly perhaps by association , the same expression . We find the Beautiful in the most symmetrical edifices , built in the finest proportions , and of the purest materials . It is , on the other hand , in some irregular castle formed for defence , some rude mill nearly as wild as the glen where it is placed , some thatched cottage , weather stained and moss covered , that we find the Picturesque . The Temple of Jupiter Olympus in all its perfect proportions was prized by the Greeks as a model of beauty ; we , who see only a few columns and broken architraves standing with all their exquisite mouldings obliterated by the vio lence of time and the elements , find them Picturesque . To return to a more practical view of the subject , we may remark , that though we consider the Beautiful and the Picturesque quite distinct , yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same landscape . This is often seen in nature ; and indeed there are few landscapes of large extent where they are not thus harmoniously combined . But it must be remembered , that while Landscape Gardening is an imitation of nature , yet it is rarely attempted on so large a scale as to be capable of the same extended harmony and variety of expression ; and also , that in Landscape Gardening as in the other fine arts , we shall be more successful by directing our efforts towards the production /z/ of a leading character or expression , than by endeavoring to join and harmonize several . Our own views on this subject are simply these . When a place is small , and only permits a single phase of natural expression , always endeavor to heighten or to make that single expression predominate ; it should clearly either aim only at the Beautiful or the Picturesque . When , on the contrary , an estate of large size comes within the scope of the Landscape Gardener , he is at liberty to give to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he is a skilful artist , be able to create great variety both of beautiful and picturesque expression , and he will also be able to give a higher proof of his power , viz. by uniting all those scenes into one whole , by bringing them all into harmony . An artist who can do this has reached the ultimatum of his avt . Again and again has it been said , that Landscape Gardening and Painting are allied . In no one point does it appear to us that they are so , more than in this that in proportion to the limited nature of the subject should simplicity and unity of expression be remembered . In some of the finest smaller compositions of Raphael , or some of the Landscapes of Claude , so fully is this borne in mind , that every object , however small , seems to be instinct with the same expression ; while in many of the great historical pictures , unity and harmony are wrought out of the most complex variety of expression . We must not be supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandeur and Sublimity are also expressions strongly marked in many of the noblest portions of natural landscape . But , except in very rare instances , they are wholly beyond the powers of the landscape gardener , at least in the comparatively limited scale /z/ of his operations in this country . All that he has to do , is to respect them where they exist in natural landscape which forms part of his work of art , and so treat the latter , as to make it accord with , or at least not violate , the higher and predominant expression of the whole . There are , however , certain subordinate expressions which may be considered as qualities of the Beautiful , and which may originally so prevail in natural landscape , or be so elicited or created by art , as to give a distinct character to a small country residence , or portions of a large one . These are simplicity , dignity , grace , elegance , gaiety , chasteness , &c.; It is not necessary that we should go into a labored explanation of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few fine trees , scattered and grouped over any surface of smooth lawn , will give a character of simple beauty ; lofty trees of great age , hills covered with rich wood , an elevation commanding a wide country , stamp a site with dignity ; trees of full and graceful habit or gently curving forms in the lawn , walks , and all other objects , will convey the idea of grace ; as finely formed and somewhat tall trees of rare species , or a great abundance of bright climbers and gay flowering shrubs and plants , will confer characters of elegance and gaiety . He who would create in his pleasure grounds these more delicate shades of expression , must become a profound student both of nature and art ; he must be able , by his own original powers , to seize the subtle essence , the half disclosed idea involved in the finest parts of nature , and to reproduce and develope it in his Landscape Garden . Leaving such , however , to a broader range of study than a volume like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will not be unacceptable to the novice a more de- /z/ tailed sketch of the distinctive features of the Beautiful and the Picturesque , as these expressions should be embodied in Landscape Gardening . THE BEAUTIFUL in Landscape Gardening ( Fig. 13 ) is produced by outlines whose curves are flowing and gradual , surfaces of softness , and growth of richness and luxuriance . In the shape of the ground , it is evinced by easy undulations melting gradually into each other . In the form of trees , by smooth stems , full , round , or symmetrical heads of foliage , and luxuriant branches often drooping to the ground , which is chiefly attained by planting and grouping , to allow free development of form ; and by selecting trees of suitable character , as the elm , the ash , and the like . In walks and roads , by easy flowing curves , following natural shapes of the surface , with no sharp angles or abrupt turns . In water , by the smooth lake with curved margin , embellished with flowing outlines of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy winding curves of a brook . The keeping of such a scene should be of the most polished kind , grass mown into a softness like velvet , gravel walks scrupulously firm , dry , and clean ; and the most perfect order and neatness should reign throughout . Among the trees and shrubs should be conspicuous the finest foreign sorts , distinguished by beauty of form , foliage , and blossom ; and rich groups of shrubs and flowering plants should be arranged in the more dressed portions near the house . And finally , considering the house itself as a feature in the scene , it should properly belong to one of the classical modes ; and the Italian , Tuscan , or Venetian forms are preferable , because these have both a polished and a domestic air , and readily admit of the graceful accompaniments of vases , urns , and other harmonious accessories . Or , if we are to have a plainer dwelling , FIG. 13 . Example of the Beautiful in Landscape Gardening . FIG . If ) . Example of the Picturesque in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its character , and its veranda festooned with masses of the finest climbers . THE PICTURESQUE in Landscape Gardening ( Fig. 14 ) aims at the production of outlines of a certain spirited irregularity , surfaces comparatively abrupt and broken , and growth of a somewhat wild and bold character . The shape of the ground sought after , has its occasional smoothness varied by sudden variations , and in parts runs into dingles , rocky groups , and broken banks . The trees should in many places be old and irregular , with rough stems and bark ; and pines , larches , and other trees of striking , irregular growth , must appear in numbers sufficient to give character to the woody outlines . As , to produce the Beautiful , the trees are planted singly in open groups to allow full expansion , so for the Picturesque , the grouping takes every variety of form ; almost every object should group with another ; trees and shrubs are often planted closely together ; and intricacy and variety thickets glades and underwood as - in wild nature , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windings , turning off frequently at sudden angles where the form of the ground or some inviting object directs . In water , all the wildness of romantic spots in nature is to be imitated or preserved ; and the lake or stream with bold shore and rocky , wood-fringed margin , or the cascade in the secluded dell , are the characteristic forms . The keeping of such a landscape will of course be less careful than in the graceful school . Firm gravel walks near the house , and a general air of neatness in that quarter , are indispensable to the fitness of the scene in all modes , and indeed properly evince the recognition of art in all Landscape Gardening . But the lawn may be less frequently mown , the edges of /z/ the walks less carefully trimmed , where the Picturesque prevails ; while in portions more removed from the house , the walks may sometimes sink into a mere footpath without gravel , and the lawn change into the forest glade or meadow . The architecture which belongs to the picturesque landscape , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage , or some other striking forms , with bold projections , deep shadows , and irregular outlines . Rustic baskets , and similar ornaments , may abound near the house , and in the more frequented parts of the place . The recognition of art , as Loudon justly observes , is a first principle in Landscape Gardening , as in all other arts ; and those of its professors have erred , who supposed that the object of this art is merely to produce a fac-simile of nature , that could not be distinguished from a w r ild scene . But we contend that this principle may be fully attained with either expression the picturesque cottage being as well a work of art as the classic villa ; its baskets , and seats of rustic work , indicating the hand of man as well as the marble vase and balustrade ; and a walk , sometimes narrow and crooked , is as certainly recognised as man 's work , as one always regular and flowing . Foreign trees of picturesque growth are as readily obtained as those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always apparent in both modes . The evidences are indeed stronger and more multiplied in the careful polish of the Beautiful landscape , * and hence many prefer this * The beau ideal in Landscape Gardening , as a fine art , appears to us to be embraced in the creation of scenery full of expression , as the beautiful or picturesque , the materials of which are , to a certain extent , different from those in wild nature , being composed of the floral and arboricultural riches of all climates , as far as possible ; uniting in the same scene , a richness and a variety never to /z/ species of landscape , not , as it deserves to be preferred , because it displays the most beautiful and perfect ideas in its outlines , the forms of its trees , and all that enters into its composition , but chiefly because it also is marked by that careful polish , and that completeness , which imply the expenditure of money , which they so well know how to value . If we declare that the Beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called upon to explain why the Picturesque is so much more attractive to many minds . This , we conceive , is owing Dartly to the imperfection of our natures by which most of us sympathize more with that in which the struggle between spirit and matter is most apparent , than with that in which the union is harmonious and complete ; and partly because from the comparative rarity of highly picturesque landscape , it affects us more forcibly when brought into contrast with our daily life . Artists , we imagine , find somewhat of the same pleasure in studying wild landscape , where the very rocks and trees seem to struggle with the elements for foothold , that they do in contemplating the phases of the passions and instincts of human and animal life . The manifestation of power is to many minds far more captivating than that of beauty . All who enjoy the charms of Landscape Gardening , may perhaps be divided into three classes : those who have arrived only at certain primitive ideas of beauty which are found in regular forms and straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest and most perfect be found in any one portion of nature ; a scene characterized as a work of art , by the variety of the materials , as foreign trees , plants , &c.,; and by the polish and keeping of the grounds in the natural style , as distinctly as by the uniform nd symmetrical arrangement in the ancient style . /z/ development of the idea in the material form ; and those who in the Picturesque enjoy most a certain wild and incomplete harmony between the idea and the forms in which it is expressed . As the two latter classes embrace the whole range of modern Landscape Gardening , we shall keep distinctly in view their two governing principles the Beautiful and the Picturesque , in treating of the practice of the art . There are always circumstances which must exert a controlling influence over amateurs , in this country , in choosing between the two . These are , fixed locality , exuense , individual preference in the style of building , and many others which readily occur to all . The great variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford an abundance of opportunity for either taste Within the last five years , we think the Picturesque is beginning to be preferred . It has , when a suitable locality offers , great advantages for us . The raw materials of wood , water , and surface , by the margin of many of our rivers and brooks , are at once appropriated with so much effect , and so little art , in the picturesque mode ; the annual tax on the purse too is so comparatively little , and the charm so great ! While , on one hand , the residences of a country of level plains usually allow only the beauty of simple and graceful forms ; the larger demesne , with its swelling hills and noble masses of wood ( may we not , prospectively , say the rolling prairie too ? ) , should always , in the hands of the man of wealth , be made to display all the breadth , variety , and harmony of both the Beautiful and the Picturesque . There is no surface of ground , however bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to one or the other of these expressions . And the improver who detects the true /z/ character , and plants , builds , and embellishes , as he should , constantly aiming to elicit and strengthen it will soon arrive at a far higher and more satisfactory result , than one who , in the common manner , works at random . The latter may succeed in producing pleasing grounds he will undoubtedly add to the general beauty and tasteful appearance of the country , and we gladly accord him our thanks . But the improver who unites with pleasing forms an expression of sentiment , will affect not only the common eye , but much more powerfully , the imagination , and the refined and delicate taste . But there are many persons with small cottage places , of little decided character , who have neither room , time fior income , to attempt the improvement of their grounds fully , after either of those two schools . How shall they render their places tasteful and agreeable , in the easiest manner ? We answer , by attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to secure this , is by employing as leading features only trees and grass . A soft verdant lawn , a few forest or ornamental trees well grouped , walks , and a few flowers , give universal pleasure ; they contain in themselves , in fact , the basis of all our agreeable sensations in a landscape garden ( natural beauty , and the recognition of art ) ; and they are the most enduring sources of enjoyment in any place . There are no country seats in the United States so unsatisfactory and tasteless , as those in which , without any definite aim , everything is attempted ; and a mixed jumble of discordant forms , materials , ornaments , and decorations , is assembled a part in one style and a bit in another , without the least feeling of unity or congruity . These rural bedlams , full of all kinds of absurdities , without a leading character or expression of any sort , cost their /z/ owners a vast deal of trouble and money , without giving a tasteful mind a shadow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat cottage residence , with its simple , sylvan character of well kept lawn and trees . If the latter does not rank high in the scale of Landscape Gardening as an art , it embodies much of its essence as a source oi enjoyment the production of the Beautiful in country residences . Besides the beauties of form and expression in the different modes of laying out grounds , there are certain universal and nherent beauties common to all styles , and , indeed , to every composition in the fine arts . Of these , we shall especially point out those growing out of the principles of UNITY , HARMONY , and VARIETY . UNITY , or the production of a whole , is a leading principle of the highest importance , in every art of taste or design , without which no satisfactory result can be realized . This arises from the fact , that the mind can only attend , with pleasure and satisfaction , to one object , or one composite sensation , at the same time . If two distinct objects , or classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only attend satisfactorily to one , by withdrawing our attention for the time from the other . Hence the necessity of a reference to this leading principle of unity . To illustrate the subject , let us suppose a building , partially built of wood , with square windows , and the remainder of brick or stone , with long and ' narrow windows . However well such a building may be constructed , or however nicely the different proportions of the edifice may be adjusted , it is evident it can never form a satisfactory whole . The mind can only account for such an absurdity , by supposing it to have been built by two /z/ individuals , or at two different times , as there is nothing indicating unity of mind in its composition . In Landscape Gardening , violations of the principle of unity are often to be met with , and they are always indicative of the absence of correct taste in art . Looking upon a landscape from the windows of a villa residence , we sometimes see a considerable portion of the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trees and shrubs , and upon one side , or perhaps in the middle of the same scene , a formal avenue leading directly up to the house . Such a view can never appear a satisfactory whole ; because we experience a confusion of sensations in contemplating it . There is an evident incongruity in bringing two modes of arranging plantations , so totally different , under the eye at one moment , which distracts , rather than pleases the mind . In this example , the avenue , taken by itself , may be a beautiful object , and the groups and connected masses may , in themselves , be elegant ; yet if the two portions are seen together , they will not form a whole , because they can not make a composite idea . For the same reason , there is something unpleasing in the introduction of fruit trees among elegant ornamental trees on a lawn , or even in assembling together , in the same beds , flowering plants and culinary vegetables one class of vegetation suggesting the useful and homely alone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamental . In the arrangement of a large extent of surface , where a great many objects are necessarily presented to the eye at once , the principle of unity will suggest that there should be some grand or leading features to which the others should be merely subordinate . Thus , in grouping trees , there should be some large and striking masses to which the others appear to belong , however distant , instead of /z/ scattered groups , all of the same size . Even in arranging walks , a whole will more readily be recognised , if there are one or two of large size , with which the others appear connected as branches , than if all are equal in breadth , and present the same appearance to the eye in passing . In all works of art which command universal admiration we discover an unity of conception and composition , an unity of taste and execution . To assemble in a single composition forms which are discordant , and portions dissimilar in plan , can only afford pleasure for a short time to tasteless minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The production of an accordant whole is , on the contrary , capable of affording the most permanent enjoyment to educated minds , everywhere , and at all periods of time . After unity , the principle of VARIETY is worthy of consideration , as a fertile source of beauty in Landscape Gardening . Variety must be considered as belonging more to the details than to the production of a whole , and it may be attained by disposing trees and shrubs in numerous different ways ; and by the introduction of a great number ol different species of vegetation , or kinds of walks , ornamental objects , buildings , and seats . By producing intricacy , it creates in scenery a thousand points of interest , and elicits new beauties , through different arrangements and combinations of forms and colors , light and shades . In pleasuregrounds , while the whole should exhibit a general plan , the different scenes presented to the eye , one after the other , should possess sufficient variety in the detail to keep alive the interest of the spectator , and awaken further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over variety , and preventing it from becoming discordant . It , indeed , always supposes contrasts , but neither so strong nor /z/ so frequent as to produce discord ; and variety , but not so great as to destroy a leading expression . In plantations , we seek it in a combination of qualities , opposite in some respects , as in the color of the foliage , and similar in others more important , as the form . In embellishments , by a great variety of objects of interest , as sculptured vases , sun dials , or rustic seats , baskets , and arbors , of different forms , but all in accordance , or keeping with the spirit of the scene . To illustrate the three principles , with reference to Landscape Gardening , we may remark , that , if unity only were consulted , a scene might be planted with but one kind of tree , the effect of which would be sameness ; on the other hand , variety might be carried so far as to have every tree of a different kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , introduces contrast and variety , but keeps them subordinate to unity , and to the leading expres sion ; and is , thus , the highest principle of the three . In this brief abstract of the nature of imitation in Landscape Gardening and the kinds of beauty which it is possible to produce by means of the art , we have endeavored to elucidate its leading principles , clearly , to the reader . These grand principles we shall here succinctly recapitulate , premising that a familiarity with them is of the very first importance in the successful practice of this elegant art , viz. : THE IMITATION OF THE BEAUTY OF EXPRESSION , derived from a refined perception of the sentiment of nature : THE RECOGNITION OF ART , founded on the immutability of the true , as well as the beautiful : AND THE PRODUCTION OF UNITY , HARMONY , AND VARIETY , in order to render complete and continuous , our enjoyment of any artistical work . /z/ Neither the professional Landscape Gardener , nor the amateur , can hope for much success in realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make himself master of the natural character or prevailing expression of the place to be improved . In this nice perception , at a glance , of the natural expression , as well as the capabilities of a residence , lies the secret of the superior results produced even by the improver , who , to use the words of Horace Walpole , " is proud of no other art than that of softening nature 's harshness , and copying her graceful touch . " When we discover the picturesque indicated in the grounds of the residence to be treated , let us take advantage of it ; and while all harshness incompatible with scenery near the house is removed , the original expression may in most cases be heightened , in all rendered more elegant and appropriate , without lowering it in force or spirit . In like manner good taste will direct us to embellish scenery expressive of the Beautiful , by the addition of forms , whether ? n trees , buildings , or other objects , harmonious in character , as well as in color and outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasure resulting from their cultivation Mentations in the Ancient Style ; their formality . In the Modern Style ; gr ouping trees Arrangement and grouping in the Graceful school ; in the Picturesque sch ( ol . Illnstra tions in planting villa , ferme ornee , and cottage grounds .

Calls in the country , catches opening glades , Joins willing woods , and varies shades from shades ; Now breaks , or now directs the intending lines ; Paints as you plant , and , as you work , designs . " /z/ M O N G all the materials at our disposal for the embellishment of country resi.dences , none are at once so highly ornamental , so indispensable , and so easily managed , as trees , or wood . We introduce them in every part of the landscape , in the foreground as well as in the distance , on the tops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are , indeed , like the drapery which covers a somewhat ungainly figure , and while it conceals its defects , communicates to it new interest and expression . A tree , undoubtedly , is one of the most beautiful objects in nature . Airy and delicate in its youth , luxuriant and majestic in its prime , venerable and picturesque in its old /z/ age , it constitutes in its various forms , sizes , and developments , the greatest charm and beauty of the earth in all countries . The most varied outline of surface , the finest combination of picturesque materials , the stateliest country house would be comparatively tame and spiritless , without the inimitable accompaniment of foliage . Let those who have passed their whole lives in a richly wooded country , whose daily visions are deep leafy glens , forest clad hills and plains luxuriantly shaded , transport themselves for a moment to the desert , where but a few stunted bushes raise their heads above the earth , or those wild steppes where the eye wanders in vain for some " leafy garniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the wind sweeps over with unbroken fury , and they may , perhaps estimate , by contrast , their beauty and value . We are not now to enumerate the great usefulness of trees , their value in the construction of our habitations , our navies , the various implements of labor , in short , the thousand associations which they suggest as ministering to our daily wants ; but let us imagine the loveliest scene , the wildest landscape , or the most enchanting valley , despoiled of trees , and we shall find nature shorn of her fair proportions , and the character and expression of these favorite spots almost entirely destroyed . Wood , in its many shapes , is then one of the greatest sources of interest and character in Landscapes . Variety , which we need scarcely allude to as a fertile source of beauty , is created in a wonderful degree by a natural arrangement of trees . To a pile of buildings , or even of ruins , to a group of rocks or animals , they communicate new life and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some portions , and throwing others /z/ into stronger light , contribute greatly to produce intricacy and variety , and confer an expression , which , without these latter qualities , . might in a great measure be wanting . By shutting out some parts , and inclosing others , they divide the extent embraced by the eye into a hundred different landscapes , instead of one tame scene bounded by the horizon . The different seasons of the year , too , are inseparably connected in our minds with the effects produced by them on woodland scenery . Spring is joyous and enlivening to us , as nature then puts on her fresh livery of green , and the trees bud and blossom with a renewed beauty , that speaks with a mute and gentle eloquence to the heart . In summer they offer us a grateful shelter under their umbrageous arms and leafy branches , and whisper unwritten music to the passing breeze . In autumn we feel a melancholy thoughtfulness as " We stand among the fallen leaves , " and gaze upon their dying glories . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and behold in their leafless spray , and seemingly dead limbs , an annual type of that deeper mystery the deathless sleep of all being . By the judicious employment of trees in the embellishment of a country residence , we may effect the greatest alterations and improvements within the scope of Landscape Gardening . Buildings which are tame , insipid , or even mean in appearance , may be made interesting , and often picturesque , by a proper disposition of trees . Edifices , or parts of them that are unsightly , or which it is desirable partly or wholly to conceal , can readily be hidden or improved by wood ; and walks and roads , uhich otherwise would be but simple /z/ ways of approach from one point to another , are , by an elegant arrangement of trees on their margins , or adjacent to them , made the most interesting and pleasing portions of the residence . In Geometric gardening , trees disposed in formal lines , exhibit as strongly art or design in the contriver , as regu* lar architectural edifices ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are able to dispose them in our pleasure-grounds and parks , around our houses , in all the variety of groups , masses , thicket , and single trees , in such a manner as to rival the most beautiful scenery of general nature ; producing a portion of landscape which unites with all the comforts and conveniences of rural habitation , the superior charm of refined arrangement , and natural beauty of expression . If it were necessary to present any other inducement to the country gentleman to form plantations of trees , than the great beauty and value which they add to his estate , we might find it in the pleasure which all derive from their cultivation . Unlike the pleasure arising from the gratification of our taste in architecture , or any other of the arts whose productions are offered to us perfect and complete , the satisfaction arising from planting and rearing trees is never weakened . " We look , " says a writer , " upon our trees as our offspring ; and nothing of inanimate nature can be more gratifying than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing more interesting than to examine their progress , and mark their several peculiarities . In their progress from plants to trees , they every year unfold new and characteristic marks of their ultimate beauty , which not only compensate for past cares and troubles , but like the /z/ returns of gratitude , raise a most delightful train of sensations in the mind ; so innocent and rational , thai they may justly rank with the most exquisite of human enjoyments . " " Happy is he , who in a country life Shuns more perplexing toil and jarring strife- , Who lives upon the natal soil he loves , And sits beneath his old ancestral groves . " To this , let us add the complacent feelings with which a man in old age may look around him and behold these leafy monarchs , planted by his boyish hands and nurtured by him in his youthful years , which have grown aged and venerable along with him ; " A wood coeval with himself he sees , And loves his own contemporary trees . " PLANTATIONS IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plants in the ancient style of Landscape Gardening , we discover the evidences of the formal taste , abounding with every possible variety of quaint conceits , and rife with whimsical expedients , so much in fashion during the days of Henry and Elizabeth , and until the eighteenth century in England , and which is still the reigning mode in Holland , and parts of France . In these gardens , nature was tamed and subdued , or as some critics will have it , tortured into every shape which the ingenuity of the gardener could suggest ; and such kinds of vegetation as bore the shears most patiently , and when carefully trimmed , assumed gradually the appearance of verdant statues , pyramids , crowing cocks , and rampant lions , were the especial favorites of the gardeners of the old school . /z/ It has been remarked , that the geometric style would always be preferred in a new country , or in any country where the amount of land under cultivation is much less than that covered with natural woods and forests ; as the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always incline to lay out their gardens and -pleasure-grounds in regular forms , because the distinct exhibition of art would give more pleasure by contrast , than the elegant imitation of beautiful nature . That this is true as regards the mass of uncultivated minds , we do not deny . But at the same time we affirm that it evinces a meagre taste , and a lower state of the art , or a lower perception of beauty in the individual who employs the geometrical style in such cases . A person , whose place is suriounded by inimitably grand or sublime scenery , would undoubtedly fail to excite our admiration , by attempting a fac-simile imitation of such scenery on the small scale of a park or garden ; but he is not , therefore , obliged to resort to right-lined plantations and regular grass plots , to produce something which shall be at once sufficiently different to attract notice , and so beautiful as to command admiration . All that it would be requisite for him to do in such a case , would be to employ rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-chestnut and the linden , in situations where the maple and the sycamore are the principal trees , elegant flowering shrubs and beautiful creepers , instead of sumacs and hazels , and to have his place kept in high and polished order , instead of the tangled wildness of general nature . On the contrary , were a person to desire a residence newly laid out and planted , in a district where all around is in a high state of polished cultivation , as in the suburbs /z/ of a city , a species of pleasure would result from the imitation of scenery of a more spirited , natural character , as the picturesque , in his grounds . His plantations are made in irregular groups , composed chiefly of picturesque trees , as the larch , &c.; his walks would lead through varied scenes , sometimes bordered with groups of rocks overrun with flowering creepers and vines ; sometimes vith thickets or little copses of shrubs and flowering plants ; sometimes through wild and comparatively neglected portions ; the whole interspersed with open glades of turf . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of Landscape Gardening , wherever it is appreciated , will , in practice , consist in arranging a demesne of from five to some hundred acres , or rather that portion of it , say one half , one third , etc. , devoted to lawn and pleasure-ground , pasture , etc. so as to exhibit groups of forest and ornamental trees and shrubs , surrounding the dwelling of the proprietor , and extending for a greater or less distance , especially towards the place of entrance from the public highway . Near the house , good taste will dictate the assemblage of groups and masses of the rarer or more beautiful trees and shrubs ; commoner native forest trees occupying the more distant portions of the grounds. * * Although we love planting , and avow that there are few greater pleasures than to see a darling tree , of one 's own placing , every year stretching wider its feathery head of foliage , and covering wilh a darker shadow the soft turf beneath it , still , we will not let the ardent and inexperienced hunter after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of advice . This is , always to make considerable sacrifice to get a place with sorns existing wood , or a few ready grown trees upon it ; especially near the site for the house . It is better to yield a little in the extent of prospect , or in the direct proximity to a certain /z/ PLANTATIONS IN THE MODERN STYLE . In the Modern Style of Landscape Gardening , it is our aim , in plantations , to produce not only what is called natural beauty , but even higher and more striking beauty of expression , and ot individual forms , than we see in nature ; to create variety and intricacy in the grounds of a residence by various modes of arrangement ; to give a highly elegant or polished air to places by introducing rare and foreign species ; and to conceal all defects of surface , disagreeable views , unsightly buildings , or other offensive objects . As uniformity , and grandeur of single effects , were the aim of the old style of arrangement , so variety and harmony of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern landscape . And as the Avenue , or the straight line , is the leading form in the geometric arrangement of plantations , so let us enforce it upon our readers , the GROUP is equally the key-note of the Modern style . The smallest place , having only three trees , may have these pleasingly connected in a group ; and the largest and finest park the Blenheim or Chatsworth , of seven miles square , is only composed of a succession of groups , becoming masses , thickets , woods . If a demesne with the most beautiful surface and views has been for some time stiffly and locality , than to pitcn your tent in a plain , desert-like in its bareness on which your leafy sensibilities must suffer for half a dozen vears at least , before you can hope for any solace . It is doubtful whether there is not almost as much interest in studying from one 's window the curious ramifications , the variety of form , and the entire harmony , to be found in a fine old tree , as -P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panorama of the whole horizon ; and we have generally found tha no planters have so little courage and faith , as those who have commenced without the smallest group of large trees , as a nucleus for their plantations. /z/ awkwardly planted , it is exceedingly difficult to give it a natural and agreeable air ; while many a tame level , with scarcely a glimpse of distance , has been rendered lovely by its charming groups of trees . How necessary , therefore , is it , in the very outset , that the novice , before he begins to plant , should know how to arrange a tasteful group ! Nothing , at first thought , would appear easier than to arrange a few trees in the form of a natural and beautiful group , and nothing really is easier to the practised hand , Yet experience has taught us that the generality of persons , in commencing their first essays in ornamental planting , almost invariably crowd their trees into a close , regular clump , which has a most formal and unsightly appearance , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . " Natural groups are full of openings and hollows , of trees advancing before , or retiring behind each other ; all productive of intricacy , of variety , of deep shadows and brilliant lights . " The chief care , then , which is necessary in the forma tion of groups , is , not to place them in any regular or artificial manner , as one at each corner of a triangle , square , octagon , or other many-sided figure ; but so to dispose them , as that the whole may exhibit the variety , connexion , and intricacy seen in nature . " The greatest beauty of a group of trees , " says Loudon , " as far as respects their stems , is in the varied direction these take as they grow into trees ; but as that is , for all practical purposes , beyond the influence of art , all we can do , is to vary as much as possible the ground plan of groups , or the relative positions which the stems have to each other where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ even where a very few trees are used , of which any person may convince himself by placing a few dots on paper . Thus two trees ( fig. 15 ) , or a tree and shrub , which is the smallest group ( a ) , may be placed in three different positions with reference to a spectator in a fixed point ; if he moves round them , they will first vary in form separately , and next unite in one or two groups , according to the position of the spectator . In like manner , three trees may be placed in four different positions ; four trees may be placed in eight different positions ( b ) ; five trees may be grouped in ten different ways , as to ground plan ; six may be placed in twelve different ways ( c ) , and so on . " Encyclopaedia of Gard. ) /z/ Fig. 15 . Grouping of Trees . In the composition of larger masses , similar rules must /z/ be observed as in the smaller groups , in order to prevent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline must be flowing , here projecting out into the grass , there receding back into the plantation , in order to take off all appearance of stiffness and regularity . Trees of medium and smaller size should be so interspersed with those of larger growth , as to break up all formal sweeps in the line produced by the tops of their summits , and occasionally , low trees should be planted on the outer edge of the mass , to connect it with the humble verdure of the surrounding sward . In many parts of the union , where new residences are being formed , or where old ones are to be improved , the grounds will often be found , partially , or to a considerable extent , clothed with belts or masses of wood , either previously planted , or preserved from the woodman 's axe . How easily we may turn these to advantage in the natural style of Landscape Gardening ; and by judicious trimming when too thick , or additions when too much scattered , elicit often the happiest effects , in a magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate and arrange , much skill , taste , and judgment , are requisite , to enable the proprietors to preserve only what is really beautiful and picturesque , and to remove all that is superfluous . Most of our native woods , too , have grown so closely , and the trees are consequently so much drawn up , that should the improver thin out any portion , at once , to single trees , he will be greatly disappointed if he expects them to stand long ; for the first severe autumnal gale will almost certainly prostrate them . The only method , therefore , is to allow them to remain in groups of considerable size at first , and to thin them out as is finally desired , when they have made stronger roots and ' become more inured to the influence of the sun and air . /z/ But to return to grouping ; what we have already endeavored to render familiar to the reader , may be called grouping in its simple meaning - for general effect , and with an eye only to the natural beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we may , the mode of grouping in the two schools of Landscape Gardening heretofore defined , that is to say , grouping and planting for Beautiful effect , and for Picturesque effect ; as we wish it understood that these two different expressions , in artificial landscape , are always to a certain extent under our control . /z/ The elementary features of this expression our readers will remember to be fulness and softness of outline , and perfectly luxuriant development . To insure these in plantations , we must commence by choosing mainly trees of graceful habit and flowing outlines ; and of this class of trees , hereafter more fully illustrated , the American elm and the maple may be taken as the type . Next , in disposing them , they must usually be planted rather distant in the groups , and often singly . We do not mean by this , that close groups may not occasionally be formed , but there should be a predominance of trees grouped at such a distance from each other , as to allow a full development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is planted , the trees composing it should be usually of the same or a similar kind , in order that they may grow up together and form one finely rounded head . Rich creepers and blossoming vines , that grow in fine luxuriant wreaths and masses , are fit accompaniments to occasional groups in this manner . Fig. 16 represents a plan of trees grouped along a road or walk , so as to develope the Beautiful . It is proper that we should here remark , that a distinct species of after treatment is required for the two modes . Trees , or groups , where the Beautiful is aimed at , should be /z/ Fig. 16 . Grouping to produce the Beautiful.J pruned with great care , and indeed scarcely at all , except to remedy disease , or to correct a bad form . Above all , the full luxuriance and development of the tree should be encouraged by good soil , and repeated manurings when necessary ; and that most expressively elegant fall and droop of the branches , which so completely denotes the Beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimming of the lower branches , which must also be carefully preserved against cattle , whose browsing line would soon efface this most beautiful disposition in some of our fine lawn trees . Clean , smooth stems , fresh and tender bark , and a softly rounded pyramidal or drooping head , are the characteristics of a Beautiful tree . We need not add that gently sloping ground , or surfaces rolling in easy undulations , should accompany such plantations. /z/ All trees are admissible in a picturesque place , but a predominance must be used by the planter of what are truly called picturesque trees , of which the larch and fir tribe /z/ and some species of oak , may be taken as examples . In Picturesque plantations everything depends on intricacy Fig . IT Grouping to produce the Picturesque. and irregularity , and grouping , therefore , must often be done in the most irregular manner rarely , if ever , with single specimens , as every object should seem to connect itself with something else ; but most frequently there should be irregular groups , occasionally running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ; trusting to after time for any thinning , should it be necessary . Fig . IT may , as compared with Fig. 16 , give an idea of picturesque grouping . There should be more of the wildness of the finest and most forcible portions of natural woods or forests , in the disposition of the trees ; sometimes planting them closely , even two or three in the same hole , at others more loose and scattered . These will grow up into wilder and more striking forms , the barks will be deeply furrowed and rough , the limbs twisted and irregular , and the forms and outlines distinctly varied . They should often be intermixed with smaller undergrowth of a similar character , as the hazel , hawthorn , etc. , and formed into such picturesque and strik /z/ ing groups , as painters love to study and introduce into their pictures . Sturdy and bright vines , or such as are themselves picturesque in their festoons and hangings , should be allowed to clamber over occasional trees in a negligent manner ; and the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood of the mansion , may be kept short by the cropping of animals , or allowed to grow in a more careless and loose state , like that of tangled dells and natural woods . There will be the same open glades in picturesque as in beautiful plantations ; but these openings , in the former , will be bounded by groups and thickets of every form , and of different degrees of intricacy , while in the latter the eye will repose on softly rounded masses of foliage , or single open groups of trees , with finely balanced and graceful heads and branches . In order to know how a plantation in the Picturesque mode should be treated , after it is established , we should reflect a moment on what constitutes picturesqueness in any tree . This will be found to consist either in a certain natural roughness of bark , or wildness of form and outline , or in some accidental curve of a branch of striking manner of growth , or perhaps of both these conjoined . A broken or crooked limb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same base , are frequently peculiarities that at once stamp a tree as picturesque . Hence , it is easy to see that the excessive care of the cultivator of trees in the graceful school to obtain the smoothest trunks , and the most sweeping , perfect , and luxuriant heads of foliage , is quite the opposite of what is the picturesque arboriculturist 's ambition . He desires to encourage a certain wildness of growth , and allows his trees to spring up occasionally in thickets /z/ to assist this effect ; he delights in occasional irregularity of stem and outline , and he therefore suffers his trees here and there to crowd each other ; he admires a twisted limb or a moss covered branch , and in pruning he therefore is careful to leave precisely what it would be the aim of the other to remove ; and his pruning , where it is at all necessary , is directed rather towards increasing the naturally striking and peculiar habit of the picturesque tree , than assisting it in developing a form of unusual refinement and symmetry . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that planting , grouping , and culture to produce the Beautiful , require a much less artistic eye ( though much more care and attention ) than performing the same operations to elicit the Picturesque . The charm of a refined and polished landscape garden , as we usually see it in the Beautiful grounds with all the richness and beauty developed by high culture , arises from our admiration of the highest perfection , the greatest beauty of form , to which every object can be brought ; and , in trees , a judicious selection , with high cultivation , will always produce this effect . But in the Picturesque landscape garden there is visible a piquancy of effect , certain bold and striking growths and combinations , which we feel at once , if we know them to be the result of art , to be the production of a peculiar species of attention not merely good , or even refined ornamental gardening . In short , no one can be a picturesque improver ( if he has to begin with young plantations ) who is not himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artistical eye and who is not capable of imitating , eliciting , or heightening , in his plantations or other portions of his residence , the picturesque /z/ in its many variations . And we may add here , that efficient and charming as is the assistance which all ornamental planters will derive from the study of the best landscape engravings and pictures of distinguished artists , they are indispensably necessary to the picturesque im prover . In these he will often find embodied the choicest and most captivating studies from picturesque nature ; and will see at a glance the effect of certain combinations of trees , which he might otherwise puzzle himself a dozen years to know how to produce After all , as the picturesque improver here will most generally be found to be one who chooses a comparatively wild and wooded place , we may safely say that , if he has the true feeling for his work , he will always find it vastly easier than those who strive after the Beautiful ; as the majority of the latter may be said to begin nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for openness and the smiling , sunny , undulating plain , where they must of course to a good extent plant anew . After becoming well acquainted with grouping , we should bring ourselves to regard those principles which govern our improvements as a whole . We therefore must call the attention of the improver to the two following principles , which are to be constantly in view : the production of a whole , and the proper connexion of the parts . Any person who will take the trouble to reflect for a moment on the great diversity of surface , change of position , aspects , views , etc. , in different country residences , will at once perceive how difficult , or , indeed , how impossible it is , to lay down any fixed or exact rules for arranging plantations in the modern style . What would be precisely adapted to a hilly rolling park , would often be found entire- 8t LANDSCAPE GARDENING . ly unfit for adoption in a smooth , level surface , and the contrary . Indeed , the chief beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few leading principles , and applying them to different and varied localities ; un like the geometric style , which proceeded to level , and arrange , and erect its avenues and squares , alike in every situation , with all the precision and certainty of mathematical demonstration . In all grounds to be laid out , however , which are of a lawn or park-like extent , and call for the exercise of judgment and taste , the mansion or dwelling-house , being itself the chief or leading object in the scene , should form , as it were , the central point , to which it should be the object of the planter to give importance . In order to do this effectually , the large masses or groups of wood should cluster round , or form the back-ground to the main edifice ; and where the offices or out-buildings approach the same neighborhood , they also should be embraced . We do not mean by this to convey the idea , that a thick wood should be planted around and in the close neighborhood of the mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air ; but its appearance and advantages may be easily produced by a comparatively loose plantation of groups well connected by intermediate trees , so as to give all the effect of a large mass . The front , and at least that side nearest the approach road , will be left open , or nearly so ; while the plantations on the back-ground will give dignity and importance to the house , and at the same time effectually screen the approach to the farm buildings , and other objects which require to be kept out of view ; and here both for the purposes of shelter and richness of effect , a good proportion of evergreens should be introduced . /z/ From this principal mass , the plantations must break oft ' in groups of greater or less size , corresponding to the extent covered by it ; if large , they will diverge into masses of considerable magnitude , if of moderate size , in groups made up of a number of trees . In the lawn front of the house , appropriate places will be found for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small groups of trees , remarkable for the beauty of their forms , foliage , or blossoms . Care must be taken , however , in disposing these , as well as many of the groups , that they are not placed so as , at some future time , to interrupt or disturb the finest points of prospect . In more distant parts of the plantations will also appealmasses of considerable extent , perhaps upon the boundary line , perhaps in particular situations on the sides , or in the interior of the whole ; and the various groups which are distributed between should be so managed as , though in most cases distinct , yet to appear to be the connecting links which unite these distant shadows in the composition , with the larger masses near the house . Sometimes several small groups will be almost joined together ; at others the effect may be kept up by a small group , aided by a few neighboring single trees . This , for a park-like place . Where the place is small , a pleasure-ground character is all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only a few trees , very similar and highly beautiful effects may be attained . The grand object in all this should b.e.to open to the eye , from the windows or front of the house , a wide surface , partially broken up and divided by groups and masses of trees into a number of pleasing lawns or openings , differing in size and appearance , and producing /z/ a charming variety in the scene , either when seen from a given point or when examined in detail . It must not be forgotten that , as a general rule , the grass or surface of the lawn answers as the principal light , and the woods or plantations as the shadows , in the same manner in nature as in painting ; and that these should be so managed as to lead the eye to the mansion as the most important object when seen from without , or correspond to it in grandeur and magnitude , when looked upon from within the house . If the surface is too much crowded with groups of foliage , breadth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be felt , on the other hand , an absence of the noble effect of deep and broad shadows . One of the loveliest charms of a fine park is , undoubtedly , variation or undulation of surface . Everything , accordingly , which tends to preserve and strengthen this pleasing character , should be kept constantly in view . Where , therefore , there are no obvious objections to such a course , the eminences , gentle swells , or hills , should be planted , in preference to the hollows or depressions . By planting the elevated portions of the grounds , theii apparent height is increased ; but by planting the hollows , all distinction is lessened and broken up . Indeed , where there is but a trifling and scarcely perceptible undulation the importance of the swells of surface already existing is surprisingly increased , when this course of planting is adopted ; and the whole , to the eye , appears finely varied . Where the grounds of the residence to be planted are level , or nearly so , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the lawn or park itself , the boundarv groups and masses must be so connected together as . froru /z/ the most striking part or parts of the prospect ( near the house for example ) to answer this end . This should be done , not by planting a continuous , uniformly thick belt of trees round the outside of the whole ; but by so arranging the various outer groups and thickets , that when seenfro ? n the given points they shall appear connected in one whole . In this way , there will be an agreeable variation in the margin , made by the various bays , recesses , and detached projections , which could not be so well effected if the whole were one uniformly unbroken strip of wood . But where the house is so elevated as to command a more extensive view than is comprised in the demesne itself , another course should be adopted . The grounds planted must be made to connect themselves with the surrounding scenery , so as not to produce any violent contrast to the eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is most frequently the case , the lawn or pleasure-ground join , on either side or sides , cultivated farm lands , the proper connexion may be kept up by advancing a few groups or even scattered trees into the neighboring fields . In the middle states there are but few cultivated fields , even in ordinary farms , where there is not to be seen , here and there , a handsome cluster of saplings or a few full grown trees ; or if not these , at least some tall growing bushes along the fences , all of which , by a little exercise of this leading principle of connexion , can , by the planter of taste , be made to appear with few or trifling additions , to divaricate from , and ramble out of the park itself . Where the park joins natural woods , connexion is still easier , and where it bounds upon one of our noble rivers , lakes , or other large sneeis of water , of course connexion is not expected ; foi /z/ sudden contrast and transition is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suggest that the more polished parts of the lawns and grounds should , whatever character is attempted , be those nearest the house . There the most rare and beautiful sorts of trees are displayed , and the entire plantations agree in elegance with the style of art evinced in the mansion itself . When there is much extent , however , as the eye wanders from the neighborhood of the residence , the whole evinces less polish ; and gradually , towards the furthest extremities , grows ruder , until it assimilates itself to the wildness of general nature around . This , of course , applies to grounds of large extent , and must not be so much enforced where the lawn embraced is but moderate , and therefore comes more directly under the eye . It will be remembered that , in the foregoing section , we stated it as one of the leading principles of the art of Landscape Gardening , that in every instance where the grounds of a country residence have a marked natural character , whether of beautiful or picturesque expression , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes by his art to aid and strengthen that expression . This should ever be borne in mind when we are commencing any improvements in planting that will affect the general expression of the scene , as there are but few country residences in the United States of any importance which have not naturally some distinct landscape character ; and the labors of the improver will be productive of much greater satisfaction and more lasting pleasure , when they aim at effects in keeping with the whole scene , than if no egard be paid to this important point . This will be felt almost /z/ intuitively by persons who , perhaps , would themselves be incapable of describing the cause of their gratification , but would perceive the contrary at once ; as many are unable to analyse the pleasure derived from harmony in music , while they at once perceive the introduction of discordant notes . We do not intend that this principle should apply so closely , that extensive grounds naturally picturesque shall have nothing of the softening touches of more perfect beauty ; or that a demesne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few " smart touches " of the former . This is often necessary , indeed , to prevent tame scenery from degenerating into insipidity , or picturesque into wildness , too great to be appropriate in a country residence . Picturesque trees give new spirit to groups of highly beautiful ones , and the latter sometimes heighten by contrast the value of the former . All of which , however , does not prevent the predominance of the leading features of either style , sufficiently strong to mark it as such ; while , occasionally , something of zest or elegance may be borrowed from the opposite character , to suit the wishes or gratify the taste of the proprietor . GROUND PLANS OF ORNAMENTAL PLANTATIONS . To illustrate partially our ideas on the arrangement of plantations we place before the reader two or three examples , premising that the small scale to which they are reduced prevents our giving to them any character beyond that of the general one of the design . The first ( Fig. 20 ) represents a portion , say one third or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal , and which has hitherto been kept in tillage as ordinary farm land . The public /z/ Fig. 18 . Plan of a common Farm , before any improvements. road , a , is the boundary on one side : dd are prettily wooded dells or hollows , which , together with a few groups near the proposed site of the house , c , and a few scattered single trees , make up the aggregate of the original woody embellishments of the locality . In the next figure ( Fig. 19 ) a ground plan of the place is given , as it would appear after having been judiciously laid out and planted , with several years ' growth . At , the approach road leaves the public highway and leads to the house at c : from whence paths of smaller size , b , make the circuit of the ornamental portion of the residence , taking advantage of the wooded dells , d , originally existing , which offer some scope for varied walks concealed from each other by the intervening masses of thicket . It wi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing grounds as a Country Seat , after ten years ' improvement be seen here , that one of the largest masses of wood forms a background to the house , concealing also the out-buildings ; while , from the windows of the mansion itself , the trees are so arranged as to group in the most pleasing and effective manner ; at the same time broad masses of turf meet the eye , and fine distant views are had through the vistas in the lines , e e . In this manner the lawn appears divided into four distinct lawns or areas bounded by groups of trees , instead of being dotted over with an unmeaning confusion of irregular masses of foliage . The form of these areas varies also with every change of position in the spectator , as seen from different portions of the grounds , or different points in the walks ; and they can be still further varied at pleasure by adding more single trees or small groups , which should always , to produce variety of outline , be /z/ placed opposite the salient parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which latter they would appear to diminish or clog up . The stables are shown at / ; the barn at g , and the kitchen garden adjacent at h ; the orchard at i ; and a small portion of the farm lands at k ; a back entrance to the out-buildings is shown in the rear of the orchard . The plan has been given for a place of seventy acres , thirty of which include the pleasure grounds , and forty the adjoining farm lands . Figure 20 is the plan of an American mansion . Plan of a Mansion Residence , laid out in the natiaral style . " /z/ residence of considerable extent , only part of the farm lands , / , being here delineated . In this residence , as there Is no extensive view worth preserving beyond the bounds of the estate , the pleasure grounds are surrounded by an irregular and picturesque belt of wood . A fine natural stream or rivulet , which ran through the estate , has been formed into a handsome pond , or small lake , / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The approach road breaks off from the highway at the entrance lodge , z , and proceeds in easy curves to the mansion , b ; and the groups of trees on the side of this approach nearest the house , are so arranged that the visitor scarcely obtains more than a glimpse of the latter , until he arrives at the most favorable position for a first impression . From the windows of the mansion , at either end , the eye ranges over groups of flowers and shrubs ; while , on the entrance front , the trees are arranged so as to heighten the natural expression originally existing there . On the other front , the broad mass of light reflected from the green turf at A , is balanced by the dark shadows of the picturesque plantations which surround the lake , and skirt the whole boundary . At i , a light , inconspicuous wire fence separates that portion of the ground , g , ornamented with flowering shrubs and kept mown by the scythe , from the remainder , of a park-like character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At c , are shown the stables , carriage house , etc. , which , though near the approach road , are concealed by foliage , though easily accessible by a short curved road , returning from the house , so as not to present any road leading in the same direction , to detract from the dignity of the approach in going to it . A prospect tower , or rustic pavilion , on a little eminence /z/ overlooking the whole estate , is shown at j . The small arabesque beds near the house are filled with masses of choice flowering shrubs and plants ; the kitchen garden is shown at d , and the orchard at e . Suburban villa residences are , every day , becoming more numerous ; and in laying out the grounds around them , and disposing the sylvan features , there is often more ingenuity , and as much taste required , as in treating a country residence of several hundred acres . In the small area of from one half an acre to ten or twelve acres , surrounding often a villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the same features , and as much as possible of the enjoyment , which are to be found in a large and elegant estate . To do this , the space allotted to various purposes , as the kitchen garden , lawn , etc. , must be judiciously portioned out , and so characterized and divided by plantations , that the whole shall appear to be much larger than it really is , from the fact that the spectator is never allowed to see the whole at a single glance ; but while each portion is complete in itself , the plan shall present nothing incongruous or ill assorted . An excellent illustration of this species of residence , is afforded the reader in the accompanying plan ( Fig. 21 ) of the grounds of Riverside Villa . This pretty villa at Burlington , New Jersey ( to which we shah again refer ) , was lately built , and the grounds , about six or eight acres in extent , laid out , from the designs of John Notman , Esq. , architect , of Philadelphia ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment , scarcely anything which can be supposed necessary for the convenience or wants of the family , is lost sight of . The house , a , stands auite near the bank of the river , /z/ Fig. 21 . Plan of a Sulmrban Villa Residence. while one front commands fine water views , and the other looks into the lawn or pleasure grounds , b . On one side of the area is the kitchen garden , c , separated and concealed from the lawn by thick groups of evergreen and deciduous trees . At e , is a picturesque orchard , in which the fruit trees are planted in groups instead of straight lines , for the sake of effect . Directly under the windows of the drawing-room is the flower garden , y , * and /z/ at g , is a seat . The walk around the lawn is also a carriage road , affording entrance and egress from the rear of the grounds , for garden purposes , as well as from the front of the house . At h , is situated the ice-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i , gardener 's house , etc . In the rear of the latter are the stables , which are not shown on the plan . The embellished farm ( ferme ornee ) is a pretty mode of combining something of the beauty of the landscape garden with the utility of the farm , and we hope to see small country seats of this kind become more general . As regards profit in farming , of course , all modes of arranging or distributing land are inferior to simple square fields ; on account of the greater facility of working the land in rectangular plots . But we suppose the owner of the small ornamental farm to be one with whom profit is not the first and only consideration , but who desires to unite with it something to gratify his taste , and to give a higher charm to his rural occupations . In Fig. 22 , is shown part of an embellished farm , . treated in the picturesque style throughout . The various trees , under grass or tillage , are divided and bounded by winding roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hawthorn , instead of wooden fences ; the roads being wide enough to afford a pleasant drive or walk , so as to allow the owner or visitor to enjoy at the same time an agreeable circuit , and a glance at all the various crops and modes of culture . In the plan before us , the approach from the public road is at b ; the dwelling at c ; the barns and far:n-buildings at d ; the kitchen garden at e ; and the orchard at f . About the house are distributed some groups of trees , and here the fields , g , are kept in grass , and are either mown /z/ Fig. 22 . View of a Picturesque farm ( fcrme ornie ) . or pastured . The fields in crops are designated h , on the plan ; and a few picturesque groups of trees are planted , or allowed to remain , in these , to keep up the general character of the place . A low *dell , or rocky thicket , is situated at i , . Exceedingly interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a picturesque farm of this kind . The hedges may be of a great variety of suitable shrubs , and , in addition to those that we have named , we would introduce others of the sweet brier , the Michigan or prairie rose ( admirably adapted for the purpose ) , the flowering crab , and the like beautiful and fragrant in their growth and blossoms . These hedges we would cause to grow thick , rather by interlacing the branches , than by constant shearing or trimming , which would give them a less formal , and a more free and natural air . The winding lanes traversing the farm need /z/ only be gravelled near the house , in other portions being left in grass , which will need little care , as it will generally be kept short enough by the passing of men and vehicles over it . A picturesque or ornamental farm like this would be an agreeable residence for a gentleman retiring into the country on a small farm , desirous of experimenting for himself with all the new modes of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be rather an advantage , and there would be an air of novelty and interest about the whole residence . Such an arrangement as this would also be suitable for a fruit farm near one of our large towns , the fields being occupied by orchards , vines , grass , and grain . The house and all the buildings should be of a simple , though picturesque and accordant character . The cottage ornee may have more or less ground attached to it . It is the ambition of some to have a great house arid little land , and of others ( among whom we remember the poet Cowley ) to have a little house and a large garden . The latter would seem to be the more natural taste . When the grounds of a cottage are large , they will be treated by the landscape gardener nearly like those of a villa residence ; when they are smaller a more quiet and simple character must be aimed at . But even where they consist of only a rood or two , something tasteful and pretty may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small piece of ground on one side of a cottage , in which a picturesque characters attempted to be maintained . The plantations here are made mostly with shrubs instead of trees , the latter being /z/ only sparingly introduced for the want of room . In the disposition of these shrubs , however , the same attention to picturesque effect is paid as we have already pointed out in our remarks on grouping ; and by connecting the thickets and groups here and there , so as to conceal one walk from the other , a surprising variety and effect will frequently be produced in an exceedingly limited spot . The same limited grounds might be planted so as to produce the Beautiful ; choosing , in this case , shrubs of symmetrical growth and fine forms , planting and grouping them somewhat singly , and allowing every specimen to attain its fullest luxuriance of development . In making these arrangements , Fig. 23 . Grounds of a Cottage omee , . even in the small area of a fourth of an acre , we should study the same principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if we were improving a mansion residence o r the first class . The extent of the operations , and the sums lavished , are not by any means necessarily connected with successful and pleasing results . The man of correct taste will , by the aid of very limited means and upon a small surface , be able to afford the mind more true pleasure , than the improver who lavishes thousands without it , creating no other emotion than surprise or pity at the useless expenditure incurred ; and the Abbe Delille says nothing more true than that , Ce noble emploi demand un artiste qui pense , Prodigue de genie , et non pas de depense. " /z/ From the inspection of plans like these , the tyro may learn something of the manner of arranging plantations , and of the general effect of the natural style in particular cases and situations . But the knowledge they afford is so far below that obtained by an inspection of the effects in reality , that the latter should in all cases be preferred where it is practicable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost impossible that the same plan should exactly suit any other situation than that for which it was intended , for its great excellence lies in the endless variety produced by its application to different sites , situations , and surfaces ; developing the latent capacities of one place and heightening the charms of another . But the leading principles as regards the formation of plantations , which we have here endeavored briefly to elucidate , are the same in all cases . After becoming familiar with these , should the amateur landscape gardener be at a loss how to proceed , he can hardly do better , as we have before suggested , than to study and recur often to the beautiful compositions and combinations of nature , displayed in her majestic groups , masses , and single trees , as well as open glades and deep thickets ; of which , fortunately , in most parts of our country , checkered here and there as it is with beautiful and picturesque scenery , there is no dearth or scarcity . Keeping these few principles in his mind , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own estate ; for nature is truly inexhaustible in her resources of the Beautiful . CLASSIFICATION OF TREES AS TO EXPRESSION . The amateur who wishes to dispose his plantations in the natural style of Landscape Gardening so as to produce graceful or picturesque landscape , will be greatly aided by a study /z/ of the peculiar expression of trees individually and in com position . The effect of a certain tree singly is often exceedingly different from that of a group of the same trees . To be fully aware of the effect of groups and masses requires considerable study , and the progress in this study may be greatly facilitated by a recurrence from groups in nature to groups in pictures . As a further aid to this most desirable species of information we shall offer a few remarks on the principal varieties of character afforded by trees in composition . Almost all trees , with relation to forms , may be divided into three kinds , viz. round-headed trees , oblong or pyramidal trees , and spiry-topped trees ; and so far as the expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are , especially when viewed at a distance ( as much of the wood seen in a prospect of any extent necessarily must be ) , productive oi nearly the same general effects . Round-headed trees compose by far the largest of these divisions . The term includes all those trees which have an irregular surface in their boughs , more or less varied in outline , but exhibiting in the Tre " s d whole a top or head comparatively round ; as the oak , ash , beech , and walnut . They are generally beautiful when young , from their smoothness , and the elegance of their forms ; but often grow picturesque when age and time have had an opportunity to produce their wonted effects upon them . In general , however , the different round-headed trees may be considered as the most appropriate for introduction in highly-cultivated scenery , or landscapes where the character is that of graceful or polished beauty ; as they harmonize with almost all scenes , /z/ buildings , and natural or artificial objects , uniting well with other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous breaks in the surface of their foliage , which reflect differently the lights and produce deep shadows , there is great intricacy and variety in the heads of many round-topped trees ; and therefore , as an outer surface to meet the eye in a plantation , they are much softer and more pleasing than the unbroken line exhibited by the sides of oblong or spiry-topped trees . The sky outline also , or the upper part of the head , varies greatly in round-topped trees from the irregularity in the disposition of the upper branches in different species , as the oak and ash , or even between individual specimens of the same kind of tree , as the oak , of which we rarely see two trees alike in form and outline , although they have the same characteristic expression ; while on the other hand no two verdant objects can bear a greater general resemblance to each other and show more sameness ol figure than two Lombardy poplars . " In a tree , " says Uvedale Price , " of which the foliage is everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form ; then , as the sun strikes only on the surface , neither can there be much variety of light and shade ; and as the apparent color of objects changes according to the different degrees of light or shade in which they are placed , there can be as little variety of tint ; and lastly , as there are none of these openings that excite and nourish curiosity , but the eye is everywhere opposed by one uniform leafy screen , there can be as little intricacy as variety . " From these remarks , it will be perceived that even among round-headed trees there may be great difference in the comparative beauty ot /z/ different sorts ; and judging from the excellent standard here laid down , it will also be seen how much in the eye of a painter a tree with a beautifully diversified surface , as the oak , surpasses in the composition of a scene one with a very regular and compact surface and outline , as the horse-chestnut . In planting large masses of wood , therefore , or even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary loose and varied manner of growth common in the majority of forest trees , are greatly to be preferred to all others . When they cover large tracts , as several acres , they convey an emotion of grandeur to the mind ; when they form vast forests of thousands of acres , they produce a , feeling of sublimity ; in the landscape garden when they stand alone , or in fine groups , they are graceful or beautiful . While young they have an elegant appearance ; when old they generally become majestic or picturesque . Other trees may suit scenery or scenes of particular and decided characters , but round-headed trees are decidedly the chief adornment of general landscape . Spiry-topped trees ( Fig. 25 ) are distinguished by straight leading stems and horizontal branches , which are comparatively small , and taper gradually to a point . The foliage is generally evergreen , and in most trees of this class Fig. 25. spuy-topped hangg in para u e i or drooping tufts from the branches . The various evergreen trees , composing the spruce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and among deciduous trees , the larch , belong to this division . Their hue is generally much darker than that of deciduous trees , and there is a strong similarity , oj /z/ almost sameness , in the different kinds of trees which may properly be called spiry-topped . From their sameness of form and surface this class of trees , when planted in large tracts or masses , gives much less pleasure than round-headed trees ; and the eye is soon wearied with the monotony of appearance presented by long rows , groups , or masses , of the same form , outline , and appearance ; to say nothing of the effect of the uniform dark color , unrelieved by the warmer tints of deciduous trees . Any one can bear testimony to this , who has travelled through a pine , hemlock , or fir forest , where he could not fail to be struck with its gloom , tediousness , and monotony , especially when contrasted with the variety and beauty in a natural wood of deciduous , round-headed trees . Although spiry-topped trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet they have a character of their own , which is very striking and peculiar , and we may add , in a high degree valuable to the Landscape Gardener . Their general expression when single or scattered is extremely spirited , wild , and picturesque ; and when judiciously introduced into artificial scenery , they produce the most charming and unique effects . " The situations where they have most effect is among rocks arid in very irregular surfaces , and especially on the steep sides of high mountains , where their forms and the direction of their growth seem to harmonize with the pointed rocky summits . " Fir and pine forests are extremely dull and monotonous in sandy plains and smooth surfaces ( as in the pine barrens of the southern states ) ; but among the broken rocks , craggy precipices , /z/ and otherwise endlessly varied surfaces ( as in the Alps , abroad , and the various rocky heights in the Highlands of the Hudson and the Alleghanies , at home ) they are full of variety . It will readily be seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable quantities in wild , broken , and picturesque scenes , where they will appear perfectly in keeping , and add wonderfully to the peculiar beauty of the situation . In all grounds where there are abruptly varied surfaces , steep banks , or rocky precipices , this class of trees lends its efficient aid to strengthen the prevailing beauty , and to complete the finish of the picture . In smooth , level surfaces , though spiry-topped trees can not be thus extensively employee they are by no means to be neglected or thought valueless , but may be so combined and mingled with other roundheaded and oblong-headed trees , as to produce very rich and pleasing effects . A tall larch or two , or a few spruces rising out of the centre of a group , give it life and spirit , and add greatly , both by contrast of form and color , to the force of round-headed trees . A stately and regular white pine or hemlock , or a few thin groups of the same trees peeping out from amidst , or bordering a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interest which the same awakens in the mind of the spectator . Care must be taken , however , that the very spirited effect which is here aimed at , is not itself defeated by the over anxiety of the planter , who , in scattering too profusely these very strongly marked trees , makes them at last so plentiful , as to give the whole a mingled and confused look , in which neither the graceful and sweeping outlines of the round-headed nor the picturesque . summits of the spiry-topped trees predominate ; as the former decidedly /z/ should , in all scenes where an expression of peculiarly irregular kind is not aimed at . The larch , to which we shall hereafter recur at some length , may be considered one of the most picturesque trees of this division ; and being more rapid in its growth than most evergreens , it may be used as a substitute for , or in conjunction with them , where effect is speedily desired . Oblong-headed trees show heads of foliage more lengthened out , more formal , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirytopped trees in having upright branches instead of horizontal ones , and in forming a conical or ueeslf pyramidal mass of foliage , instead of a spiry , tufted one . They are mostly deciduous ; and approaching more nearly to round-headed trees than spiry-topped ones do , they may perhaps be more frequently introduced . The Lombardy poplar may be considered the representative of this division , as the oak is of the first , and the larch and fir of the second . Abroad , the oriental cypress , an evergreen , is used to produce similar effects in scenery . The great use of the Lombardy poplar , and other similar trees in composition , is to relieve or break into groups , large masses of wood . This it does very effectually , when its tall summit rises at intervals from among round - headed trees , forming pyramidal centres to groups where there was only a swelling and flowing outline . Formal rows , or groups of oblong-headed trees , however , are tiresome and monotonous to the last degree , a straight line of them being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic hedge . Examples of this can be /z/ easily found in many parts of the Union where the crude and formal taste of proprietors , by leading them to plant long lines of Lombardy poplars , has had the effect of destroying the beauty of many a fine prospect and building . Conical or oblong-headed trees , when carefully employed , are very effective for purposes of contrast , in conjunction with horizontal lines of buildings such as we see in Grecian or Italian architecture . Near such edifices , sparingly introduced , and mingled in small proportion with round-headed trees , they contrast advantageously with the long cornices , flat roofs , and horizontal lines that predominate in their exteriors . Lombardy poplars are often thus introduced in pictures of Italian scenery , where they sometimes break the formality of a long line of wall in the happiest manner . Nevertheless , if they should be indiscriminately employed , or even used in any considerable portion in the decoration of the ground immediately adjoining a building of any pretensions , they would inevitably defeat this purpose , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the elegance of the house . Drooping trees , though often classed with oblongheaded trees , differ from them in so many particulars , that they deserve to be ranked under a separate head . To this class belong the weeping willow , the weeping birch , the drooping elm , etc . Their prominent characteristics are gracefulness and elegance ; and we consider them as unfit , therefore , to be employed to any extent in scenes where it is desirable to keep up the expression of a wild or highly picturesque character . As single objects , or tastefully grouped in beautiful landscape , they /z/ are in excellent keeping , and contribute much to give value to the leading expression . When drooping trees are mixed indiscriminately with other round-headed trees in the composition of groups or masses , much of their individual character is lost , as it depends not so much on the top ( as in oblong and spiry trees ) as upon the side branches , which are of course concealed by those of the adjoining trees . Drooping trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown to the best advantage on the borders of groups or the boundaries of plantations . It must not be forgotten , but constantly kept in mind , that all strongly marked trees , like bright colors in pictures , only admit of occasional employment ; and that the very object aimed at in introducing them will be defeated if they are brought into the lawn and park in masses , and distributed heedlessly on every side . An English author very justly remarks , therefore , that the poplar , the willow , and the drooping birch , are " most dangerous trees in the hands of a planter who has not considerable knowledge and good taste in the composition of a landscape . " Some of them , as the native elm , from their abounding in oui own woods , may appear oftener ; while others which have a peculiar and exotic look , as the weeping willow , should only be seen in situations where they either do not disturb the prevailing expression , or ( which is better ) where they are evidently in good keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his usual good taste , " is not adapted to sublime objects . We wish it not to screen the broken buttress and Gothic windows of an abbey , or to overshadow the battlements of a ruined castle . These offices it resigns to the oak , whose dignity can /z/ Ill support them . The weeping willow seeks an humble scene some romantic footpath bridge , which it half conceals , or some grassy pool over which it hangs its streaming foliage , ' And dips Fig. 27 . Trees in keeping . Its pendent boughs , as if to drink . ' " * The manner in which a picturesque bit of landscape can be supported by picturesque spiry-topped trees , and its expression degraded by the injudicious employment of graceful drooping trees , will be apparent to the reader in the two accompanying little sketches . In the first ( Fig. 27 ) , the abrupt hill , the rapid mountain torrent , and the distant Alpine summits , are in fine keeping with the tall spiry larches and firs , which , shooting up on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the second ( Fig. 30 ) , there is evidently something discordant in the scene which strikes the spectator at first sight ; this is the misplaced introduction of the large willows , which belong to a scene very different in character . Imagine a removal of the surrounding hills , and let the rapid stream spread out into a smooth peaceful lake with graduilly retiring shores , and the blue summits in the distance and then the willows will harmonize admirably . Having now described the peculiar characteristics of these different classes of round-headed , spiry-topped oblong , and drooping trees ' , we should consider the proper /z/ method by which a harmonious combination of the different forms composing them may be made so as not to violate correct principles of taste . An indiscriminate mixture of their different forms would , it is evident , produce anything but an agreeable effect . For example , let a person plant together in a group , three trees of totally opposite forms and expressions , viz. a weeping willow , an oak , and a poplar ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from their discordant forms . On the other hand , the mixture of trees that exactly correspond in their forms , if these forms , as in oblong or drooping trees , are similar , will infallibly create sameness . In order then to produce beautiful variety which shall neither on the one side run into confusion , nor on the other verge into monotony , it is requisite to give some little attention to the harmony of form and color in the composition of trees in artificial plantations . The only rules which we can suggest to govern the planter are these : First , if a certain leading expression is desired in a group of trees , together with as great a variety as possible , such species must be chosen as harmonize with each other in certain leading points . And , secondly , in occasionally intermingling trees of opposite characters , discordance may be prevented , and harmonious expression promoted , by interposing other trees of an intermediate character . In the first case , suppose it is desired to form a group of trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow alone would have the effect ; but in groups , willows alone produce sameness : in order therefore , to give variety , we must choose other trees /z/ which , while they differ from the willow in some particulars , agree in others . The elm has mucn larger and darker foliage , while it has also a drooping spray ; the weeping birch differs in its leaves , but agrees in the pensile flow of its branches ; the common birch has few pendent boughs , but resembles in the airy lightness of its leaves ; and the three-thorned acacia , though its branches are horizontal , has delicate foliage of nearly the same hue and floating lightness as the willow . Here we have a group of five trees , which is , in the whole , full of gracefulness and variety , while there is nothing in the composition inharmonious to the practised eye . To illustrate the second case , let us suppose a long sweeping outline of maples , birches , and other light , mellow-colored trees , which the improver wishes to vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is evident , that if these trees were planted in such a manner as to peer abruptly out of the light-colored foliage of the former trees , in dark or almost black masses of tapering verdure , the effect would be by no means so satisfactory and pleasing , as if there were a partial transition from the mellow , pale green of the maples , etc. , to the darker hues of the oak , ash , or beech , and finally the sombre tint of the evergreens . Thus much for the coloring ; and if , in addition to this , oblong-headed trees or pyramidal trees were also placed near and partly intermingled with the spiry-topped ones , the unity of the whole composition would be still more complete. * * We are pera aaded that very few persons are aware of the beauty , varied and endless , that may be produced by arranging trees with regard to their coloring . It requires the eye and genius of a Claude or a Poussin , to ievelope all these hidden beauties of harmonious combination . Gilpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woody scenery ; and we would not wish to lose many of our most superb trees , because they could not be introduced in particular portions of landscape . Contrasts in trees may be so violent as to be displeasing ; as in the example of the groups of the three trees , the willow , poplar , and oak : or they may be such as to produce spirited and pleasing effects . This must be effected by planting the different divisions of trees , first , in small leading groups , and then by effecting a union between the groups of different character , by intermingling those of the nearest similarity into and near the groups : in this way , by easy transitions from the drooping to the round-headed , and from these to the tapering trees , the whole of the foliage and forms harmonize well . Fig. 29 . Example in grouping . " Trees , " observes Mr. Whately , in his elegant treatise on this subject , " which differ in but one of these circumstances , of shape , green , or growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished for the pays , in speaking of the dark Scotch fir , " with regard to color in general , 1 /hink I speak the language of painting , when I assert that the picturesque eye makes little distinction in this matter . It has no attachment to one color in preference to another , but considers the beauty of all coloring as resulting , not from the colors themselves , but almost entirely from their harmony with other eolors in their neighborhood . So that as the Scotch fir tree is combined or stationed , it forms a beautiful umbrage or a murky spot . " /z/ purpose of variety ; if they differ in two or three , they become contrasts : if in all , they are opposite , and seldom group well together . Those , on the contrary , which are of one character , and are distinguished only as the characteristic mark is strongly or faintly impressed upon them , form a beautiful mass , and unity is preserved without sameness. " * There is another circumstance connected with the color of trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the knowledge of which may sometimes be turned to valuable account . We mean the effects produced in the apparent coloring of a landscape by distance , which painters term aerial perspective . Standing at a certain position in a scene , the coloring is deep , rich , and full in the foreground , more tender and mellow in the middle-ground , and softening to a pale tint in the distance . " Where to the eye three well marked distances Spread their peculiar coloring , vivid green , Warm brown , and black opake the foreground bears Conspicuous : sober olive coldly marks The second distance ; thence the third declines In softer blue , or lessening still , is lost In fainted purple . When thy taste is call 'd To deck a scene where nature 's self presents All these distinct gradations , then rejoice As does the Painter , and like him apply Thy colors ; plant thou on each separate part Its proper foliage . " Advantage may occasionally be taken of this peculiarity in the gradation of color , in Landscape Gardening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial distance . In grounds /z/ and scenes of limited extent , the apparent size and breadth may be increased , by planting a majority of the trees in the foreground , of dark tints , and the boundary with foliage of a much lighter hue . An acquaintance , individually , with the different species of trees of indigenous and foreign growth , which may be cultivated with success in this climate , is absolutely essential to the amateur or the professor of Landscape Gardening . The tardiness or rapidity of their growth , the periods at which their leaves and flowers expand , the soils they love best , and their various habi-ts and characters , are all subjects of the highest interest to him . In short , as a love of the country almost commences with a knowledge of its peculiar characteristics , the pure air , the fresh enamelled turf , and the luxuriance and oeauty of the whole landscape ; so the taste for the embellishment of Rural Residences must grow out of an admiration for beautiful trees , and the delightful effects they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lovers of nature . Admitting this , we think , in the comparatively meagre state of general information on this subject among us , we shall render an acceptable service to the novice , by giving a somewhat detailed description of the character and habits of most of the finest hardy forest and ornamental trees . Among those living in the country , there are many who care little for the beauties of Landscape Gardening , who are yet interested in those trees which are remarkable for the beauty of their forms , their foliage , their blossoms , or their useful purposes . This , we hope , will be a sufficient explanation for the apparently disproportionate number of pages which we shall devote io this part of our subject . /z/ The History and Description of all the finest hardy Deciduous Trees .

" THE OAK . Quercus . Nat . Ord . Corylaceae Lin . Syst . Monoecia , Polyandria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the first created of all trees ; and when we consider its great and surpassing utility and beauty , we are fully disposed ; o concede it the first rank among the denizens of the /z/ forest . Springing up with a noble trunk , and stretching out its broad limbs over the soil , " These monarchs of the wood , Dark , gnarled , centennial oaks , " seem proudly to bid defiance to time ; and while generations of man appear and disappear , they withstand the storms of a thousand winters , and seem only to grow more venerable and majestic . They are mentioned in the oldest histories ; we are told that Absalom was caught by his hair in " the thick boughs of a great oak ; " and Herodotus informs us that the first oracle was that of Dodona , set up in the celebrated oak grove of that name . There , at first , the oracles were delivered by the priestesses , but , as was afterwards believed , by the inspired oaks themselves " Which in Dodona did enshrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Acorns , the fruit of the oak , appear to have been held in considerable estimation as an article of food among the ancients . Not only were the swine fattened upon them , as in our own forests , but they were ground into flour , with which bread was made by the poorer classes . Lucretius mentions , that before grain was known they were the common food of man ; but we suppose the fruit of the chestnut may also have been included under that term . " That oake whose acornes were our foode before The Cerese seede of mortal man was knowne. " /z/ The civic crown , given in the palmy days of Rome to the most celebrated men , was also composed of oak leaves /z/ It should not be forgotten that the oak was worshipped oy the ancient Britons . Baal or Yiaoul ( whence Yule ) was the god of fire , whose symbol was an oak . Hence at his festival , which was at Christmas , the ceremony of kindling the Yule log was performed among the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the hearths of all the people were annually lighted from these sacred fires every Christmas . We believe the curious custom is still extant in some remote parts of England , where the " Yule log " is ushered in with much glee and rejoicing once a year . As an ornamental object we consider the oak the most varied in expression , the most beautiful , grand , majestic , and picturesque of all deciduous trees . The enormous size and extreme old age to which it attains in a favorable situation , the great space of ground that it covers with its branches , and the strength and hardihood of the tree , all contribute to stamp it with the character of dignity and grandeur beyond any other compeer of the forest . When young its fine foliage ( singularly varied in many of our native species ) and its thrifty form render it a beautiful tree . But it is not until the oak has attained considerable size that it displays its true character , and only when at an age that would terminate the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then its deeply furrowed trunk is covered with mosses ; its huge branches , each a tree , spreading out horizontally from the trunk with great boldness , its trunk of huge dimension , and its " high top , bald with dry antiquity ; " all these , its true characteristics , stamp the oak , as Virgil has expressed it in his Georgics /z/ " Jove 's own tree , That holds the woods in awful sovereignty For length of ages lasts his happy reign , And lives of mortal man contend in vain . Full in the midst of his own strength he stands , Stretching his brawny arms and leafy hands , His shade protects the plains , his head the hills commands . " /z/ " The oak , " says Gilpin , " is confessedly the most picturesque tree in itself , and the most accommodating in composition . It refuses no subject either in natural or in artificial landscape . It is suited to the grandest , and may with propriety be introduced into the most pastoral . It adds new dignity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching its wild , moss-grown branches athwart their ivied walls , it gives them a kind of majesty coeval with itself ; at the same time its propriety is still preserved if it throws its arms over the purling brook or the mantling pool , where it beholds " Its reverend image in the expanse below . " Milton introduces it happily even in the lowest scene " Hard by a cottage chimney smokes , From between two aged oaks . " The oak is not only one of the grandest and most picturesque objects as a single tree upon a lawn , but it is equally unrivalled for groups and masses . There is a breadth about the lights and shadows reflected and embosomed in its foliage , a singular freedom and boldness in its outline , and a pleasing richness and intricacy in its huge ramification of branch and limb , that render it highly adapted to these purposes . Some trees , as the willow or the spiry poplar /z/ though pleasing singly , are monotonous to the last degree when planted in quantities . Not so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , when forming a wood entirely by itself , which affords so great a variety of form and disposition , light and shade , symmetry and irregularity , as this king of the forests . To arrive at its highest perfection , ample space on every side must be allowed the oak . A free exposure to the sun and air , and a deep mellow soil , are highly necessary to its fullest amplitude . For this reason , the oaks of our forests , Fig . SO . The Charter Oak , Hartford. being thickly crowded , are seldom of extraordinary size ; and there are more truly majestic oaks in the parks of England than are to be found in the whole cultivated portion of the United States . Here and there , however , throughout our c Duntry may be seen a solitary oak of great /z/ age and immense size , which attests the fitness of the soil and climate , and displays the grandeur of our native species The Wads worth Oak near Geneseo , N. Y. , of extraordinary dimensions , the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admiration of hundreds of travellers on the route to Niagara . Its trunk measures thirty-six feet in circumference . The celebrated Charter Oak at Hartford , which has figured so conspicuously in the history of New England , is still existing in a green old age , one of the most interesting monuments of the past to be found in the country . Near the village of Flushing , Long Island , on the farm of Judge Lawrence , is growing one of the noblest oaks in the country . It is truly park-like in its dimensions , the circumference of the trunk being nearly thirty feet , and its majestic head of corresponding dignity . In the deep alluvial soil of the western valleys , the oak often assumes a grand aspect , and bears witness to the wonderful fertility of the soil in that region . Different species of Oak . This country is peculiarly rich in various kinds of oak ; Michaux enumerating no less than forty species indigenous to North America . Of these the most useful are the Live oak ( Quercus virens ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Q. falcata ) ; the Red oak ( Q. rubra ) , etc. , the bark of which is extensively used in tanning ; the Quercitron or Black oak , which is highly valuable as affording a fine yellow or brown dye for wool , silks , paper-hangings , etc. ; and the White oak , which is chiefly used for timber . We shall /z/ here describe only a few of those which are most entitled to the consideration of the planter , either for their valuable properties or as ornamental trees , and calculated for planting in woods or single masses . The White oak . ( Quercus alba . ) This is one of the most common of the American oaks , being very generally distributed over the country , from Canada to the southern states . In good strong soils it forms a tree 70 or 80 feet high , with wide extending branches ; but its growth depends much upon this circumstance . It may readily be known even in winter by its whitish bark , and by the dry and withered leaves which often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leaves are about four inches wide and six in length , divided uniformly into rounded lobes without points ; these lobes are deeper in damp soils . When the leaves first unfold in the spring they are downy beneath , but when fully grown they are quite smooth , and pale green on the upper surface and whitish or glaucous below . The acorn is oval and the cup somewhat flattened at the base . This is the most valuable of all our native oaks , immense quantities of the timber being used for various purposes in building ; and staves of the white oak for barrels are in universal use throughout the Union . The great occasional size and fine form of this tree , in some natural situations , prove how noble an object it would become when allowed to expand in full vigor and majesty in the open air and light of the park . It more nearly approaches the English oak in appearance than any other American species . Rock Chestnut oak . ( Q. Prinus Monticola . ) This is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance in the middle states . It has the /z/ peculiar advantage of growing well on the most barren and rocky soils , and can therefore be advantageously employed by the landscape gardener , when a steep , dry , rocky bank is to be covered with trees . In deep , mellow soil , its growth is wonderfully vigorous , and it rapidly attains a height of 50 or 60 feet , with a corresponding diameter . The head is rather more symmetrical in form and outline than most trees of this genus , and the stem , in free , open places , shoots up into a lofty trunk . The leaves are five or six inches long , three or four broad , oval and uniformly denticulated , with the teeth more regular but less acute than the Chestnut white oak . When beginning to open in the spring they are covered with a thick down ; but when fully expanded they are perfectly smooth and of a delicate texture . Michaux . Chestnut White oak . ( Quercus Prinus palustris . ) This species much resembles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obovate , and deeply toothed . It is sparingly found in the northern states , and attains its greatest altitude in the south , where it is often seen 90 feet in height . Though generally found in the neighborhood of swamps and low grounds , it grows with wonderful rapidity in a good , moderately dry soil , and from the beauty of its fine spreading head , and the quickness of its growth , is highly deserving of introduction into our plantations . The Yellow oak . ( Q. Prinus acuminata . ) The Yellow oak may be found scattered through our woods over nearly the whole of the Union . Its leaves are lanceolate , and regularly toothed , light green above , and whitish beneath ; the acorns small . It forms a stately tree , 70 feet high ; and the branches are more upright in /z/ their growth , and more clustering , as it were , round the central trunk , than other species . The beauty of its long pointed leaves , and their peculiar mode of growth , recommend it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety . The Pin oak . ( Q. palustris . ) The Pin oak forms a tree in moist situations , varying in height from 60 to 80 feet . The great number of small branches intermingleu with the large ones , have given rise to the name of this variety . It is a hardy , free growing species , particularly upon moist soils . Loudon considers it , from its " far extending , drooping branches , and light and elegant foliage , " among the most graceful of oaks . It is well adapted to small groups , and is one of the most thrifty growing and easily obtained of all our northern oaks . The Willow oak . ( Q. Phellos ) This remarkable species of oak may be recognised at once by its narrow , entire leaves , shaped almost like those of the willow , and about the same size , though thicker in texture . It is not found wild north of the barrens of New Jersey , where it grows plentifully , but thrives well in cultivation much further north . The stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its growth . It is so different in appearance and character from the other species of this genus , that in plantations it would never be recognised by a person not . conversant with oaks , as one of the family . It deserves to be introduced into landscapes for its singularity as an oak , and its lightness and elegance of foliage individually . The Mossy-cup oak . ( Q. olivaformis ) This is so called because the scales of the cups terminate in a long , moss-like fringe , nearly covering the acorn . It is quite a /z/ rare species , being only found on the upper banks of the Hudson , and on the Genesee river . The foliage is fine , large , and deeply cut , and the lower branches of the tree droop in a beautiful manner when it has attained some considerable size . Quercus macrocarpa , the Over-cup White oak , is another beautiful kind found in the westerr states , which a good deal resembles the Mossy-cup oak in the acorn . The foliage , however , is uncommonly fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen inches long , and eight broad . It is a noble tree , with fine deep green foliage ; and the growth of a specimen planted in our grounds has been remarkably vigorous . Scarlet oak . ( Quercus coccinea . ) A native of the middle states ; a noble tree , often eighty feet high . The leaves , borne on long petioles , are a bright lively green on both surfaces , with four deep cuts on each side , widest at the bottom . The great and peculiar beauty of this tree , we conceive to be its property of assuming a deep scarlet tint in autumn . At that period it may , at a great distance , be distinguished from all other oaks , and indeed from every other forest tree . It is highly worthy of a place in every plantation . The Live oak . ( Quercus virens . ) This fine species will not thrive north of Virginia . Its imperishable timber is the most valuable in our forests ; and , at the south , it is a fine park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with , however , a rather wide and low head . The thick oval leaves are evergreen , and it is much to be regretted that this noble tree will not bear our northern winters . The English Royal oak . ( Q. robur . ) This is the great representative of the family in Europe , and is one of the /z/ most magnificent of the genus , growing often in the fine old woods and parks of England , to eighty and one hundred feet in height . The branches spread over a great surface . " The leaves are petiolated , smooth , and of a uniform color on both sides , enlarged towards the summit , and very coarsely toothed . " As a single tree foi park scenery , this equals any American species in majesty of form , though it is deficient in individual beauty of foliage to some of our oaks . It is to be found for sale in our nurseries , and we hope will become well known among us . The timber is closer grained and more durable , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his Sylva , recommends its introduction into this country largely , on these accounts . The Turkey oak . ( Q. Cerris . ) There are two beautiful hybrid varieties of this species , which have been raised in England by Messrs . Lucombe and Fulham , which we hope will yet be found in our ornamental plantations . They are partially evergreen in winter , remarkably luxuriant in their growth , attaining a height of seventy or eighty feet , and elegant in foliage and outline . The Lucombe and Fulham oaks grow from one to five feet in a season ; the trees assume a beautiful pyramidal shape , and as they retain their fine glossy leaves till May , they would form a fine contrast to other deciduous trees . We might here enumerate a great number of other fine foreign oaks ; among which the most interesting are the Holly or Holm oak ( Quercus Ilex ) ; and the Cork oak ( Q. Suber ) , of the south of France , which produces the cork of commerce ( both rather too tender for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , from which a scarlet dye /z/ is obtained ; and the Italian Esculent oak ( Q. Esculus ) , with sweet nutritious acorns . Those , however , who wish to investigate them , will pursue this subject further in European works ; while that splendid treatise on our forest trees , the North American Sylva of Michaux , will be found to give full and accurate descriptions of all our numerous indigenous varieties , of which many are peculiar to the southern states . The oak flourishes best on a strong loamy soil , rather moist than dry . Here at least the growth is most rapid , although , for timber , the wood is generally not so sound on a moist soil as a dry one , and the tree goes to decay more rapidly . Among the American kinds , however , some may be found adapted to every soil and situation , though those species which grow on upland soils , in stony , clayey , or loamy bottoms , attain the greatest size and longevity . When immense trees are desired , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is preferable , raised from the acorn sown where it is finally to remain . This is necessary on account of the very large tap roots of this genus of trees , which are either entirely destroyed or greatly injured by removal . Transplanting this genus of trees should be performed either early in autumn , as soon as the leaves fall or become brown , or in spring before the abundant rains commence . THE ELM . Ulmus . Nat . Ord . Ulmaceae . Lin . Syst . Pentandria , Digynia . We have ascribed to the oak the character of pre- /z/ eminent dignity and majesty among the trees of the forest . Let us now claim for the elm the epithets graceful and elegant . This tree is one of the noblest in the size of its trunk , while the branches are comparatively tapering and slender , forming themselves , in most of the species , into long ana graceful curves . The flowers are of a chocolate or purple color , and appear in the month of April , before the leaves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green in the spring , growing darker , however , as the season advances . The elm is one of the most common trees in both continents , and has been well known for its beauty and usefulness since a remote period . In the south of Europe , particularly in Lombardy , elm trees are planted in vineyards , and the vines are trained in festoons from tree to tree in the most picturesque manner . Tasso alludes to this in the following stanza : " Come olmo , a cui la pampinosa pianta Cupida s'avviticchi e si marite ; Se ferro il tronca , o fulmine lo schianta Trae seco a terra la compagna vite . " Gerusalemme Liberata , 2. 326 . It is one of the most common trees for public walks and avenues , along the highways in France and Germany , growing with great rapidity , and soon forming a widely extended shade . In Europe , the elm is much used for keels in ship-building , and is remarkably durable in water ; more extensive use is made of it there than of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red American elm is more valuable than any other in the United States for the blocks used in ship rigging . For its graceful beauty the elm is ? entitled to high /z/ regard . Standing alone as a single tree , or in a group of at most three or four in number , it developes itself in all its perfection . The White American elm we consider the most beautiful of the family , and to this we more particularly allude . In such situations as we have just mentioned , this tree developes its fine ample form in the most perfect manner . Its branches first spring up embracing the centre , then bend off in finely diverging lines , until in old trees they often sweep . the ground with their loose pendent foliage . With all this lightness and peculiar gracefulness of form , it is by no means a meagre looking tree in the body of its foliage , as its thick tufted masses of leaves reflect the sun and embosom the shadows as finely as almost any other tree , the oak excepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes where the expression of elegant or classical beauty is desired . In autumn the foliage assumes a lively yellow tint , contrasting well with the richer and more glowing colors of our native woods . Even in winter it is a pleasing object , from the minute division of its spray and the graceful droop of its branches . It is one of the most generally esteemed of our native trees for ornamental purposes , and is as great a favorite here as in Europe for planting in public squares and along the highways . Beautiful specimens may be seen in Cambridge , Mass. , and very fine avenues of this tree are growing with great luxuriance in and about New Haven. * The charming villages of New England , among which Northampton and Springfield are pre-eminent , borrow from the superb and wonderfully luxuriant elms which decorate their fine /z/ streets and avenues , the greater portion of their peculiai loveliness . The elm should not be chosen where large groups and masses are required , as the similarity of its form in different individuals might then create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peculiarly well calculated for small groups , or as a single object . The roughness of the bark , contrasting with the lightness of its foliage and the easy sweep of its branches , adds much also to its effect as a whole . We shall briefly describe the principal species of the elm . The American White elm . ( Ulmus Americana . ) This is the best known and most generally distributed of our native species , growing in greater or less profusion over the whole of the country included between Lower Canada and the Gulf of Mexico . It often reaches 80 feet in height in fine soils , with a diameter of 4 or 5 feet . The leaves are alternate , 3 or 4 inches long , unequal in size at the base , borne on petioles half an inch to an inch in length , oval , acuminate , and doubly denticulated . The seeds are contained in a flat , oval , winged seed-vessel , fringed with small hairs on the margin . The flowers , of a dull purple color , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the branches , and appear very early in the spring . This tree prefers a deep rich soil , and grows with greater luxuriance if it be rather moist , often reaching in such situations an altitude of nearly 100 feet . It is found in the greatest perfection in the alluvial soils of the fertile valleys of the Connecticut , the Mississippi , and the Ohio rivers . The Red or Slippery elm . ( U. fulva . ) A tree of /z/ lower size than the White elm , attaining generally onl 40 or 50 feet . According to Michaux , it may be distinguished from the latter even in winter , by its buds , which are larger and rounder , and which are covered a fortnight before their development with a russet down The leaves are larger , rougher , and thicker than those of the White elm ; the seed-vessels larger , destitute of fringe ; the stamens short , and of a pale rose color . This tree bears a strong likeness to the Dutch elm , and the bark abounds in mucilage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less drooping than those of the White elm . The Wahoo elm ( U. alata ) is not found north of Virginia . It may at once be known in every stage of its growth by the fungous cork-like substance which lines the branches on both sides . It is a very singular and curious tree , of moderate stature , and grows rapidly and well when cultivated in the northern states . The common European elm . ( U. campestris . ) This is the most commonly cultivated forest tree in Europe , next to the oak . It is a more upright growing tree than the White elm , though resembling it in the easy disposition and delicacy of its branches . The flowers , of a purple color , are produced in round bunches close to the stem . The leaves are rough , doubly serrated , and much more finely cut than those of our elms . It is a fine tree , 6Q or 70 feet high , growing with rapidity , and is easily cultivated . The timber is more valuable than the American sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beauty . There are some dozen or more fine varieties of this species cultivated in the English nurseries , among which the most remarkable are /z/ the Twisted elm ( U. c. tortuosa ) , the trunk of which is singularly marked with hollows and protuberances , and the grain of . the wood curiously twisted together : the Kidbrook elm ( U. c. virens ) , which is a sub-evergreen : the Gold and Silver striped elms , with variegated leaves , and the Narrow-leaved elm ( U. c. viminalis ) , which resembles the birch : the Cork-barked elm ( U. c. suberosa ) , the young branches of which are covered with cork , etc . The latter is one of the hardiest and most vigorous of all ornamental trees in this climate . It thrives in almost every soil , and its rich , dark foliage , which hangs late in autumn , and its somewhat picturesque form , should recommend it to every planter . The Scotch or Wych elm . ( U. montana . ) This is a tree of lower stature than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . The leaves are broad , rough , pointed , and the branches extend more horizontally , drooping at the extremities . The bark on the branches is comparatively smooth . It is a grand tree , " the head is so finely massed and yet so well broken as to render it one of the noblest of park trees ; and when it grows wild amid the rocky scenery of its native Scotland , there is no tree which assumes so great or so pleasing a variety of character/ ' * In general appearance , the Scotch elm considerably resembles our White elm , and it is a very rapid grower . Its most ornamental varieties are the Spiry-topped elm ( U. m. fastigiata ) , with singularly twisted leaves , and a very upright growth : the weeping Scotch elm ( U. m. pendula ) , a very remarkable variety , the branches of which droop in a /z/ fan-like manner : and the Smooth-leaved Scotch elm ( V m , glabra ) . There is scarcely any soil to which some of the different elms are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil ; the Scotch or Wych elm will thrive well even in very rocky places ; and the White elm grows readily in all soils , but most luxuriantly in moist places . All the species attain their maximum size when planted in a deep loam , rather moist than dry . They bear transplanting remarkably well , suffering but little even from the mistaken practice of those persons who reduce them in transplanting to the condition of bare poles , as they shoot out a new crop of branches , and soon become beautiful young trees in spite of the mal-treatment . As the elm scarcely produces a tap root , even large trees may be removed , when the operation is skilfully performed . In such cases , the recently-removed tree should be carefully and plentifully supplied with water until it is well established in its new situation . The elm is also easily propagated by seed , layers , or , in some species , by suckers from the root . THE PLANE OR BUTTONWOOD TREE . Platanus . Nat . Ord . Platanaceae . Lin . Syst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its name from broad , on account of the broad , umbrageous nature of its branches . It is a well known tree of the very largest DECIDUOUS ORNAMENTAL TREES . lof ) size , common to both hemispheres , and greatly prized tor the fine shade afforded by its spreading head , in the warmer parts of Europe and Asia . No tree was in greater esteem with the ancients for this purpose ; and we are told that the Academic groves , the neighborhood of the public schools , and all those favorite avenues where the Grecian philosophers were accustomed to resort , were planted with these trees ; and beneath their shade Aristotle , Plato , and Socrates , delivered the choicest wisdom and eloquence of those classic days . The Eastern plane ( Platanus orientalis ) was first brought to the Roman provinces from Persia , and so highly was it esteemed that according to Pliny , the Morini paid a tribute to Rome for the privilege of enjoying its shade . To that author we are also indebted for the history of the great plane tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so huge a size , that the governor of the province , Licinius Mutianus , together with eighteen of his retinue , feasted in the hollow of its trunk . In the United States , the plane is not generally found growing in great quantities in any one place , but is more or less scattered over the whole country . In deep , moist , alluvial soils , it attains a size scarcely , if at all , inferior to that of the huge trees of the eastern continent ; forming at least , in the body of its trunk , a larger circumference than any other of our native trees . The younger Michaux ( Sylva , 1 , 325 ) measured a tree near Marietta , Ohio , which at four feet from the ground was found to be forty-seven feet in circumference ; and a specimen has lately been cut on the banks of the Genesee river , of such enormous size , that a section of the trunk was hollowed out and furnished as a small room , capable of containing /z/ fourteen persons. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises up seventy feet , and then expands into a fine , lofty head , surpassing in grandeur ail its neighbors of the forest . The large branches of the plane shoot out in a horizontal direction ; the trunk generally ascending in a regular , stately , and uninterrupted manner The blossoms are small greenish balls appearing in spring , and the fertile ones grow to an inch in diameter , assuming a deep brownish color , and hang upon the tree during the whole winter . A striking and peculiar characteristic of the plane , is its property of throwing off or shedding continually the other coating of bark here and there in patches . Professor Lindley ( Introduction to the Natural System , 2d ed. 187 ) says this is owing to its deficiency in the expansive power of the fibre common to the bark of other trees , or , in other words , to the rigidity of its tissue : being therefore incapable of stretching with the growth of the tree , it bursts open on different parts of the trunk , and is cast off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , extending more or less even to the extremity of the branches ; and makes this tree quite conspicuous in winter . Bryant , in his address to Green River , says : " Clear are the depths where its eddies play , And dimples deepen and whirl away , And the plane tree 's speckled arms o'ershoot The swifter current that mines its root . " The great merit of the plane , or buttonwood , is its /z/ extreme vigor and luxuriance of growth . In a good soil it will readily reach a height of thirty-five or forty feet in ten years . It is easily transplanted ; and in new residences , bare of trees , where an effect is desired speedily , we know of nothing better adapted quickly to produce abundance of foliage , shelter , and shade . When the requisite foliage is obtained , and other trees of slower growth have reached a proper size , the former may be thinned out . As the plane tree grows to the largest size , it is only proper for situations where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fellows have ample room for its full development . Then soaring up , and extending its wide-spread branches on every side , it is certainly a very majestic tree . The color of the foliage is of a paler green than is usual in forest trees ; and although of large size , is easily wafted to and fro by the wind , thereby producing an agreeable diversity of light pleasing to the eye in summer . In winter the branches are beautifully hung , even to their furthest ends , with the numerous round russet-balls , or seed-vessels , each suspended by a slender cord , and swinging about in the air . The outline of the head is pleasingly irregular , and its foliage against a sky outline is bold and picturesque . It is not a tree to be planted in thick groves by itself , but to stand alone and detached , or in a group with two or three . In avenues it is often happily employed , and produces a grand effect . It also grows with great vigor in close cities , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Hospital , and other places in Philadelphia fully attest . There is but a trifling difference in general effect between /z/ our plane or buttonwood and the Oriental plane . For the purposes of shade and shelter , the American is the finest , as its foliage is the longest and broadest . The Oriental plane ( Platanus orientalis ) has the leaves lobed like our native kind ( P. occidentalis ) , but the segments are much more deeply cut ; the footstalks of its leaves are green , while those of the American are of a reddish hue , and the fruit or ball is much smaller and rougher on the outer surface when fully grown . Both species are common in the nurseries , and are worthy the attention of the planter ; the Oriental , as well for the interesting associations connected with it , being the favorite shade-tree of the east , etc. , as for its intrinsic merits as a lofty and majestic tree . Two of the varieties of P. occidentalis are sometimes cultivated , the chief of which is the Maple-leaved plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraxinus . Nat . Ord . Oleaceae . Lin . Syst . Polygamia , Dioecia . The name of the ash , one of the finest and most useful of forest trees , is probably derived from the Celtic asc , a pike as its wood was formerly in common use for spears and other weapons . Homer informs us that Achilles was slain with an ashen spear . In modern times the wood is in universal use for the various implements of husbandry , for the different purposes of the wheelwright and carriagemaker , and in short for all purposes where great strength and elasticity are required ; for in these qualities the ash is /z/ second to no tree in the forest , the hickory alone excepted . The ash is a large and lofty tree , growing , when surrounded by other trees , , sixty or seventy feet high , and three or more in diameter . When exposed on all sides it forms a beautiful , round , compact head of loose , pinnated , light green foliage , and is one of the most vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ash are found in the greatest luxuriance and beauty on the banks and margins of rivers where the soil is partially dry , yet where the roots can easily penetrate down to the moisture . The European ash is remarkable for its hardy nature , being often found in great vigor on steep rocky hills , and amid crevices where most other trees flourish badly . Southey alludes to this in the following lines : " Grey as the stone to which it clung , half root , Half trunk , the young ash rises from the rock . " As the ash grows strongly , and the roots , which extend to a great distance , ramify near the surface , it exhausts the soil underneath and around it to an astonishing degree . For this reason the grass is generally seen in a very meagre and starveci-condition in a lawn where the ash tree abounds . Here and there a single tree of the ash will have an excellent effect , seen from the windows of the house ; but we would chiefly employ it for the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees in an extensive plantation . When the ash is young it forms a well rounded head ; but when older the lower branches bend towards the ground , and then slightly turn up in a very graceful manner . We take pleasure in quoting what that great lover and accurate delineator of forest beauties , Mr. Gilpin , gays of the ash . " The ash generally carries its principal /z/ stem higher than the oak , and rises in an easy flowing line . But its chief beauty consists in the lightness of its whole appearance . Its branches at first keep close to the trunk and form acute angles with it ; but as they begin to lengthen they generally take an easy sweep , and the looseness of the leaves corresponding with the lightness of the spray , the whole forms an elegant depending foliage . Nothing can have a better effect than an old ash hanging from the cornel of a wood , and bringing off the heaviness of the other foliage with its loose pendent branches . " ( Forest Scenery , p. 82 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rican White ash ( and we consider it the finest of all the species ) is the coloring which its leaves put on in autumn . Gilpin complains that the leaf of the European ash " decays in a dark , muddy , unpleasing tint . " Not so the White ash . In an American wood , such as often lines and overhangs the banks of the Hudson , the Connecticut , and many of our noble northern streams , the ash assumes peculiar beauty in autumn , when it can often be distinguished from the surrounding trees for four or five miles , by the peculiar and beautiful deep brownish purple of its fine mass of foliage . This color , though not lively , is so full and rich as to produce the most pleasing harmony with the bright yellows and reds of the other deciduous trees , and the deep green of the pines and cedars . The ash , unlike the elm , starts into vegetation late in the spring , which is an objection to planting it in the immediate vicinity of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing in tint , compared witn those of other deciduous trees . /z/ The White ash . ( Fraxinus Americana ) This species , according to Michaux , is common to the colder parts of the Union , and is . most abundant north of the Hudson . It owes its name to the light color of the bark , which on large stocks is deeply furrowed , and divided into squares of one to three inches in diameter . The trunk is perfectly straight , and in close woods is often undivided to the height of more than 40 feet . The leaves are composed of three or four pairs of leaflets , terminated by an odd one ; the whole twelve or fourteen inches long . Early in spring they are covered with a light down which disappears as summer advances , when they become quite smooth , of a light green color above and whitish beneath . The foliage , as well as the timber of our White ash , is finer than that of the common European ash , and the tree is much prized in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes called the Water ash , requires a moist soil to thrive well , and is seen in the greatest perfection on the borders of swamps . Its buds are of a deep blue ; the young shoots of a bright green , sprinkled with dots of the same color , which disappear as the season advances . It may readily be distinguished from the White ash by its bark , which is of a duller hue and less deeply furrowed . The Black ash is altogether a tree of less stature than the preceding . The other native sorts are the Red ash ( F. tomentosa ) , with the bark of a deep brown tint , found in Pennsylvania : the Green ash ( F. viridis ) , which also grows in Pennsylvania , and is remarkable for the brilliant green of both sides of the leaves : the Blue ash ( F. Quadrangulata ) , a beautiful tree of Kentucky , 70 feet high , distinguished by the four opposite membranes of a greenish color , found on the young /z/ shoots : mid the Carolina ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which are covered with a thick down in spring . The common European ash ( F. excelsior ) strongly resembles the White ash . It may , however , easily be known by its very black buds , and longer , more serrated leaflets which are sessile , instead of being furnished w r ith petioles like the White ash . This fine tree , as well as the White ash , grows to 80 or 90 feet in height , with a very handsome head . The Weeping ash , Fig. 31 , is a very remarkable variety Fig. 81 . The Weeping Ash. of the European ash , with pendulous or weeping branches ; and is worthy a place in every lawn for its curious ramification , as well as for its general beauty . It is generally propagated by grafting on any common stock , as the White ash ; 7 or 8 feet high , when the branches immediately begin 10 turn down in a very striking and peculiar manner . The droop of the branches is hardly a graceful one , yet it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The EUROPEAN LINDEN , at Prcsqu-ile , the Eesidence of Mrs. Denning . Age 44 years .

The Flowering ash ( Fraxinus Ornus* ) is a small tree of about 20 feet , growing plentifully in the south of Europe , and is also found sparingly in this country . Its chief beauty lies in the beautiful clusters of pale or greenish- white flowers , borne on the terminal branches in May and June . The foliage and general appearance of the tree are much like those of the common ash ; but when in blossom it resembles a good deal the Carolina Fringe tree . In Italy a gummy substance called manna exudes from the bark , which is used in medicine . THE LIME OR LINDEN TREE . Tilia . Nat . Ord . Tilaceae . Lin . Syst . Polyandria , Monogynia . This tree , or rather the American sort , is well known among us by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright , and regularly shaped tree ; and all the species are much esteemed , both in Europe and this country , for planting in avenues and straight lines , wherever the taste is in favor of geometric plantations . In Germany and Holland it is a great favorite for bordering their wide and handsome streets , and lining their long and straight canals . " In Berlin , " Granville says in his travels , " there is a celebrated street called ' unter der Linden , ' ( under the lime trees , ) a gay and splendid avenue , planted with double /z/ rows of this tree , which presented to my view a scene far more beautiful than I had hitherto witnessed in any town , either in France , Flanders , or Germany . " In this country the European lime is also much planted in our cities ; and some avenues of it may be seen in Philadelphia , particularly before the State-house in Chestnut-street . The basswood is a very abundant tree in some parts of the middle states , and is seen growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior of this state . With us the wood is considered too soft to be of much value , but in England it was formerly in high repute as an excellent material for the use of carvers . Some very beautiful specimens of old carving in lime wood may be seen in Windsor Castle and Trinity College. * The Russian bass mats , which find their way to every commercial country , are prepared from the inner bark of this tree . The sap affords a sugar like the maple , although in less quantities ; and it is stated in the Encyclopaedia of Plants ( p. 467 ) " that the honey made from the flowers of the lime tree is reckoned the finest in the world . Near Knowno , in Lithuania , there are large forests chiefly of this tree , and probably a distinct variety . The honey produced in these forests sells at more than double the price of any other , and is used extensively in medicine and for liqueurs. " * The art of carving in wood , brought to such perfection by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; therefore the lime has lost a most important branch of its usefulness . Perhaps the finest specimens of the works of Gibbons are to be seen at Chatsworth , the seat of the Duke of Devonshire , in Derbyshire . The execution of the flowers , fish , game , nets , etc. , on the panelling of the walls is quite wonderful . It was of him that Walpole justly said , @#@ that he was the first artist who gave to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers , and chained together the various productions of the elements , with a free disorder natural to each species . ' The lime tree is still , however , used by the carver , and we hopo that the art of wood carving may gradually be restored . " Sir T. D. Lander /z/ . The leaves of the lime are large and handsome , heartshaped in form , and pleasing in color . The flowers , which open in June , hang in loose , pale yellow cymes or clusters , are quite ornamental and very fragrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us ; then of honey cells , Made delicate from all white flower bells . /z/ It was a favorite tree in the ancient style of gardening , as it bore the shears well , and was readily dipt into all manner of curious and fantastic shapes . When planted singly on a lawn , and allowed to develope itself fully on every side , the linden is one of the most beautiful of trees . Its head then forms a fine pyramid of verdure , while its lower branches sweep the ground and curve upwards in the most pleasing form . For this reason , though the linden is not a picturesque tree , it is very happily adapted for the graceful landscape , as its whole contour is full , flowing , and agreeable . The pleasant odor of its flowers is an additional recommendation , as well as its free growth and handsome leaves . Were it not that of late it is so liable to insects , we could hardly say too much in its praise as a fine ornament for streets and public parks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the architecture ; its shade affords cool and pleasant walks , and the delightful odor of its blossoms is doubly grateful in the confined air of the city . Our basswood has rather less of uniformity in its outline than the European lindens , but the general form is the same . The American lime , or basswood ( Tilia Americana ) , is the most robust tree of the genus , and produces much /z/ more vigorous shoots than the European species . It prefers a deep and fertile soil , where the trunk grows remarkably straight , and the branches form a handsome , well-rounded summit . The flowers are borne on long stalks , and are pendulous from the branches . The leaves are large , heart-shaped , finely cut on the margin , and terminated by a point at the extremity . The seeds , which ripen in autumn , are like small peas , round and greyish . The white lime ( T. alba ) is rare in the eastern states , but common in Pennsylvania and the states south of it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers are the finest of our native sorts . The leaves are also very large , deep green on the upper surface , and white below ; they are more obliquely heart-shaped than those of the common basswood . The young branches are covered with a smooth silvery bark . This species is very common on the Susquehannah river . The Downy lime tree . ( T. pubescens . ) The under side of the leaves , and the fruits of this species , are , as its name denotes , covered with a short down . Its flowers are nearly white ; the serratures of the leaves wider apart , and the base of the leaf obliquely truncated . It is a handsome large tree , a native of Florida , though hardy enough , as experience proves , to bear our northern winters . The European lime ( T. Europcea ) is distinguished from the American sorts , by its smaller and more regularly cordate and rounded leaves . Unlike our native species , the flowers are not furnished with inner scale-like petals . The foliage is rather deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head rather /z/ more regular in form and disposition . There are two pretty varieties of the English lime which are well known in this country , viz. the Red-barked , or corallina ( var. rubra ) , with red branches ; and the Golden-barked ( var. aurea ) , with handsome yellow branches . These trees are peculiarly beautiful in winter , when a few of them mingled with other deciduous trees make a pleasing variety of coloring in the absence of foliage . The broadleaved European lime is the finest for shade and ornament . The whitish foliage of Tilia alba , which probably is also a variety , has a beautiful appearance , somewhat like the Abele tree , in a gentle breeze . These trees grow well on any good friable soil , and readily endure transplantation . They bear trimming remarkably well ; and when but little root is obtained the head may be shortened in proportion , and the tree will soon make vigorous shoots again . All the species are easily increased by layers . THE BEECH TREE . Fagus . Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Polyandria . The Beech is a large , compact , and lofty tree , with a greyish bark and finely divided spray , and is a common inhabitant of the forest in all temperate climates . In the United States , this tree is generally found congregated in very great quantities , wherever the soil is most favorable ; hundreds of acres being sometimes covered with this single kind of timber . Such tracts are familiarly known /z/ as " beech woods . " The leaves of the beecn are remarkably thin in texture , glazed and shining on the upper surface , and so thickly set upon the numerous branches , that it forms the darkest and densest shade of any of our deciduous forest trees . It appears to have been highly valued by the ancients as a shade tree ; and Virgil says in its praise , in a well-known Eclogue : " Tityre , tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi , Sylvestrem tenui musam moditaris avena . " It bears a small compressed nut or mast , oily and sweet , which once was much valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we have heard of their being applied , is in the manufacture of an oil , scarcely inferior to olive oil . This is produced from the mast of the beech forests in the department of Oise , France , in immense quantities ; more than a million of sacks of the nuts having been collected in that department in a single season . They are reduced , when perfectly ripe , to a fine paste , and the oil is extracted by gradual pressure . The product of oil , compared with the crushed nuts , is about sixteen per cent . ( Michaux , N. American Sylva . ) In Europe , the wood of the beech is much used in the manufacture of various utensils ; but here , where our forests abound in woods vastly superior in strength , durability , and firmness , that of the beech is comparatively little esteemed . The beech is quite handsome and graceful when young , and when large it forms one of the heaviest and grandest of beautiful park trees . From this massy quality , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a thick anc impenetrable mass of foliage is desired ; /z/ and , on account of its density , it is also well suited to shut out unsightly buildings , or other objects . The leaves of many beech trees hang on the tree , in a dry and withered state , during the whole winter . This is chiefly the case with young trees ; but we consider it as greatly diminishing its beauty at that season , as the tree is otherwise very pleasing to the eye , with its smooth , round , grey stern , and small twisted spray . A deciduous tree , we think , should as certainly drop its leaves at the approach of cold weather , as an evergreen should retain them ; more especially if its leaves have a dead and withered appearance , as is the case with those of the beech in this climate . The White beech ( Fagus Sylvatica ) is the common beech tree of the middle and western states . It is found in the greatest perfection in a cool situation and a moist soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest stocks . The leaves oval , smooth , and shining , coarsely cut on the edges , and margined with a soft down in the spring . The Red beech ( F.ferruginea ) , so called on account of the color of its wood , loves a still colder climate than the other , and is found in the greatest perfection in British America . The leaves are divided into coarser teeth on the margin than the foregoing species . The nuts are much smaller , and the whole tree forms a lower and more spreading head . The European beech ( F. sylvatica ) is thought by many botanists to be the same species as our white beech , or at most only a variety . Its average height in Europe is about fifty feet ; the buds are shorter , and the leaves not so coarsely toothed as our native sorts . The Purple beech is a very ornamental variety of the European beech , common /z/ in he gardens . Both surfaces of the leaves , and even the yoang shoots , are deep purple ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every stage of its progress , and more par ticularly when it reaches a good size , one of the strangest anomalies among trees , in the hue of its foliage . There is also a variety called the copper-colored beech , with paler purple leaves ; * and a more rare English variety ( F. s. pendula ) , the Weeping beech , with graceful pendent branches THE HORNBEAM ( Carpinus Americana ) , and the IRONWOOD ( Ostrya Virginica ) , are both vell known small trees , belonging to the same natural family as the beech . They are of little value in ornamental plantations ; but from their thick foliage , they might perhaps be employed to advantage in making thick verdant screens for shelter or concealment . THE POPLAR TREE . Populus . Nat . Ord. oaiieaceae . Lin . Syst . Dicecia , Octandria . Arbor Populi , or the people 's tree , was the name given in the ancient days of Rome to this tree , as being peculiarly appropriated to those public places most frequented by the people : some ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by adding , that its trembling leaves are like the populace , always in motion . The poplars are light- wooded , rapid-growing trees ; many /z/ of them of huge size , and all with pointed , heart-shaped leaves . The tassel-like catkins , or male blossoms , of a red or brownish hue , appear early in the spring . Some of the American kinds , as the Balsam and Balm of Gilead poplars , have their buds enveloped in a fragrant gum ; others , as the Silver poplar , or Abele , are remarkable for the snowy whiteness of the under side of the foliage ; and the Lorn bardy poplar , which " Shoots up its spire , and shakes its leaves in the sun , " /z/ for its remarkably conical or spire-like manner of growth . The leaves of all the species , being suspended upon long and slender footstalks , are easily put in motion by the wind . This , however , is peculiarly the case with the aspen , the leaves of which may often be seen trembling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is motionless . There is a popular legend in Scotland respecting this tree , which runs thus : " Far ofl in the Highland wilds ' t is said ( But truth now laughs at fancy 's lore ) , That of this tree the cross was made , Which erst the Lord of Glory bore ; And of that deed its leaves confess , E'er since , a troubled consciousness . " In Landscape Gardening the poplar is not highly esteemed ; but it is a valuable tree when judiciously employed , and produces a given quantity of foliage and shade sooner perhaps than any other . Some of the American kinds are majestic and superb trees when old , particularly the Cottonwood and Balsam poplars . One of the handsomest sorts is the Silver poplar . At some distance , the downy under surfaces of the leaves , turned up by the wind , give it very /z/ much the aspect of a tree covered with white blossoms . This effect is the more striking , when it is situated in front of a group or mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining its leaves in full beauty to the latest possible period in the autumn . Its growth is very rapid , forming a fine rounded head of thirty feet in height , in six or eight years . The Lombardy poplar is a beautiful tree , and in certain situations produces a very elegant effect ; but it has been planted so indiscriminately , in some parts of this country , in close monotonous lines before the very doors of our houses , and in many places in straight rows along the highways for miles together , to the neglect of our fine native trees , that it has been tiresome and disgusting . This tree may , however , be employed with singular advantage in giving life , spirit , and variety to a scene composed entirely of round-headed trees , as the oak , ash , etc. , when a tall poplar , emerging here and there from the back or centre of the group , often imparts an air of elegance and animation to the whole . It may , also , from its marked and striking contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention to some particular point in the landscape . When large poplars of this kind are growing near a house of but moderate dimensions , they have a very bad effect by completely overpowering the building , without imparting any of that grandeur of character conferred by an old oak , or other spreading tree . It should be introduced but sparingly in landscape composition , as the moment it is made common in any scene , it gives an air of sameness and formality , ana all the spirited effect is lost which its sparing introduction among other trees produces . The Lombardy poplar /z/ is so well adapted to confined situations , as its branches require less lateral room than those of almost any other large deciduous tree . It is an objection to some of the poplars , that in any cultivated soil they produce an abundance of suckers . For this reason they should be planted only in grass ground , or in situations where the soil will not be disturbed , or where the suckers will not be injurious . Indeed , we conceive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , to give variety to plantations of other and more valuable trees . They grow well in almost every soil , moist or dry , and some species prefer quite wet and springy places . The chief American poplars are the Tachamahaca or Balsam poplar ( Populus balsamifera ) , chiefly found in Northern America ; a large tree , SO feet high , with fragrant gummy buds and lanceolate-oval leaves ; the Balm of Gilead poplar ( P. candicans ) , resembling the foregoing in its buds , but with very large , broad , heart-shaped foliage . From these a gum is sometimes collected , and used medicinally for the cure of scurvy . The American aspen ( P. tremuloides ) , about 30 feet high , a common tree with very tremulous leaves and greenish bark ; the large American aspen ( P. grandidentata ) , 40 feet high , with large leaves bordered with coarse teeth or denticulations ; the Cotton tree ( P. argentea ) , 60 or 70 feet , with leaves downy in a young state ; the American Black poplar of smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Cotton wood ( P. Canadensis ) , found chiefly in the western part of this state , a fine tree , with smooth , unequally-toothed , wide cordate leaves ; and the Carolina poplar ( P. angulata /z/ an enormous tree of the swamps of the south and west considerably resembling the Cotton tree , but without the resinous buds of that species . Among the European kinds , the most ornamental , as we have already remarked , is the Silver aspen , White poplar , or Abele tree ( P. alba ) , which grows to a great size on a deep loamy soil in a very short time . The leaves are divided into lobes , and toothed on the margin , smooth and very deep green above , and densely covered with a soft , close , white down beneath . There are some varieties of this species known abroad , with leaves more or less downy , etc . Sir J. E. Smith remarks in his English Flora , that the wood , though but little used , is much firmer than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best Norway fir , with the additional advantage that they will not readily take fire , like any resinous wood . The English aspen ( P. tremula ) considerably resembles our native aspen ; but the buds are somewhat gummy . The Athenian poplar ( P. Grceca ) is a tree about 40 feet high , with smaller , more rounded , and equally serrated foliage . The common Black European poplar ( P. nigra ) is also a large , rapidly growing tree , with pale-green leaves slightly notched : the buds expand later than most other poplars , and the young leaves are at first somewhat reddish in color . The Necklace-bearing poplar ( P. monilifera ) , so called from the circumstance of the catkins being arranged somewhat like beads in a necklace , is supposed to have been derived from Canada , but there are some doubts respecting its origin : in the south it is generally called the Virginia poplar . The Lombardy poplar ( P. dilatata ) , a native of the bankg of the Po , where it is sometimes called the Cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well known among us to need any description . Only one sex , the female , has hitherto been introduced into this country ; and it has consequently produced no seeds here , but has been entirely propagated by suckers from the root . THE HORSE-CHESTNUT TREE . jiEsculus . Nat . Ord . Esculaceae . Lin . Syst . Heptandria , Monogynia . A large , showy , much admired , ornamental tree , bearing large leaves composed of seven leaflets , and , in the month of May , beautiful clusters of white flowers , delicately mottled with red and yellow . It is a native of Middle Asia , but flourishes well in the temperate climates of both hemispheres . It was introduced into England , probably from Turkey , about the year 1575 : in that country the nuts are often ground into a coarse flour , which is mixed with other food and given to horses that are broken- winded ; and from this use the English name of the tree was derived . A starch has been extracted in considerable quantity from the nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Horse-chestnut is by no means a picturesque tree , being too regularly rounded in its outlines , and too compact and close in its surface , to produce a spirited effect in light and shade . But it is nevertheless one of the most beautiful exotic trees which will bear the open air in this climate . The leaves , each made of clusters of six or seven leaflets , are of a fine dark-green color ; the whole head of foliage /z/ has much grandeur and richness in its depth of hue and massiness of outline ; and the regular , rounded , pyramidal shape , is something so different from that of most of our indigenous trees , as to strike the spectator with an air of novelty and distinctness . The great beauty of the Horsechestnut is the splendor of its inflorescence , surpassing that of almost all our native forest trees : the huge clusters of gay blossoms , which every spring are distributed with such luxuriance and profusion over the surface of the foliage , and at the extremity of the branches , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrub , than of an ordinary tree of the largest size . At that season there can be no more beautiful object to stand singly upon the lawn , particularly if its branches are permitted to grow low down the trunk , and ( as they naturally will as the tree advances ) sweep the green sward with their drooping foliage . Like the lime tree , however , care must be taken , in the modern style , to introduce it rather sparingly in picturesque plantations , and then only as a single tree , or upon the margin of large groups , masses , or plantations ; but it may be more freely used in grounds in the graceful style , for which it is highly suitable . When handsome avenues or straight lines are wanted , the Horse-chestnut is again admirably suited , from its symmetry and regularity . It is , therefore , much and justly valued for these purposes in our towns and cities , where its deep shade and beauty of blossom are peculiarly desirable , the only objection to it being the early fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mode of growth . The large buds are thickly covered in winter with a resinous gum , to protect them from the cold and moisture ; in the spring these burst open , and the whole growth of the young shoots , leaves , /z/ flowers , and all , is completed in about three or four weeks When the leaves first unfold , they are clothed with a copious cotton-like down , which falls off when they have attained their full size and development . The growth of the Horse-chestnut is slow for a softwooded tree , when the trees are young ; after five or six years , however , it advances with more rapidity , and in twenty years forms a beautiful and massy tree . It prefers a strong , rich , loamy soil , and is easily raised from the large nuts , which are produced in great abundance . There are several species of Horse-chestnut , but the common one ( JEsculus Hippocastanum ) is incomparably the finest . The American sorts are the following : ( JEsculus Ohioensis , ) or Ohio Buckeye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small sized tree , with palmated leaves consisting of Jive leaflets , and pretty , bright yellow flowers , with red stamens . The fruit is about half the size of the exotic species . The Red-flowered Horse-chestnut ( Esculus rubicundd ) is a small tree with scarlet flowers ; and the Smooth-leaved ( JE . glabra ) has pale yellow flowers . All the foregoing have prickly fruit . Besides these are two small Horse-chestnuts with smooth fruit , which thence properly belong to the genus Pavia , viz. the Yellow-flowered Pavia ( P. luted ) of Virginia and the southern states ; and the Red-flowered ( P. rubra ) , with pretty clusters of reddish flowers ; both these have leaves resembling those of the Horse-chestnut , except in being divided into five leaflets , instead of seven . There are some other species , which are , however , rather shrubs than trees . /z/ THE BIRCH TREE . Betula . Nat . Ord . Betulaceae . Lin . Syst . Monoecia , Polyandria . The Birch trees are common inhabitants of the forests of all cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silvery- white , or reddish colored stems , delicate and pliant spray , and small , light foliage . There is no deciduous tree which will endure a more rigorous climate , or grow at a greater elevation above the level of the sea . It is found growing in Greenland and Kamschatka , as far north as the 58th and 60th degree of latitude , and on the Alps in Switzerland , according to that learned botanist , M. DeCandolle , at the elevation of 4,400 feet . It is undoubtedly the most useful tree of northern climates . Not only are cattle and sheep sometimes fed upon the leaves , but the Laplander constructs his hut of the branches ; the Russian forms the bark into shoes , baskets , and cordage for harnessing his reindeer ; and the inhabitants of Northern Siberia , in times of scarcity , grind it to mix with their oatmeal for food . In this country the birch is no less useful . The North American Indian , and all who are obliged to travel the wild , unfrequented portions of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their way through the wilderness from river to river , find the canoe made of the birch bark , the lightest , the most durable , and convenient vessel , for these purposes , in the world. * /z/ The wood of our Black birch is by far the finest ; and , as it assumes a beautiful rosy color when polished , and is next in texture to the wild Cherry tree , it is considerably esteemed among cabinet-makers in the eastern states , for chairs , tables , and bedsteads . In Europe , the sap of the birch is collected in the spring , in the same manner as that of the maple in this country , boiled with sugar and hops , and fermented with the aid of yeast . The product of the fermentation is called bir-ch wine , and is described as being a remarkably pleasant and healthy beverage . Though perhaps too common in some districts of our country to be properly regarded as an ornamental tree , yet in others where it is less so , the birch will doubtless be esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite ; and we regard it as a very elegant and graceful tree , not less on account of the silvery white bark of several species , than from the extreme delicacy of the spray , and the pleasing lightness and airiness of the foliage . In all the species , the branches have a tendency to form those graceful curves which contribute so much to the beauty canoes . To procure proper pieces , the largest and smoothest trunks are selected ; in the spring , two circular incisions are made several feet apart , and two longitudinal ones , on opposite sides of the tree : after which , by introducing a wedge , the bark is easily detached . These plates are usually ten or twelve feet long , and two feet nine inches broad . To form canoes , they are stitched together with fibrous roots of the white spruce , about the size of a quill , which are deprived of the bark , split , and suppled in water . The seams are coated with resin of the Balm of Gilead . Great use is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Canadians , in their long journeys through the interior of the country : they are light , and very easily transported on the shoulders from one lake to another , which is called the portage . A canoa calculated for four persons , with their baggage , weighs from forty to fifty pounds ; and some of them are made to carry fifteen passengers . " /z/ of trees ; but the European weeping birch is peculiarly pleasing as it grows old , on that account . It is this variety which Coleridge pronounces , - Most beautiful Of forest trees the Lady of the woods . " And Bernard Barton , speaking of our native species , says , " See the beautiful Birch tree fling Its shade on the grass beneath Its glossy leaf , and its silvery stem ; Dost thou not love to look on them 1 " The American sorts , and particularly the Black birch , start into leaf very early in the spring , and their tender green is agreeable to the eye at that season ; while the swelling buds and young foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint perfume . Even the blossoms , which hang like little brown tassels from the drooping branches , are interesting to the lover of nature . " The fragrant birch above him hung Her tassels in the sky , And many a vernal blossom sprung , And nodded careless by . " /z/ Nothing can well be prettier , seen from the windows of the drawing-room , than a large group of trees , whose depth and distance is made up by the heavy and deep masses of the ash , oak , and maple ; and the portions nearest the eye or the lawn terminated by a few birches , with their sparkling white stems , and delicate , airy , drooping foliage . Our White birch , being a small tree , is very handsome in such situations , and offers the most pleasing variety to the eye , when /z/ Sean in connexion with other foliage . Several kinds , as the Yellow and the Black birches , are really stately trees , and form fine groups by themselves . Indeed , most beautiful and varied masses might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their characteristic barks , branches , and foliage . As an additional recommendation , many of these trees grow on the thinnest and most indifferent soils , whether moist or dry ; and in cold , bleak , and exposed situations , as well as in warm and sheltered places . We shall enumerate the different kinds as follows : The Canoe birch , Boleau a Canot , of the French Canadians ( B.papy racea ) , sometimes also called the Paper birch , is , according to Michaux , most common in the forests of the eastern states , north of latitude 43 , and in the Canadas There it attains its largest size , sometimes seventy feet in height , and three in diameter . Its branches are slender , flexible , covered with a shining brown bark , dotted with white ; and on trees of moderate size , the bark of the trunk is of a brilliant white ; it is often used for roofing houses , for the manufacture of baskets , boxes , etc. , besides its most important use for canoes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five lines long , are of a middling size , oval , unequally denticulated , smooth , and of a dark green color . The White birch ( B. populifolia ) is a tree of much smaller size , generally from twenty to thirty-five feet in height : it is found in New York and the other middle states , as well as at the north . The trunk , like the foregoing , is covered with silvery bark : the branches are slender , and generally drooping when the tree attains con siderable size . The leaves are smooth on both surfaces ; /z/ heart-shaped at the base , very acuminate , and doubly and irregularly toothed . The petioles are slightly twisted , and the leaves are almost as tremulous as those of the aspen . It is a beautiful small tree for ornamental plantations . The common Black or Sweet birch . ( B. lenta . ) This is the sort most generally known by the name of the birch , and is widely diffused over the middle and southern states . In color and appearance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old trees , at the close of winter , it is frequently detached in transverse portions , in the form of hard ligneous plates six or eight inches broad . The leaves , for a fortnight after their appearance , are covered with a thick silvery down , which disappears soon after . They are about two inches long , serrate , heart-shaped at the base , acuminate at the summit , and of a pleasing tint and fine texture . The wood is of excellent quality , and Michaux recommends its introduction largely into the forests of the north of Europe . The Yellow birch ( B. luted ) grows most plentifully in Nova Scotia , Maine , and New Brunswick , on cool , rich soils , where it is a tree of the largest size . It is remarkable for the color and arrangement of its outer bark , which is of a brilliant golden yellow , and is frequently seen divided into fine strips rolled backwards at the end , but attached in the middle . The leaves are about three and a half inches long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bordered with sharp and irregular teeth . It is a beautiful tree , with a trunk of nearly uniform diameter , straight , and destitute of branches for thirty or forty feet . The Red oirch ( B. rubra ) belongs chiefly to the south , being scarcely ever seen north of Virginia . It prefers the moist soil of river banks , where is reaches a noble height /z/ It takes its name from the cinnamon or reddish color of the outer bark on the young trees ; when old it becomes rough , furrowed , and greenish . The leaves are light green on the upper surface , whitish beneath , very pointed at the end , and terminated at the base in an acute angle . The twigs are long , flexible , and pendulous ; and the limbs of a brown color , spotted with white . The European White birch . ( B. alba . ) This species , the common birch tree of Europe , is intermediate in appearance and qualities between our Canoe birch and White birch . The latter it resembles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellence of its wood . There is a distinct variety of this , to which we have alluded , called the Weeping birch ( Var. pendula ) , w r which is very rapid in its growth , and highly graceful in its form . From the great beauty of our native species , this is perhaps the only European sort which it is very desirable to introduce into our collections . THE ALDER TREE . Alnus . Nat , Ord . Betulaceae . Lin . Syst . Monoecia , Tetrandria . The alder tree is a native of the whole of Europe , where it grows to the altitude of from thirty to sixty feet . Our common Black alder ( A. glauca ) , and Hazel-leaved alder ( A. serrulata ) , are low shrubs of little value or interest . This , however , is a neat tree , remarkable for its love of moist situations , and thriving best in places even too wet for the willows ; although it will also flourish on dry and elevated soils The leaves are roundish in form , wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green in color . The tree rapidly forms an agreeable pyramidal head of foliage , when growing in damp situations . As it is a foreign tree we shall quote from Gilpin its character in scenery . " The alder , " says he , " loves a low , moist soil , and frequents the banks of rivers , and will flourish in the poorest forest swamps where nothing else will grow . It is perhaps the most picturesque of any of the aquatic tribe , except the weeping willow . He who would see the alder in perfection must follow the banks of the Mole in Surrey , through the sweet vales of Dorking and Mickleham , into the groves of Esher . The Mole , indeed , is far from being a beautiful river ; it is a silent and sluggish stream , but what beauty it has it owes greatly to the alder , which everywhere fringes its meadows , and in many places forms very pleasing scenes . It is always associated in our minds with river scenery , both of that tranquil description most frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with that wider and more stirring cast which is to be found amidst the deep glens and ravines of Scotland ; and nowhere is this tree found in greater perfection than on the wild banks of the river Findhorn and its tributary streams , where scenery of the most romantic description everywhere prevails . " * Although the beauty of the alder is of a secondary kind , it is worth occasional introduction into landscapes where there is much water to be planted round , or low running streams to cover with foliage . In these damp places , like the willow , it grows very well from truncheons or large limbs , stuck in the ground , vhich take root and become trees speedily . There are two principal varieties , the /z/ common alder ( A. glutinosa ) , and the cut-leaved aldei ( A. glutinosa laciniata ) . The latter is much the hand somer tree , and is also the rarest in our nurseries . THE MAPLE TREE . Acer . Nat . Ord . Aceraceas . Lin . Syst . Polygamia , Monoecia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle states , as ornamental trees , although they are by no means uncommon in every piece of woods of any extent , is a high proof of their superior merits for such purposes . These consist in the rapidity of their growth , the beauty of their form , the fine verdure of their foliage , and in some sorts , the elegance of their blossoms . Among all the species , both native and foreign , we consider the Scarletflowering maple as decidedly the most ornamental species . In the spring this tree bursts out in gay tufts of red blossoms , which enliven both its own branches and the surrounding scene long before a leaf is seen-on other deciduous trees , and when the only other appearances of vegetation are a few catkins of some willows or poplars swelling into bloom . At that season of the year the Scarlet maple is certainly the most beautiful tree of our forests . Besides this , it grows well either in the very moist soil of swamps , or the dry one of upland ridges , forms a fine clustering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade ; while it is also as little infected by insects of any description as any other tree . The latter advantage , the Sugar maple and our other varieties equally possess . As a handsome /z/ spreading tree , perhaps the White maple deserves most praise , its outline and surface being , in many cases , quite picturesque . There is no quality , however , for which the American maples are entitled to higher consideration as desirable objects in scenery , than for the exquisite beauty which their foliage assumes in autumn , as it fades and gradually dies off . At the first approach of cold we can just perceive a bright yellow stealing over the leaves , then a deeper golden tint , then a few faint blushes , until at length the whole mass of foliage becomes one blaze of crimson or orange . " Tints that the maple woods disclose Like opening buds or fading rose , Or various as those hues that dye The clouds that deck a sunset sky . " The contrast of coloring exhibited on many of our fine river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anything of the kind in the world : and the leading and most brilliant colors , viz. orange and scarlet , are produced by maples . Even in Europe , they are highly valued for this autumnal appearance , so different from that of most of the trees of the old world . Very beautiful effects can be produced by planting the Scarlet and Sugar maples in the near neighborhood of the ash , which , as we have already noticed , assumes a fine brownish purple ; of the sycamore , which is yellow , and some of the oaks , which remain green for a long time : if to these we add a few evergreens , as the White pine and hemlock , to produce depth , we shall have a kind of kaleidoscope ground , harmonious and beautiful as the rainbow . When the maple is planted to grow singly on the lawn , or in small groups , it should never be trimmed up ten 01 /z/ twenty feet high , a very common practice in some places , as this destroys half its beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low down , it will form a very elegant head . The maple is well suited to scenes expressive of graceful beauty , as they unite to a considerable variation of surface , a pleasing softness and roundness of outline . In bold or picturesque scenes , they can be employed to advantage by intermingling them with the more striking and majestic forms of the oak , etc. , where variety and contrast is desired . The European sycamore , which is also a maple , has a coarser foliage , and more of strength in its growth and appearance : it perhaps approaches nearer in general expression and effect to the plane tree , than to our native maples . It is unnecessary for us to recommend this tree for avenues , or for bordering the streets of cities , as its genera prevalence in such places sufficiently indicates its acknowledged claims for beauty , sha'de , and shelter . It bears pruning remarkably well , and is easily transplanted , even when of large size , from its native woods or swamps . The finest trees , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saccharinum ) is a very abundant tree in the northern states and the Canadas , where it sometimes forms immense forests . The bark is white ; the leaves four or five inches broad , and five-lobed ; varying , however , in size according to the age of the tree . The flowers are small , yellowish , and suspended by slender drooping peduncles . The seed is contained in two capsules united at the base , and terminated in a membranous wing ; they are ripe in October . From certain parts of the trunks of old Sugar maples , the fine wood called bird's-eye maple /z/ is taken , which is so highly prized by the cabinet-makers and the sap , which ilows in abundance from holes bored in the stem of the tree early in March , produces the wellknown maple sugar . This can be clarified , so as to equal that of the cane in flavor and appearance ; and it has been demonstrated that the planting of maple orchards , for the production of sugar , would be a profitable investment. * The Scarlet-flowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders of rivers , or in swamps ; the latter place appears best suited to this tree , for it there often attains a very large size : it is frequently called the Soft maple or Swamp maple . The blossoms come out about the middle of April while the branches are yet bare of leaves , and their numerous little pendulous stamens appear like small tufts of scarlet or purple threads . The leaves somewhat resemble those of the Sugar maple , but are rather smaller , and only three or four lobed , glaucous or whitish underneath , and irregularly toothed on the margin . This tree may easily be distinguished when young from the former , by the bark of the trunk , which is grey , with large whitish spots . Its trunk , in the choicest parts , furnishes the beautiful wood known as the curled maple . The White or Silver-leaved maple . ( A. eriocarpum . ) This species somewhat resembles the Scarlet-flowering maple . West of the Alleghany mountains it is seen in perfection , and is well known as the White maple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into four lobes , and have a beautiful white under surface . Michaux , speaking of this tree , says : " In no part of the United * A. nigrum is a variety omitted by Mr. Downing , though quite well known at the time he wrote . It differs from A. saccharinum , in having much larger leaves , and the bark of a darker color ; besides which , the sap is more abundant , an$ much sweeter , and is considered at the West much the finer tree of the two . H. W. S. /z/ States is it more multiplied than in the western country , and nowhere is its vegetation more luxuriant than on the banks of the Ohio . There , sometimes alone and sometimes mingled with the willow , which is found along these waters , it contributes singularly , by its magnificent foliage , to the embellishment of the scene . The brilliant white of the leaves beneath , forms a striking contrast with the Bright green above ; and the alternate reflection of the two surfaces in the water , heightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming an enchanting picture , which , during my long excursions in a canoe in these regions of solitude and silence , I contemplated with unwearied admiration . " * There , on those fine , deep , alluvial soils , it often attains twelve or fifteen feet in circumference . As an ornamental variety , the Silver-leaved maple is one of the most valuable . It is exceedingly rapid in its growth , often making shoots six feet long in a season ; and the silvery hue of its foliage , when stirred by the wind , as well as its fine , half drooping habit , render it highly interesting to the planter . Admirable specimens of this species may be seen in the wide streets of Burlington , N. J. The Moose wood , or Striped maple ( A. striatum ) , is a small tree with beautifully striped bark . It is often seen on the mountains which border the Hudson , but abounds most profusely in the north of the continent . Acer nigrum is the Black sugar tree of Genesee . A. Negundo , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light green hue ; it forms a pleasing tree of medium size . These are our principal native species J * N. A. Sylva , i. 214. t Negundo fraxinifolium. /z/ Among the finest foreign sorts is the Norway maple ( A. platanoides ) , with leaves intermediate in appearance between those of the plane tree and Sugar maple . The bark of the trunk is brown , and rougher in appearance than our maples , and the tree is more loose and spreading in its growth ; it also grows more rapidly , and strongly resembles at a little distance , the button-wood in its young state . Another interesting species is the sycamore tree or Great maple ( A. pseudo-platanus ) . The latter also considerably resembles the plane ; but the leaves , like those of the common maple , are smoother . They are five-lobed , acute in the divisions , and are placed on much longer petioles than those of most of the species . The flowers , strung in clusters like those of the common currant , are greenish in color . It is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continent , and grows with vigor , producing a large head , and widely spreading branches . THE LOCUST TREE . Robinia . Nat . Ord . Leguminosse . Lin . Syst . Diadelphia , Decandria . This is a well-known American tree , found growing wild in all of the states west of the Delaware River . It is a tree of secondary size , attaining generally the height of forty or fifty feet . The leaves are pinnated , bluish-green in color , and are thinly scattered over the branches . The white blossoms appear in June , and are highly fragrant and beautiful ; and from them the Paris perfumers distil an /z/ extrait which greatly resembles orange-flower water , and is used for the same purposes . As an ornamental tree we do not esteem the locust highly . The objections to it are , 1st , its meagreness and lightness of foliage , producing but little shade ; secondly , the extreme brittleness of its branches , which are liable to be broken and disfigured by every gale of wind ; and lastly the abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would not entirely banish the locust from our pleasure-grounds ; for its light foliage of a fresh and pleasing green may often be used to advantage in producing a variety with other trees ; and its very fragrant blossoms are beautiful , when in the beginning of summer they hang in loose pendulous clusters from among its light foliage . These will always speak sufficiently in its favor to cause it to be planted more or less , where a variety of trees is desired . It should , however , be remembered that the foliage comes out at a late period in spring , and falls early in autumn , which we consider objections to any tree that is to be planted in the close vicinity of the mansion . It is valuable for its extremely rapid growth when young ; as during the first ten or fifteen years of its life it exceeds in thrifty shoots almost all other forest trees : but it is comparatively short-lived , and in twenty yea is ' time many other trees would completely overtop and outstrip it It is easily propagated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raising it , and it prefers a deep , rich , sandy loam . The locust can be cultivated to advantage as a timber tree , only upon deep , mellow , and rather rich , sandy soils ; there , its growth is wonderfully vigorous , and an immense number may be grown upon a small area of ground . There are but two distinct species of locust which attain /z/ the size of trees in this country , viz. the Yellow locust ( R. pseud-acacia ) , so called from the color of its wood ; and the Honey locust ( R. viscosa ) , a smaller tree , with reddish flowers , and branches covered with a viscid honey-like gum . Some pretty varieties of the former have been originated in gardens abroad , among which the Parasol locust ( Var. umbraculifera ) is decidedly the most interesting . We recollect some handsome specimens which were imported by the late M. Parmentier , and grew in his garden at Brooklyn , Long Island . They were remarkable for their unique , rounded , umbrella-like heads , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are two pretty distinct varieties of the common Yellow locust , cultivated on the Hudson . That most frequently seen is the White variety , which forms a tall and narrow head ; the other is the Black locust , with a broad and more spreading head , and larger trunk ; the latter may be seen in fine condition at Clermont . It is a much finer ornamental tree , and appears less liable to the borer than the White varietv . THE THREE-THORNED ACACIA TREE . Gleditschia . Nat . Ord . Leguminosae . Lin . Syst . Polygamia , Dioecia . This tree is often called the Three-thorned locust , from some resemblance to the latter tree . Its delicate , doubly pinnate leaves , however , are much more like those of the Acacias , a family of plants not hardy enough to bear our climate . It is a much finer tree in appearance than the common locust , although the flowers are greenish , and inconspicuous , instead of possessing the beauty and fra- /z/ grance of the latter . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful foliage , which wafts so gracefully in the summer breeze , and folds up on the slightest shower , that it stands far above that tree in our estimation , for the embellishment of scenery . The branches spread out rather horizontally , in a fine , broad , and lofty head ; there are none of the dead and unsightly branches so common on the locust ; and the light feathery foliage , lit up in the sunshine , has an airy and transparent look , rarely seen in so large a tree , which sometimes produces very happy effects in composition with other trees . The bark is of a pleasing brown , smooth in surface the branches are studded over with curious , long , triply-pointed thorns , which also often jut out in clusters , in every direction from the trunk of the tree , to the length of four or five inches , giving it a most singular and forbidding look . In winter , these and the long seed-pods , five or six inches in length , which hang upon the boughs at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These pods contain a sweetish substance , somewhat resembling honey ; whence the tree has in some places obtained the name of Honey locust , which properly belongs to Robinia viscosa . Another recommendation of this tree , is the variety of picturesque shapes which it assumes in growing up ; sometimes forming a tall pyramidal head of 50 or 60 feet , sometimes a low horizontally branched tree , and at others it expands into a wide irregular head , quite flattened at the summit . It does not produce suckers like the locust , and may therefore be introduced into any part of the grounds . When but a limited extent is devoted to a lawn or garden , this tree should be among the first to obtain a place ; as one or two Three-thorned Acacias , mingled with other /z/ larger and heavier foliage , will at once produce a charming variety . The Three-thorned Acacia has been strongly recommended for fiedges . It is too liable to become thin at the bottom , to serve well for an outer inclosure , but if kept well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the larger animals , growing up in much less time than the hawthorn . Like the locust , it has the disadvantage of expanding its foliage late in the spring . In the strong rich soils which it prefers , it grows very vigorously , and is easily propagated from seeds . The Three-thorned Acacia ( G. triacanthos ) is the principal species , and is indigenous to the states west of the Alleghanies . G. monosperma is another kind , which is scarcely distinguishable from the Three-thorned , except in having one-seeded pods . The seedlings raised from G. triacanthos are often entirely destitute of thorns . There is a fine species called the Chinese ( G. horrida ) , with larger and finer foliage , and immense triple thorns , which is interesting from its great singularity . A tree of this kind which we imported , has stood our coldest winters perfectly uninjured , and promises to be beautiful and very hardy . Some noble specimens of the common Threethorned Acacia may be seen upon the lawn at Hyde Park , the fine seat of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ord . Leguminosae. l.in . Syst . Decandria , Monogynia . A handsome low tree , about 20 feet in height , which is /z/ found scattered sparsely through warm sheltered valleys , along the Hudson and other rivers of the northern sections of the United States , but most abundantly on the Ohio . It is valuable as an ornamental tree , no less on account of its exceedingly neat foliage , which is exactly heart-shaped , or cordiform , and of a pleasing green tint , than for its pretty pink blossoms . These , which are pea-shaped , are produced in little clusters close to the branches , often in great profusion , early in the spring , before the leaves have expanded . From the appearance of the limbs at that period , it has in some places obtained the name of Redbud . It is then one of the most ornamental of trees , and , in company with the Dog- wood , serves greatly to enliven the scene , and herald the advent of the floral season . These blossoms , according to Loudon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frequently eaten in salads abroad , and pickled by the French families in Canada . The name of Judas tree appears to have been whimsically bestowed by Gerard , an old English gardener , who described it in 1596 , and relates that " this is the tree whereon Judas did hange himselfe ; and not upon the elder tree , as it is said . " There are two species in common cultivation ; the American ( C. Canadensis ) and the European ( C. Siliquastrum ) . The latter much resembles our native tree . The flowers , however , are deeper in color ; the leaves darker , and less pointed at the extremity . It also produces blossoms rather more profusely than the American tree . Both species are highly worthy of a place in the garden , or near the house , where their pleasing vernal influences may be observed . /z/ THE CHESTNUT TREE . Castanea . Nat . Ord . Corylaceae . Lin . Syst . Moncecia , Polyandria . The chestnut , for its qualities in Landscape Gardening ranks with that king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it attains an enormous size , and its longevity in some cases is almost equally remarkable . Its fine massy foliage , and sweet nuts , have rendered it a favorite tree since a very remote period . Among the ancients , the latter were a common article of food . " Sunt nobis mitia pom a , Castanets molles , et press ! copia lactis. " /z/ They appear to have been in general use , both in a raw and cooked state . In times of scarcity , they probably supplied in some measure the place of bread-stuffs , and were thence highly valued : " As for the thrice three angled beech nut shell , Or Chestnut 's armed huske and hid kernell , No squire durst touch , the law would not afford , Kept for the court , and for the king 's own board . " Bp . Hall , Sat . JJ . III . 1 . Even to this day , in those parts of France and Italy nearest the great chestnut forests of the Appenines , these nuts form a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain is but little cultivated , and potatoes almost unknown . There a sweet and highly nutritious flour is prepared from them , which makes a delicious bread . Large quantities of the fruit are therefore annually collected in those countries , and dried and stored /z/ away for the winter 's consumption . Old Evelyn says , " the bread of the flour is exceedingly nutritive : it is a robust food , and makes women well complexioned , as I have read in a good author . They also make fritters of chestnut flour , which they wet with rose-water , and sprinkle with grated parmigans , and so fry them in fresh butter for a delicate . " The fruit of the chestnut abounds in saccharine matter ; and we learn from a French periodical , that experiments have been made , by which it is ascertained that the kernel yields nearly sixteen pel cent , of good sugar . As a timber tree , this is greatly inferior to the oak , being looser grained , and more liable to decay ; and the American wood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side of the Atlantic . It is , however , in general use among us , for posts and rails in fencing ; and when the former are charred , they are found to be quite durable . The finest natural situations for this tree appear to be the mountainous slopes of mild climates , where it attains the greatest possible perfection . Michaux informs us , that the most superb and lofty chestnuts in America are to be found in such situations , in the forests of the Carolinas . Abroad , every one will call to mind the far-famed chestnuts of Mount Etna , of wonderful age and extraordinary size . The great chestnut there , has excited the surprise of numerous travellers ; at present , however , it appears to be scarcely more than a mere shell , the wreck of former greatness . When visited by M. Houel ( Arboretum Brit ) , it was in a state of decay , having lost the greater part of its branches , and its trunk was quite hollow . A house wag erected in the interior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oven , in which , according to the ' custom of I he country , they dried chestnuts , filberts , and other fruits , which they wished to preserve for winter use ; using as fuel , when they could find no other , pieces cut with a hatchet from the interior of the tree . In Brydone 's time , in 1770 , this tree measured two hundred and four feet in circumference . He says it had the appearance of five distinct trees ; but he was assured that the space was once filled with solid timber , and there was no bark on the inside . This circumstance of an old trunk , hollow in the interior , becoming separated so as to have the appearance of being the remains of several distinct trees , is frequently met with in the case of very old mulberry trees in Great Britain , and olive trees in Italy . Kircher , about a century before Brydone , affirms that an entire flock of sheep might be inclosed within the Etna chestnut , as in a fold. * ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most celebrated Chestnut trees on record , is that called the Tortworth Chestnut , in England . In 1772 , Lord Ducie , the owner , had a portrait of it taken , which was accompanied by the following description : " The east view of the ancient Chestnut tree at Tortworth , in the county of Gloucester , which measures nineteen yards in circumference , and is mentioned by Sir Robert Aikins in his history of that county , as a famous tree in King John 's reign : and by Mr. Evelyn in his Sylva , to have been so remarkable in the reign of King Stephen , 1135 , as then to be called the great Chestnut of Tortworth ; from which it may reasonably be presumed to have been standing before the Conquest , 1066 . " This tree is still standing . On the estate of Marshall S. Eice , Esq. , at Newton Centre , is a venerable , though still vigorous and beautiful chestnut tree , the dimensions of which are believed to exceed any tree of the same species in New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence has recently been going on , through the medium of one of our agricultural papers , between the owner of the above tree , and several gcntlehien in this r /id other States , none of whom have shown figures exceeding the following : size of the " Eice Tree " circumference at base of trunk , 24 3-10 feet ; height , 76 feet : spread of limbs , 93 feet . This tree is very prolific , and has never been known to fail of bearing a largo crop of nuts . About five feet from the ground , the trunk divides into two wellformed shafts , which run up to the height of thirty feet , without a branch . /z/ In considering the chestnut as highly adapted to ornament the grounds of extensive country residences , much that we have already said of the oak will apply to this tree . When young , its smooth stem , clear and bright foliage , and lively aspect , when adorned with the numerous light greenish yellow blossoms , which project beyond the mass of leaves , render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a favorite with the poets for its grateful shade ; and as the roots run deep , the soil beneath it is sufficiently rich and sheltered to afford an asylum for the minutest beauties of the woods . Tennyson sweetly says : " That slope beneath the chestnut tall Is wooed with choicest breaths of air , Methinks that I could tell you all The cowslips and the king cups there . " When old , its huge trunk , wide-spread branches , lofty head , and irregular outline , all contribute to render it a picturesque tree of the very first class . In that state , when standing alone , with free room to develope itself on every side , like the oak , it gives a character of dignity , majesty , and grandeur , to the scene , beyond the power of most trees to confer . It is well known that the favorite tree of Salvator Rosa , and one which was most frequently introduced with a singularly happy effect into his wild and picturesque compositions , was the chestnut ; sometimes a massy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and storm-rifted giant , half leafless , or a barren trunk coated with a rich verdure of mosses and lichens . The chestnut in maturity , like the oak , has a great variety of outline ; and no trees are better fitted than these for the formation of grand groups , heavy masses , /z/ or wide outlines of foliage . A higher kind of beauty , with more dignity and variety , can be formed of these two genera of trees when disposed in grand masses , than with any other forest trees of temperate climates ; perhaps we may say of any climate . There is so little difference in the common Sweel chestnut ( Castanea vesca ) of both hemispheres , that they are generally considered the same species . Varieties have been produced in Europe , which far surpass our common chestnuts of the woods in size , though not in delicacy and richness of flavor . Those cultivated for the table in France , are known by the name of marrons . These improved sorts of the Spanish chestnut bear fruit nearly as large as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw , to our wild species , but delicious when roasted . The Spanish chestnut thrives well , and forms a large tree , south of the Highlands of the Hudson , but is rather tender north of this neighborhood . A tree in the grounds at Presque Isle , the seat of William Denning , Esq. , Dutchess Co. , is now 40 feet high . They may be procured from the nurseries , and we can hardly recommend to our planters more acceptable additions to our nut-bearing forest trees . The Chinquapin , or Dwarf chestnut ( C. pumila ) , is a curious low bush , from four to six feet high . The leaves are nearly the size of the ordinary chestnut , or rather smaller , and the fruit about two-thirds as large . It is indigenous to all the states south of Pennsylvania , and is often found in great abundance . It is a curious little tree , or more properly a shrub , and merits a place in the garden ; or it may be advantageously planted for underwood in a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak , forms strong tap-roots , it in removed with some difficulty . The finest trees are produced from the nut , and their growth is much more rapid when young , than that of the transplanted tree . It prefers a deep sandy loam , rather moist than dry ; and will not , like many forest trees , accommodate itself to wet and low situations . THE OSAGE ORANGE TREE . Madura . Wat . Ord . Urticaceae . Lin . Syst . Dicecia , Tetrandria . This interesting tree is found growing wild on the Arkansas River , and other western tributaries of the Mississippi , south of St. Louis , where , according to Mr. Nuttall , it attains the height of 50 or 60 feet . The branches are rather light-colored , and armed with spines ( produced at every joint ) about an inch and a half long . The leaves are long , ovate , and acuminate , or pointed at the extremity ; they are deep green , and more glossy and bright than those of the orange . The blossoms are greenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large orange , but the surface much rougher than that fruit . In the south , we are told , it assumes a deep yellow color , and , at a short distance , strikingly resembles the common orange ; the specimens of fruit which we have seen growing in Philadelphia , did not assume that fine color ; but the appearance of the tree laden with it , is not unlike that of a large orange tree . It was first transplanted into our gardens from a village of the Osage tribe of Indians , whence the common name of Osage orange . The introduction of this tree was one of the favorable results of /z/ Lewis and Clarke 's Expedition . It was named by them in honor of the late Wm . Maclure , Esq. , President of the American Academy of Natural Sciences . The wood is fine grained , yellow in color , and takes a brilliant polish . It is also very strong and elastic , and on this account the Indians of the wide district to which this tree is indigenous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other timber . Hence its common name among the white inhabitants is Bodac , a cor ruption of the term bois d'arc ( bow-wood ) , of the French settlers . A fine yellow dye is extracted from the wood , similar to that of the Fustic . As the Osage orange belongs to the monoecious class of plants , it does not perfect its fruit unless both the male and female trees are growing in the same neighborhood . Many have believed the fruit to be eatable , both from its fine appearance , and from its affinity with and resemblance to that of the bread-fruit ; but all attempts to render it pleasant , either cooked or in a raw state , have hitherto failed : it is therefore probably inedible , though not injurious . Perhaps when fully ripened , some mode of preparing it by baking or otherwise , may render it palatable . As an ornamental tree , the Osage orange is rather too loose in the disposition of its wide-spreading branches , to be called beautiful in its form . But the bright glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good sized tree when covered with the large , orange-like fruit , render it one of the most interesting of our native trees ; while it has the same charm of rarity as an exotic , since it was introduced from the far west , and is yet but little planted in the United States . On a small lawn , where but few trees are needed , and where it is desirable that the /z/ species employed should all be as distinct as possible , to give the whole as much variety as can be obtained in a limited space , such trees should be selected as will not only be ornamental , but combine some other charm , association , or interest . Among such trees , we would by all means give the Osage orange a foremost place . It has the additional recommendation of being a fine shade tree and of producing an excellent and durable wood * The stout growth and strong thorns of this tree have been thought indicative of its usefulness for the making of hedges : a method of fencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country . and from the experiments which we have seen made with plants of the Osage orange , we think it likely to answer a very valuable purpose ; especially in the middle and southern states . The Messrs . Landreth of Philadelphia have lately offered many thousands of them to the public at a low rate , and we hope to see the matter fairly tested in various parts of the Union . A rich deep loam is the soil best adapted to the growth of this tree ; and as it is rather tender when young ( though quite hardy when it attains a considerable size ) it should , as far as possible , be planted in a rather sheltered situation . A dry soil is preferable , if it must be placed in a cold * A very superb effect may be produced with this tree , by cutting it severely back for several years , and compelling it , as the English cull it , to stole , by sending out a dozen leading shoots , instead of one ; a plant treated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gigantic bush , round-headed , and most luxuriant , and when covered with its golden fruit , peeping out from amidst its exquisitely green foliage , it is the most superb floral ornament to a lawn that can be conceived . We recollect a surprisingly fine specimen of an Osage Orange treated in this way , at the late Dr. Edmondston 's , near Baltimore , where a plant about twenty-four years old measured in circumference , one hundred and sixty - five feet ! the limbs lying about with a profusion of growth positively wonderful , and covered with fruit . II . W. S. /z/ aspect , as all plants not perfectly hardy are much injured by the late growth , caused by an excess of moisture and consequent upon an immature state of the wood , which is unable to resist the effects of a severe winter . THE MULBERRY TREE . Morus . Nat . Ord . Urticaceae . Lin . Syst . Moncecia , Tetrandria . The three principal species of the Mulberry , are the common Red American , the European Black , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery ; and the two latter are generally low spreading trees , valued entirely for the excellency of the fruit , or the suitableness of the . foliage for feeding silkworms . Our common mulberry , however , in free , open situations , forms a large , wide-spreading , horizontally branched , and not inelegant tree : the rough , heart-shaped leaves with which it is thickly clothed , afford a deep shade ; and it groups well with the lime , the catalpa , and many other round-headed trees . We consider it , therefore , duly entitled to a place in all extensive plantations ; while the pleasant flavor of its slightly acid , dark red fruit , will recommend it to those who wish to add to the delicacies of the dessert . The timber of our wild mulberry tree is of the very first quality , when fully seasoned , it takes a dull lemon-colored hue , and is scarcely less durable than the locust or Live oak . Like those trees , it is much valued by ship-builders ; and at Philadelphia and Baltimore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floor-timbers , and tree-nails of vessels . The Red mulberry is much slower in its growth /z/ than the locust ; but so far as we are aware it is not liable to the attacks of any insect destructive to its timber ; and it would probably be found profitable to cultivate it as a timber tree . The locust , it will be remembered , grows thriftily only on peculiar soils , loose , dry , and mellow ; the Red mulberry prefers deep , moist , and rich situations . No extensive experiments , so far as we can learn , have been made in its culture ; but w r e would recommend it to the particular attention of those who have facilities for planta tions of this kind . The Black mulberry of Europe ( Morus nigra ) is a low , slow-growing tree , with rough leaves , somewhat resembling those of our Red mulberry , but more coarsely serrated , and often found divided into four or five lobes ; while the leaves , which are not heart-shaped on our nat 've species , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit four or five times as large as the American , full of rich , sweet juice . It has long been a favorite in England , and is one of the most healthy and delicious fruits of the season , Glover says : " There the flushing peach , The apple , citron , almond , pear , and date , Pomegranates , purple mulberry , and fig , From interlacing branches mix their hues And scents , the passengers ' delight . " /z/ We regret that so excellent a fruit should be so little cultivated here . It succeeds extremely well in the middle * Further experience has shown , that this tree is not to be depended upon , at least as fur north as the middle portion of the Hudson Kiver . An admirable substitute for the fruit , is Downing 's Seedling Mulberry , raised some years ago by Mr. Charles Downing , of Newburgh , and while being an excellent fruit , has , we believe , the additional merit of being ever-bearing . II . W. S. /z/ states ; and as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcest , there can be no more welcome addition to our pomonal treasures , than its deep purple and luscious berries . According to Loudon , it is a tree of great durability ; in proof of which he quotes a specimen at Sion House , 300 years old , which is supposed to have been planted in the 16th century by the botanist Turner . The White mulberry ( M. alba ) is the species upon the leaves of which the silkworms are fed . The fruit is insipid and tasteless , and the tree is but little cultivated to embellish ornamental plantations , though one of the most useful in the world , when its importance in the production of silk is taken into account . There are a great number of varieties of this species to be found in the different nurseries and silk plantations ; among them the Chinese mulberry ( M. multicaulis ) grows rapidly , but scarcely forms more than a large shrub at the north ; and its very large , tender , and soft green foliage is interesting in a large collection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is the most valuable of all mulberries as food for the silkworm , while its growth is the most vigorous , and its leaves more easily gathered than those of any other tree of the genus . THE PAPER MULBERRY TREE . Broussonetia . Nat . Ord . Urticacece . Lin . Syst . Dioecia , Tetrandria . The Paper mulberry is an exotic tree of a low growth ; rarely exceeding twenty-five or thirty feet , indigenous to Japan and the South Sea Islands , but very common in our gardens . It is remarkable for the great variety of forms exhibited in its foliage ; as upon young trees it is almost /z/ impossible to find two exactly alike , though the prevailing outlines are either heart-shaped , or more or less deeply cut or lobed . These leaves are considered valueless for feeding the silkworm ; but in the South Seas the bark is woven into dresses worn by the females ; and in China and Japan extensive use is made of it in the manufacture of a paper of the softest and most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young shoots , which is first boiled to a soft pulp , and then submitted to processes greatly similar to those performed in our paper-mills . This tree blossoms in spring and ripens its fruit in the month of August . The latter is dark scarlet , and quite singular and ornamental , though of no value . The genus is dioecious ; and the reason why so few fruit-bearing trees are seen in the United States , is because we generally cultivate only one of the sexes , the female . M. Parmentier , however , who introduced the male plant from Europe , disseminated it in several parts of the country ; and the beauty of the tree has thereby been augmented by the interest which it possesses when laden with its long , hairy berries . The value of the Paper mulberry , in ornamental plantations , arises from its exotic look , as compared with other trees , from the singular diversity of its foliage , the beauty of its reddish berries , and from the rapidity of its growth . It is deficient in hardiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but further south it is considerably esteemed as a shade-tree for lining the side-walks in cities . In winter its light fawn or ash-colored bark , mottled with patches of a darker grey , contrasts agreeably with other trees . It has little picturesque beauty , and should never be planted in quantities , but only in scattered specimens , to give interest and variety to a walk in the lawn or shrubbery . /z/ THE SWEET GUM TREE . Liquidambar . Nat . Ord . Platanaceae . Lin . Syst . MoncEcia , Polyandria . According to Michaux , * the Sweet gum is one of our most extensively diffused trees . On the seashore it is seen as far north as Portsmouth ; and it extends as far south as the Gulf of Mexico and the Isthmus of Darien . In many of the southern states it is one of the commonest trees of the forest ; it is rarely seen , however , along the banks of the Hudson ( except in New Jersey ) , or other large streams of New York . It is not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-lobed leaves are in outline much like the Sugar maple , though darker in color and firmer in texture . It may also be easily distinguished from that tree , by the curious appearance of its secondary branches , which have a peculiar roughness , owing to the bark attaching itself in plates edgewise to the trunk , instead of laterally , as in the usual manner . The fruit is globular , somewhat resembling that of the buttonwood , but much rougher , and bristling with points . The male and female catkins appear on different branches of the same tree early in spring . This tree grows in great perfection in the forests of New Spain . It was first described by a Spanish naturalist , Dr. Hernandez , who observed that a fragrant and transparent gum issued from its trunk in that country , to which , from its appearance , he gave the name of liquid amber . This is now the common name of the tree in Europe ; and the gum is at present an article of export from Mexico , being chiefly valued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balsamic properties . " This substance , which in the shops N. A. Sylva , i. 315. /z/ is sometimes called the white balsam of Peru , or liquid storax , is , when it first issues from the tree , perfectly liquid and clear , white , with a slight tinge of yellow , quite balsamic ; and having a most agreeable fragrance , resembling that of ambergris or styrax . It is stimulant and aromatic , and has long been used in France as a perfume , especially for gloves . " * In the middle states a fragrant substance sometimes exudes from the leaves , and , by incision , small quantities of the gum may be procured from the trunk ; but a warmer climate appears to be necessary to its production in considerable quantities . We hardly know a more beautiful tree than the Liquid amber in every stage of its growth , and during every season of the year . Its outline is not picturesque or graceful , but simply beautiful , more approaching that of the maple than any other : it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which unites and harmonizes well with almost any others in composition ; but the chief beauty lies in the foliage . During the whole of the summer months it preserves , unsoiled , that dark glossy freshness which is so delightful to the eye ; while the singular , regularly palmate form of the leaves readily distinguishes it from the common trees of a plantation . But in autumn it assumes its gayest livery , and is decked in colors almost too bright and vivid for foliage ; forming one of the most brilliant objects in American scenery at that period of the year . The pre vailing tint of the foliage is then a deep purplish red , unlike any symptom of decay , and quite as rich as is commonly seen in the darker blossoms of a Dutch parterre . This is sometimes varied by a shade deeper or lighter , and occasionally an orange tint is assumed . When planted in the /z/ neighborhood of our fine maples , ashes , and other trees remarkable for their autumnal coloring , the effect , in a warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through what are called the pine barrens of New Jersey in such a season , must have been struck with the gay tints of the numberless forest trees , which line the roads through those sandy plains , and with the conspicuous beauty of the Sweet gum , or Liquidamber . The bark of this tree when full grown , or nearly so , is ? xceedingly rough and furrowed , like that of the oak . The wood is fine-grained , and takes a good polish in cabinet work ; though it is not so durable , nor so much esteemed for such purposes , as that of the Black walnut and some other native trees . The average height of full grown trees is about 35 or 40 feet . Liquidambar styraciflua is the only North American species . It grows most rapidly in moist or even wet situa tions , though it will accommodate itself to a drier soil . THE WALNUT TREE . Juglans . Nat . Ord . Juglandaceae . Lin . Syst . MoncEcia , Polyandria . The three trees which properly come under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black walnut , the European walnut , and the Butternut . The Black walnut is one of the largest trees of our native forests . In good soils it often attains a stature of 60 or 70 feet , and a diameter of three or four feet in the trunk , with a corresponding amplitude of branches . The leaves , about a foot or eighteen inches in length , are composed of six or /z/ eight pairs of opposite leaflets , terminated by an odd one They contain a very strong aromatic odor , which is emitted plentifully when they are bruised . The large nut , always borne on the extremity of the young shoots , is round , and covered with a thick husk ; which , instead of separating into pieces , and falling off like those of the hickory , rots away and decays gradually . The kernel of the Black walnut , too well known to need any description here , is highly esteemed , and is even considered by some persons to possess a finer flavor than a-ny other walnut . The timber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as durable as the White oak , and is less liable to the attacks of sea- worms , etc. , than almost any other ; it is , therefore , highly esteemed in naval architecture for certain purposes . But its great value is in cabinet work . Its color , when exposed to the air , is a fine , rich , dark brown , beautifully veined in certain parts ; and as it takes a brilliant polish , it is coming into general use in the United States for furniture , as well as for the interioi finishing of houses . The Black walnut has strong claims upon the Landscape Gardener , as it is one of the grandest and most massive trees which he can employ . When full grown it is scarcely inferior in the boldness of its ramification or the amplitude of its head to the oak or chestnut ; and what it lacks in spirited outline when compared with those trees , is fully compensated , in our estimation , by its superb and heavy masses of foliage , which catch and throw off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Black walnut stands alone on a deep fertile soil it becomes a truly majestic tree ; and its lower branches often sweep the ground in a graceful curve , which gives additional beauty to its whole expression . It is admirably adapted to exten- /z/ sive lawns , parks , or plantations , where there is no want of room for the attainment of its full size and fair proportions . Its rapid growth and umbrageous foliage also recommend it for wide public streets and avenues . The European walnut ( / . regia ) *OT , as it is generally termed here , the Madeira nut , is one of the most common cultivated trees of Europe , where it was introduced originally from Persia . It differs from our Black walnut ( which , however , it much resembles ) in the smooth , grey bark of the stem , the leaves composed of three or four pair of leaflets , and in the very thin-shelled fruit , which , though not exceeding the Black walnut in size , yet contains a much larger kernel , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of France orchards of the walnut are planted , and a considerable commerce is carried on in its products , consisting chiefly of the fruit , of which large quantities are consumed in all parts of Europe . The wood is greatly used in the manufacture of gun-stocks , and in cabinet-making ( though it is much inferior to the American walnut for this purpose ) ; and the oil extracted from the kernel is in high estimation for mixing with delicate colors used in painting and other purposes . The European walnut is a noble tree in size , and thickly clad in foliage . It is much esteemed as a shade tree by the Dutch ; and Evelyn , who is an enthusiastic admirer of its beauties , mentions their fondness for this tree as in the highest degree praiseworthy . " The Bergstras Bergstrasse , which extends from Heidelberg to Darmstadt , is all planted with walnuts ; for as by an ancient law the Borderers were obliged to nurse up and take care of them , and that chiefly for their ornament and shade , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that country under a continual arbor or close walk , the traveller both refreshed with the fruit and shade . How much such public plantations improve the glory and wealth of a nation ! In several places betwixt Hanau and Frankfort in Germany , no young farmer is permitted to marry a wife till he bring proof that he hath planted , and is the father of a stated number of walnut trees . " * The nuts are imported into this country in great quantities ; and as they are chiefly brought from Spain and the Madeiras , they are here almost entirely known by the name of the Madeira nut . The tree is but little cultivated among us , though highly deserving more extensive favor , both on account of its value and beauty . It grows well in the climate of the middle states , and bears freely ; a specimen eighteen or twenty years old , in the garden of the author , has reached thirty-five feet in height , and bears two or three bushels of fine fruit annually ; from which we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of this . As an ornamental tree , Gilpin remarks , that the warm russet hue of its young foliage makes a pleasing variety among the vivid green of other trees , about the end of May ; and the same variety is maintained in summer , by the contrast of its yellowish hue , when mixed in any quantity with trees of a darker tint . It stands best alone , as the early loss of its foliage is then of less consequence , and its ramification is generally beautiful . The Butternut ( / . cathartica ) belongs to this section , and is chiefly esteemed for its fruit , which abounds in oil , and is very rich and sweet . The foliage somewhat Hunter 's Evelyn , p. 168. /z/ resembles that of the Black walnut , though the leaflets are smaller and narrower . The form of the nut , however , is strikingly different , being oblong , oval , and narrowed to a point at the extremity . Unlike the walnut , the husk is covered with a sticky gum , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the walnut genus . The bark of the butternut is grey , and the tops of old trees generally have a flattened appearance . It is frequently an uncoutb ill-shapen , and ugly tree in form , though occasionally , also , quite striking and picturesque . And it is well worthy of a place for the excellence of its fruit. * THE HICKORY TREE . Carya . Nat . Ord . Juglandacese . Lin . Syst . Moncecia , Polyandria . The hickories are fine and lofty North American trees , highly valuable for their wood , and the excellent fruit borne by some of the species . The timber is extremely elastic , and very heavy , possessing great strength and tenacity . It is not much employed in architecture , as it is peculiarly liable to the attacks of worms , and decays quickly when exposed to moisture . But it is very extensively employed for all purposes requiring great elasticity and strength ; as for axletrees , screws , the wooden rings used upon the rigging of vessels , whip-handles , and axe- * Loudon errs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be identical with the Black walnut : no trees in the whole American forest are more easily distinguished at first sight . He also states the fruit to be rancid and of little value ; but no American lad of a dozen years will accord with him in this opin on . /z/ handles ; and an immense quantity of the young poles are employed in the manufacture of hoops , for which they are admirably adapted . For fuel , no American wood is equal to this in the brilliancy with which it burns , or in the duration or amount of heat given out by it : it therefore commands the highest price in market for that purpose . The hickories are nearly allied to the walnuts ; the chief botanical distinction consisting in the covering to the nut , or husk ; which in the hickories separates into four valves , or pieces , when ripe , instead of adhering in a homogeneous coat , as upon the Black walnut and butternut . In size and appearance , the hickories rank with the first class of forest trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 or 80 feet , with fine straight trunks , well balanced and ample heads , and handsome , lively , pinnated foliage . When confined among other trees in the forest , they shoot up 50 or 60 feet without branches ; but when standing singly , they expand into a fine head near the ground and produce a noble , lofty pyramid of foliage , rather rounded at the top . They have all the qualities which are necessary to constitute fine , graceful park trees , and are justly entitled to a place in every considerable plantation . The most ornamental species are the Shellbark hickory , the Pignut , and the Pecan-nut . The former and the latter produce delicious nuts , and are highly worthy of cultivation for their fruit alone ; while all of them assume very handsome shapes during every stage of their growth , and ultimately become noble trees . Varieties of the Shellbark hickory are sometimes seen producing nuts oi twice or thrice the ordinary size ; and we have not the least doubt that the fruit might be so improved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as greatly to surpass the European walnut , for the table . This result will probably be attained by planting the nuts of the finest varieties found in our woods , in rich moist soil , kept in high cultivation ; as all improved varieties of fruit have been , produced in this way , and not , as many suppose , by cultivating the original species . These remarks also apply to the Pecan-nut ; a western sort , which thrives well in the middle states , and which produces a nut more delicate in flavor than any other of this continent . These trees form strong tap-roots , and are , therefore , somewhat difficult to transplant ; but they are easily reared from the nut ; and , for the reason stated above , this method should be adopted in preference to any other , except in particular cases . The principal species of the hickory are the following : The Shellbark hichory ( C. alba ) , so called on account of the roughness of its bark , which is loosened from the trunk in long scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining attached by the middle ; this akes place , however , only on trees of some size . The eaves are composed of two pair of leaflets , with an odd or terminal one . The scales which cover the buds of the Shellbark in winter , adhere only to the lower half , while the upper half of the bud is left uncovered , by which this sort is readily distinguished from the other species . The hickory nuts of our markets are the product of this tree ; they are much esteemed in every part of the Union , and are exported in considerable quantities to Europe . Among many of the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of /z/ New York and New Jersey , the fruit is commonly known by the appellation of the Kisky-tom nut* The Pecan-nut ( Pacainer of the French ) , ( C. olivceformis ) is found only in the western states . It abounds on the Missouri , Arkansas , Wabash , and Illinois Rivers , and a portion of the Ohio : Michaux states that there is a swamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite the Cumberland river , entirely covered . with it . It is a handsome , stately tree , about 60 or 70 feet in height , with leaves a foot or eighteen inches long , composed of six or seven pairs of leaflets much narrower than those of our hickories . The nuts are contained in a thin , somewhat four-sided husk ; they are about an inch or an inch and a half long , smooth , cylindrical , and thin-shelled . The kernel is not , like most of the hickories , divided by partitions , and it has a very delicate and agreeable flavor . They form an object of petty commerce between Upper and Lower Louisiana . From New Orleans , they are exported to the West Indies , and to the ports of the United States , f Besides these two most valuable species , our forests produce the Pignut hickory ( C. porcina ) , a lofty tree with five to seven pairs of leaflets , so called from the compara tive worthlessness of its fruit ; which is very thick-shelled , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , to devour . It is easily distinguished in winter by the smaller size of its brown shoots , and its small oval buds . Its wood is considered the toughest and strongest of any of the trees of this section . The thick Shellbark hickory * In some parts , pleasant social parties which meet at stated times during the winter season , are called Kisky-toms , from the regular appearance of thc ? i nuts among the refreshments of the evening . t N. A. Sylva , i. 168. /z/ ( C. laciniosa ) resembles much in size and appearance the common Shellbark ; but the nuts are double the size , the shell much t k ; cker and yellowish , while that of the latter is white . It is but little known except west of the Alleghanies . The Mockernut hickory ( C. tomentosa ) is so called from the deceptive appearance of the nuts , which are generally of large size , but contain only a very small kernel . The leaves are composed of but four pairs of sessile leaflets , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old trees is very rugged , and the wood is one of the best for fuel . The Bitternut hickory ( C amara ) , sometimes called the White hickory , grows 60 feet high in New Jersey . The husk which covers the nut of this species , has four winged appendages on its upper half , and never hardens like the other sorts , but becomes soft and decays . The shell is thin , but the kernel is so bitter that even the squirrels refuse to eat it . The Water Bitternut ( C. aquatica ) is a very inferior sort , growing in the swamps and rice fields of the southern states . The leaflets are serrated , and resemble in shape the leaves of the peach tree . Both the fruit and timber are much inferior to those of all the other hickories . THE MOUNTAIN ASH TREE . Pyrus* Nat . Ord . Rosacese . Lin . Syst . Icosandria , Di-Pentagyma . The European Mountain ash ( Pyrus aucuparia ) is an elegant tree of the medium size , with an erect stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves are pinnated , four or five inches in length , and slightly resemble those of the ash . The snow-white flowers are produced in large flat clusters , in the month of May , which are thickly scattered over the outer surface of the tree , and give it &; lively appearance . These are succeeded by numerous bunches of berries , which in autumn turn to a brilliant scarlet , and are then highly ornamental . For the sake of these berries , this tree is a great favorite with birds ; and in Germany it is called the Vogel Beerbautn , i. e. bird 's berry tree , and is much used by bird catchers to bait their springs with . Twenty-five feet is about the average height of the Mountain ash in this country . Abroad it grows more vigorously ; and in Scotland , where it is best known by the name of the Roan or Rowan tree , it sometimes reaches the altitude of 35 or 40 feet . The lower classes throughout the whole of Britain , for a long time attributed to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Sir Thomas Lauder informs us that this supeivtition is still in existence in many parts of the Highlands , as well as in Wales . It is probable that this tree was a giv , at favorite with the Druids ; for it is often seen growing near their ancient mystical circles of stones . The dairymaid , in many parts of England , still preserves the old custom of driving her cows to pasture with a switch of the roan tree , which she believes has the power to shield them from all evil spells. * " Evelyn mentions that it is customary in Wales to plant this tree in churchyards ; and Miss Kent in her Sylvan Sketches , makes the following remarks : ' In former times this tree was supposed to be /z/ possessed of the property of driving away witches and evil spirits ; and this property is alluded to in one of the stanzas of a very ancient song , called the Laidley Worm of Spindlcton 's Heughs . ' Their spells were vain ; the boys return 'd To the Queen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where there is rowan-tree wood 1 " " The last line of this stanza leads to the true roading of a stanza in Shakspeare 's tragedy of Macbeth . The sailor 's wife , on the witch 's requesting some chestnuts , hastil ) answers , ' A rown-tree , witch ! ' but many of the editions have it , ' aroint thee , witch ! ' which is nonsense , and evidently a corruption . " * The European Mountain ash is quite a favorite with cultivators here , and deservedly so . Its foliage is extremely neat , its blossoms pretty , and its blazing red berries in autumn communicate a cheerfulness to the season , and harmonize happily with the gay tints of our native forest trees . It is remarkably well calculated for small plantations or collections , as it grows in almost any soil or situation , takes but little room , and is always interesting . " In the Scottish Highlands , " says Gilpin , " on some rocky mountain covered with dark pines and waving birch , which cast a solemn gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a clump and mixing with them , have a fine effect . In summer the light green tint of their foliage , and in autumn the glowing berries which hang clustering upon them , contrast beautifully with the deeper green of the pines : and if they are happily blended , and not in too large a proportion , they add some of the most picturesque furni- /z/ ture with which the sides of those rugged mountains are invested . " We have seen the Mountain ash , here , display , ing itself in great beauty , mingled with a group of hemlocks from among the deep green foliage of which , the coral berries of the former seemed to shoot out ; their color heightened by the dark back ground of evergreen boughs . The American Mountain ash ( Pyrus Americana ) is a native of the mountains along the banks of the Hudson , and other cold and elevated situations in the north of the United States : on the Catskill we have seen some handsome specimens near the Mountain House ; but generally it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome a tree as the foreign sort . In the general appearance of the leaves and blossoms , however , it so nearly resembles the European as to be thought merely a variety by some botanists . The chief difference between them appears to be in the color of the fruit , which on our native tree is copper colored or dull purplish red . It may probably assume a handsome shape when cultivated . The Sorb or Service tree ( Pyrus Sorbus ) is an interesting species of Pyrus , a native of Europe , which is sometimes seen in our gardens , and deserves a. place for its handsome foliage and its clusters of fruit ; which somevhat resemble those of the Mountain ash , and are often eaten when in a state of incipient decay . The leaves are coarser than those of the Mountain ash , and the tree is larger , often attaining the height of 50 or 60 feet in its native soil . The White Beam ( Pyrus Aria ) is another foreign species , also bearing bunches of handsome scarlet berries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not pinnated , but simply serrated on the margin . It grows 30 feet /z/ nigh , and as the foliage is dark green on the upper side , and downy white beneath , it presents an effect greatly resembling that of the Silver poplar in a slight breeze . Abroad , the timber is considered valuable ; but here it is chiefly planted to produce a pleasing variety among other trees , by Us peculiar foliage , and scarlet autumnal fruit . All the foregoing trees grow naturally in the highest , most exposed , and often almost barren situations . When , however , a rapid growth is desired , they should be planted in a more moist and genial soil . They are easily propagated from the seed , and some of the sorts may be grafted on the pear or hawthorn . The seeds , in all cases , should be sown in autumn . THE AILANTUS TREE . Ailantus . Nat . Ord . XanthoxylaceiE . Lin . Syst . Polygamia , Moncecia . Ailanto is the name of this tree in the Moluccas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appellation probably bestowed on account of the rapidity of its growth , and the great height which it reaches in the East Indies , its native country . When quite young it is not unlike a sumac in appearance ; but the exireme rapidity of its growth and the great size of its pinnated leaves , four or five feet long , soon distinguish it from that shrub . During the first half dozen years it outstrips almost any other deciduous tree in vigor of growth , and we have measured leading stems which had grown twelve or fifteen feet in a single season . In four or five years , therefore , it forms quite a bulky head , but after that , period it advances more slowly , and in 20 years would probably be overtopped by the poplar , the plane , or any other fast growing tree . There are , as yet , no specimens /z/ in this country more than 70 feet high ; but the trunk shoots up in a fine column , and the head is massy and irregular in outline , ki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn that in Europe its wood has been applied to cabinet work ; for which , from its close grain and bright satin-like lustre , it is well adapted. * The male and female flowers are borne on separate trees , and both sexes are now common , especially in New York . The male forms the finer ornamental tree , the female being rather low , and spreading in its head . In New York and Philadelphia , the Ailantus is more generally known by the name of the Celestial tree , and is much planted in the streets and public squares . For such situations it is admirably adapted , as it will insinuate its strong roots into the most meagre and barren soil , where few other trees will grow , and soon produce an abundance of foliage and fine shade . It appears also to be perfectly free from insects ; and the leaves , instead of dropping slowly , and for a long time , fall off almost immediately vvhen frost commences . The Ailantus is a picturesque tree , well adapted to produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as its fine long foliage catches the light well , and contrasts strikingly with that of the round-leaved trees . It has a troublesome habit of producing suckers , however , which must exclude it from every place but a heavy sward , where the surface of the ground is never stirred by cultivation . The branches of this tree are entirely destitute of the small spray so common on most forest trees , and have a singularly naked look in winter , well calculated to fix the attention of the spectator at that dreary season . /z/ The largest Ailantus trees in America are growing in Rhode Island , where it was introduced from China , under the name of the Tillou tree . It has since been rapidly propagated by suckers , and is now one of the commonest ornamental trees sold in the nurseries . The finest trees , however , are those raised from seed * THE KENTUCKY COFFEE TREE . Gymnocladus . Nat . Ord . Leguminosae . Lin . Syst . Dicecia , Decandria . This unique tree is found in the western part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north as Montreal , in Canada . But it is seen in the greatest perfection , in the fertile bottoms of Kentucky and Tennessee . Sixty feet is the usual height of the Coffee tree in those soils ; and judging from specimens growing under our inspection , it will scarcely fall short of that altitude , in well cultivated situations , anywhere in the middle states . When in full foliage , this is a very beautiful tree . The whole leaf , doubly compound and composed of a great number of bluish-green leaflets , is generally three feet long , and of two-thirds that width on thrifty trees ; and the whole foliage hangs in a well-rounded mass , that would . ook almost too heavy , were it not lightened in effect by * We think public opinion 1ms very much changed about this tree , since the early editions of this work . Being then but newly introduced , and having ( to Americans ) the very great merit of growing with remarkable rapidity , it was very much sought after , and is now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its flowers and young wood , and the troublesome habit of suckering , have quite thrown it into disfavor , especially since its place can be now supplied by a much more effective tree , from the same country ( Japan ) : the Paulownia growing with equal rapidity , and having an early Spring bloom , of great beauty and sweetness of perfume . H. W. S. /z/ the loose , tufted appearance of each individual leaf . The flowers , which are white , are borne in loose spikes , in the beginning of summer ; and are succeeded by ample brown pods , flat and somevhat curved , which contain six or seven large grey seeds , imbedded in a sweet pulpy substance . As the genus is dioecious , it is necessary that both sexes of this tree should be growing near each other , m order to produce seed . When Kentucky was first settled by the adventurous pioneers from the Atlantic States , who commenced their career in the primeval wilderness , almost without the necessaries of life , except as produced by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered a substitute for coffee in the seeds of this tree , and accordingly the name of Coffee tree was bestowed upon it : but when a communication was established with the seaports , they gladly relinquished their Kentucky beverage for the more grateful flavor of the Indian plant ; and no use is at present made of it in that manner . It has , however , a fine , compact wood , highly useful in building 01 cabinet-work . The Kentucky Coffee tree is well entitled to a place in every collection . In summer , its charming foliage and agreeable flowers render it a highly beautiful lawn tree ; and in winter , it is certainly one of the most novel trees , m appearance , in our whole native sylva . Like the Ailantus , it is entirely destitute of small spray , but it also adds to this the additional singularity of thick , blunt , terminal branches , without any perceptible buds . Altogether it more resembles a dry , dead , and withered combination of sticks , than a living and thrifty tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ihe common appearance of our deciduous trees /z/ in winter ; yet , as it is not so , but a rare and very unique exception to the usual beautiful diversity of spray and ramification , it is highly interesting to place such a tree as the present in the neighborhood of other full-sprayed species , where the curiosity which it excites will add greatly to its value as an interesting object at that period of the year. * Fig. 33 . The Kentucky Coffee Tree . The seeds vegetate freely , and the tree is usually propagated in that manner . It prefers a rich , strong soil , like most trees of the western states . /z/ THE WILLOW TREE . Salix . Nat . Ord . Salicaceoe . Lin . Syst . Dioecia , Diandria . A very large genus , comprising plants of almost every stature , from minute shrubs of three or four inches in height , to lofty and wide-spreading trees of fifty or sixty feet. * They are generally remarkable for their narrow leaves , and slender , round , and flexible branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to the beauty of artificial scenery ; but among them are three or four trees , which , from their peculiar character , deserve especial notice . These are the Weeping , or Babylonian willow ( Salix Babylonica ) , the White , or Huntington willow ( S. alba ) , the Golden willow ( S. vitellina ) , the Russell willow ( S. Russelliana ) , and the profuse Flowering willow ( S. caprea ) . The above are all foreign sorts , which , however ( except the last ) , have long ago been introduced , and are now quite common in the United States . All of them except the first , have an upright or wavy , spreading growth , and form lofty trees , considerably valued abroad for their timber . The White willow and the Russell willow are very rapid in their growth , and have a pleasing light green foliage . The Golden willow is remarkable for its bright yellow bark , which renders it quite ornamental , even in winter . It is a middle sized tree , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle states . Salix caprea is deserving a place in collections for the beauty of its abundant blossoms at an early and cheerless period in the spring . /z/ The chief , and indeed almost the only value of these willows in Landscape Gardening , is to embellish low grounds , streams of water , or margins of lakes . When mingled with other trees , they often harmonize so badly from their extremely different habits , foliage , and color , that unless very sparingly introduced , they can not fail to have a bad effect . On the banks of streams , however , they are extremely appropriate , hanging their slender branches over the liquid element , and drawing genial nourishment from the moistened soil . " Le saule incline sur la rive penchante , Balanjant mollement sa tete blanchissante . " In the middle distance of a scene , also , where a stream winds partially hidden , or which might otherwise wholly escape the eye , these trees , if planted along its course , connected as they are in our minds with watery soils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression of a brook or river , winding its way beneath their shade . In landscapes , the Weeping willow is peculiarly express* ive of grace and softness . Although a highly beautiful tree , great care must be used in its introduction , to preserve the harmony and propriety of the whole ; as nothing could be more strikingly inappropriate than to : ntermix it frequently with trees expressive of dignity or majesty , as the oak , etc. ; where the violent contrast exhibited in the near proximity of the two opposite forms , could only produce discord . The favorite place , where it is most true to nature and itself , is near water , where " it dips Its pendent boughs , stooping as if to drink . " COWPER . /z/ There , when properly introduced , not in too great abundance , hanging over some rustic bridge , or cool jutting spring , and supported , and brought into harmony with surrounding vegetation by such other graceful and lightsprayed trees as the Birch and Weeping elrn , its effect is often surpassingly beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vernal season to burst its buds , and mirror its soft green foliage in the flood beneath , and one of the last in autumn to yield its leafy vesture to the chilling frosts , or fitful gusts of approaching winter . We consider the Weeping willow ill calculated for a place near a mansion which has any claims to size , magnificence , or architectural beauty ; as it does not in anyway contribute by its form or outline to add to or strengthen such characteristics in a building . The only place where it can be happily situated in this way , is in the case of very humble or inconspicuous cottages , which we have seen much ornamented by being completely hidden , as it were , beneath the soft veil of its streaming foliage . There is a very singular variety of the Weeping willow cultivated in our gardens , under the name of the Ringlet willow ; which is so remarkable in the form of its foliage , and so different from all other trees , that it is well worth a place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring or hoop , and the appearance of a branch in full foliage is not unlike a thinly curled ringlet ; whence its commor name . It forms a neat , middle-sized tree , with drooping branches , though hardly so pendent as the Weeping willow . The uses of the willow are extremely numerous . Abroad it is extensively cultivated in coppices , for timber and fuel , /z/ for hoops , ties , etc. ; and we are informed , that in the north ern parts of Europe , and throughout the Russian Empire , the twigs are employed in manufacturing domestic utensils , harness , cables , and even for the houses of the peasantry themselves . From the fibres of the bark , it is said that a durable cloth is woven by the Tartars ; and the bark is used for tanning in various parts of the eastern continent . But by far the most extensive use to which this plant is applied , is in the manufacture of baskets . From the earliest periods it has been devoted to this purpose , and large plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to the culture of particular kinds for this purpose , both in Europe and America . The common Basket willow , an European species ( S. viminalis ) , is the sort usually grown for this purpose , but several others are also employed . For the culture of the basket willows , a deep , moist , though not inundated soil is necessary ; such as is generally found on the margins of small streams , or low lands . " Ropes and baskets made from willow twigs , w r ere probably among the very earliest manufactures , in countries where these trees abound . The Romans used the twigs for binding their vines , and tying their reeds in bundles , and made all sorts of baskets of them . A crop of willows was considered so valuable in the time of Cato , that he ranks the Salictum , or willow field , next in value to the vineyard and the garden . ( Art . Salix . Arb . Brit . ) Among us , the European Basket willow is extensively cultivated , and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Jersey and Pennsylvania . The wood of some of the tree willows , and particularly that of the Yellow willow , and the Shining willow ( S. lucida ) , is /z/ greatly used in making charcoal for the manufacture of gunpowder . It is almost unnecessary to say that all the willows grow readily from slips or truncheons planted in the ground . So tenacious of life are they , that examples are known where small trees have been taken up and completely inverted , by planting the branches and leaving the roots exposed , which have nevertheless thrown out new roots from the former tops , and the roots becoming branches , the tree grew again with its ordinary vigor . THE SASSAFRAS TREE . Laurus . Nat . Ord . Lauracese . Lin . Syst . Enneandria , Monogynia . The Sassafras is a neat tree of the middle size , belonging to the same family as the European laurel or Sweet bay ; it is found , more or less plentifully , through the whole territory of the United States . In favorable soils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 40 or 50 feet in height ; but in the woods it seldom reaches that altitude . The flowers are yellow , and appear in small clusters in May , and the fruit is a small , deep blue berry , seated on a red footstalk or cup . The bark of the wood and roots has an agreeable smell and taste , and is a favorite ingredient , with the branches of the spruce , in the small beer made by the country people . Medicinally , it is considered antiscorbutic and sudorific ; and is thought efficacious in purifying the blood . It was formerly in great repute with practitioners abroad , and large quantities of the bark of the roots were shipped to England ; but the demand has of late greatlv decreased . /z/ The Sassafras is a very agreeable tree to the eye , decked as it is with its glossy , deep green , oval , or three-lobed leaves . When fully grown , it is also quite picturesque for a tree of so moderate a size ; as its branches generally have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially flattened , and considerably varied in outline After ten years of age , this tree always looks older than it re-ally is , from its rough , deeply cracked , grey bark , and rather crooked stem . It often appears extremely well on the borders of a plantation , and mixes well with almost any of the heavier deciduous trees . As it is by no means so common a tree as many of those already noticed , it is generally the more valued , and may frequently be seen growing along the edges of cultivated fields and pastures , appearing to thrive well in any good mellow soil . THE CATALPA TREE . Catalpa . Nat . Ord . Bignoniacere . Lin . Syst . Diandria , Monogynia . A native of nearly all the states south and west of Virginia , this tree has become naturalized also throughout the middle and eastern sections of the Union , where it is generally planted for ornament . In Carolina it is called the Catawba tree , after the Catawba Indians , a tribe that formerly inhabited that country ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed upon it in the north , is only a corruption of that original name . The leaves of this tree are very large , often measuring six or seven inches broad ; they are heart-shaped in form , /z/ smooth , and pale green on the upper side , slightly downy beneath . The blossoms are extremely beautiful , hanging , like those of the Horse-chestnut , in massy clusters beyond the outer surface of the foliage . The color is a pure and delicate white , and the inner part of the corolla is delicately sprinkled over with violet , or reddish and yellow spots ; indeed , the individual beauty of the flowers is so great when viewed closely , that one almost regrets that they should be elevated on the branches of a large forest tree . When these fall , they are succeeded by bean-like capsules or seed-vessels , which grow ten or twelve inches long , become brown , and hang pendent upon the branches during the greater part of the winter . The Catalpa never , or rarely , takes a symmetrical form when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty or fifty feet in diameter . Its large and abundant foliage affords a copious shade , and its growth is quite rapid , soon forming a large and bulky tree . In ornamental plantations it is much valued on account of its superb and showy flowers , and is therefore deserving a place in every lawn . It is generally seen to best advantage when standing alone , but it may also be mingled with other large round-leaved trees , as the basswood , etc. , when it produces a very pleasing effect . The branches are rather brittle , like those of the locust , and are therefore somewhat liable to be broken by the wind . Accustomed to a warmer climate , the leaves expand late in the spring , and wither hastily when frost approaches ; but the soft tint of their luxuriant vegetation is very grateful to the eye , and it appears to be uninjured by the hottest rays of summer . North of this place the Catalpa is rather too tender for exposed situations . /z/ We have seen the Catalpa employed to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river banks , where , if planted , it will soon insinuate its strong roots , and retain the soil firmly . In Ohio , experiments have been made with the timber for the posts used in fencing ; and it is stated on good authority that it is but little inferior , when well seasoned , to that of the locust in durability . Michaux mentions that he has been assured that the honey collected from the flowers is poisonous ; but this we are inclined to doubt ; or at least we have witnessed no ill effects from planting it in abundance in the middle States , in those neighborhoods where bees are kept in considerable numbers . The Catalpa is very easily propagated from seeds sown in any light soil ; and the growth of the young plants is extremely rapid . C. syringafolia is the only species . THE PERSIMON TREE . Diospyros . Nat . Ord . Ebenacese . Lin . Syst . Polygamia , Dicecia . The Highlands of the Hudson , and about the same latitude on the Connecticut , may be considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spreading loose head , of some twenty or thirty feet high , in good soils in the middle states ; but we have seen a /z/ specimen of nearly eighty feet , in the old Bartram Garden at Philadelphia ; and fifty feet is probably the average growth on deep fertile lands in the southern states . The Persimon bears a small , round , dull red fruit , about an inch in diameter , containing six or seven stones ; it is insufferably austere and bitter , until the autumnal frosts have mellowed it and lessened its harshness , when it becomes quite palatable . Considerable quantities of the fruit are annually brought into New York market and its vicinity , from New Jersey , and sold : the produce is very abundant , a single tree often yielding several bushels . A strong brandy has been distilled from them ; and in the south they are said to enter into the composition of the country beer . For the latter purpose they are pounded up with bran , dried , and kept for use till wanted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five inches long , simple , oblong , dark green , and glossy , like those of the orange . The blossoms are green and inconspicuous . The Persimon has no importance as a tree to recommend it ; but it may be admitted in all good collections for its pleasing shining foliage , and the variety which its singular fruit adds to the productions of a complete country residence . The common sort ( D. Virginiana ) grows readily from the seed . There is an European Species ( Dyosporus Lotus ) , with yellow fruit about the size of a cherry , rather less palatable than our native kind . The specimens of this tree , which we have imported , appear too tender to bear our winters unprotected , so that it will probably not prove hardy in the northern states . /z/ THE PEPERIDGE TREE . Nyssa . , Nat . Old . Santalaceae . Lin . Syst . Polygamia , Dioecia . The Peperidge , Tupelo , or sour gum tree , as it is called in various parts of the Union , grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist situations , though we have seen it in New York State , thriving very well in dry upland soils . The diameter of the trunk is seldom more than eighteen inches , and the general height is about forty or fifty feet . The flowers are scarcely perceptible , but the fruit borne in pairs , is about the size of a pea , deep blue , and ripens in October . The leaves are oval , smooth , and have a beautiful gloss on their upper surface . The branches diverge from the main trunk almost horizontally , and sometimes even bend downwards like those of some of the Pine family , which gives the tree a very marked and picturesque character . The Peperidge when of moderate size is not difficult to transplant , and we consider it a very fine tree , both on account of its beautiful , dark green , and lustrous foliage in summer , and the brilliant fiery color which it takes when the frost touches it in autumn . In this respect it is fully equal in point of beauty to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have already described ; and so fine a feature do we consider this autumnal beauty of foliage that we would by all means advise the introduction of such trees as the Peperidge into the landscape for that reason alone , were it not also valuable for its peculiar form and polished leaves in summer . Besides the Peperidge there are three other Nyssas , natives of this continent , viz. the Black gum ( N. Syhatica ) , /z/ a tree of greater dimensions , and larger , more elongated leaves , whose northern boundary is the neighborhood of Philadelphia ; the Large Tupelo ( N. grandidentata ) , a tree of the largest size , with large , coarsely toothed foliage , and a large blue fruit , three-fourths of an inch long , which is sometimes called the wild olive ; and the sour Tupelo ( N. capitata ) , with long , smooth , laurel-like leaves , and light red , oval fruit , called the Wild Lime , from its abounding in a strong acid , resembling that of the latter fruit . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are little known north of Philadelphia . The wood of all the foregoing trees is remarkable for the peculiar arrangement of its fibres ; which , instead of running directly through the stem in parallel lines , are curiously twisted and interwoven together . Owing to this circumstance it is extremely difficult to split , and is therefore often used in the manufacture of wooden bowls , trays , etc . That of the Peperidge is also preferred for the same reason , and for its toughness , by the wheelwrights , in the construction of the naves of wheels , and for other similar purposes . Michaux remarks that he is unable to give any reason why the names of Sour gum , Black gum , etc. , have been bestowed upon these trees , as they spontaneously exude no sap or fluid which could give rise to such an appellation . We suspect that the term has arisen from a comparison of the autumnal tints of these trees belonging to the genus Nyssa , with those of the Sweet gum or Liquidambar , which , at a sliort distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ THE THORN TREE . Crategus . Nat . Ord . Rosaceae . Lin . Syst . Icosandria , Di-pentagynia , A tree of the smallest size ; but though many of the sorts attain only the stature of ordinary shrubs , yet some of our native species , as well as the English Hawthorn ( C. oxycantha ) , when standing alone , will form neat , spreading-topped trees , of twenty or thirty feet in height . Although the thorn is not generally viewed among us as a plant at all conducive to the beauty of scenery , yet we are induced to mention it here , and to enforce its claims in that point of view , as they appear to us highly entitled to consideration . First , the foliage deep green , shining , and often beautifully cut and diversified in form is prettily tufted and arranged upon the branches ; secondly , the snowy blossoms often produced in such quantities as to completely whiten the whole head of the tree , and which in many sorts have a delightful perfume present a charming appearance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruddy crimson or purple haws or fruit , which give the whole plant a rich and glowing appearance in and among our fine forests , open glades , or wild thickets , in autumn . The most ornamental and the strongest growing indigenous kinds are the Scarlet Thorn tree ( C. coccinea ) , and its varieties , the Washington Thorn ( C. populifolid ) , and the Cockspur Thorn ( C. crus-galli ) ; all of which , in good soil , will grow to the height of twenty or thirty feet , and can readily be transplanted from their native sites . The English Hawthorn is not only a beautiful small tree , but it is connected in our minds with all the elegant , /z/ poetic , and legendary associations which belong to it in England ; for scarcely any tree is richer in such than this . With the floral games of May , this plant , from its blooming at that period , and being the favorite of the season , has become so identified , that the blossoms are known in many parts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks and Romans , they were dedicated to Flora , whose festival began on the first of that month ; and in the olden times of merry England , the May-pole , its top decked with the gayest garlands of these blossoms , was raised amid the shouts of the young and old assembled to celebrate this happy rustic festival . Chaucer alludes to the custom , and describes the hawthorn thus : Marke the faire blooming of the Hawthorne tree , Which finely cloathed in a robe of white , Fills full the wanton eye with May 's delight . /z/ And Herrick has left us the following lines to " Corrina going a Maying : " " Come , my Corrina , come ; and coming marke How echo field turns a street , eche street a park Made green , and trimmed with trees ; see how Devotion gives eche house a bough Or branch ; eche porch , eche doore ere this , An arke , a tabernacle is , Made up of Hawthorne , neatly interwove , As if here were those cooler shades of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we extract from the " Romance of Nature . " " Come let us rest this hawthorn tree beneath , And breathe its luscious fragrance as it flies , /z/ And watch the tiny petals as they fall , Circling and winnowing down our sylvan hall . " The berries , or haws , as they are called , have a very rich and coral-like look when the tree , standing alone , is completely covered with them in October . There are some elegant varieties of this species , which highly deserve cultivation for the beauty of their flowers and foliage . Among them we may particularly notice the Double White , with beautiful blossoms like small white roses ; the Pink and the Scarlet flowering , both single and double , and the Variegated-leaved hawthorn , all elegant trees ; as well as the Weeping hawthorn , a rarer variety , with pendulous branches . The Hawthorn is most agreeable to the eye in composition when it forms the undergrowth or thicket , peeping out in all its green freshness , gay blossoms , or bright fruit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; where , mingled with the hazel , etc. , it gives a pleasing intricacy to the whole mass of foliage . But the different species display themselves to most advantage , and grow also to a finer size , when planted singly , or two or three together , along the walks leading through the different parts of the pleasure-ground or shrubbery . THE MAGNOLIA TREE . Magnolia . Nat . Ord . Magnoliaceac . Lin . Syst . Polyandria , Polygynia . The North American trees composing the genus Magnolia ire certainly among the most splendid productions of the forests in any temperate climate ; and when we consider /z/ the size and fragrance of their blossoms , or the beauty of their large and noble foliage , we may be allowed to doubt whether there is a more magnificent and showy genus of deciduous trees in the world . With the exception of a few shrubs or smaller trees , natives of China and the mountains of Central Asia , it belongs exclusively to this continent , as no individuals of this order are indigenous to Europe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first botanists who came over to examine the riches of our native flora , and were transplanted to the gardens of England and France more than a hundred years ago , where they are still valued as the finest hardy trees of that hemisphere . The Large Evergreen Magnolia ( M. grandijlora ) , or Big Laurel , as it is sometimes called , is peculiarly indigenous to that portion of our country south of North Carolina , where its stately trunk , often seventy feet in height , and superb pyramid of deep green foliage , render it one of the loveliest and most majestic of trees . The leaves , which are evergreen , and somewhat resemble those of the laurel in form , are generally six or eight inches in length , thick in texture and brilliantly polished on the upper surface . The highly fragrant flowers are composed of about six petals , opening in a wide cup-like form , of the most snowy whiteness of color . Scattered among the rich foliage , their effect is exquisitely beautiful . The seeds are borne in an oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cells which split longitudinally , when the stony seed , covered with a bright red pulp , drops out . There are several varieties , which have been raised from the seed of this species abroad ; the most beautiful is the Exmouth Magnolia , with fine foliage , rusty beneath ; it produces its /z/ flowers much earlier and more abundantly than the original sort . We regret that this tree is too tender to bear the open air north of Philadelphia , as it is one of the choicest evergreens . At the nurseries of the Messrs . Landreth , and at the Bartram Botanic Garden of Col. Carr , near that city , some good specimens of this Magnolia and its varieties are growing thriftily ; but in the State of New York , and at the east , it can only be considered a greenhouse plant . The Cucumber Magnolia ( C. acuminata ) , ( so called from the appearance of the young fruit , which is not unlike a green cucumber ) takes the same place in the north , in point of majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . Its northern limit is Lake Erie ; and it abounds along the whole range of the Alleghanies to the southward , in rich mountain acclivities , and moist sheltered valleys . There it often measures three or four feet in diameter , and eighty in height . The leaves , which are deciduous , like those of all the Magnolias except the M. grandiftora , are also about six inches long and four broad , acuminate at the point , of a bluish green on the upper surface . The flowers are six inches in diameter , of a pale yellow , much like those of the Tulip tree , and slightly fragrant . The fruit is about three inches long , and cylindrical in shape . Most of the inhabitants of the country bordering on the Alleghanies , says Michaux , gather these cones about midsummer , when they are half ripe , and steep them in whiskey ; the liquor produced , they take as an antidote against the fevers prevalent in those districts . The Umbrella Magnolia ( M. tripetala ) , though found /z/ sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abounds most in the south and west . It is a smaller tree than the preceding kinds , rarely growing more than thirty feet high . The leaves on the terminal shoots are disposed three or four in a tuft , which has given rise to the name of Umbrella tree . They are of fine size , eighteen inches or two feet long , and seven or eight broad , oval , pointed at both ends ; the flowers are also large , white , and numerous ; and the conical fruit-vessel containing the seeds , assumes a beautiful rose-color in autumn . From its fine tufted foliage , and rapid growth , this is one of the most desirable species for our pleasure-grounds . The Large-leaved Magnolia ( M. macrophylld ) is the rarest of the genus in our forests , being only found as yet in North Carolina . The leaves grow to an enormous size when the tree is young , often measuring three feet long , and nine or ten inches broad . They are oblong , oval , and heart-shaped at the base . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hat-crown , and diffusing a most agreeable odor . The tree attains only a secondary size , and is distinguished in winter by the whiteness of its bark , compared with the others . It is rather tender north of New York . The Heart-leaved Magnolia ( M. cordata ) is a beautiful southern species , distinguished by its nearly round , heartshaped foliage , and its yellow flowers about four inches in diameter . It blooms in the gardens very young , and very abundantly , often producing two crops in a season . Magnolia auriculata grows about forty feet high , and is also found near the southern Alleghany range of mountains . The leaves are light green , eight or nine inches long , widest at the top , and narrower towards the /z/ base , where they are rounded into lobes . The flowers are not so fine as those of the preceding kinds , but still are handsome , pale greenish white , and about four inches in diameter . Besides these , there is a smaller American Magnolia , which is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union grows within 150 miles of the seashore . This is the Magnolia of the swamps of New Jersey and the South ( M. glauca ) , of which so many fragrant and beautiful bouquets are gathered in the season of its inflorescence , brought to New York and Philadelphia , and exposed for sale in the markets . It is rather a large bush , than a tree ; with shining , green , laurel-like leaves , four or five inches long , somewhat mealy or glaucous beneath . The blossoms , about three inches broad , are snowy white , and so fragrant that where they abound in the swamps , their perfume is often perceptible for the distance of a quarter of a mile . The foreign sorts introduced into our gardens from China , are the Chinese purple ( M. purpurea ) , which produces an abundance of large delicate purple blossoms early in the season ; the Yulan or Chinese White Magnolia ( M. conspicua ) , a most abundant bloomer , bearing beautiful white , fragrant flowers in April , before the leaves appear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid between the two foregoing , with large flowers delicately tinted with white and purple . These succeed well in sheltered situations , in our pleasure-grounds , and add greatly to their beauty early in the season . Grafted on the cucumber tree , they form large and vigorous trees of great beauty . The Magnolia , in order to thrive well , requires a deep , /z/ rich soil ; which in nearly all cases , to secure their luxuriance , should be improved by adding thereto some leaf mould or decayed vegetable matter from the woods When transplanted from the nursery , they should be preferred of small or only moderate size , as their succulent roots are easily injured , and they recover slowly when large . Most of them may be propagated from seed ; but they flower sooner , grow more vigorously , and are much hardier when grafted upon young stocks of the Cucumber Magnolia . This we have found to be particularly the case with the Chinese species and varieties . All these trees are such superbly beautiful objects upon a lawn in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , that they need no further recommendation from us to insure their regard and admiration from all persons who have room for their culture . If possible , situations somewhat sheltered either by buildings or other trees , should be chosen for all the species , except the Cucumber Magnolia , which thrives well in almost any aspect not directly open to violent gales of wind . THE WHITE-WOOD , OR TULIP TREE . Liriodendron . Nat . Ord . Magnoliaceae . Lin . Syst . Polyandria , Polygynia . The Tulip tree belongs to the same natural order as the Magnolias , and is not inferior to most of the latter in all that entitles them to rank among our very finest forest trees . The taller Magnolias , as we have already remarked , do /z/ not grow naturally within 100 or 150 miles of the seacoast ; and the Tulip tree may be considered as in some measure supplying their place in the middle Atlantic states . West of the Connecticut river , and south of the sources of the Hudson , this fine tree may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 90 feet in height . But in the western states , where indeed the growth of forest trees is astonishingly vigorous , this tree far exceeds that altitude . The elder Michaux mentions several which he saw in Kentucky , that were fifteen and sixteen feet in girth ; and his son confirms the measurement of one , three miles and a half from Louisville , which , at five feet from the ground , was found to be twenty-two feet and six inches in circumference , with a corresponding elevation of 130 feet . The foliage is rich and glossy , and has a very peculiar form ; being cut off , as it were , at the extremity , and slightly notched and divided into two-sided lobes . The breadth of the leaves is six or eight inches . The flowers , which are shaped like a large tulip , are composed of six thick yellow petals , mottled on the inner surface with red and green . They are borne singly on the terminal shoots , have a pleasant , slight perfume , and are very showy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed of a number of scales surrounding the central axis in the form of a cone . It is remarkable that young trees under 30 or 35 feet high , seldom or never perfect their seeds . Whoever has once seen the Tulip tree in a situation where the soil was favorable to its free growth , can never forget it . With a clean trunk , straight as a column , for 40 or 50 feet , surmounted by a fine , ample summit of rich green foliage , it is , in our estimation ; /z/ decidedly the most stately tree in North America . When standing alone , and encouraged in its lateral growth , it will indeed often produce a lower head , but its tendency is to rise , and it only exhibits itself in all its stateliness and majesty when , supported on such a noble columnar trunk , it towers far above the heads of its neighbors of the park or forest . Even when at its loftiest elevation , its large specious blossoms , which , from their form , one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze The Tulip tree Its golden chalice oft triumphantly displays . /z/ jut out from amid the tufted canopy in the month of June , and glow in richness and beauty . While the tree is less than a foot in diameter , the stem is extremely smooth , and it has almost always a refined and finished appearance . For the lawn or park , we conceive the Tulip tree eminently adapted : its tall upright stem , and handsome summit , contrasting nobly with the spreading forms of most deciduous trees . It should generally stand alone , or near the border of a mass of trees , where it may fully display itself to the eye , and exhibit all its charms from the root to the very summit ; for no tree of the same grandeur and magnitude is so truly beautiful and graceful in every portion of its trunk and branches . Where there is a taste for avenues , the Tulip tree ought by all means to be employed , as it makes a most magnificent overarching canopy of verdure , supported on trunks almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bitterness , are but little liable to the attacks of any insect . /z/ This tree was introduced into England about 1608 : and is now to be found in almost every gentleman 's park on 1h Continent of Europe , so highly is it esteemed as an ornamental tree of the first class . We hope that the fine native specimens yet standing , here and there , in farm lands along our river banks , may be sacredly preserved from the barbarous infliction of the axe , which formerly despoiled without mercy so many of the majestic denizens of our native forests . In the western states , where this tree abounds , it is much used in building and carpentry . The timber is light and yellow , and the tree is commonly called the Yellow Poplar in those districts , from some fancied resemblance in the wood , though it is much heavier and more durable than that of the poplar . When exposed to the weather , the wood is liable to warp , but as it is fine grained , light , and easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches , doors , cabinet-work , and wainscots . The Indians who once inhabited these regions , hollowed out the trunks , and made their canoes of them . There are two sorts of timber known ; viz. the Yellow and the White Poplar , or Tulip tree . These , however , it is well known are the same species ( L. tulipifera ) ; but the variation is brought about by the soil , which if dry , gravelly , and elevated , produces the white , and if rich , deep , and rather moist , the yellow timber . It is rather difficult to transplant the Tulip tree when it has attained much size , unless the roots have undergone preparation , as will hereafter be mentioned ; but it is easily propagated from seed , or obtained from the nurseries , and the growth is then strong and rapid . /z/ THE DOGWOOD TREE . Cornus . jft'at . Ord . Cornaceae . Lin . Syst . Tetrandria , Monogynia . There are a number of small shrubs that belong to this genus , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has any claims to rank as a tree . In the middle states , where it abounds , as well as in most other parts of the Union , the maximum height is thirtyfive feet , while its ordinary % elevation is about twenty feet . The Dogwood is quite a picturesque small tree , and owes its interest chiefly to the beauty of its numerous blossoms and fruit . The leaves are oval , about three inches long , dark green above , and paler below . In the beginning of May , while the foliage is beginning to expand rapidly , and before the tree is in full leaf , the flowers unfold , and present a beautiful spectacle , often covering the whole tree with their snowy garniture . The principal beauty of these consists in the involucrum or calyx , which , instead of being green , as is commonly the case , in the Dogwood takes a white or pale blue tint . The true flowers may be seen collected in little clusters , and are , individually , quite small , though surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine white blossom . In the early part of the season , the Dogwood is one of the gayest ornaments of our native woods . It is seen at that time to great advantage in sailing up the Hudson river . There , in the abrupt Highlands , which rise boldly many hundred feet above the level of the river , patches of the Dogwood in full bloom gleam forth in snowy whiteness from among the tender green of the surrounding young foliage , and the gloomier shades of the dark evergreens , /z/ which clothe with a rich verdure the rocks and precipices that overhang the moving flood below . The berries which succeed these blossoms become quite red and brilliant in autumn ; and , as they are plentifully borne in little clusters , they make quite a display . When the sharp frosts have lessened their bitterness , they are the food of the robin , which , at that late season , eats them greedily . The foliage in autumn is also highly beautiful , and must be considered as contributing Jto the charms of this tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is at that season as easily known at a distance by its fine coloring , as the Maple , the Liquidambar , and the Nyssa , of which we have already spoken . Taking into consideration all these ornamental qualities , and also the fact that it is every day becoming scarcer in our native wilds , we think the Dogwood tree should fairly come under the protection of the picturesque planter , and well deserves a place in the pleasure-ground and shrubbery . The wood is close-grained , hard , and heavy , and takes a good polish . It is too small to enter into general use , but is often employed for the lesser utensils of the farm . The bark has been very successfully employed by physicians in Philadelphia , and elsewhere , and is found to possess nearly the same properties as the Peruvian bark . Bigelow states in his American Botany , that its use in fevers has been known and practised in many sections of the Union by the country people , for more than fifty years . Besides this native species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly called the Cornelian cherry , which is now planted in many of our gardens , and grows to the height of twenty or thirty feet . The small /z/ yellow flowers come out close to the branches in March or April , and the whole tree is quite handsome in autumn , from the size , and color of its fine oval scarlet berries . These are as large as a small cherry , transparent , and hang for a long time upon the tree . The leaves are much like those of the common Dogwood . Although the blossoms are produced when the plant is quite a bush , yet it must attain some age before the fruit sets . Altogether , the Cornelian cherry is one of the most desirable of small trees. * /z/ Nat . Ord , Taxaceae . Lin . Syst . Monoecia , Polyandria . This fine exotic tree , which appears to be perfectly hardy in this climate , is one of the most singular in its foliage that has ever come under our observation . The leaves are wedge-shaped , or somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles , and pale yellowish green in color ; the ribs or veins , instead of diverging from the central mid-rib of the leaf , as is commonly the case in dicotyledonous plants , are all parallel ; in short , they almost exactly resemble ( except in being three or four times as large ) those of the beautiful Maiden hair fern ( Adiantum ) common in our woods : being thickened at the edges and notched on the margin in a similar manner . The male flowers are yellow , sessile catkins ; the female is seated in a curious kind of cup , formed by the enlargement of the summit of the peduncle . The fruit is a drupe , about an inch in length , containing a nut , which , according to Dr. Abel , is almost always to be seen for sale in the markets of China /z/ and Japan , the native country of this tree . They are eaten after having been roasted or boiled , and are considered excellent . The Salisburia was introduced into this country by that zealous amateur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodlands , near Philadelphia , who brought it from England in 1784 , where it had been received from Japan about thirty years previous . There are several of these now growing at Woodlands ; and the largest measures sixty feet in height , and three feet four inches in circumference . The next largest specimen which we have seen is now standing on the north side of that fine public square , the Boston Common . It originally grew in the grounds of Gardiner Green , Esq. , of Boston ; but though of fine size , it was , about three years since , carefully removed to its present site , which proves its capability for bearing transplanting . Its measurement is forty feet in elevation , and three in circumference . There is also a very handsome tree in the grounds of Messrs . Landreth , Philadelphia , about thirty-five feet high and very thrifty . We have not learned that any of these trees have yet borne their blossoms ; at any rate none but male blossoms have yet been produced . Abroad , the Salisburia has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been reared from the nuts . The bark is somewhat soft and leathery , and on the trunk and branches assumes a singular tawny yellow or greyish color . The tree grows pretty rapidly , and forms an exceedingly neat , loose , conical , or tapering head . The timber is very solid and heavy ; and the tree is said to grow to enormous size in its native country . Bunge , who accompanied the mission from Russia to Pekin , states that he saw /z/ near a Pagoda , an immense Ginko tree , with a trunk nearly forty feet in circumference , and still in full vigor of vegetation. * Although nearly related to the Pine tribe , and forming , apparently , the connecting link between the coniferce and exogenous trees , yet , unlike the former tribe , the wood of the tree is perfectly free from resin . The Ginko tree is so great a botanical curiosity , and is so singularly beautiful when clad with its fern-like foliage , that it is strikingly adapted to add ornament and interest to the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be viewed near by to understand its peculiarity , and as the form and outline of the tree are pleasing , and harmonize well with buildings , we would recommend that it be planted near the house , where its unique character can be readily seen and appreciated . Salisburia adiantifolia is the only species . In the United States it appears to flourish best in a rich fertile soil , rather dry than otherwise . South of Albany it is perfectly hardy , and may therefore be considered a most valuable acquisition to our catalogue of trees of the first class . It has hitherto been propagated chiefly from layers ; but cuttings of the preceding year 's growth , planted early in the spring , in a fine sandy loam , and kept shaded and watered , will also root without much difficulty . When the old trees already mentioned ( which have doubtless been raised from seed ) begin to blossom , plants reared from them by cuttings or grafts , will , of course , produce blossoms and fruit much more speedily than when reared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nat . Or A. Coniferae . Lin . Syst . Moncecia , Monadelphia . The Southern or Deciduous cypress ( Taxodium disti* chum ) * is one of the most majestic , useful , and beautiful trees of the southern part of North America . Naturally , it is not found growing north of Maryland , or the south part of Delaware , but below that boundary it becomes extremely multiplied . The low grounds and alluvial soils subject to inundations , are constantly covered with this tree ; and on the banks of the Mississippi and other great western rivers , for more than 600 miles from its mouth , those vast marshes , caused by the periodical bursting and overflowing of their banks , are filled with huge and almost endless growths of this tree , called Cypress swamps . Beyond the boundaries of the United States its geographical range extends to Mexico ; and Michaux estimates that it is found more or less abundantly , over a range of country more than 3000 miles in extent . " In the swamps of the southern states and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of vegetable mould is deposited every year by the floods , the Cypress attains its utmost development . The largest stocks are 120 feet in height , and from 25 to 40 feet in circumference above the conical base , which at the surface of the earth is always three or four times as large as the continued diameter of the trunk ; in felling them , the negroes are obliged to raise themselves upon scaffolds five or six feet from the ground The roots of the largest stocks , particularly of such as are /z/ most exposed to inundation , are charged with conical protuberances , commonly from eighteen to twenty-four inches , and sometimes , four or five feet in thickness ; these are always hollow , smooth on the surface , and covered with a reddish bark , like the roots , which they resemble also in the softness of their wood ; they exhibit no sign of vegetation , and I have never succeeded in obtaining shoots by wounding their surface and covering them with the earth . No cause can be assigned for their existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear when it is twenty or twenty-five feet in height ; they are not made use of except by the negroes for bee-hives . " " The foliage is open , light , and of a fresh , agreeable tint ; each leaf is four or five inches long , and consists of two parallel rows of leaflets , upon a common stem . The leaflets are small , fine , and somewhat arching , with the convex side outwards . In the autumn , they change from a light green to a dull red , and are shed soon after . " " The Cypress blooms in Carolina about the first of February . The male and female flowers are borne separately , by the same tree ; the first in flexible pendulous aments , and the second in bunches , scarcely apparent . The cones are about as large as the thumb , hard , round , of an uneven surface , and stored with small , irregular , ligneous seeds , containing a cylindrical kernel ; they are ripe in October , and retain their productive virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given of the Cypress in its native soils . In the middle states it is planted only as an ornamental tree ; and while , in the South , its great abundance N. A. Sylva. ii . 332. /z/ causes it to be neglected or disregarded as such , its rarity here allows us fully to appreciate its beauty . North of the 43 of latitude it will not probably stand the winter without protection ; but south of that , it will attain a good size . The finest planted specimen which we have seen , and one which is probably equal in grandeur to almost any in their native swamps , is growing in the Bartram Botanic Garden , near Philadelphia . That garden was founded by the father of American botanists , John Bartram , who explored the southern and western territories , then vast wilds , at the peril of his life , to furnish the savans and gardens of Europe , with the productions of the new world , and who commenced the living collection , now unequalled , of American trees , in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Cypress , a tree of noble dimensions , measuring at this time 130 feet in height and 25 in circumference . The tree was held by Bartram 's son , William , while his father assisted in planting it , ninety-nine years ago . The elder Bartram at the time expressed to his son , the hope that the latter might live to see it a large tree . Long before he died ( not many years since ) , it had become the prodigy of the garden , and great numbers from the neighboring city annually visit it , to admire its vast size , and recline beneath its ample shade . The foliage of the Cypress is peculiar ; for while it has a resemblance to the Hemlock , Yew , and other evergreen trees , its cheerful , bright green tint , and loose airy tufts of foliage , give it a character of great lightness and elegance . In young trees , the form of the head is pyramidal or pointed ; but when they become old , Michaux remarks , the head becomes widely spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect . This is also /z/ heightened by the deep furrows or channels in the trunk , and the singular excrescences or knobs already described , which , jutting above the surface of the ground , give a strange ruggedness to the surface beneath the shadow of its branches . A single Cypress standing alone , like that in the Bartram Garden , is a grand object , uniting with the expression of great elegance and lightness in its foliage ? that of magnificence , when we perceive its extraordinary height , and huge stem and branches . In composition , the Cypress produces the happiest effect , when it is planted with the hemlock and firs , with which it harmonizes well in the form of its foliage , while its soft light green hue is beautifully opposed to the richer and darker tints of those thickly-clad evergreens . Wherever there is a moist and rather rich soil , the Cypress may be advantageously planted : for although we have seen it thrive well on a fertile dry loam , yet to attain all its lofty proportions , it requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient supply of moisture . There its growth is quite rapid ; and although it may , at first , suffer a little from the cold at the north , in severe winters , yet it continues its progress , and ultimately becomes a stately tree . In many parts of the southern states , the timber of this tree , which is of excellent quality , is extensively used in the construction of the framework and outer covering of houses . It is also esteemed for shingles ; and a large trade has long been carried on ' from the south in Cypress shingles . Posts made of this tree are found to be very lasting ; and it is also employed for water-pipes , masts of vessels , etc . In the north , its place is supplied by the Pine /z/ timber , but in many southern cities , particularly New Orleans , it will be found to enter into the composition of almost every building . In the nurseries , the Cypress is usually propagated from the seed ; and as it sends down strong roots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it attains too great a development . The European Cypress ( Cupressus sempervirens ) , a beautiful evergreen tree , shaped like a small Lombardy poplar , which is the principal ornament of the churchyards and cemeteries abroad , is unfortunately too tender to endure the winter in any of the states north of Virginia . South of that state , it may probably become naturalized , and serve to add to the catalogue of beautiful indigenous evergreen trees . From its dark and sombre tint , and perpetual verdure , it is peculiarly the emblem of grief : " Binde you my brows with mourning Cyparesse , And palish twigs of deadlier poplar tree , Or if some sadder shades ye can devise , Those sadder shades vaile my light-loathing eyes . " /z/ THE LARCH TREE . Larix . Nat . Ord . Coniferae . Lin . Syst . M onoecia , Monadelphia . The Larch is a resinous , cone-bearing tree , belonging to the Pine family , but differing from that genus in the annual shedding of its leaves like other deciduous trees . fn Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps and Appenines ; and in America , is indigenous to the most /z/ northern parts of the Union , and the Canadas . The leaves are collected in little bunches , and the branches shoot out from the main stem in a horizontal , or , more generally in a declining position . Fig. 36 . The European Larch . For picturesque beauty , the Larch is almost unrivalled . Unlike most other trees which must grow old , uncouth , and misshapen before they can attain that expression , this is singularly so , as soon almost as it begins to assume the stature of a tree . It can never be called a beautiful tree , so far as beauty consists in smooth outlines , a finely rounded head , or gracefully drooping branches . But it has what is perhaps more valuable , as being more rare , the expression of boldness and picturesqueness peculiar to itself , and /z/ which it seems to have caught from the wild and rugged chasms , rocks , and precipices of its native mountains . There its irregular and spiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surrounding hills , . and suit well with the gloomy grandeur of those frowning heights . Like all highly expressive and characteristic trees , much more care is necessary in introducing the Larch into artificial scenery judiciously , than round-headed trees . If planted in abundance , it becomes monotonous , from the similitude of its form in different specimens ; it should therefore be introduced sparingly , and always for some special purpose . This purpose may be either to give spirit to a group of other trees , to strengthen the already picturesque character of a scene , or to give life and variety to one naturally tame and uninteresting . All these objects can be fully effected by the Larch ; and although it is by far the most suited to harmonize with and strengthen the expression of scenery naturally grand , or picturesque , with which it most readily enters into combination ; yet , in the hands of taste , there can be no reason why so marked a tree should not be employed in giving additional expression to scenery of a tamer character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon thin , barren , and dry soils , is another great merit which it possesses as an ornamental tree ; and it is also a necessary one to enable it to thrive well on those very rocky and barren soils , where it is most in character with the surrounding objects . It is highly valuable to produce effect or shelter suddenly , on portions of an estate , too thin or meagre in their soil to afford the sustenance necessary to the growth of many other deciduous trees . /z/ The Larch is the great timber tree of Europe . Its wood is remarkably heavy , strong , and durable , exceeding in all those qualities the best English oak . To these , it is said to add the peculiarity of being almost uninflammable , and resisting the influence of heat for a long time . Vitruvius relates that when Caesar attacked the castle of Larignum , near the Alps , whose gate was commanded by a tower built of this wood , from the top of which the besieged annoyed him with their stones and darts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set fire to the whole . When , however , all the former were consumed , he was astonished to find the Larch tower uninjured. * The Larch is unquestionably the most enduring timber that we have . It is remarkable , that whilst the red wood or heart wood is not formed at all in the other resinous trees , till they have lived for a good many years , the Larch , on the contrary , begins to make it soon after it is planted ; and while you may fell a Scotch fir of thirty years old , and find no red wood in it , you can hardly cut down a young Larch large enough to be a walking stick , without finding just such a proportion of red wood compared to its diameter as a ' ree , as you will find in the largest Larch tree in the forest , compared to its diameter . To prove the calue of the Larch as a timber tree , several experiments were made in the river Thames . Posts of equal thickness and strength , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing the river wall , where they were alternately covered with water by the effect of the tide , and then left dry by its fall . This species of alternation is the most trying of all circumstances for the endurance of timber ; and accordingly the oaken posts decayed , ana were twice renewed in the course of a very few years , /z/ while those that were made of the Larch remained altogether unchanged . Besides the foregoing species ( Larix Europea ) *we have two native sorts much resembling it ; which are chiefly found in the states of Maine , Vermont , and New Hampshire . These are known by the names of the Red Larch ( L. Microcarpa ) and the Black Larch ( L. pendula ) , which latter is often called Hackmatack . In the coldest , parts of the Union , these often grow to 80 and 100 feet high ; but in the middle states they are only seen in the swamps , and appear not to thrive so well except in such situations . For this reason the European Larch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either for profit or ornament . The latter is generally increased from seed in the nurseries . The American Larches are well worthy a place where sufficient moisture can be commanded , as their peculiar forms are striking , though not so finely picturesque as that of the European species . * A very curious and remarkable addition to the varieties of this genus is ( Larix pendula ) the Weeping Larch , differing from our ( Pendula Americana American Weeping Larch , and much more extraordinary . When worked ten or fifteen feet high , the inclination of the branches and spray is immediately downward , and when gently swayed by the wind , it is excessively graceful and pretty . We do not know a more distinctive and striking tree , or one more rare . It seems difficult to transplant at leat this is our experience and it can only be increased by grafting by approach . Nurserymen are apt to work it too low : it should never be grafted at a less distance than ten to twelve feet and for some years , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is apt to be top-heavy . This curious variety was found accidentally , if we remember right , some ten to fifteen years since , in a nursery near Hereford , England , by ; i Mr. Gtodsall , and is known in English nurseries as Larix , communis pendiila Godsalii . Larix Griffitfiii , the Sikkin Larch , and Abies Icxmfcri ( though at present classed as an Alies , we believe may prove to be Larch ) , are two very new varieties , too expensive ; at present to be generally introduced . A Kce-mftri , known also as the Golden Pine of China , is very highly extolled for its beautiful green in Summer , and golden color in Autumn or Winter . - II . W , S. /z/ In the upper part of Massachusetts , we have observed them in their native soils growing 70 or 80 feet high , and assuming a highly pleasing appearance .

Lin . Sysl . Dccandria , Monogynia . This fine American tree , still very rare in our ornamental plantations , is a native of West Tennessee , and the banks of the Kentucky river , and in its wild localities seems confined to rather narrow limits . It was named , when first discovered , after the poet Virgil , whose agreeable Georgics have endeared him to all lovers of nature and a country life . The Virgilia is certainly one , of the most beautiful of all that class of trees bearing papilionaceous , or pea-shaped flowers , and pinnate leaves , of which the common locust may serve as a familiar example . It grows to a fine , rather broad head , about 30 or 40 feet high , with dense and luxuriant foliage much more massy and finely tufted than that of most other pinnated-leaved trees . Each leaf is composed of seven or eight leaflets , three or four inches long , and half that breadth , the whole leaf being more than a foot in length . These expand rather late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of May , followed by numerous terminal racemes , or clusters , of the most delicate and charming pea-shaped blossoms , of a pure white . These /z/ clusters are six or eight inches in length , a.d quite broad , the flowers daintily formed , and arranged in a much more graceful , loose , and easy manner , than those of the locust . They have a very agreeable , slight perfume , especially in the evening , and the whole effect of the tree , when standing singly on a lawn and filled with blossoms , is highly elegant . When the blossoms disappear , they are followed by the pods , about the fourth of an inch wide , and three or four inches long , containing a few seeds . These ripen in July or August . This tree is frequently called the Yellow-wood in its native haunts its heart wood abounding in a fine yellow coloring matter , which , however , is said to be rather difficult to fix , or render permanent . The bark is beautifully smooth , and of a greenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they die off , take a lively yellow tint . This tree grows pretty rapidly , and is very agreeable in its form and foliage , even while young . It commences flowering when about ten or fifteen feet high , and we can recommend it with confidence to the amateur of choice trees as worthy of a conspicuous place in the smallest collection . The only species known is Virgilia lutea . It was first described by Michaux , and was sent to England about the year 1812 . Quite the finest planted specimens within our knowledge are growing in some of the old seats in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia , where there are several thirty or forty feet in height , and exceedingly beautiful , both in their form and blossoms . A small specimen on our lawn , eighteen feet high , blossoms now very profusely. /z/ THE PAULOWNIA TREE . Paulownia . Nat . Ord . JScrophulariuceae . Lin . Syst .

It is remarkable for the large size of its foliage , and the great rapidity of its growth . The largest leaves are more than two feet in diameter , slightly rough or hairy , and serrated on the edges . They are heart-shaped , and have been likened to those of the Catalpa , but they perhaps more nearly resemble those of the common Sun-flower . In its growth , this tree , while young , equals or exceeds the Ailantus . In rich soils , near Paris , it has produced shoots , in a single season , 12 or 14 feet in length . After being two or three years planted , it commences yielding its blossoms in panicled clusters . These are bluish lilac , of an open mouthed , tubular form , are very abundantly distributed , and , together with the large foliage , and the robust habit of growth , give this tree a gay and striking appearance . Its flower buds open during the last of April , or early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should the Paulownia prove as hardy as ( from our fine dry summers for ripening its wood ) we confidently anticipate* it will be worthy of a prominent place in every arrangement of choice ornamental trees . * We doubt if this tree proves quite as hardy as Mr. Downing believed . Our own trees , some of the oldest in the country , have missed their bloom for three years though previously , they had blossomed regularly and well . It is not impossible that , as the tree gets older , and its growth less rampant , it may ripen off its wood better , and thus be in a better condition to resist Spring frost ? . H. W.

In either continent they form the densest and most extensive forests known , and their wood in civil and naval architecture , and for various other purposes , is more generally used than any other . In the United States and the Canadas , there are ten species ; in the territory west of the Mississippi to the Pacific , including Mexico , there are fourteen ; in Europe fourteen ; in Asia , eight , and in Africa , two species .

On Mount Blanc , the Pines grow within 2,800 feet of the line of perpetual snow. * In Mexico , also , Humboldt found them higher than any other tree ; and Lieut . Glennie describes them as growing in thick forests on the mountain of Popocatapetl , as high as 12 , 693 feet , beyond which altitude vegetation ceases entirely . f The Pines are , most of them , trees of considerable magnitude and lofty growth , varying from 40 to 1 50 or even 200 feet in height in favorable situations , rising with a perpendicular trunk , which is rarely divided into branches bearing much proportionate size to the main stem , as in most deciduous trees . The branches are much more horizontal than those of the latter class ( excepting the Larch ) . The leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little parcels of /q/
