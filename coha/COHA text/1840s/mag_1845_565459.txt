txt Such an ecclesiastical system deserves well of mankind . It ought not to be bated and despised as anarchical . It keeps things in their right place . It is potent for good ; imbecile for evil . It trains up the people to a feeling of personal responsibility , and personal reliance . it inflames them with an intelligent love of civil and religious liberty . It banishes error from the church by free discussion , and by a wholesome watch and discipline : while it encourages progress in divine knowledge by making the Bible the source and standard of faith . We commend the system to the favor of all . Not that an assent to these views should hurry the assentors , violently and tumultuously , from their hierarchical churches into a Congregational enclosure-but , remaining , if best , in their present relations , let them still honor the primitive ecclesiastical system , the mother of modern freedom : and let those to whom the opportunity is given of founding or strengthening Congregational churches , embrace the privilege . THEODORE PARKER AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked period in the history of Liberal Christianity in Boston and this country . It will be as the year of the Hegira to the followers of the prophet , whether with as happy an issue we do not presume to say . We are certain of this ; that the events which have occurred ; the principles which these events have illustrated and tested ; and the discussions which have turned upon them , are all memorable and likely to be remembered . Our readers will not be surprised oT displeased , we think , that we again invite their attention to Mr. Parker and his brethren of the Liberal School . Mr. Parker 's South Boston sermon , " On the Transient and Permanent in Christianity , " it will be remembered was preached May 19 , 1841 . The " Discourse of Religion , " &amp;c. , was delivered as a series of lectures , the following autumn and winter and afterwards published in a volume . The sensation which * A Letter to the Boston Association of Congregational Ministers , touchino cer-a tam matters of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church in Roxbnry . Boston , C. C. Little &amp; J. C.

Reviews and newspaper critiques were for a time numerous , concerning Mr. Parker and his opinions . The Boston Association also , of which Mr. P. is a member , after some delay took the matter in hand , and expressed their disapprobation of his opinions in ways sufficiently significant , and by no means the most agreeable . The storm which was raised , had gradually lulled into a calm previously to the last autumn . Mr. Parker had gone to Germany for a few months , and from which it is said the unclean spirit which possessed him first came . Perhaps it was hoped , that be would there in some of its dry places , seek and find rest . But he returned , and though we do not affirm that he brought with him seven other spirits , we are quite confident , that if he had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or raised a mightier storm . On Sunday , Nov. 17 , 1844 , Mr. Parker exchanged pulpits with Rev. Mr. Sargent , a member of the Boston Association , and minister at large attached to the Suffolk Chapel , // which is under the care of the Benevolent Fraternity of churches . The Executive Committee of this Fraternity immediately took the subject into consideration , addressed a communication to the ministers at large , " expressive of their views in relation to Mr. Parker , and of the grounds upon which his admittance to the pulpits of the Fraternity was not to be desired . " In other words Mr. Sargent was made to understand , after a very gentle fashion indeed , but in a manner sufficiently decided , that the thing was not to happen a second time . To this Mr. Sargent replied , declining to give any pledges as to his future course , and tendering his resignation . This was accepted by the committee with many expressions of regret and some delay . Mr. Waterston another of the ministers at large , and we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied by a letter , in which he warmly and earnestly acceded to and adopted the views of the committee . Upon this commenced the storm . Mr. Sargent the Sunday following his resignation , preached a sermon on " Obstacles to the Truth , " to a large audience in the Flollis street meeting house . This sermon was immediately published . The month following , another event occurred which did not tend to allay the agitation On the 26th of December , Mr. Parker preached " the Thursday Lecture " to a full and attentive audience . This he did , not by invitation , as may well be guessed , but in his turn , by his right as a member of the Boston Association . It was remarked by the reporters for the press , that he was alone in the pulpit . The sermon was speedily printed . Its theme and title were " The Relation of Jesus to*this Age and the Ages . " It is a brief but decided expression of his views of historical Christianity and the Gospel narrative , differing not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The style is perhaps more luxuriant in its beauty , and the application to Mr. Parker 's opponents , more pointed and offensive . A few weeks after , it was announced , that the Boston Association had surrendered the care of " the Thursday Lecture " to the minister of the first church . Jan. 5 , 1845 . The Executive Committee of the Benevolent Fraternity made their quarterly report , in which they recited their proceedings in the case of Mr. Sargent , with the letters of Messrs . Sargent and Waterston . The meeting of the Fraternity was full ; the proceedings were approved by a formal vote , two voices dissenting , and the report was ordered to be printed . This brought the matter in review before the community of Liberal Christians , and it was earnestly discussed in private and through the press . While the excitement was fresh , the Sunday following , ( Jan. 12 , ) Rev. J. F. Clarke , pastor of " the Church of Disciples , " preached a sermon in which he explained to his congregation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show by action his own principles in respect to the question of ministerial fellowship now before the churches ; and had decided in consequence to exchange with Mr. Parker the second Sunday succeeding . Mr. Clarke , it may be proper to say here , is the farthest possible from adopting Mr. Parker 's peculiar views ; and " the Church of the Disciples , " though based on " the largest liberty , " in respect to theological opinions , as conditions of membership , was constituted expressly to realize and promote a higher style of religious life . Its maxims and ways are many of them such as we greatly like . It represents in the Unitarian body the evangelical or Methodist movement , and is the church of " Revivals and Prayer Meetings . " The announcement by Mr. Clarke was received by many of his church with regret // and disapprobation . During the weeks intervening , there was abundance of conference and discussion ; meetings large and small were held , to induce the pastor to recede from his position , but without success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place . A large minority of the church did not attend the service , nor hear Mr. Parker , but withdrew to Amory Hall , and held separate worship . The sermon preached by Mr. Parker , " On the Excellency of Goodness , " was published . So also the proceedings of the Church of the Disciples , in respect to the exchange , with a history of the discussions and opinions expressed in them , was given to the public iii " the Christian World , " followed by several communications from Mr. Clarke , explaining and defending the ground he had taken . The minority of the church were soon organized into a separate society , under the name of " the Church of the Savior , " and the pastoral care of Rev. Mr. Waterston . The discussions in the Liberal ranks become more and more earnest . " The Christian Register , " the ancient organ of the denomination , takes its ground with the coolness and self-complacence that becomes an establishment so aristocratic and conservative , with a moderate infusion of contempt for Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " kindles into a martyr-spirit in anticipation of " the Baptism of Fire , " to which the churches might be called for the defense of the faith and in the cause and name of a living and real Savior . On the one side a pamphlet is issued , short and pithy , consisting of brief " questions addressed to Rev. Theodore Parker and his friends , " which would be all well and to the point , from any but a Liberal Christian . On the other side appears , " The true Position of Rev. Theodore Parker , " which is quite as significant on its side of the question , and quite as searching in the truths which it sends home to the exclusive party . Rev. Mr. Furness of Philadelphia , hearing the strife at a distance , interposes his mediation from the city of brotherly love , " in two sermons " On Christian Union and the Truth of the Gospels , " in which he is simple or honest enough to charge upon his Boston brethren , a dereliction from their ancient principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest of liberal Christianity has been with orthodoxy , and Unitarians have been the assertors of freedom of conscience and inquiry and Christian charity , and in the ardor of our liberality , we have insisted over and over again , that whether a man believe in the trinity or unity of God , whether he receive the tenets of the orthodox faith or reject them , is a small matter , if he only has a free , honest , charitable temper . We have taken up the noble doctrine of the apostle , and declared that without a charitable spirit a man is nothing , though he have all faith so that he could remove mountains , and that with charity he is all , whatever may be the errors of his understanding . " Mr. Furriess 's interference , and above all with such a confession , seems not to have been the most acceptable to the conservative Bostonians . Meanwhile , as we should expect , the Unitarian clergy , each in their several pulpits , preach with greater or less directness , on the subject so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exclusive principle . " Some of these sermons are published . Dr. Frothingham of the first church , prints four discourses under the significant title , " Deism or Christianity , " as though this were the question before the denomination . He names his sermons thus- " Evidence , Creed , the Difference , the Warning , " from which we conclude , that he has read Carlyle and Emerson . In the sermon of " the Creed , " he thus de // dares the conclusion of the whole matter ,  --  " Let us have a belief , therefore . How can we otherwise have any portion in the believer 's rest and hope ? Let us have a creed also . For how else can we tell or know what we believe ? Only let it he held with humility , and seriousness , and charity . We need not ask too curiously how much there is of it , nor of what precise kind it is .

Ware of West Cambridge , the author of " Zenobia " and " Proteus , " gives to the public two sermons , entitled " Righteousness before Doctrine , " with the text , " Forbid him not , for he that is not against us , is for us . " Into the field thus occupied by lighter troops , the Christian Examiner leads on its heavier force with becoming dignity . The elaborate article in the March number of that Journal , is able , fair and conciliatory , and takes the best position in respect to " Mr. Parker and his views , " which could be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the denomination . And no liberal Christian , we presume none , does understand himself and the interests of his denomination more perfectly than does the writer of that article . Of Mr. Parker he says , adopting a just distinction between the spiritual truths and the historical facts of revelation , " We do not understand that he denies the Christian truths . On the contrary , he both recognizes and insists on them , makes theta prominent and authoritative and calls for faith in them , as just and essential to the true life . So far as they are concerned , he whose course ha* given so much pain to his brethren , is a Christian believer ; and so far as the inculcation of these truths is concerned , he is most certainly a Christian teacher . " - . . . " So far as faith in the supernatural mission of Christ , or in the historical record of his life is concerned , Mr. Parker is not a Christian believer . " This article was followed by Remarks on an article , &amp;c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two others have appeared which we have not seen . But the most remarkable publication , elicited by this discussion , is the " Letter to the Boston Association of Congregational Ministers , touching certain matters of their theology , " by Theodore Parker . This is dated , March 20th , 1845 , and is one of the last of the many pamphlets issued , but not one of the least in its significance . It is not very long , but quite long enough to satisfy the Boston Association . It is not very difficult to be understood , but rather more so to be digested , especially by those for whom the morceau was prepared . It is not very logical in its form and method , but its aim can not be shunned nor its force broken . It is withal somewhat tartly written , but it comes from one , in whom reverence for the authority of men and names is not the most largely developed , and perhaps on whom it has not been the most faithfully inculcated . There is too an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but perhaps it is only that of one who knows his advantage and means to use it , courteously , indeed , as becomes one who has been trained in a school in which courtesy is a prime virtue , and yet strongly , as we Calvinists should expect from him with our views of human nature . We give a few extracts* // " Gentlemen-The peculiar circumstances of the last few years have placed both you and me in new relations to the public and to one another . * You have , I am told , at great length , and in several consecutive meetings , discussed the subject of my connection with your reverend body ; you have debated the matter whether you should expel me for heresy , and by a circuitous movement , recently made , have actually excluded me from preaching the Thursday lecture . * * * Until recently the Unitarians have been supposed to form the advance guard , so to say , of the church militant ; at least they have actually been the movement party in Theology . As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand the matter , this work was in part intellectual , hut in a greater part moral , for they declared , either directly or by implication , the right of each man to investigate for himself in matters pertaining to religion , and his right also to the Christian name if he claimed it , and his character seemed to deserve it . They called themselves liberal Christians , and seemed to consider that he was the best Christian who was most like Christ in character and life , thus making religion the essential of Christianity , and leaving each man to determine his own theology . * * * The Unitarians have no reco*nized and public creed . It used to be their glory . At the Theological School in Cambridge I subscribed 00 symbolical books ; at my ordination , 1 assented to no form of doctrines-neither church nor council requesting it . When I became a member of your learned body , no one asked me of my opinions whether orthodox or heterodox . * * * I have no wish to disguise my theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let it stand or fiJI by itself . But still I do not know that 1 have transgressed the limits of Unitarianisin , for I do not know what these limits are . It is a great glory to a liberal association , to have no symbolical books , but a great inconvenience that a sect becoming exclusive should not declare its creed . I can not utter the shibboleth of a party till I first hear it pronounced in the orthodox way . " As you have had the field of controversy entirely to yourselves these several years , and as yet have not , as a body , mache a public and authorized statement of your theological belief , I roust beg you to inform me what is orthodoxy according to the Boston Association . The orthodoxy of the Catholic church I know very well ; I am not wholly ignorant of what is called orthodoxy by the Lutheran and Calvinistic churches ; but the ORTHoDoxy of the Boston Association of Congregational Ministers is not a thing so easy to come at . As I try to comprehend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undefined . It changes color , and it changes shape ; now it seems a mountain , then it appears like a cloud ; - you will do a great service , if you will publish your symbolical books and let the world know what is the true doctrine according to the Boston Association of Congregational Ministers . " He then addressed to them a series of " scholastic and dogmatic questions , &amp;c . " These all relate to the authority and inspiration of the Old and New Testamenhs and the connection between right views of these points , and the claim to salvation and the Christian name . Some of these questions contemplate views of these points that are extravagant and false , which they first caricature and thea ridicule . Of these views we have only to say , that the falsehood is a fair mark for the shaft , and we speed it home to that , only desiring that the falsehood may not he mistaken for the truth . Others there are , which bring out opinions that are held by leading Unitarian divines and perhaps by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing upon the question at issue between Mr. Parker and that body . We give a few of these questions . " 1 . What do you mean by the word salvation ? 2 . What do you mean by a miracle ? 3 . What do you mean by inspiration ? 4 . XVhat do you mean by revelation ? 7 . What do you consider the essential doctrines of Christianity ; what moral and religious truth is taught by Christianity , that was wholly unknown to the human race before the time of Christ ?  --  and is there any doctrine of Christianity that is not a part also of natural religion ? 9 . Do you believe that all or any of the authors of the Old Testament were miraculously inspired , so that all or any of their language can properly be called the TVord of God , and their writings constitute a miraculous revelation ? " &amp;c. &amp;c. ( 14 is a question to the same purport respecting the New Testament. ) " 10 . Do you believe the law contamed // in the Pentateuch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed to man ? or is it , like the law of Massachusetts , a human work in whole or in part ? 12 . Do you believe that any prophet of the Old Testament , solely through a miraculous revelation made to him by God , did distinctly and unequivocally foretell any distant and future event , which has since come to pass , and in special that any prophet of the Old Testament , did thereby and in manner aforesaid , distinctly and unequivocally foretell the birth , life , sufferings , death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth , so that Jesus was in the proper and exclusive sense of the word , the Messiah predicted by the prophets and expected hy the Jews ? 17 . Do you believe that Jesus of Nazareth was miraculously horn , as it is related in two of the Gospels , with hut one human parent , that he was tempted by the Devil and transfigured , talking actually with Moses and Elms ; that he actually transformed the substance of water into the substance of wine ; fed five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked on the waters ; miraculously stilled a tempest ; sent demons out of men into a herd of swine ; and that he restored to life persons wholly and entirely dead ? 23 . Do you believe that the writers of the four Gospels and the book of Acts , never mingled mythical , poetical , or legendary matter in theircompositions ; that they never made a mistake in a matter of fact ; and that they have in all cases reported the words and actions of Jesus with entire and perfect accuracy ? 24 . Do you believe the miracles related in the book of the Acts-for example , the miraculous inspiration of the Apostles at Pentecost ; the cures effected by Peter , his vision , his miraculous deliverance from prison by the angel of the Lord , ' the miraculous conversion of Paul , " &amp;c. &amp;c . The answer to these questions as they might be found in Unitarian books and periodicals we do not care to quote . What they would be , is too notorious to need a reference or verification . The attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent with Unitarian orthodoxy , would wake in scorn a thousand deafening echoes . But it will be asked , What if all this be so ? ' What if leading Unitarian writers and divines have held some and even all of these opinions and are still retained in fellowship , has Mr. Parker therefore a claim to the same fellowship ? Their opinions are not the same with his . And whence does he derive his authority , from practice or liberal principles , to complain of inconsistency and injustice , in that he is refused while they receive courtesy and fellowship ? Let us look at the state of the case . What have the Boston Association done in the way of withholding this fellowship ? They have not expelled Mr. Parker from their body . They have not fastened upon him a formal censure . But they have generally refused to exchange with him ; which is a withholding of courtesy that thirty years since , and in respect to the same Boston Association , was deemed a grave and unpardonable offense , to proceed against which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy . " Five of the entire Association and three only of the city members have exchanged with Mr. Parker since May , 1841 , while the other associations in the neighborhood have done as before . Some of this body have been zealous to impose on the ministry at large , ' the implied promise , as a condition of their office , that they shall not exchange with him . They have indirectly shut him out from the Thursday lecture ; they have morally and publicly held up Mr. Parker as unworthy the confidence of the community as a Christian teacher , ' and // his system as deism and not Christianity . They have treated him in such a way in personal conference , that it has been semi-officially stated , that it was surprising that a man of spirit and delicacy should not take the hint and withdraw from a place where he was not wanted . Under these circumstances , what are Mr. Parker 's grounds of complaint , and are they well founded ? He has no where stated them in the form and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they are substantial , and deserve the consideration of all concerned . I. His first ground of complaint is , that his brethren having done so much , have done no more ; that having in effect degraded him from their society , and sought to deny him caste in his profession , they have not done it in form and with the reasons clearly assigned , and by a regular process , such as is common to all organized societies . Mr. P. has been served with no definite charges ; no trial in which he might face in his defense confronting witnesses and confronting arguments , and no sentence or decision on which to stand or to which to yield . We know very well that a charge may be falsely and foolishly ureed against a man , and yet it defines what he is to meet . If guilty , it measures the extent of his guilt , and secures him from all imputation of greater guilt than he deserves to bear . If innocent , it gives him the most effectual instrument of self-defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a means of the basest cunning ; but it is also a priceless boon , as giving opportunity to unmask the false swearer and expose the cunning machination . A sentence may but proclaim the iniquity of a corrupt judge ; but even in that case it gives the injured man the best and surest instrument by which to argue his cause over again at the tribunal of public opinion : while if it be just and true , it defends him whom it convicts from worse imputations and more enormous accusations . Hence , regular and organized bodies , with all their imperfections , are greatly to be preferred to those that are irregular and therefore irresponsible . These last are proverbially unfair and indefinite in their charges , prejudiced and impatient in their inquisition for truth , capricious in their decisions , and remorseless in the execution of them . Hence , all societies of men , who respect themselves , the public and the truth , if they receive a man to their fellowship , do it on the principles on which their union is based ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the coup de grace in an orderly way . It is only theater rowdies and half insane politicians that hustle a man out when they are determined to endure him no longer . We see not why all this is not as true of things ecclesiastical as of things secular ; and yet there are men who are seized with a cold shivering at the very name of a creed and of discipline as maintaining a creed , and at once begin to talk of the dreary history of councils and the inquisition : whereas , we understand the very essence of the inquisitorial spirit to be a capricious disregard of facts and of the principles of justice . That in which the inquisitor and the Jesuit agree is , that it is right to do any thing and in any way for the church ; or in other words , to sacrifice the individual if the cause demand it . We are not insensible to the evils that pertain to a creed , and to the spirit that too often is present in discipline , and against these evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray to be delivered from associations , whether ministerial or otherwise , that have no principles of union , except to tolerate us as long as they can , and then to get rid of us , because they must , without telling us or telling the community why . // 2 . Mr. P. may complain that it is a thing unheard of and new that liberal Christians have a symbol or creed , and that it is inconsistent with all their principles to frame or use such a symbol . The question here is a question of fact . It is not what ought to be , hut what actually is and has been . It is not whether it is fit that a symbol should be held , but whether liberal Christians have held one , either written or implied . Much argument has been used in the newspapers and pamphlets , to prove that a bond of sympathy and union is needed in a common belief ; and much more has been said , in the way of ridicule and warm assertion , to show how absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divine revelation to exchange with one who preaches that such a thing can not be and never was given . Much that has been said on this point , has been truly said , and well said , and earnestly said. * We certainly can have no objection to it , but heartily approve it all . But the fact remains fixed , that the Unitarians have in the past fought most lustily against all kinds of creeds , and called them by the hardest names . In distinction from the sects , as they have been pleased to call them , they have held themselves forth as liberal Christians , including men of all faiths but of one spiritor as Mr* Furness says , " of a free , honest and charitable temper . " Especially have they cried out against the enforcement of a creed in the way of discipline . The thought of such a thing has filled them with horror , and called up the most doleful images of the dungeons of the * The following , from the Christian Register , is worth copying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do when unbelief Is trumpeting its views ? Why put it in the pulpit , sir , To keep it from the pews . " inquisition , of Father Dominic with his red-hot iron tongs , of the rack and the thumb screw . It is said , indeed , that in these objections to a creed there has always been intended a creed raised from the Bible , while it was implied that the Bible was received as a revelation ; that when every other creed was rejected , it was asserted in the same breath that the Bible was their only creed ; - that in the phrase liberal Christian , the predicate liberal was limited by the subject Christian , and that Christian implies the receiving of the Christian Scriptures as true . XVe admit that this was often the fact . But this does not make in the least against the fact asserted , that the arguments , the principles , by which they fought against creeds , thus limited , would not ride over these limits as easily as over any other . This does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to receive a man , who defines for himself what Christianity is-especially if he holds that Christianity is a perpetual and not an occasional revelation from God . Th*se arguments are summed up by asserting the difference between a man 's religion and his theology , and the assertion that his religion was to be the test of fellowship and not his theology . If , then , a man passes this test-if his religion is confessedly satisfactory-what more is to be said , especially if his unbelieving theology treats the moral part of the Bible with greater respect than others treat it , with their greater respect for its history ? Nothing is to be said . Mr. Parker is still to be received , or their principles must be abandoned , and with their principles , all their fine arguments ad liberalitat em , for themselves , and ad invidiam , against the sects . But again , is it said that it may be very proper to give our fellowship to Mr. Parker as a Christian believer , but not as a Christian teacher ? We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he teaches is true , which is the main thing in the case . If Christianity be but a revelation of the doctrines of the absolute religion , it may be to be regretted indeed that Mr. Parker does not take our view , or the right view , of some things pertaining to its history and sanctions ; but who shall say that he does not teach Christianity ; and if he teaches Christianity , who shall say that he is not a Christian teacher ? The argument then relating to the fact in respect to their holding the Christian revelation , has neither pertinency nor force , when we show to what the principles would lead when the facts are changed . The principles of liberal fellowship are the principles on which Mr. P. stands , and he must stand a liberal Christian still , and a Christian teacher till they set up new foundations . So have these principles been understood by a large portion of the Unitarians . So Mr. Furness understands them , so does Mr. Ware , so does Mr. Clarke , none of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laymen i*nderstand them . The discussions show it . On the one side , we have the assertion that liberal Christians have received the Bible in fact , and on the other , the argument from liberal maxims . 3 . Mr. Parker may ask , what is in fact the symbol , or creed , by the application of which he is now to be excluded from fellowship . It is loosely said in reply , the . same that has always prevailed and been understood to exist , the reception of the Christian Scriptures . This is admirable as it meets the ear , and we doubt not as it meets the heart of many devoutly disposed Unitarians . But what is it to receive the Christian Scriptures in the liberal sense of the phrase ? The Mormon receives the Christian Scriptures . So , too , we believe , does the Mohammedan . We remember that in our childhood , we heard of an old soldier of the Revolution who said that the Bible was a very good book , especially the history of the wars in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the war of 76 . It seems to us that he thought as well of that part of the Bible at least , as certain divines whom the Unitarians receive as on the right side of this Bible-dividing line , while they would set Mr. Parker so rudely over on the wrong side . It has been earnestly contended , for instance , by some very well meaning Unitarians , who are , we presume , innocently ignorant that Mr. Parker is not to be admitted to a Christian pulpit , because forsooth , he denies that Jesus was the Messiah predicted by the prophets , and expected by the Jews on the basis of these prophecies . This may be a very good reason for such a conclusion in itself considered , but it is hardly consistent to be urged by or to those who at the same time receive and honor with high authority and influence those who deny that the Old Testament gives any prophetic intimations of a Messiah . But this was held in a review of Hengstenberg 's Christology attributed to Mr. Noyes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noyes is not a liberal Christian only , but a Christian teacher , nor this alone , but one who teaches those who are preparing to be Christian teachers , in the interpretation of the Bible . * We give the following quotations . " Having come to the conclusion that the language of the prophets in the sense which we have reason to suppose they assigned to it , gives us no intimation of a suffering , dying Messiah , or one who should rise from the dead , and no clear and proper predictions which were fulfilled in Jesus personally , we have endeavored , " &amp;c . Christ . Exam . Vol. 16 , P. 364 . So p. 360 : " When he ( Jesus ) affirmed that he was the Messiah , he only affirmed in figurative language , that he was the inspired teacher sent from God , for whose instructions the Jewish dispensation had been a preparation , and who was designed by God , to fulfill his great purpose in relation to the instruction of the Jewish nation and of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this , and yet in this very discussion respecting Mr. Parker , he is distinctly and frequently contrasted with Mr. Parker , as a cautious , reverent , and trustworthy expounder of the Scriptures . So too it is earnestly contended that Mr. Parker has lightly and profanely said that the Savior was deceived himself , or left others to be deceived , in applying to himself these prophecies . But Mr. Noyes and Mr. Norton must certainly rest in one solution or the other , if we rightly understand their view of the prophecies themselves , and from what both Mr. Norton and Mr. Furness have written , we gather , that they do not shrink from one , at least , of these conclusions . It is also objected that he makes the recorded facts of the Gospels to be but myths and fables . But Mr. Norton says , of the first two chapters of Matthew , that they are to be rejected , partly for critical reasons , but mainly from objections arising from " the intrinsic character " of the narrative . To the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative in the two chapters appears to belong from its intrinsic character . In the story of the magi , we find represented a strange mixture of astrology and miracle . " The narrative in Luke , is open to no critical objections . It is as genuine as any part of the books which Mr. Norton has labored so long to prove to be so in order to establish Christianity on an unshaken foundation . But of this narative he says , " With its real miracles , the fictions of oral tradition had probably become blended ; and the individual who committed it to writing probably added what he regarded as poetical embellishments . " So also , Mr. Furness gives this as the probable solution of the annunciation to Mary " There was every thing in the sentiments of the time and country , and in the probable situation of the mother of Jesus , to exalt her imagination ; and in view of her ap proaching marriage , to cause her to dwell upon the idea of the Messiah , until the thought wove itself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destined mother of that divine personage , and even that she had conceived before her espousals . " " The influence of the mother upon her child before it has seen the light , will not be questioned . " " We know not the mode nor the extent of the influence . It is a divine mystery . Still we must believe that the angel-thoughts and dreams of the blessed mother of our Lord must have ministered a part of the sacred discipline whereby he was prepared and sanctified , even in her sacred womb , to be the Son of God and Redeemer of man . " His conclusion is that incidents pertaining to this period , and certain remarkable experiences of the mother of Jesus , " viewed through the magnifying medium of the faith , veneration , and enthusiasm which the remarkable life that was just closed had produced , were shaped and exaggerated thereby . " And of these the evangelists selected what seemed to them " to be nearest the truth . " Of the Old Testament Mr. Norton holds that the Pentateuch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual law came neither from Moses nor from God , on the ground that parts of them are worthy of neither , and that the prophets and Jesus contended against the whole system of sacrifices with all their force . He allows that there was a divine and miraculous revelation by Moses , inasmuch as Christianity proceeds on this supposition , and is so far responsible for the Jewish religion , and because the elevated views of God among the Jews attested it , and the sublime conceptions of the Psalmists and of Isaiah must have been wrought upon by such knowledge previously given to the race in a miraculous way . We do not make these references , to give an adequate and full account // of the various shades of opinion that are held within the pale of the liberal school , nor have we made all that we might to show that these views are not the exceptions , the strange monstrosities in the museum of their interpreters . Too many there are among them , whose " faith in these particulars , " according to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found , perchance , to hang around them about as loosely as a tunic of muslin . " We rejoice in the belief that there are many among them , who reject the assumptions of the writers we have quoted , as heartily as they do the more consistent hut bolder theories of Mr. Parker . But we can not see how in any proper sense of the terms , the Bible or the reception of the Christian Scriptures is the basis of their fellowship . The facts and opinions adduced show that the Bible is not the creed which liberal Christians would now set up . They do not dream of such a thing . It is something far different from this . As we understand it , their creed is the belief in a divine revelation accompanied* by miracles . This is a fair statement of the creed which by its self-acting operation is to keep them on " the foundation of the apostles and prophets , " and to shut out infidels from this Christian body . We pause here a moment to add , that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up the Bible as a bond of fellowship , in distinction from consent to certain principles , as the truths which the Bible reveals . In the obvious meaning of the words , the Bible our creed , it means the reception , as a revelation from God , of all that is within the covers of what is commonly called the Bible . how illiberal this would be , we can easily see . The rejection of a hook , or a chapter , or a verse , on critical grounds , as no part of the Bible given of God , would of course exclude a man from the Christian fellowship . Rev. J. Pye Smith , for instance , could not preach in one of the pulpits at Boston because he doubts whether the Song of Solomon properly belongs to the Bible ; and Prof. Tholuck must find the door of every liberal church closed against him for his views of a part of Isaiah or John ; or if the test mean less than this , if it mean what our liberal friends make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to admit Mr. Parker , or only just as wide as it may suit the convenience of those who bold it that it should be . From the very indeterminateness of the phrase , it may become the instrument of caprice and injustice . The only reasonable bond of fellowship , is the believing that God in revealing himself to man has revealed some truths , and the consent to these truths as in fact revealed ; - at the same time avowing that the Bible is the primal and only authority for our faith in them , and that by the Bible this faith is perpetually to he tested , and either rejected or confirmed . In this sense is it that " the Bible and the Bible only is the religion of Protestants . " Now , the misfortune of our liberal friends is , that this test they can not apply , for in order to accommodate the greatest number of believers , they have in fact received those who held that the Bible reveals nothing , but simply asserts anew the doctrines of the absolute religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When then a man comes forward and says , I hold the same principles which the Bible teaches , though I have a peculiar way of viewing the Bible , it is hard to reject him . Hence , they turn and say , " the Bible is our creed ; " which we have shown signifies too much , or it means nothing . * Not authenticated , for that , though it would please Mr. Norton , would let out upon the domains of infidelity , too large a number easily to be spared . // But we return to Mr. Parker and his brethren . 4 . The actual creed of the liberal Christians being defined , Mr. P. may ask whether it justifies itself ? whether it has sufficient reasons to offer for its own vindication ? whether , in short , the difference between himself and Mr. Norton or Mr. Furness is great enough to authorize his ex-clusion ? The creed is this : " I believe that Jesus is a messenger sent from God , who taught religious truth and wrought a miracle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only a man ; that his coming was not predicted by the Jewish prophets , and that in claiming that it was , he but accommodated himself to Jewish tropes and interpretations ; that he never promised to aid his apostles by spiritual influences after his death ; and their record of his life and deeds , and explanations of his teachings , are not always to he relied upon , but that the gospels are largely mingled with matter that is mythical and legendary : in short , he may believe that the New Testament is as little to be trusted as Mr. Norton considers the Old to be in its account of Moses , and yet if he holds that Christ was a special messenger and wrought a miracle , he is received as a believer. * This is the minimum of faith which distinguishes the liberal Christian from the infidel ; this the lowest mark in the sliding scale of their present creed . * We are tempted to ask whether a Mormon or a Mohamedan would not pass the demand of such a test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " The Resurrection has more evidence than any other , ( miracle ) for it is attested by the epistles as well as the gospels , and was one corner stone of the Christian church . " " Still there must have been a foundation of fact for such a superstructure ; ( i.e. the gospel narrative , ) a great spirit to have commenced such a movement as the Christian ; a great doctrine to have accomplished this , the most profound and wondrous revolution in human affairs . " Mr. Parker may ask , and may ask with reason , whether the difference between himself and such a believer is sufficient to justify his exclusion from Christian fellowship . The substance of religion is the same with him and the man accepted as a Christian . They both receive the absolute religion as the true and binding faith . They both receive the immortality of the soul , the moral government and paternal character of God . If there be any difference between them in respect to the thoroughness of their views and the earnestness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker 's favor . But he will be told , You take the authority from these truths ; you deprive them of their sanction as revealed from God and confirmed by miracles . ' To this lie replies , Not so , indeed-not at all ; I do but add to their authority . 1 find their highest sanction in the conscience of every living man . ' You tell one who asks , why he should believe that God revealed these truths by Jesus and to the race some eighteen hundred years ago . I tell him that lie reveals them now , and reveals them to him . You tell him that he confirmed them by miracles that are now centuries old . I tell him that he confirms them by what to me is a miracle this very moment-by a living and present wonder . You tell a man who doubts whether the story of the teacher and the miracle be true , that lie must read Mr. Norton or some other writer on the genuineness of the record ; and if he is not satisfied with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the musty folios that connect the present with the past , and perhaps to read these folios must study Latin , Greek , Syriac and Hebrew ; and perhaps after that must cross the Atlantic and visit the Bodleian Library , the British Museum , the collections at Paris , Berun and the Vatican : whereas I teli // him it is of ' little moment whether the story be true or not , that he is bound to receive the truth because he knows it is true . Now I may be mistaken , but surely if I preach as good a Christianity , and perhaps a better , and as I think with an authority more real , though I may be mistaken , my mistake is not important enough to anthorize my exclusion from your fellowship . Not only so , but there are those among you now , who , though they receive the miracles as facts , deny that they authenticate or give authority to the doctrine . As respects the authority of revelation , they are as unchristian as myself and yet are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book with irreverence and dishonor . ' Not I , indeed , is his answer ; but rather do I treat it with greater respect than some of you . You profess to receive it , and by your forced interpretations you mangle and distort it , and when you pass it off as such a mixture of truth and error , of inspiration and mistake , you make it incredible and contemptible too . To secure its testimony as a witness for the truth you hold , and to yourselves the name of Christian , you give to parts of it the authority which you require , and refer its mistakes and difficulties to the credulity of pious but weak men ; while I save and uphold its consistency by making the whole a delightful relic of the past , legendary and mythical indeed , but still in the highest of all senses true and binding . 5 . The strongest ground on which Mr. Parker may urge upon his brethren his claims to be acknowledged as a liberal Christian , is , that his opinions are the legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a liberal Christian par eminence . He is the logical resultant of the liberal philosophy . He is so far from meriting the cold shoulder , which is the liberal way of excommunicating a man , that he may lawfully claim the highest consideration . To many this seems a very hard saying ,  --  a saying more daring than true , and ingenious rather than well grounded . To liberal Christians it is especially ungrateful , while to some of the stricter sort , who can receive any thing provided it be called orthodox , but who are too polite either to have reasons for their faith or to assert them , it is very rude and uncourteous . Both these tell us that there is no established liberal philsosophy ; that the liberal theology is not a fixed but a variable quantity , which may assume every shade of opinion from the highest style of protest , after the manner of Anus or Arminius , down to the lowest grade of affirmation adopted by Norton or Furness . Its motto is variety of doctrine in unity of spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , for the best of all reasons , that there are no acknowledged liberal principles from which to conclude . Of this fact we are altogether aware . We ourselves assert that there is a great variety of theological opinion in the liberal ranks , and yet is it characterized by a prevailing philosophy* Its principles are held by many with saving clauses and happy inconsistencies . The conscience of man is too true to itself and to God not to suggest these in spite of any system , and hence the liberal preaching and writing may , on many points , approach if it does not come up to the truth . The liberal philosophy too is negative rather than positive . It denies rather than affirms . It protests against this and that view of God ; of the administration of God ; of man in his guilt and wants , and of the Gospel that meets this guilt and these wants ; rather than utters its own decided and strong convictions , and supports them by well placed reasoning . When it is asked its own opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives // a well turned figure , or sounding declamation , or practical homily , and you can not often find it precise , consistent and thorough-going in its deductions . But in arguing , it has principles which it dare not state , and applies a system which it will not affirm ; whether consciously or unconsciously we assert not , but of the fact we are sure . In a previous essay we have described this philosophy at some length , under the several heads of the Nature of Religion , the Government of God , and the Guilt and Wants of Man ; expressly and abundantly declaring , that this philosophy was applied in arguments rather than avowed in a naked and systematic form . We shall not re-state these principles at length ; but we remain certain that they constitute the prima philosophia of the liberal school , and give to it its beauty and its fascination in the eyes of a majority of its adherents . An appeal to those principles , if logical , will carry the field in argument . We assert then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a liberal Christian , by whatever is peculiar in the terms of liberal fellowship ; but that his conclusions are the logical result of whatever is peculiar in the liberal philosophy . Mr. Parker 's conclusions are two . A supernatural revelation is not required by man . There is not evidence sufficient to warrant the belief that the supernatural recorded in the New Testament is historically true . The principles of the liberal school are these ; - Concerning God , that his government is not one of love in its highest form , as animating and enforcing a law of holiness , but of love , as distinguished from law ; - concerning religion , that it is a sentiment like the sense of the beautiful and of the true , and not that sentiment of the divine which becomes religious only when it is based on a character that is true to the holy in God , and then flowers into rich luxuriance , and ripens into precious fruit ;  --  and concerning man , that he is unfortunate and badly developed , rather than guilty and condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than to be renewed by the Spirit of God . The logical road from these principles to Mr. Parker 's conclusions , is short and direct . Take his first position . A supernatural revelation is not required . It is as clear as the sunlight , that the liberal philosophy being true , it is not demanded . All the necessities contemplated by such a natural theism , may be met and satisfied without a supernatural revelation . There is no natural necessity for it . Who shall say that it is not in the power of God , and the resources already furnished by nature , to bring out such a style of men , of moral heroes or providential men , as Carlyle calls them , who shall furnish all that is needed for instruction and impulse ; - who shall reflect a clear image of the divine in the steadied mirror of their own pure hearts , and then make the truth beam from their eye , and speak from their lips , and shine from their beautiful lives ? Whc shall say that such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the demand of their age ? Who shall say , that a succession of such men would not , by successive impulses , lift the race up . ward to any point of religious truth or culture which is demanded ? On the liberal theosophy , and for the purpose for which it admits a supernatural intervention , there is no demand for it in the nature of things . Nor is there a moral necessity for such an intervention . The fault with man is not so much guilt , as an imperfect and ill-developed humanity . there is no strong and prevailing tendency to sin " by nature , " but a divine aspiration after truth // and holiness which gropes for the light ; there is no " not liking to retain God in the knowledge " which requires that Jehovah should step out from the onward course of nature , that he may be heard ; but there is a longing after the divine , which needs but to see what it longs for , and it rushes to embrace the glorious vision . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , God , when revealed to man with miracles of healing , a wondrous life and a most moving death , tries his utmost power as it were in vain ; but man is a poor victim of ill-developed humanity that looks for the light , as " they that watch for the morning . " Here is no moral demand , which may not be met and satisfied , without a supernatural messenger . There is no necessity for such intervention , on the liberal theory , attested by the iListory of man . The history of man unrolls its dark chapters of error , ignorance and imperfection , it is true , and it may be said that the facts of man 's condition require a revelation by miracle to fix the doubtful , make clear the obscure , and to declare , by an authorized messenger , the paternal character of God , and the soul 's immortal life . But history has also her brighter chapters , and her immortal record of such teachers as Socrates and Plato ; and of races too , that seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor and duty . Who shall say that nature who by her unaided energies could produce such men as Socrates and Cicero , might not also without a miracle , produce a Moses and a Jesus , if all for which Moses and Jesus were wanted , and all which they did , was to teach the liberal theism , which Mr. Norton ascribes to them ? or if we admit a miraculous revelation to be desirable , surely it were a useless expenditure of force , to do all that the Bible records of miracle to establish truths so simple and so few . We know that Mr. Norton endeavors to relieve this difficulty by cutting down the Scriptures to very small dimensions , but even his Bible has rather more of the supernatural than seems to us to be called for . To remedy this difficulty he creates another , by lowering the dignity of human nature , even below our view of it ; a difficulty which we leave him to adjust with his own friends of the liberal school , and with the pinin testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Paul the apostle . But it may be said by those who stand upon the history of man , that miracles were needed in a ruder age , to amaze the senses and to wake up the torpor of badly educated men , and thus to force an entrance for truths , which having entered would stand upon their own merits and make good their own defense . Nay rather , says Mr. Parker , history teaches that it is more probable that Moses and Jesus did , by their grandeur of character and force of utterance make an impression so deep and strong , that their wondering disciples denied them an earthly origin , and from the gorgeous hues of their own imagination wove for them a halo of divine splendor . History testifies this of other great men confessedly not supernatural , and why when closely questioned may she not affirm it of these ? The only possible answer to this question , the liberal philosophy can not furnish . She can not say there is a demand for the supernatural , which makes its occcurrence not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not save herself from the logical resolt to which Mr. Parker would conduct her. * Mr. Parker 's second proposition concerns the credibility of the mir * It is the maxim of Horace , " Nec Dens in tersit nisi dignus vindice nodus incident , " and the misfortune of the liberal theism that it does not furnish the " nodus. " // acles that are in fact recorded in the New Testament . Of these he says , that he can not receive such facts on such evidence . ' To this conclusion the liberal philosophy furnishes the premises . It does this , as it fails to furnish the most decisive evidence for such facts , in their being morally required . It also does it by the actual interpretation which it is forced to put upon the Scriptures , even while it seeks to sustain their supernatural origin . Let us follow the liberal theist in the use which he must make of the Bible , with his philosophy of man and of God . He opens the Old Testament . The God who is there revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his government-his command to cruel deeds , his despotic spirit and cruel acts , so described-are all to be received with large abatements , and copious explanations . Accordingly he disposes of the inspiration of parts , or the whole of it , and if that does not answer his end , he cuts very largely in upon the record . Instead of reading it in the true historic spirit , he gives it forced constructions and violent suppositions . All anticipations of a Messiah vanish at the point of his dissecting knife , and are evaporated before the spirit , alike unbelieving and unpoetic , of his dry interpretations . The ritual system of Moses is too barbarous and vulgar to he tolerated hy his delicate sensibilities , and its bloody sacrifices are too savage to have a moral significance . It is well if he does not go beyond the conclusions of Mr. Norton , and deny that the Old Testament furnishes evidence of a miraculous revelation to the Jexvish people . He goes to the New Testament . lie admires the spirit of Christ , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oriental hyperbole . When they are repeated in the words of those who wrote his life and explained his teachings , they are imported from the school of Alexandria , or are the intense expressions of excited minds . The promise of aid to these disciples by their master , after his death , and its striking fulfillment as it shines out from the sacred page , is nothing . The applications by Jesus to himself of the Messianic prophecies , are nothing but accommodations to the prejudices of the mistaken Jews . The significance attached to his death , the assertion of it in grave discussion , the illustration of it by figures as various almost as language can furnish , the connection of it with Jewish sacrifices , by men who , if they were not inspired , ought at least not to write nonsense , the use of it by John and Paul and Peter , in sentences of angelic rapture , that are kindled by the thought of the love that was commended to man in that death , all this is diluted and explained away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an epithet . The government of God too , as its uncompromising claims and the terror of its wrath were uttered by the lips of Christ himself , and declared again and again by his apostles ; the daring of human guilt as it is measured by its trifling with the claims of the Eternal ; the peculiar guilt of rejecting the salvation that was wrought by the dying Son of God ; the terror of the condemnation which shall come of thus dealing with his offered mercy ; - all this is distilled by the chemistry of liberal hermeneutics to a delightful otto of roses , as if Christianity were a moral perfumery , to give the last finish to modern culture . Instead of salvation to be received or rejected , it commends to us the mild and tolerant spirit of Christianity . Instead of God waiting to be gracious , it gives us God as such a Father , that his children must be spoiled by his weakness . Instead of exhorting to repentance , it enjoins upon men to be mild and charitable . Having passed the Scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritless caput mortuum , the liberal expounder brings them to Mr. Parker as a trustworthy record of a supernatural revelation . Having loaded them down with these violent explanations , he offers them as the rationalized version of the miraculous . Mr. Parker can not receive them . Surely , says he , if God were to give man a record of this rcvelation , he would not leave it in such a form . He would not mingle in it truth so important with error so mischievous , nor majesty so high with weakness so puerile , nor confident assertion of truth in the name of God , with so much Jewish error and prejudice uttered in the nan*e of the same God , nor true history with such credulous exaggeration . Rather let me give it the highest honor as the noblest work of man , which of course shall not be free from human weakness , than call it the gift of God ; and then be forced to interpret it with a violence , which , if used upon a human author , would call up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , has the better of the argument . Of course we do not here ask whether these liberal interpretations are or are not justified on critical grounds . We say only , if they are , they lead to Mr. Parker 's conclusions . We rest therefore in the opinion that Mr. Parker is the logical result of whatever is peculiar in the liberal philosophy , and therefore he may reasonably ask to be recognized as a liberal Christian . Against this conclusion it is urged , that Mr. Parker is of the German school in philosophy and interpretation , and that his system is a hasty compound of their pantheism and rationalism combined . Doubtless Mr. Parker is a German scholar . Doubtless he is familiar with the varieties of its many-sided theology , and employs the barbarous technics of its fantastic philosophy . But the human mind is not one thing in July , Germany and another in America . Nor is German philosophy a thing so utterly and hopelessly foreign , as in no respect to find its likeness in schools that have the utmost horror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be different , while the spirit and principles are the same . The one may follow Locke and Paley , the other Leibnitz and Kant , and yet both may deny to God his rights as a moral and personal sovereign , and to man his serious accountability and his actual guilt . The pantheism of Hegel and the sensualism of Hobbes , agree in denying the theism that is true to the nature of things and the conscience of man . The German school and the Priestleian , have the same relations to a supernatural revelation made to man as a sinner , and are equally averse to the theism of Paul and of Shakspeare . In all its bearings upon the question of such a revelation , Mr. Parker 's philosophy is the same with that of the liberal school ; and to call it German in its origin and to show that it is German in some of its principles , does not relieve the difficulty . The same law holds good , both of the liberal school of interpretation and of the German . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sober judgment , more restraint from public sentiment , and less of the university isolation and independence , and of the madness that cometh from such learning , and in consequence less logic and consistency in following principles to their conclusions . It would not be difficult to show that Mr. Norton and Mr. Furness are less consistent than Mr. Parker , though they are in some points nearer the truth . Nor would it be difficult to show that German rationalism was the same in its beginnings with the rationalism of Boston , and that the tendency of both is swift and headlong by the force of logical consecutiveness to Theodore Parker and the Boston Association . // the termini attained by Strauss and Parker. * It is also said , that Mr. Parker is the farthest possible from being a close and consistent thinker , that he is rather an enormous reader , a very " helluo librorum " - that he recklessly jumps at conclusions in his youth , and publishes them in his haste , which , if he would revise in silence and with time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has read too much we do not doubt . That his conclusions are strange , fantastic and ill-sustained , we have testified abundantly . We wonder that he does not start back from them , and re-examine his premises ; or even choose to be more believing at the expense of being inconsistent . But his premises , and not the haste and frankness of the man , are the causes of the frightful conclusion . Would that the light which the result casts backward upon its causes , might not shine in vain . We may be told , that all this is none of our business ; that a communion which never intermeddles with " the sects " might be let alone with a better grace . Did we argue this question in a sectarian way , this charge might lie , on that ground , * The Christian Examiner of March , says upon this point , " atroce vu/tu . " He who can not see an essential difference between the writings of Mr. Norton , Dr. Paifrey or Mr. Furness , where the facts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually asserted , and the writings of Mr. Parker , where they are as continually denied , must he incapable of discerning or measuring the relations of ideas ; and he who will not see the difference because it suits his purpose to overlook it , saves his intelligence at the expense of his honesty . " pp. 252 , 3 . We see and assert a difference , hut it is , that the premises of both being admitted , the difference is in Mr. Parker 's favor as respects the argument . If any one doubts this , let him study the introduction to Strauss 's Life of Christ , and see how he conducts such writers as Norton , Furness and Palfrey triumphantly on to his own conclusions . against us . As to the fact alledged , we confess ourselves ignorant , that the liberal community never contrast themselves with others , to their own advantage , or that they do it less offensively or less contemptuously than others do the same thing for themselves . So too it may be said that the attempt to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to make sectarian capital ,  --  that he is no more to be charged upon the Unitarian body because he happens to be among them , than Strauss &amp; Co. upon the German orthodox church , because they appeared in that body. * It is enough for us to say , that this has never been our argument ,  --  and that we have expressly and forcibly disclaimed and rejected it , and to insinuate that we have used it , is to appeal to sectarian feeling with an emphasis . Our argument is , that the principles , which , in the German church , have ended in Strauss , have in the Amen- * When our liheral friends talk in this fashion , we are tempted to refer them to a poem by Goethe , translated under the title of " the Magician 's Apprentice .

As far as we have to do with him , we desire in a friendly spirit , to lead him to better conclusions , by giving him better premises . As far as we have to do with the liberal body who hold the same premises , but shrink from the conclusions to which he carries them , we desire to test the premises by their results to Mr. Parker and his associates of the liberal school , and of them we might say much that is favorable and not do full justice to our convictions and feelings .
