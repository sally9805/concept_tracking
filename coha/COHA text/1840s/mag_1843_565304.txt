txt THE exalted reputation for talents which the late Professor Fisher left behind him , has conspired with the affecting circumstances of his death , to throw a romantic but melancholy interest around his memory . More than twenty years have now passed , since Yale College and the surround . ing community , were suddenly involved in the deepest gloom at the tidings , that one respected and beloved in no ordinary degree , who had just exchanged with them the parting salutation , and embarked for the Old World under the most flattering auspices , had suffered a terrible shipwreck and was buried beneath the waves ! A new generation has sprung up , who have listened with interest to the tale of sorrow , that has mingled with enthusiastic expressions of admiration for his talents and virtues from his former associates and pupils ; and the wish has often been repeated , that a full biography of him might be given to the public . Not being in possession of his writings , we have not the means of making out a complete analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief but remarkable life ; but we propose only to recite a few partic ulars respecting him , gleaned from the excellent " Eulogy " of Professor Kingsley pronounced on the occasion of his death , and from several obituary notices published at the same period . This we do by way of introductioii to the " Remlnlscences , " - the title of an unpublished manuscript now before us , written by an intimate friend and classmate of Professor Fisher , soon after his decease . ALEXANDER METcALF FISHER was born at Franklin , Massachusetts , in the year 1794 . His parents were muth respected members of the pastoral charge of the late celebrated Dr. Emmons . He early exhibited tokens of a superior mind and an aptitude for learning , which determined his parents to give him a liberal education ; and , accordingly , he entered Yale College , in the autumn of 1809 . Though but fifteen years of age , and diminutive in person , yet the superiority of his mind , and his love of study , were soon apparent , and he speedily acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in his class . He took his baccalaureate degree in 1813 , and returned to his father 's house . // Without any definite plan of life before him , but desirous of examining for himself the grounds of the Christian faith , in which he had been educated , he placed himself , the following year , under the instruction of his profound and venerable pastor . He wrote a series of dissertations on points of theology proposed to him by the Doctor ; often , with his usual independence , controverting some of the peculiar and favorite opinions of that distinguished divine , who expressed , at times , as we were informed by Professor Fisher himself , much uneasiness , not to say displeasure , at having his peculiar doctrines canvassed with so much freedom by a youth of nineteen . It is not unlikely that this was the reason for breaking off their connexion ; for the next year Mr. Fisher repaired to Andover , and entered the Theological Seminary . Here he devoted himself to the regular studies of the Institution with his accustomed diligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His constitution had received a severe shock , from which it did not recover for several years afterwards . In 1815 he was appointed tutor in Yale College , and entered upon the duties of the office at the opening of the fall term . At this time , his health was very poor , his person much emaciated , and his spirits deeply depressed . Regular employment so congenial to his taste , gradually repaired his strength and revived his spirits ; and he selected the most difficult studies , for , as Delambre observes , difficulties constitute the natural aliment of genius . The solution of various mathematical problems proposed by Dr. Adrain in a magazine published in the city of New York , an able review of Day 's Algebra in a public journal , and a profound Essay on Musical Temperament , written during his tutorship , and published in the first volume of the Amer ican Journal of Science , * brought him rapidly into notice among scientific men ; and , in the year 1817 , when on the decease of the lamented President Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural philosophy , was elevated to the presidency , Mr. Fisher was elected adjunct professor in that department . From this period , his plans of study were laid out on the broadest scale ; his health improved ; he ascended the heights of science with almost unexampled rapidity ; and he fulfilled all the duties of an instructor and officer of the college with the greatest ability and faithfulness . " In the time which elapsed , " says Prof. Kingsley , " from his election to his new office to his departure for Europe , he had examined and digested the writings of the principal philosophers of Britain , tracing every discovery , theory , and illustration to its source ; and had read , with the same attention , many of the most valuable publications of the mathematicians and philosophers of France . He had , in the same time , prepared a full course of lectures in natural philosophy , both theoretical and experimental , which for copiousness , clearness , and exact ndaptation to the purposes of instruction , equaled the highest expectations of his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he resolved on an excursion to Europe , not so much for the sake of making new acquisitions in science ,  --  for the knowledge of European philosophers is found in their books ,  --  as to visit the places of public instruction , and examine by actual inspection the modes of communicating knowledge in foreign universities ; to form an acquaintance with men who were * This constitutes the first article in that Journal , which has now reached nearly fifty volumes and contributed greatly to the advancement of American science . // distinguished in his own departmont ; and to obtain such information as might enable him more fully to aid in raising the scientific character of his country , and in promoting the usefulness and prosperity of the college , to the interests of which he was entirely devoted . Every preparation was made which was thought necessary to secure the attainmont of his object ; and , after the fullest inquiries , and taking the host advico , he embarked at New York for Livorpool , in the Albion packot , whore , to use his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing seomed to promise a quick , safe , and agreeable passage . ' " Among the various melancholy wrecks of packet-ships to England that have from time to time spread consternation and grief over both countries , soldom has one occasioned wider and deepor sorrow than the loss of the packet-ship Albion . On the 1st of April , 1822 , nearly sixty passengers appoarod on the dock of this elegant ship , all animated with the prospect of a happy voyage , and left the harbor of New York , reciprocating with their friends the joyous shouts customary on such occasions . On the 22d of the same month , they all , with the exception of nine persons , including but one passenger , met a watery grave on the coast of Ireland , near Kinsale . Their passage had been pleasant until the 2 1st , when the ship encountered and weathered a severe gale ; but the brave calitain and tempest-boaten crow , choorod all on board with the hope that in loss than two days they should roach their destined port . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea which knocked her on her boams-onds , swept her docks , and carried hor mainmast by the board . " The ship became unm nageable , and the unhappy inmates drifted along at the mercy of the waves , agonizing or reviving under alternations of fear and hope , until twelve o'clock at night , when the light of " Old Head " came in sight , and warned them that they were rapidly drifting ashore , on a rocky and most dangorous coast . About four o'clock , as the day dawned , the commandor , Captain Williams , *io had made every effort to encourage the men and preserve the ship , communicated the dreadful certainty that no efforts could possibly save her , and in about five minutes she struck  --  the breakers dashed furiously over her-she rapidly filled , and shortly aftor went to pieces , within a fow rods of the land . The shore was rocky and precipitous , rising to the height of one hundred and fifty feet , and those who in great numbers were colloeted on the brow , were provented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day unveiled the distressing and hopeless spectacle of the numerous ship 's company clinging in agony to tho shrouds and broken parts of the ship , and plunging at short intorvals into the raging abyss . The surviving passenger roports that he last saw our friend in the cabin whoa it was fast filling with water-that he looked deeply anxious , but was obsorving the barometer , probably with the view of watching any indications it might afford of abating violonce in the tempest . It is believed , therefore , that he met his fate below , being ( lrOxvnod by the suddon influx of waters . " If , " says Prof. Kingsley , " we shrink from approaching the final scene , and chock our imaginations , which would paint in too vivid colors tho last sufferings of our departed friend , what must have been the horror , the agony which rent his bosom , in actual view of a death so suddon , so unexpocted , so awful ! But horo , lot us not indulge too far our gloomy surmises . Others may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he no doubt was calm and // collected . Others frantic with grief , and mad with alarm and terror , amidst the rage of contending elements , may have abandoned themselves to despair ; but he no doubt was undismayed , and knew where to place his confidence . We may indeed suppose that he thought of his parents and b* home , of the friends he had left behind , and the Institution so much the object of his affection ; that the idea of the sudden extinction of his earthly prospects , and the loss of whatever his heart held dear , now rushed upon his recollection , and filled him with unutterable anguish ; yet those who best knew him will most easily believe that the last feeling of his heart , as the billows closed around him , that his last aspiration as he sunk into the opening gulf was , Father , not my will , but thine , be done . ' The estimate formed of the character of Professor Fisher in Prof. Kingsley 's eulogy , and in the obituary notices of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is substantially the same . The " Reminiscences , " which follow , were addressed to a particular friend of Prof. Fisher by a classmate then residing at a distance , whose long and intimate connexion with the deceased , had suggested to him many recollections of incidents illustrative of his genius and character . These were communicated to his surviving friends , without any view to publication but familiar and personal incidents of this kind , intended only for the eye of friendship , often make us better acquainted with the character to which they relate , than the most labored panegyric . The letter proceeds as follows . My dear Sir-I readily comply with your request " to furnish some reminiscences of our dear departed * See particularly Am . Journ . Science , V , 367 ; Christian Spectator , IV , 389 , 432. friend , Professor Fisher ; " for although I can not help keeping in mind his mournful fate whenever I think of him , still a recurrence to our former intimacy affords recollections which I love to cherish . Two circumstances conspired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a certain interesting period of his life , than was probably known to any other individual . One was my connexion with him as one of the tutors of the same class for two years , which unavoidably brought me into close contact with him , and which relation , I may add , produced a high degree of intimacy and confidence between us . Another was , that during the same period , owing to his excessive modesty , he afforded to very few persons an opportunity of knowing any thing respecting his habits and feelings . You remember , sir , that we were classmates in college ; but this relation produced only a common acquaintance , while that of colleague tutors occasioned the most unreserved confidence , which , since our separation four years ago , has been maint*ined by a frequent correspondence . To the public , Professor Kingsley has already communicated enough to justify the fame of our friend , perhaps enough to satisfy their curiosity ; but to your own private circle , where be was admired so much and loved so well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too minute . The intellectual superiority of Mr. Fisher began to display itself at a very early period of his college life . I well remember the first time I ever observed it ,  --  it was in the p*sing of a Greek verb . The same emphatic manner , the same precision and accuracy that were afterwards so characteristic of him , were all conspicuous in his first recitation , and led me to mark him as a candidate for eminence . I retain an equally distinct remembrance of // his personal appearance at that time . He was a little black-eyed boy of fifteen , rather stooping in his posture , and of a figure diminutive even for his years . His features contemplated singly were rather ordinary , but taken together , they certainly bore no common impress , but were remarkable for that same thoughtful expression which was so much observed in his later years . Exalted as was the opinion which his classmates formcd of him during his first year , yet the extent of his capacity was not fully understood until the latter part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mathematical course . It astonished us all to see with what ease be traveled through conic sections , and spherical geometry and trigonometry ; how completely he supplied defective demonstrations in the text-book , and how he occasionally detected fallacies in the author , and demonstrated the incorrectness of his conclusions. * I may add that to most of his classmates it seemed almost sublime , to see one of an age but a single remove from childhood , of a figure 50 disproportioned to the magnitude of his subject , and of a mould so fiail and delicate , march with such ease and steadiness over those heights which stood in this part of our path , where some of us either worked our way with desperate toil , or halted at the base in dismay . It was natural for the class to infer that recitations , which were so completely mastered must have been prepared with uncommon labor ; and this inference was the more likely to be made , on account of his known habits of intense and assiduous application ; but I was assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of any extraordinary exertion ; that in fact he had got over them so long before the others came up , that he gained no * The class read Webber 's Mathematics . small part of the time for other pursuits . In the winter of Junior year , the class calculated a lunar eclipse . To accommodate the lessons to the slow pace at which the majority were forced to advance , one or two of the elements were given out for a recitation , so that a week elapsed before the calculation and projection of the eclipse were completed . The design of conducting the class through the calculation of the eclipse , was announced and the first lesson given out on Saturday noon : I was assured by a classmate that before sunset of the same day , Fisher had completed the calculation . The celerity with which he performed numerical calculations , is to be ascribed partly to the small size of his characters , and the compactness of his work , a remark which applies equally to his handwriting . His reasons for adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digested at a very early period ; the manner was in neither case the result of accident ; every thing indeed of his was done by rule . In accordance with a suggestion of Dr. Beattie , his practice was , to carry such letters as go above or below the line cxactly to the middle of the space , in which case the long letters of two contiguous lines would never interfere with each other . Upon considerations equally minute , but rational and useful , were founded all the peculiarities of his handxvriting ; and to these were ow/lag the uncommon neatness , compactness , and legibility , which distinguished it . We seldom see any one put so much on a page as he did , and still his hand is remarkably legible . I never knew ny one who could commit to writing so much matter in the same time , although it is not uncommon to see those who write with greater apparent velocity . This fu*nishes an example of the advantages he derived from reflecting on the most minute circumstan // ces that affected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One who became acquainted with the extent and variety of Mr. Fisher 's information , not only in the abstruse sciences but also on all those topics which enter into the conversation of the learned and polite , would be apt to infer that his reading must have been immense . But the fact was that it was confined to a comparatively small number of books . He thought so much of the different estimate to be attached to different authors , and esteemed it so much better to read one able work well than many works superficially , that he was never ashamed to say of many a common-place production , " I never read it ; " and yet , if the conversation happened to turn on that work , his companions would be surprised to find that he knew so much of it . But the attention he gave to o ? ie able writer , frequently made him acquainted , in no small degree , with the contents of other books to which that writer referred ; and hence he embraced and followed the maxim , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be sought by the study of a few out of all the vast multitude of authors . " But he did not consider that " looking at " a book , or " looking over " it , was reading it . With him reading a book was to study it ; to become thoroughly acquainted with all it contains ; to pause over its striking passages ; to reflect on its sentiments ; to comment upon it in written notes ; and to examine many collateral works , especially reference books . To read Horace , was to unlock the great storehouse of all antiquity , of which Horace is the key . To read Pope 's Satires , ( of which he was very fond , ) was to investigate the spirit and manners of the age in which they were written . But the miscellany which commanded much of Mr. Fisher 's attention , in the earlier part of his college life , was that of Swift , especially his prose works . The unaffected character of his style and his wit , hit the taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that so far as his style was formed on any model , it was formed on the writings of Swift . He was not indeed averse to a style more ornamented than his own , when it suited the character of the subject , and of the writer ; but he believed that in cases where others might embellish with propriety and effect , he could not do it without seeming affectation . The idea that nothing but the greatest plainness and simplicity of manner was suited to him , he carried so far , that I do not recollect that in the whole course of his speaking in public while a student , he could ever be brought to make more than one gesture . Many other incidents of his early history might be recited , evincive of strong peculiarities of character , indicative however , for the most part , of originality of thought , delicacy of taste , and determination of purpose ; but it was not until the autumn of 1815 , when we entered upon our duties as tutors of the same class , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As all the more finished productions , whether of nature or of art , exhibit new perfections as we inspect them more closely , so I found that , exalted as were my ideas of the capacity of my colleague , they fell far short of the reality . I shall never forget the impressions made by my first interview with him , after entering upon this new employment . His mind seemed too gigantic for its frail tenement . He was just recovering from an alarming indisposition , the effects of which were still visible in his altered features and emaciated frame . He was also greatly depressed in mind , and augured very unfavorably of his success in the station upon which he // had entered . His best friends , indeed , had their apprehensions respecting his power to maintain " the post of dignity . " I need not say how completely he afterwards dissipated these apprehensions . The new situation to which he felt himself unequal , elicited appropriate talents ; or I am inclined to attribute his success here , as in every other enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to bear on every emergency . Another distressing apprehension that attended him at this time was , the fear of permanent delirium . This I regarded , at first , as the offspring of his infirm state of health , and was disposed to treat it lightly , until I learned that a few months before , his nervous system had become exceedingly disordered . In alluding to this state of mind , he observed , that he bad often endeavored and longed to recover and apply to some useful purpose , a portion of that spirit which then enabled him so rapidly to invent and so easily to execute his airy schemes . This imperfect state of health , accompanied by constant depression of spirits , continued with little abatement through the whole period of his tutorship ; yet invincibly attached to study , he seemed incapable of any remission ; but beset as he was by those distressing sensations which accompany a chronic debility of the stomach , and haunted at night by feverish dreams , he was still , during the whole time , devouring with incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the profoundest depths of the science of music . So prevalent were the foregoing disorders during the tii*e that he was writing his essay on Musical Temperament , that his rest became exceedingly broken . I remember one instance in particular . It was the night but one after our revered and beloved President Dwight died , and before his remains were committed to the tomb . The sorrowful emotions awakened by that event , conspiring with an imagination already enfeebled and disturbed , either banished sleep entirely from his pillow , or agitated his slumbers with the most frightful images . I was in his room late in The evening in company with a friend . Mr. F. hinted at his sufferings the preceding night , and intimated a desire that one of us should stay and keep him company . We were both well acquainted with his habitual reserve on subjects of this kind , and knew that such a request could be elicited only by very uncommon sufferings . Accordingly it was at once agreed that one of us should remain . Mr. Fisher afterwards incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding night . They were truly awful , such as indicated a highly excited state of the nervous system , bordering on derangement . Yet it was during this very time that he prepared that essay on Musical Temperament which has been pronounced by the most competent judges so able and profound . This was during the winter vacation of 1817 . The whole piece was written in less than two weeks , although the calculations , especially those from which the tables were constructed , were extremely laborious . My impression is that he told me that in making the tables alone , he filled his slate with fi*ures more than a hundred times , and he always carried on such computations with great compactness . I can not certainly say to what extent these calculations were prepared beforehand ; but I witnessed the progress of the composition of the article from day to day , and well recollect that it was written and prepared for the Connecticut Academy ( to which body it was addressed ) within the period of two weeks . I always considered Mr. F. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as among the most // remarkable qualities he possessed . They began to be developed at an early age , and he was able to read very difficult pieces during his first year in college . His vocal powers however were not at all extraordinary , and it is therefore perhaps the more remarkable that he should have been so very fond of the science of music , as to have devoted all his powers to the investigation of its principles . It was a favorite recreation with him silently to peruse the pieces of the greatest masters , as Handel and Haydn , carrying on all parts at a time with a full comprehension , and ( as he assured me ) with a perfect enjoyment of the harmony . He passed many a leisure hour in this mental performance of Handel 's grand Hallelujah Chorus . This piece in its greatest extent , the Lock Hospital collection , and the Harmonia Sacra , furnished his favorite amusement . As yet he had hardly called in the aid of instruments . He however at length procured an organ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the principles of musical harmony was so familiar , that he was at once able to perform pieces of moderate difficulty in all parts . He did not finally attain to an excellence in performing which was anticipated from so promising a beginning , probably because he would not devote the time to it which is indispensable to excellence . The love of simplicity which characterized his literary taste , was also conspicuous both in his selection of pieces , and in his performance on the organ . He probably never brought himself to attempt a single flourish . I have heard accomplished masters speak with high admiration , both of his classical taste in music , and of his profound acquaintance with its scientific principles . The originality of his taste is conspicuous in this , that as soon as he fell in with the compositions of celebrated European masters , he could no longer endure the jingling homespun style of church music then generally prevalent in our country towns , although this was the style to which he had always been accustomed from his infancy . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own composition . Some few of them I heard him perform , but do not know whether he bestowed sufficient attention upon any piece , to render it a fair specimen of his talents for musical composition . Of Professor Fisher 's great mathematical powers , it would be easy for me to recall numerous illustrations . The following incident may serve as an example . One evening after tea we set out for a walk , and on our way stopped a moment at a bookseller 's . Happening to take up a number of the New York Monthly Magazine , I observed several mathematical questions which were understood to be proposed by Doctor Adrain . One of them , as being peculiarly difficult , was offered as a prize question , the premium being the current volume of the magazine . I pointed it out to Mr. Fisher . He read it over hastily , and immediately afterwards we resumed our walk . Reaching that delightful lawn , the New Haven Green , we took a few turns over it , conversing on some common-place topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to our rooms . Mr. Fisher apologized for a temporary absence of mind by saying , " Excuse me , I was thinking of that problem , " but added shortly after , " I 've got it . " I accompanied him to his room , but observing him to be making some preparation to proceed with the problem , I retired . Next morning he showed me the solution completed , which I think he had performed in three different ways . The one which had occurred to him in our walk , was that which pleased him most , and it was the one which he sent to the Monthly Magazine , // with the signature of " X. " It was inserted in the next number of the Magazine as the solution of " X of New Haven , " the latter part being probably derived from the postmark . It was particularly commended for its elegance , and among a number of competitors , the prize was awarded to " X of New Haven . " Happening to be at the bookstore when the succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform Mr. F. of his success , which I did by inquiring " if he could lend me one of the numbers of the Monthly Magazine . " He readily understood me , as he intimated by a significant smile which he labored in vain to conceal ; but he blushed deeply for having betrayed his consciousness of success . Speaking of Doctor Adrain reminds me of the desire Mr. Fisher expressed , at an early period of his mathematical studies , of becoming acquainted with that gentleman , and the great pleasure he derived from a personal interview . The same feelings led him to seek the acquaintance of Dr. Bowditch ; and the delight which he experienced in the conversation of that great man , was an earnest of the happiness he would have felt , had he been permitted to enjoy a familiar intercourse with the mathematicians and philosophers of France and Britain . Although he was by nature diffident in manners , he was at all times fully master of his intellectual powers , and his mind would run clear when his knees trembled . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated an entrance into a mixed company with dread . The extent to which mathematicians have pushed their inquiries , and the profoundness of their views , may in some degree be estimated by the fact , that one who could solve very difficult problems with almost intuitive readiness , declared that he had frequently paused over mathematical writers of the higher order , in astonishment at the human intellect . The great distinction to which Professor Fisher attained as a mathematician , I am not disposed to ascribe to any peculiarity in the structure of his intellect , but merely to the application of a great mind to a great subject , where its powers could have complete scope . In any other subject , where strength and penetration of mind were peculiarly requisite , his success would have been , and indeed was , proportionally great . I do not rank him so much among men of genius , where some peculiar power is in great excess above the rest , and where , as is sometimes the case , an extraordinary talent for music , or painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even imbecility of intellect ; but I place him rather among the men of gigantic minds , where all the parts are great , but all still well balanced , and in harmonious proportion . These are the men of sound judgment , of common sense , who look at subjects in all their parts and relations ; they are the Galileos , the Bacons , the Newtons , the Edwardses , the Washingtons ,  --  and not the Paracelsuses , the Keplers , the Fieldings , the Vol. taires . Genius often suddenly reaches its acme ; but powers of mind like those of Professor Fisher , although probably all developed at the age of twenty eight , would never during his life , had he lived many years longer , have ceased to move onward with constantly accelerated velocity . He was no less a metaphysician than a mathematician , and nothing could exceed the terseness of his translations in the learned languages , especially of a writer so dense as Tacitus . Though a man of intellect rather than of imagination , yet he was a most acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and novelists ; and while an undergraduate , he astonished // his classmates , and elicited an unusual compliment from President Dwight , for a disputation which he read on the subject of " banks . " One would hardly expect to find that the same mind which could devise new methods of finding the orbits of comets , would also be critical in punctuation , in the planting of shrubbery , in the structure of a court-yard , or even in apparel and equipage . But Professor Fisher 's love of symmetry and propriety , in matters of taste , and of correctness in the scholar , made him a keen observer of life and manners , as well as a rare proficient in literary criticism . This habit of minute observation , I had great opportunities of noticing during our frequent walks about the city of New Haven . His criticisms upon the style of different buildings , ( for architecture was his favorite among the arts , ) upon the arrangement of the streets , trees , fences , and gardens , as well as upon a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a market-town , were truly original and instructive ; and I recur to those seasons , which seemed only the ramblings of an idle hour , as some of the most agreeable and profitable of my life . I have rarely if ever met with any one who could assign so satisfactory a reason for his opinions on common-place subjects , which most people take up without supposing them to be worth a reason . These attributes of our friend , the less as well as the greater , fitted him to be an accomplished critic . The various talents which have been enumerated ; his clearness and comprehensiveness ; his keenness of observation , extending to the minutest particulars ; his delicate vein of satire , ( a talent probably known to but few ; ) the extent of his information , the universality of his taste , and the soundness of his judgment ; - these are qualities which , combined as they were in such ample measure and due proportion , fitted him to wield , with powerful sway , the sceptre of criticism . Nature evidently intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His elocution was forcible and distinct , and his emphasis was laid with exact discrimination , but , invincibly opposed as he was to the cultivation of the graces of oratory , ( because they did not seem to him to be uivea him by nature , ) he generally , in public speaking , appeared far below himself . Of this disadvantage he was conscious to excess ; and the apprehension that the want of rhetorical powers would be the means of burying his other talents in obscurity , contributed not a little to enhance those gloomy forebodings in which he was inclined to indulge , previous to his appointment to the mathematical chair . Knowing well the unfavorable anticipations which he had formed of his success in the world , I hastened , on learning his appointment , to announce to him the pleasing intelligence . It was on the occasion of the inauguration of President Day . Mr. Fisher , through indisposition , was prevented from attending the public exercises in the morning , and did not expect to come out in the afternoon . I found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , told him the news in a manner somewhat ambiguous . He therefore would not credit the intelligence until after repeated assurances , but believed me in jest . But the time thus gained to set his guard was well employed ; he betrayed scarce any emotion , but the effect on his spirits was obvious , for he soon left his bed and joined the procession to witness the ceremonies of the afternoon . By subsequent conversations I learned that the appointment fulfilled his utmost wishes . It came also at a very favorable time , although quite unexpected . His gloomy forebodings of sinking into insignificance were at once dissipated ; and how could the prospect of // a field so well suited to his talents and his inclination , where he was conscious of being able to sustain his part with such distinguished ad. vantage , fail to animate his hopes and awaken his joy and gratitude ! It was shortly after , in a morning walk , that he disclosed to me his glad emotions , and expressed his thankfulness to that kind Providence which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself moving with any respectability , in a sphere indeed consonant to his warmest wishes , and to the evident designs of nature itself . Guarded as he habitually was , lest any one should discover his emotions and impute them to weakness , it is pro . hable that very few of his friends were aware how much this appointrnent contributed to raise him from a dejected , desponding state , and to arouse his slumbering energies . From this moment , he began to digest those great plans of personal improvement and extensive usefulness , which he pursued with such steadiness and alacrity during the remainder of his short but distinguished career . Few men ever sacrificed so much of feeling and inclination , in order to do what reason and duty decided ought to be done . So determined was he to keep reason at the helm , when duty came in conflict with inclination , that some have not given him credit for half the sensibility he actually possessed . In aiming steadily at the greatest possible good , he resisted every temptation which might allure him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from that self-discipline , were objects of his constant and unremitted effort . A singular instance occurs to me of his determination to act according to the dictates of reason in opposition to feeling . He had for some time been afflicted with a severe tooth-ache , and , although the tooth was carious , he felt the usual reluctance to having it extracted . To overcome this feeling , he adopted the following method . He took his pen and set down the arguments pro and con in numerical order ; and finding those in the affirmative preponderate so much , he rose from the table , resorted to a dentist , and submitted to the operation . Finding it less painful than he had apprehended , and being now able to contemplate the instruments with pleasure for the relief they had afforded , although he had just before thought of them with great abhorrence , he inferred that the most favorable opportunity for undergoing this operation , is immediately after having a tooth extracted ; and , in the spirit of true philosophy , he brought his theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth , which was occasionally troublesome , extracted on the spot . I have hinted that Mr. Fisher had much more sensibility than many supposed him to have . Although I do not suppose that he possessed this attribute in a very high degree , it may still be affirmed that his feelings were delicate and acute . I could hardly recollect an instance of any mistake that he made in all his recitations when a student ; hut inconsiderable as his inaccuracies appeared to others , he told me afterwards that he had been occasionally so mortified by a mistake , that it was hardly out of his mind for several succeeding days , and he could not meet his instructor hut with shame and confusion . This may look to some like inordinate ambition , and perhaps it really implies too much of that feeling ; but other obvious reasons can be assigned for the emotions which he experienced from causes so trifling . He had to maintain the character of the first scholar in his class , a place awarded to him by the suifrages of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccuracy . He felt , therefore , that a mistake degraded him both from the rank // which had been assigned him , and from that high standing which he contemplated as the only one worthy of his aim . The same elevated standard was afterwards kept continually in view , when an instructor ; and he used to say that nothing was worthy of the confidence of the pupil but the greatest possible accuracy on the part of the teacher , and that mistakes on his part sullied his character like lapses from virtue . It is probable indeed that he was not indifferent to fame ; but his ambition was of a higher order than that which would attach any great importance to incidents like the foregoing . That he was not eager for popularity , in the sense in which it is usually received in college , is obvious from the independence with which he maintained his share of the discipline , and the spirit with which he braved censure and obloquy whenever they were to be met in the faithful discharge of his duty . If like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vain , no one surely ever subdued it more completely ; no one ever had a stronger perception of the weakness it implies , or guarded himself more effectually against betraying it . In the unreserved confidence which subsisted between us for several years , I do not remember a single* instance , even in the most private communications , when that infirmity was fairly developed . So aware was he of the liability of distinguished men to exhibit vanity , or at least to be suspected of it , that his feelings were wounded by any allusion to his superiority , because it seemed to imply that he had the weakness to be pleased with flattery . On subjects of this kind his delicacy was remarkable , and even , as I thought , excessive ; for it was hardly safe to carry the confidence of friendship so far as to allude to any of the honors he had acquired . This was one reason why he avoided rather than courted those topics of conversation which afforded him peculiar opportunities for display . He did not like to converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when any one seemed to introduce such topics on his account , because it perhaps implied either that he would be fond of such an opportunity to exhibit himself , or ( what he disliked as much ) it indicated an opinion that he was unable to converse on other subjects . In his aversion to open praise , while he was so deeply mortified at disgrace and so studious to acquire solid reputation , he seems to have resembled the late Mr. Cayendish , a distinguished British philosopher , who is said to have been so studious of accuracy , that hardly an error was ever detected in all he wrote , and still so averse to flattery as to have retired in confusion from a meeting of the Philosophical Society , because in an introduction to a learned foreigner , his merits were mentioned with more freedom than suited his modesty . The character of Mr. Fisher as a man of honor may be judged of by the following incident . It was accidentally known that while a student , he had been admitted into very close confidence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllable on account of a chronic weakness of the eyes . Several years afterwards , one of Mr. Fisher 's companions incidentally alluded to the privations of that gentleman , and intimated to Mr. F. his knowledge of the fact , that he supplied the deficiency . He declined any conversation on the subject , but courteously drew off his friend to another topic . A subsequent conversation enabled me to see the principle by which he was governed , which was this : In order to keep a secret faithfully , we must not let it be known that we possess it . Professor Fisher , in accordance with both his nature and habit , was very cautious in forming his reli. // gious opinions . From some prevailing tenets of his fathers , he was inclined to dissent ; on others his belief was suspended ; but he never settled , so far asl know , in any belief which President Dwight would have considered essentially erroneous . In many instances he admitted the truth of a doctrine , but rejected some of the arguments by which it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation ; and I can not help thinking , that the graces of religion had taken deep root in the heart of one so constant in the performance of its outward and sacred duties , and so exemplary in the practice of its pure virtues . I have heard him mention the recurrence to his mind of those subjects on which he had been intensely engaged during the week , as severe temptations which he experienced on the Sabbath ; but I have been acquainted with few scholars who devoted themselves so exclusively on that day to its sacred employments . For his daily reading in the Scriptures , his common rule was two chapters . In perusing the evangelists , it was his favorite method to carry on together the different accounts of the same transaction by the aid of Newcomb 's Harmony . I have heard him more than once express the great pleasure and satisfaction which he derived from that work . We read of poets who had reached their full maturity at the age to which our friend had attained , and were never able to surpass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of Professor Fisher were not of this class . Brilliancy is an attribute which may speedily acquire its utmost limits ; but capacity and strength admit of indefinite enlargement . Mr. Fisher possessed , in an unusual degree , the power and the habit of application , which were necessary to augment that capacity and strength beyond any limits which we can assign . I looked with the most sanguine expectations to a period when they would reach a consummation equaled by few of his contemporaries . What peculiar reason , therefore , have we to deplore his untimely fate ! Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus Tam can capitis ? Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor Urget ? cui Pudor et Justitim soror Incorrupta Fides , nudaque Veritas , Quando ullum invenient parem ?
