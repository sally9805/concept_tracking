txt IT will be refreshing to the minds of those engaged in the asperities of political contention , occasionally to turn their thoughts to the movements which have for their object the pacification of the embattled world . Though , to them , the day when " the sword shall be beaten into the ploughshare " may appear far distant , they will rejoice to have presented to them the possibility of a higher and holier state than the world has ever yet exhibited ; they will rejoice to turn from " the wrong and outrage with which earth is filled , " to bring home the time when men shall learn war no more for ever . The Peace Movement , at the worst , is looked upon as a harmless abstraction . It has to encounter the indiLUerence rather than the enmity of the world . Unlike other reforms , it does not array our selfishness against it . No one would if he could restrain the tongue or pen of its advocates . Fighting is not loved for fighting 's sake . War , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evils ; as a sad necessity ; as the scourge of God upon the guilty nations . It is not now pretended that it brings any blessing in its train ; if it ward off some greater evil , it has accomplished the only good result claimed for it even by the most belligerent . The day has gone by when it was classed with the natural evils , - with the earthquake and the storm . It is felt to be a moral evil , the consequence of bitter selfishness , the product of the lusts and passions of men . In itself , for itself , war has now no friends ; peace and the peacemakers no enemies . Every one is therefore prepared , not only to listen attentively to the advocates of peace , but to reverence those who have fully imbued their own // hearts with the mild , and forgiving , and self-sacrificing principles which they advocate ; especially if they manifest a trustful confidence in man , and a firm faith in the ultimate spread of the truth . The enthusiasm and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We love them for their faith , their hope , their zeal , and bid them God speed ' in their attempts to lessen the miseries of the world , and to take from off the neck of the people every yoke , save that yoke which is light and easy to be borne . We can not help admitting , that if unsuccessful in the one great ultimate object , they labor not in vain ; that if they fail to show us the sun of righteousness already risen , they point us to the purple sky of the east , which betokens a brighter light beneath the horizon , and which is already dissipating the mists and darkness of the night . To this subject we have long desired to invite the attention of the readers of the Democratic Review . Let us in the first place fix it on the extent of the evil against which the advocates . of the Peace Movement contend ; let us endeavor to estimate the magnitude of their object , by tracing out some of the consequences of the martial spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which even now , though weakened , retains its dominion . Look to England ; the supposed prosperity of this nation is believed to be the result of her military spirit . She has been almost continually , from the Norman conquest down to the present time , in conflict with some other nation . Her military posts raise themselves up in defiance all over the broad surface of the earth ; her floating batteries trouble the waters of the whole world . Her military spirit has gone north and south , and east and west , for conquest . The blood of her sons has moistened every soil , the bones of her children have whitened every land . Even now , that she may protect her trade , her warlike energy is employed in the slaughter of the peaceful Chinese ! Has not the same spirit which fired the blood of the northern savage , when he overran the island now the " mistress of the ocean , " continued to manifest itself through generation after generation to the present day * Is it not the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , which has thus acquired and retained dominion over the remotest parts of the earth * Unlovely as is this trait of character , pirate-like , robber-like as it is , opposed directly to the selfsacrificing spirit of Christianity , till of late few have been so hold as to question it . We allude not invidiously to England ; we have selected her for an example , because it is easier to see the mist which hangs // over others , than-that in which we are ourselves enveloped . The same red stream flows in our veins , and this Anglo-Saxon blood is pre-eminent in the annals of warfare . We vaunt ourselves that we are as skilful in shedding blood , and as ready and willing to encounter a foe on the field of battle , as the most warlike . Our homes in this land are mainly by conquest ; we fought side by side with England as her colonies ; the birth-throe of our nation was in the field of blood ; the martial spirit was revived in our last contest with England ; and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip the dogs of war " for a narrow strip of waste land on our eastern borders . Could we see ourselves as others see us , we need not look abroad for an instance of the deep imbuing of the spirit of war . In fact , though the Anglo-Saxon race are lovers of the fight to a degree unsurpassed by any other , the martial spirit has been the master of the civilized world , looking down upon the lives and happiness of the common people as of no worth , regarding them as but the counters in the game . The nations of Europe can hardly be considered as ever at peace . Their nominal peace is but as a truce between contending armies , that they may rest a while and bury their dead ; continuing to stand face to face , ready at the signal to rush forward for the destruction of each other . There is no peace for the nations confronting each other with vast armaments , each jealous of its national " glory , " proud of its strength to rend and destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is nothing to bind down into subjection the conflicting elements . Even when the sun shines out over them , when the storm is hushed , the thick dark clouds still skirt the horizon ; let the wind but change , and the whole heavens are hung with darkness . Whether the battle rage or not , is beyond human control . It depends on accident . A mistake in diplomacy , the irritable temper of some public functionary , the caprice of the l*ader of a party , a mob on the frontier , a foolish mistake of a navy officer , will pronounce the sentence of death upon hundreds of thousands , cause the widow 's groan and the orphan 's cry . The lusts of the Corsicari yoked seventeen populous nations to the battlecar . Human life arid human happiness thus , as it were , rest on the turn of the die . There is no security for man . He holds all that he values subject to the will , to the vices , to the mistakes of a few ! It is against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate for peace contends . He would deliver the world from this abject bondage , and throw down the 4lltars of this blind butcher-god , whose murdered victims have been as countless as the sands upon the sea-shore. // We can readily see how the world has been ' made subject to the sword . The slavery of the people has descended from generation to generation . The occupation of our far-off ancestors was war - the destruction of human life ; their favorite amusement was hunting  --  the shedding of the blood of animals . The thirst for blood , child after child , was drawn in with the mother 's milk , stimulated by nursery rhymes , inflamed in early youth by a warlike literature The sword was the ornament for the gentleman ; the use of it , the only means of distinction . The song of the poet , the smile of beauty , the favor of the king , the blessing of the priest , the applause of the multitude , completed the work of hardening men 's hearts , so that they could seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever the leaders deemed it for their interest that the work of death should begin . This has continued for ages as if there was no way of escape from the curse . It has been submitted to as a pestilence that could not be overcome , as a plague that could not be stayed ; nay , not only submitted to , but , catching the ferocity one man from another , by appeals to their patriotism , their chivairy , their contempt of danger , they were made to delight in the carnage of the fight . Even Christianity has been harnessed to the war-chariot ; the relig*ion which with her first breath proclaimed good-will to man , which was nurtured and strengthened by the blood of martyrs who sacrificed their own lives for others ' good ,  --  which ever spoke in accents of universal love , saying , If thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he be athirst , give him drink ,  --  this faith of love and mercy , of meekness and charity , has been forced , with unwilling lips , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " swift to shed blood . " Nay , nay ! man never has had the boldness thus *vho1ly to corrupt the truth . It is only the war of selfdefei ? ce , of national protection , over which the pure white robe of Christianity has been thrown . Thus saith the priest  --  but the soldier has stretched his Christian right to battle , to cover his deeds , whether he fought at home or abroad , to attack or repel , whether he contended with his own countryman or with the foreigner , with his next door neighbor or the far-off Indian , on any ground , for any purpose . And none spoke to him of the wrong - there came no voice of warning to his ears . The priest was silent-how could he speak l Was not his very church hung with the trophies of war It is true that George Fox and his peaceful followers , and some other small sects , have lifted up their voices against war . // They eradicated from their own breasts the military spirit . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of plebeian blood . They were despised and looked down upon . Their light could not penetrate the camp , or throw its rays upon the council board . Individuals , isolated men , in every age , have also written and spoken against the horrors of war , and of the opposition of the martial spirit to the spirit of Christ . But in vain . The still small voice was overwl*lmed by the shouts and the thunders of the battle-field . In our own country , Benjamin Franklin has the high distinction of being the first advocate of peace , of being perhaps the first statesman in the whole world , who publicly and forcibly attempt . ed to stem the tide of opinion , and to bear down on the custom of ivar . He had seen its horrors in the battles of the Revolution , he deplored the mad passions which they excited , and mourned over the wide-spread desolation of this sanguinary contest , and declared that the time would come , when men would no longer thus butcher each other . His sagacity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We refer for proof , that he had raised himself far above the common tone on the subject of war , to his correspondence with David Hartly , the British minister . It is full of the zeal and philanthropy of the peace-reformer . The following are extracts - " I received your favor of the 20th Sept. , containing your very judicious proposition for securing the spectators in the play-house from the danger of fire But what are the lives of a few idle haunters of play-houses compared with the many thousands of worthy men , and of honest industrious families , destroyed by this devilish war ! o that we could find some invention to stop the spreading of the flames , and to put an end to so horrid a conflagration . " Again he speaks of means to make treaties more durable ; still further , in a letter to Hartly , he says : " What think you of a proposition , if I should make it , of a family compact between England , France , and America . America would be indeed happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace her father and her husband . What repeated follies are these repeated wars ! You can not want to conquer or govern each other ; why then be continu* ally employed in injuring and destroying each other . How many excellent things might have been done to promote the internal welfare of each country ; what bridges , roads , canals , and other useful public works , tending to the common felicity , might have been made and established with the money and men foolishly spent during the last seven centuries , by our mad wars in doing // one another mischief . You are near neighbors , and each have very respectable qualities . Learn to be quiet and respect each other 's rights . You are all Christians . One is the Most Christina King , the other is Defender of the Faith . Manifest the propriety of these titles by your future conduct . By this , ' says Christ , shall all men know ye are my disciples , if ye love one another . ' Seek peace and ensue it . " They who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to his correspondence on the subject of privateering ; to his apologue of the angels beholding a naval engagement , in a letter to Dr. Priestley ; to his peace suggestions in his correspondence with B. Vaughan , Esq . Beside these , Franklin made many proposals for the improvement of the law of nations , having for their object the overcoming of the war spirit . In this work he found able coadjutors among the fathers of our republic . They were just from the battle , and the poverty and moral degradation of the people , the fiscal embarrassments , the wrong tone of public opinion , impressed them with the necessity of doing what they could to avert other conflicts . " The journals of the Congress of the Confederation , " says a sound writer , " are full of such programmes as now emanate only from the bureaux of our Peace Societies . " How striking the contrast in the feelings of these patriotic men , with the war mania of many of our present legislators . It would seem that a war in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different aspects . How readily in the midst of God 's blessings do men forget the consequences*of his frown ! So it ever has been . Peace soon called the public attention from the contemplation of the sufferings of war ; and as our country increased in population , and gathered in of the world 's riches , the horrors of the battle were forgotten  --  the pain and weakness of disease fading away from the mind with returning health and strength . It was not until another war with Great Britain that the present permanent Peace Movement commenced . The foundation of the Massachusetts Peace Society was laid in the year 1815 . Similar institutions were established in various other parts of the country , and in Europe , and an active correspondence commenced , and has been kept up between these distant associations . The formation of the first Peace Society in England was not , however , in consequence of , but simultaneous with , that in the United States . Dr. Noah Worcester was the founder of the first society in this country ; William Pitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ground first taken by the Massachusetts Peace Society was in // opposition to war not strictly defensive ; but soon this gronild was found to be unfit for the purpose ; it was not firm enough to bear the iatrenchmeat of peace . Public opinion drove the friends of peace to a higher stand . Every nation had its favorite war to be justified on the plea of national safety . Even Bonaparte fought only on the defensive - as he said . The excused , justifiable fight was always the fight then to be fought - the popular war , the war in which the country was then engaged . Each nation for itself separated its own battles from the mass of crime in which they were mingled , and rejoiced in them , - thus incasing pollution in fine gold , and holding it up for the admiration of the world . The Massachusetts Peace Society was therefore superseded by the American Peace Society , organized in the year 1828 , of which WiLLIAM LAnD was the first President , continuing in office till his death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the spirit of Christ . Besides the efforts of Worcester , Scarlett , and Ladd , there has sprung up a host of others all over this country , who are continuing the impulse given to the cause . In France the Society for the spread of Christian Morals have devoted a part of their efforts to this branch of reform . Count de Sellon of Geneva also founded a peace society there , and with untiring benevolence devoted himself to this and kindred works . In England the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace continue their exertions resolutely and efficiently , and the labors of the British philanthropios are felt throughout every part of that nation . This is an auspicious beginning of the movement . There is now scarce a to*vn , district , or neighborhood , where the question of the unjustifiable character of war is not discussed . By the pens of Worcester , and Ladd , and Channing , and many other in this country - of Scarlett , Thrush , Clarkson , Dymond , and their coadjutors in England- of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines are becoming gradually infused into the public mind . The peace literature is now no small addition to our libraries ; the periodical press has teemed with a constant flow of articles on the subject ; tracts have been scattered to the four quarters of the globe , and lectures and lyceum discussions have driven the subject home to the fireside of almost every man . A movement so general is not without a strong claim on the attention of the politician . A reasonable success is abundaiitly proved by the zeal with which these reformers work , for had they found the shield against their attack impenetrable , they would before this have given up their warfare . So far from being discouraged , they never were more confident of success than at present ; for VOL . X. , No . XLIV. - 15 // tfiough one of their leaders has been taken from them , his spirit remains to incite them continually to new efforts in behalf of the cause he has bequeathed to them . But what has been done l we hear asked . What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to the disarming of the nations ; not one has adopted in practice the principles of peace ; the flow of human blood has not been stopped ; the preparation for shedding blood has not been stayed . This is true . But remember , a great change is to be effected inwardly before it manifests itself in the outward conduct . From the position of a nation glorying in war , regarding it as the instrument of her prosperity , the*cherished employment for the energies of her most distinguished sons , to the full stature of a Christian people seeking others ' good rather than their own , the distance is mighty indeed . It is not to be traversed in one age . The onward path is indeed a long one . It reaches from the battle-field to a far-off Eden , to a paradise upon earth now hut dimly seen with the strongest eye of faith . Happy if men have entered this path-nay , happy if they linger at the opening , and then point out to each other the angel forms and " spirits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grossness of the flesh thro*vn off , are still inviting them to enter the path they loved while on earth . Light has been scattered on this subject . There has been , we believe , a great change in public opinion . Though the fire has not been quenched , it has been kept in subjection ; though the war trumpet is still continually sounding upon the ear , its notes have become harsh and grating to millions . Though the war spirit is not openly rebuked by the people , in every circle it is lamented . The war speeches are heard in silence , or , if applauded by the Unreflecting , no echo of admiration comes back to reward the efforts of the " provokers of strife . " Though our newspaper press is often full of fight , it has but taken its cue from the noisy patriot who raises the war-cry as of old , forgetting that it has lost its charm among the people . " Maine , " said William Ladd , " is my home ; I know the people well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men when they were speaking of the rash resolutions of their legislature-laboring men too , the bone and muscle . I know the feeling of this State ; they have not the war.fever . It is the contest of the leaders of the two parties to outdo each other in this noisy patriotism . It is the office-holders and the office*seekers , who raise the war-cry . They are indeed noisy , for one idle grasshopper will make a whole field vocal with his shrill note , while thousands of industrious ants are silently at work . " We would riot overrate the results of the Peace Movement , for // that which men acknowledge has been done , is enough to make it cherished , and to encourage its friends in their future labors . The cause is onward . The signs of the times are not to be mistaken . In the court of royalty , at the cabinet meeting , its influence is felt . Collisions of interest , which a quarter of a century ago would have plunged nations into war , are now amicably settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the law of nations . The favorable ear which has been lent to the proposal of the establishment of a Congress of Nations , for the settlement of international disputes , demonstrates that the determination of the wise and good , to lessen the occasions of hostility , is felt by every statesman . There is , indeed , a tempering down of the war tone , a growing spirit of mutual concession among the principal nations , and an increasing repugnance to war among every enlightened people . We do not claim for the Peace Movement proper the whole merit of this change . Other causes are in constant action . These are the extension of commerce and the frequency of intercommunication-the kindly affections flowing from heart to heart , silentiy , noiselessly ; for every keel that cuts the wave forms a pathway for love to travel in . There is , too , the spread of democratic principles , which go side by side with the principles of peace . Sound democracy ever contends against restrictive systems , national barriers , the setting up of men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other men , for the gain of the few . Its charm is that it proclaims good-will to men . Thousands flock to its standard because it is set up on the broad platform of universal hrotherhood , while the banner of aristocracy floats over the war-castle , the lord of which but feeds his vassals that they may have strength to fight for him . In Europe the governments of some of the most belligerent nations are not sufficiently strong in the affections of the people for them to encounter safely the shock of war . The governed have not sufficient confidence in the rulers to make it expedient for the nation to measure its strength with its adversaries . Add to this the national debts  --  the bondage of the many to the capitalist  --  the price which the people pay for national glory . The over-loaded beast of burden already staggers under the weight ; increase it , and he will be broken down altogether . Again ; in olden times there were but two classes of men , the nobles and the people ; now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , in intelligence , keenly alive to their own interest . They have rio war spirit , for the battle is death to them ; and their influence is strengthening all over the world . The capitalists , they who hold // the key of the world 's treasures , have a growing dislike to national debts . The Jew does not now crouch at the foot of the throne , as he once did ; royalty itself , ere it can prepare for war , must go " on change . " But it is in this country that the martial spirit has received its greatest check ; it is here that the pacific principles will first be adopted . Our political institutions direct the energies of every mind to questions of reform . While we love and reverence our fathers , we are not disposed to think that they attained to all truth . Their path was onward , and we best manifest our duty to them by pressing forward ourselves . They cut down the forest , and planted the grain , but there is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , because they had not the strength to eradicate them ; - they will yield to us , for time has weakened the roots which fastened them to the soil . Our people are not deterred from the discussion of new opinions merely because they arc new . The cry of Radicalism does not close the ear to truth . The people will inquire for themselves of this matter ; they will not wear any chain because their fathers were thus in bondage . They begin to suspect that the poor man , the strong.sinewed working.man , the labor.blackened artisan , has equal rights to life and to the means of happiness with the rich and educated . They begin to ask some radical questions on this subject . Are we , say they , to be cut off from our usual employments by a declaration of war , and thus driven by a fear of starvation into the ranks of the army , to be changed from freemen into the veriest slaves , whose every motion is controlled by others l Are we to fill the ditch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nay , say they , it is unequal , unfair that we should be shot at for a shilling a day , while others , whose lives are no dearer than ours , whose wives and children love them no better than do ours , after being educated as*officers at the public expense , receive ample pay , and all the glory of the victory . And this too while the owners of the country 's wealth , for which we fight , tread on Brussels carpets , and , lolling on soft sofas , are out of harm 's way , rejoicing perhaps that a victory has been *von , the price of which has been the destruction of ten thousand of us . If a war be needed for the good of our common country , let its dangers and privations be common too . These questions are already asked in whispers all over the land . They will be shouted in the ears of our politicians ere long . We have known a large audience to draw the deep breath of indignation when was read before them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his efficient force one-third of a large army , // as the consumption by disease alone of a single campaign . It was a mere stroke of the pen - a thing of course - this consigning thousands of men to sickness , wo , and certain death , - and done too with more composure than it would cost a humane man to direct a troublesome kitten to be destroyed . No wonder that the people felt indignation at the low value thus put upon human S life ! Carlyle has said that " the common people are always in favor of war , for then there is a demand for the common people-to be shot . " Not exactly so with us . It may be so in a starving population , whose only chance for life is in the ranks of the army ; in a country from which corn-laws bar out the food of the people , and whose factories are closed by the restrictive systems of the neighboring nations ; where a man with a soul is of less value than the dogs in a nobleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven to this extremity . They feel that they have souls , feel that they belong to the family of man , and while their love of their country is not surpassed by any on earth , they know what they can justly and fairly ask of their richer brethren . The time has almost gone by when the whole burden of war , both its suffering and its consequent taxation , can be thrown on them , while the educated , the wealthy , the influential , touch not the burden with the tips of their fingers . For who feels the burden of taxation save the poor man , whose comforts are abridged by it , whose bread for his wife and children is lessened by it l What is the war debt but the mortgage to the capitalist of the very sinews of the people , which must create the value that is to discharge it l This is radicalism indeed , but it is radicalism which has some definite claims upon the attention of the most conservative among us . What has the statesman to complain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human brotherhood . You have presented before the people a scroll , bearing , in large letters ; the words " equal rights . " They have rejoiced to rend them , but now ask you to unroll your paper , that they may also read down to the very end . They have been taught some welcome truths , and they long for further light . The starving population of Europe are our brethren , and you that have taught us this great truth , that have excited our sympathies toward them , and made us love and pity them , will you now ask us to shoot down these men whom . degradation has driven to the army , because the government which oppresses them has also injured us l You have read the people some lessons in the philosophy of war , and they begin to love the study , and have some hesitation in placing themselves // where they must kill or be killed , because of disputes which , if you possessed sufficient magnanimity , sufficient confidence in their practical good sense , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding of the democratic principle ( we use the word democratic as denoting the elevation of the people , the binding them together in bands of a common brotherhood , creating a mutual interest in each other , the prostration of every institution which enables a few injuriously to affect the interest of others ) - is opening a new avenue to men 's minds , and preparing the people to learn of Him " who spake as never man spake . " We do not pretend that our political institutions are perfect , or that no evil follows the wandering of the people into untried paths , where no ancient land-marks nor guide-posts are set up . We do not pretend that the people are fully enlightened . Far from it . They see yet but partially . Their eyes are not fully opened . Yet with the light they have , they are boldly and earnestly in progress . The public mind is deeply excited . Lono* established opinions , the customs of ages , are intently examined ; and when satisfied of former errors , they have the self-confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth that has penetrated the masses , is mainly this : - thnt there is much wo and wretchedness , poverty and degradation , carnage and oppression in the world , not necessarily there ; that the wrongs done by man to man are not from the necessity of the case , but from the imperfect structure of society ; that the gnawing hunger of a whole population , the abject bondage of many people , the degradation of millions , made machines of that they may be better soldiers  --  the rivers of blood that have been shed-that all these are not of God 's appointment , but the result of the bitter selfishness of the few ; and that they , the people , have in times past been made slaves of , that they might be the scourges of each other , not for their own profit or pleasure , but to minister to the lusts and passions of those who control the movements of the nations . They begin to suspect the wisdom which seeks to bring good out of evil , by opposing man to man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual self-destruction . Where is the good of all this l ask the people . To whose advantage is it i The good comes not to us . It destroys us . If our political institutions are sound , their tendency is to elevate the people , to diffuse the comforts of life among them all , to extend refinement of feeling a ad activity of mind through the whole mass ; to improve the morals , and to call out into full exercise the social feelings , the spirit of love and mutual kindness . // Now war is the opposing principle , the antagonist of all this , and of course conflicts with the spirit of our republican government . One unavoidable consequence of war , is the unequal distribution of property . It absorbs all the wealth of the country to fill still further the coffers of the rich . National experience in Europe proves this . Vast sums of money are extorted from the people to be returned , dollars to the few , cents to the many ; and the war debt , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinews and muscles to the capitalist . War is necessarily an aristocratical state ; the same relative distinction extends all over the land as is seen in the ships of war ,  --  the princely state-room for the master , the hammock for the men ,  --  the one enjoying ample space and the free air in his luxurious cabin , the others crowded below in a mass , to breathe the suffocating odors of the hold . It is , we repeat , necessarily so ; war can not be waged without these unjust distinctions . The many must become subject to the few , the money interest must be the lord of the ascendent , and when Peace returns she finds the habit of command in some , the willingness to yield in others , firmly fastened upon the nation . The government , fused in the furnace of war , assumes the shape which the exiaencies of war demand ; it takes the mould of the battle , and peace only cools down the mass into adamantine hardness , which ever after bears down upon the people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fight which created a nobility , and it is the continuance of the martial spirit which still buo*s them up above the level of common men . We have recurred to this view of the subject to show that our relative position as a nation , that our republican institutions , favor the spread of the principles of Christianity . It is our popular government , our democratic reference to the good of the people , the bold radical spirit among us , which will not rest satisfied with a lie because the lie has been told for ages , which makes our country the proper field for the spread of this reform , and encourages the philanthropist in this blessed work . We do not pretend , as we befor* said , that the people are fully enlightened on this subject . There are yet many in utter darkness , many whose prejudices against some one foreign nation have been industriously kept alive . There are others , too , the alarmists by trade , disturbers of the public peace for bread - so reckless of consequences to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy any commotion which shall break up the present relative positions of men . Still the people have their eyes partially opened ; they see present evils , though their vision extends riot far away to see the curative means . For instance , in the case // of a war for the disputed territory , they can not comprehend how the waste of money , life , human happiness , on both sides , can settle existing difficulties . Neither nation can conquer the other ; and when at last the attempt at pacification is made , the exasperated feelings created by the war , so far from diminishing , increase the difficulties of an adjustment . They begin to feel too the utter folly of the terms " national honor , " " national glory , " " national chivalry " - though many of our legislators appear not to have made the discovery . These terms are the watchwords of England - a country in which twenty thousand people at least die annually of actual starvation - where , notwithstanding this , the poor sailor or soldier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose body is maimed , and whose mother and sister are " on the parish , " shouts huzza for his king and his country . Glorious England ! They have some idea too that the spread of knowledge , the thorough diffusion of the comforts of life ,  --  in other words , the happiness of the people , is their true glory . They know that this glory is not promoted by war . Experience tells them that the sword has ever been the instrument of the tyrant and oppressor ; and he that wields it even in the cause of liberty , too often has found he but obtained " the name Of freedom , graven on a heavier chain ! " We are aware that the popular indignation was excited and still continues , against those who took part in opposition to the last war ; and rightly excited too . A party peace organization , while the country is engaged in fight , has the appearance of a traitorous combination , attacking the government when weakened by the employment of all its resourccs against the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country which the Federal party then opposed , but the one result of this war spirit - the actual war then existing . It was not the unchristian nature of every war , but the inexpediency of the exercise of the right then to do battle . They did not place themselves on the high ground of the moralist , but on the lotv ground of the partisan . They did not so much consider the happiness and welfare of the people , as the success and triumph of a faction . Was it not so in the mainthough many may have joined the opposition from higher and purer motives ' ! What moral right has any one to oppose his country ; to embarrass her operations , when actually engaged in war , if he holds to the right and expediency of ever fighting at all ' !
