txt IN all communities there is a pervading theory of life , a set of principles which guide the mass , a few permanent ideas that actuate society . The English , for example , driven by a humid atmosphere to look within doors for cheerful associations , gather about them with profusion , the means of physical wellbeing . Continental visitors to Great Britain are astonished at the perfection of domestic machinery , and the ingenious devices to secure ease and warmth , and render the dwelling a castle and a home . They at once recognize in such arrangements the idea of Comfort as the chief element in the philosophy of life . People on the other side of the channel , instead of concentrating their means of enjoyment , go abroad in search of them . The Parisian finds the glare of a public cafe more agreeable than the snug fire-side of a private room ; he reads his gazege under the trees in a public garden , and finds no difficulty in making a companion of his neighbor at the theatre , piquing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation than for any individual qualities or possessions . By temperament and habit he directly seeks Pastime , as the end of his existence . If we pass to Italy , we discover a passion for music , great local pride in the fame of genius , universal taste and enthusiasm for imaginative excitement of all kinds , and realize how largely Art enters into their system of life . The Chinese trustfully refer you to " Old Custom , " and the Turks to Fate , as the principles by which they regulate their heing . It may be a fanciful notion , but I think the ordinary salutations of a people indicate in a measure , their philosophy of living . The French greeting is literally- ' how do you carry yourself ? "  --  a query suggestive of egotism ; that of the Italians " how do you stand ? " which breathes of an existence in the immediate-so characteristic of the South ; while our favorite phrase is- " how do you get alono ? " - at once calling up an external and distant goal-success . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies of the whole country and so constantly eulogized on public occasions , that they may he justly deemed the active and prominent element of American life . It has become so much a practice , when any reference is made to the habits , manners and principles of our nation , to indulge in self-congratulation , that not a few shrink from the hazardous experiment of dwelling otherwise than complacently upon the social traits of the people . Indeed , one 's patriotism is liable to be called in question if he acknowledge any other creed than implicit belief in the superiority of existent motives of action and modes of life . Such a feeling can not obtain , however , among the candid and inquiring-among those whose love of country is intelligent and sincere . To such the chief value of political liberty is the scope it affords for social improvemeiit . They revert to a brave ancestry not alone to glory in their laurels , but to emulate their fidelity and add to the trophies of national renown . No man flatters the woman he truly loves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is evidenced rather by blind partiality than affectionate insight , and bold recognition of truth . If any people are bound by honor and wisdom to self-criticism , it is ourselves , for we have it in our power more than any other to carry out new principles of action , to improve upon the results of experience , and immediately appropriate , as individuals , all the light that comes to us 1845.1 // What then are the ultra tendencies in our social system , taking New England philosophy , so generally quoted with admiration , as the basis of inquiry ? What elements must we individually furnish to render our culture generous ? Wherein are we liable to be perverted by the theory of life which prevails ? Republics have ever been accounted peculiarly favorable to the development of character . The absence of external domination has been deemed the best guarantee for personal independence . The general confidence in this idea seems to me to have produced results of a directly contrary kind . Nowhere is the force of public opinion stronger than here . The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind us as individuals . Noble-minded men in the old world turn upon their own resources , cultivate their peculiar tastes , and rely upon their personal convictions , with the more determination , from the very despotism which surrounds them . Our countrymen pass through Southern Europe , and casually survey the apathy which broods over human existence , the abject misery of the lower orders and the frivolous dissipation of the higher , and turn away from the spectacle in disgust . But if they could enter the apartments of some of the true spirits , scattered through those densely populated cities , they would frequently pause in admiration of the scene . They would find minds living , as it were , in the very atmosphere of heroism , holding constant communion with the good and great of past ages , and cherishing in solitude purposes worthy of the most eminent of our race . I have known young men in Italy subsisting upon the scantiest incomes rather than live upon the wages of despotism , withdrawing from the gayest society rather than countenance the levity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and elevating companionship , and thus atoning for their untoward lot by a quiet bravery more impressive than the most gallant achievements . Such characters have given me a more vivid sense of human worth than the lives of successful heroes . I have thus been made to realize how much of sacredness there is in the individual , how much he can accomplish within himself , what courage and power he may display and what energies he may unfold by manly and philosophic endurance . With us the case is so widely different that the tendency is to spread outward from ourselves and become identified with the mass . There is a cant of reverence applied to man in the abstract , but as an individual he is seldom appreciated except under a professional aspect . The true end of freedom is to develope manhood and womanhood , not to make authors , mechanics or statesmen . First let us have the humeri attributes in their completeness ,  --  the broad intelligence that no vocation can bound , the heart which no sect or party can absorb ! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not mere aptitudes or condition-win our interest and enlist our sympathies ! It is owing to an estimate the opposite of this , that , except in the West and South , the surface of life is so level that there is little material in the way of original character , in our young land ,  --  so few compared to the monotonously energetic mass , who stand in bold relief , distinct , consistent , individual men , living for a great idea like Columbus , or enduring with brave selfreliance like Dante . The danger is ever with us that we refer our actions , thoughts and feelings , to the idolized standard of public opinion . We believe too much in associations and too little in ourselves . We are not inclined to concentrate mind , sentiment and activity , but to dissipate them in generalities . Now , the actual good which the individual derives from associations is very limited . They are doubtless useful in a certain way and to a certain extent ; but they ought not to blind us to nearer obligations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may often be best promoted by personal fidelity . " Over the time , thou hast no power ; to redeem a world sunk in dishonesty has not been given thee ; solely over one man therein thou hast a quite absolute , uncontrollable power ; him redeem , him make honest ; it will be something , it will be much , and thy life and labor not in vain . " Next to the danger of subserviency to society , the unhealthy prominence of the idea of thrift is the most baneful feature in our philosophy of life . That it should be prominent in a young and commercial republic is to be expected . The reat error is that there is little desire to restrain its expression within // due hounds . Let it have free scope on the exchange and in the mart , but let it not continually deform our fireside discuurse and usurp the inner sanctuary of the soul . There , at least , let not all be " hase respects of thrift and none of love . " Pecuniary ability is the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deified ; success is exclusively desired , or rather grossly misunderstood ; for if there be a single established principle of human well-being , it is that which defines the successful man as him who is true to himself-to his powers , tastes , and actual needs . It is time we not only coldly acknowledged , but instinctively felt , that it is as barbaric to reverence wealth as to overload the limbs with ornament . The philosophy of life with us seems based on the faith that man lives by bread alone . Trade and politics completely overshadow literature and art . Invention exhausts itself upon machines and finance ; our trophies may be found chiefly at the patent office . Yet the real end of all these is to procure time , and what is time if unprovided with the resources which shall dignify and adorn it ? " Poetry , " says a beautiful writer , " and the principle of self , of which money is the visible incarnation , are the God and Mammon of the world . " What intelligent mind can doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea is the spirit of our community ! A New England merchant , upon leaving a picture-gallery abroad , was observed by his companion to be very thoughtful . Presently he exclaimed , " I have been thinking of nothing but making money all my life . How much there is to learn and to enjoy , in this world ! Henceforth no thought of business shall enter my mind , until I recross the Atlantic . I will study painting , and sculpture , and music : I will commune with nature ; I will ponder the works of departed genius ; I will cultivate the society of the intellectual and the gifted ; " - at this point of his harangue , he suddenly left his friend 's side , and darted into a shop they were passing ,  - -  apologizing , upon resuming the walk , by saying he had merely stopped to inquire the price of tallow ! Leisure with us is still an anomaly . Now far be it from us to gainsay the advantages of industry , to deny that labor is man s appropriate sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of universal activity , and consequently , of prosperity around us . Let us only contend that all labor is not obvious and tangible ; that no man who thinks , deserves to be called an idler ; that the absence of any obvious employment or specific profession does not necessarily make any one amenable to the charge of inactivity . How much of our boasted industry is profitless ! To how many social ambition or extravagant tastes , instead of necessity , form the true motives of business ! Hoxv much of the so called occupation about us is void of any higher result than that of keeping its votaries out of mischief ! How seldom do those who have acquired a competency , retire upon it to scenes of domestic improvement ! With what reluctance du the fortunate yield the arena to the young and penniless , even when age and infirmity warn them to retreat ! It is time we learned , not to underrate business , but to appreciate leisure . A man who is miserable when his hands are unemployed or his mind unabsurbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not remove . Where then are the results of our boasted education ? Of what avail are prosperity and freedom ? Doubtless activity is the true destiny of man , an essential condition of his being ; and much of it must be outward and absorbing . But this is no reason for the horror of leisure which is so common ; it is no reason why a man who is not ostensibly busy should be regarded as some strange animal , or that the mere idea of repose should prove alarming . One of our artists designed a family group , and submitted it to his wealthy patron for approval . " Sir . " exclaimed that personage , highly indignant ; " do you think I would have my wife painted with a rose in her hand ? Let her be employed about something . " Thus was spurned , even in fancy , a little dalliance with the passing moment , over one of those flowers which a benignant Creator seems to have furnished , as it were , to lure us sometimes to linger and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle than when idle , " was the motto which the admirable Vittoria Colonna wrought upon her husband 's dressinggown . And may we not justly regard // our appreciation of leisure as a test of improved character and growing re-sources ? The next feature in the prevalent theory of life to which I would allude , is the want of serenity . In society , business , and education , there is a spirit of urgency , an artificial force constantly exhibited , as opposed to true habits of mind as it is to real happiness . If enterprise hath her Carnival here , enjoyment often keeps Lent . XVe accustom ourselves to live in a continual bustle , and make , on all occasions , a parade of action , as if this were the true criterion of success , the only evidence of progress . We do not believe in the wise saying , that " it is an absolute , and as it were a divine perfection for a man to know how loyally to enjoy his being . " There is a true epicurism  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher instincts of the individual , of which we are practically ignorant . Instead of meeting in the frank simplicity and heartiness becoming republicans , at one another 's firesides , in the full and frequent confidence of genuine social feeling , interchanging opinions , and enjoying the delights of sympathy , we deem it better to crowd our small apartments to suffocation , wander for several hours over a dwelling which has been disarranged from garret to cellar for the occasion , exchange a word or sign of recognition with some hundred acquaintances , and close the evening 's pastime by partaking of an extravagant entertainment . Even the preparation for the conflict of life to which the earlier years of existence are sacred , is marked by the same ostentatious urgency . The tender brain of infancy is fevered by the spirit of emulation . The child is incited at home by the ambitious views of his parents , arid surrounded at school by a system of artificial machinery . Certificates of conduct and studies flutter weekly before his eyes , inspiring the same anxious foreboding that the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks suspend specie payments . Then come periodical examinations and exhibitions , for which the pupil undergoes weeks of extra drilling , as if he could not be too early and too deeply impressed with the importance of display . How often is the sensitive New England youth forced to sympathize in Tony Luinpkin 's un dutiful remonstrance to his mother 's officious and mistaken kindness , which she justifies by the common plea , that it was all for the victim 's good . " I wish you 'd let me and my good alone , then . If I 'm to have any good , let it come of itself ; and do n't keep dinging it , dinging it into me so . " And when he leaves the scene of education , whatever his calling , the same principle of " affected dispatch , " as Lord Bacon calls it , must be acted upon . If he would suc ceed in business he must identify himself with some popular movement , he must contrive to keep his name before the public , with the epithets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hint must now and then be given in the papers , of his yearly sales , or the amount of hands he employs . Above all , he must keep up in his own person an appearance of business . His rapid gait , hasty speech , and short salutations must give the world assurance of a busy man . Mrs. Jameson , whose observation was artistic , as well as sympathizing , observed , that American faces had an outward look . This extends even to American enjoyments , of which it may be said , as some traveller said of the English , " they amuse themselves sadly after the manner of their country . " If , on the other hand , a professional life is adopted , the first thing necessary to success is , to do or to seem to do something extraordinary . One must advocate some peculiar system , announce some startling novelty , or espouse some public cause , and let it be known from Maine to Georgia that he is ready to become a martyr in its behalf . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost universal . Scarcely a week passes without a celebration by public dinners and eloquent harangues of some popular event or local anniversary . The political atmosphere is never quiet , and the social spirit is ever and anon aroused by some bold doctrine or alleged discovery . Now that there is much that is really desirable in such symptoms , it would be absurd to deny ,  --  that they constitute an unavoidable feature in our present stage of progress , is very evident . Still it is of great importance that the individual should not be deceived or carried away by this universal semblance of activity . In older countries we often see a graceful repose upon destiny , an absence of care respecting the future , and an instinctive trust // like that in which a bird or flower lives , which , to say the least , leaves the mind free to please and be picased , and renders far less prevailing than with us the idea of self-interest and morbid ambition . Snch beings have the requisite sympathy to regard the individuality , and realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us not be beguiled of our selfpossession by the bustle around us . Let us not be so absorbed in the show of things , as to miss their essence and reality . There is no little danger amid all this exhibition of force , this large promise of results , that we shall be drawn aside from our true position by the stream of multitude . The great duty which such artificial activity imposes upon the individual , is to estimate calmly the real value of the objects for which so much sympathy is demanded . His obligations to his own nature are paramount to those which society so constantly urges . A few years since , a volcanic island appeared off the coast of Sicily . It was announced by many and portentous signs . Shocks of an earthquake were felt in the vicinity ; immense quantities of fish rose dead to the surface of the sea , and the water , for a considerable space , was strangely agitated . At length columns of dense smoke rose up from the waves , intermingled with globes of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many days the vapor rolled away and left a small island revealed , where before there was but a watery waste . The phenomenon excited immense interest . Scientific men flocked to the place to investigate , the material , and account for the construction of the island . The curious repaired thither to gratify their thirst for novelty , and the incredulous to satisfy their doubts . i ? inal* ly , an English voyager landed on the spot , and planting the flag of his country , gave it the name he himself bore . Satisfied that by this act his immortality was secured , he hasteiied home to report his discovery . Meantime the captain of a Sicilian vessel explored the island , indignantly tore down the British ensign , and erecting that of the Two Sicilies , declared that it should be ever known as the isle of Ferdinand . While the right of possession was warmly disputing , and the philosophers of Sicily argued as earnestly all the scientific problems involved in the subject , u hule surveyors vied with each other in drafting its form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared beneath the sea , and the next morning nothing met the eyes of the discomrited spectators hut a solitary expanse of water . Are not many popular objects announced by a like display of noise and glare as foretold the volcanic island ? And after absorbing the energies of a crowd of aspirants for fame or fortune , do they not , in like manner , sink into the waters of oblivion ? Are not the fire of genius , the apprehension of intellect , the warmth of the heart , too sacred to be carelessly expended ? Shall we he decoyed by every transient fire that gleams upon the ocean of life , when we can wander calmly along its firm shores , and look out , in*nsubdued , upon the tumult of its waves ? There is an efficacy in calmness of which we are unaware . The element of serenity is one which we peculiarly need . I speak not of that calmness which is more properly stagnation ,  - -  not the calmness of apathy and indifference , but what Wordsworth calls the " quiet of a thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the onset , of the dark cloud before the thunder-burst , of the torrent before it strikes the rocks-significant of gathering strength , of concentrate power , of quiet energy . How full of emblems of this serene action is Nature ! The frosts of autumn touch the forest leaves , und we admire their gorgeous dyes . Gradually they are loosened from the branches by the wailing breeze , and in a few days , lie thickly strewn upon the ground , there to decompose and enrich the very loam that nourished them into life . What a universal change , and how quietly produced ! What can be more awful than many of the phenomena which the snows of winter occasion ? Melting in the hollows of the hills , this white and fleecy substance dissolves , streams into the valleys and collects into torrents that swell the neighboring rivers and produce the most destructive inundations . Masses of snow conjoin among the Alpine summits , and thunder down in the form of the terrific avalanche . On a night when the winds are hushed , how noiseless falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the mighty and hitherto invincible army of Napoleon was subdued by a Russian // snow-storm . Thus is it with the soul . But a small part of its deepest and truest activity can be displayed . There is a mystery in its growth . The best energies of our nature , too , are quietly unfolded and slowly matured . There is a power and truth which can only be realized in tranquillity . There is a wisdom that displays itself only in the serene and thoughtful breast . There are beauties of character which , like the night-blooming Cereus , are closed against the glare and turbulence of everyday life , and bloom only in shade and solitude and beneath the quiet stars . Another principle in the New England philosophy of life , which demands attention , is extreme devotion to reason . Franklin is still the personation of the American mind abroad , an honored name , indeed , but one that serves only as a partial exponent of humanity-the type of the practical , not the ideal man , of useful science rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayings have attained such favor . Our only metaphysician who enjoys a European reputation , is Edwards , whose celebrated work on the Will is devoted to a defence of the old popular theology . The pride of the cultivated New Englander is that he is rational . The first lore instilled into his mind is in the shape of prudential maxims . The favorite term of approbation he bestows upon a woman is sensible , and there is nothing so congenial to his ambition as the reputation of talent . The natural consequence is that his ideal of character is based almost wholly upon intellectual gifts , and attainment ' * . Every subject is viewed through the cold medium of expediency ; all questions must be tried by the level light of the understanding , and the most hallowed associations and universal precedents wrested into the service of temporary and narrow objects . One of our most distinguished men in a critique upon Othello-that unrivalled exposition of the power of love and " jealousy , that doats but dooms , and murders yet adores , " - declares the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil consequences of amalgamation and runaway matches ! In this tendency to seize upon the rationale of existence , to act upon what are called common-sense principles , there is doubtless much to approve . A community thus characterized possesses an essential element of advancement . But when such a theory is exclusive , when it is reposed upon as broad and deep enough for the soul , and becomes , as it were , the standard of life and the mould of character , we are tempted to exclaim with Charles Lamb , " If aug them -I mean the cursed reasoning crew-those blights and blasts of alt that is human in man or child . " We do not appreciate feeling . We estimate knowledge far heyond sentiment . We reverence intellect hut look distrustfully upon enthusiasm , for the love of excitement in which the formal lives of New Englanders re-act , is not entitled to the name . We crusade for the most part against vices of appetite , which are often the overflowings of rich natures , linked with the most generous qualities , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not realize that the moral evils that most effectually despoil the spirit of beauty are those of calculation , to which perverted intellect panders ; - these are integral , not incidental . A lapse of integrity , an act of successful fraud accomplished with consummate skill , is infinitely more detestable than the temporary abuse of any natural appetite , for it argues the deliberate perversion of the higher faculties  --  a hopeless barrenness of noble feeling . I know that many will not consent to such a broad distinction between the mind and the heart ; ideas , say they , are hut feelings shaped into thought . But such metaphysical niceties have nothing to do with our present purpose . Everyone is conscious of a power within him which reasons , judges , and infers , and other and far different capacities , whose office it is to awaken , impel , and fill him with emotions . Now I think it can not be denied that the reasoning powers are too frequently cultivated with us , at the expense of those fine sensibilities and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Puritan origin , the formality of our system of education , the reserve of our social intercourse , the calculating habits of our national character-all tend to repress in the young the earnest flow of their hearts ; they early acquire a false shame at the expression of feeling , and come to regard the least manifestation of natural ardor as undignified and weak . And thus the saylug // of one of the commentators on our country is verified-our climate has no spring and our people no youth . One often recalls the exclamation of the afflicted parent depicted by Shakspeare , to his officious consoler , " I prithee , peace -I will be flesh and blood . " The brave Marquis of Posa in Schiller 's Don Carlos , in his bold and generous appeal to the cruel Philip , exclaims , " In your great system , suffer souls to ripen ! " One is inclined to urge the same plea upon tho*e who are so active in their cares for the New England mind . The cares of life and the scenes of competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do enough to indurate and pervert the fountains of the heart . Let not our theory of life , our practical philosophy , second the process which circumstances already sufficiently ensure . The vividness and strength of early impressions every one has realized . They color our whole after lot . Now , it is remarkable that , acknowledged as this truth universally is , its actual influence upon education is so slight . The impression which the child receives will be indissolubly associated with all his future experience . Should it not then be more a matter of conscience with parents and teachers to minister to the happiness of childhood , to reverence its freedom , instead of following the example of the sagacious man who clipped the wings of his bees and selected for them such flowers as he chose ? Let us refrain from stamping any stern or dark impression upon the young heart , that it may meet the problem of life in a fresh and original spirit . The discipline to which we are subject in early life , however kindly intended , too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our spiritual destiny . Byron breaks off in the midst of his glorious lay inspired by classic scenes , to lament the forced teaching of his youth , which embittered the pages of Horace for ever to his taste ; and how many New Englanders , from a similar cause , have the painful associations of a task connected with the best of books , and the gloomiest sense of restraint associated with the holiest of days ! We laugh at the impatient child who daily digs up the seed to see if it has sprouted , and are content to supply good soil to the plant and leave it to the free air , the soft dew , and the balmy sunshine ; why are we less just to the soul ? To guard it from evil , and to meet its wants as far as we can , is indeed our duty ; but a higher power has already ordained its capacities ; to them we can neither add nor take away . Let us show some veneration for God 's holy work , and leave it more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exclusive faith in reason is that it disposes us to repose entiroly upon rules , to act too constantly upon arbitrary principles , till the mechanical triumphs over the spiritual , and mere habit usurps the place of the spontaneous . Now I do not deny that rules have their utility , that in a world of vicissitude certain laws of action must be , to some extent at least , adopted , and that fixed principles are the best security to virtue . But this admission does not justify the dogged attachment to certain maxims which is so often boasted of as the distinction of New England philosophy . Constant reference to precise rules indicates the novice . The artist , at first , is continually measuring , but as his eye becomes practised , he confides in its accuracy . Au instinct developes within him more certain than the dictum of science . And thus the soul outgrows maxims and becomes spontaneously progressive and true . With many votaries of the rational system , I believe , the great idea of improvement consists in nothing more than adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not even go thus far , hut are chiefly anxious to abide by those they have already acquired . The direct tendency of this feature of time prevalent philosophy is to lead a man , particularly one of passive temperament , to entrench himself in a set of fixed laws , as if the goal of progress was reached , the great end of life achieved . lIe has established a certain theory of dietetics , a certain system of expense , has chosen a set of companions , and adopted a certain political and religious creed , and now all that remains for him is to abide by all these rules , and thus realize Burns ' picture : O ye douce folk , that live by rule , Grave , tideless-blooded , calm and cool , Compared wi ' you-O fool ! fool ! fool ! How much unlike ! Your hearts arc just a standing pool , Your lives a dyke ! // and to progress . The pursuit of truththe highest vocation of man-is thus foreclosed ; the exercise of generous sympathies-that dearest of human privileges-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an apostate from the true faith of humanity . He has relinquished the real glory of his nature . The future is deuuded of hope to his fixed gaze , and his heart beats only in monotonous echoes to the slow and weary footsteps of time . A work of art is said to be perfect in proportion as it does not remind the spectator of the process by which it was created ; so a character is delightful as we lose all sense of its training in the love of its spontaneous excellences . Let us recognize the beauty and power of true enthusiasm ; and whatever we may do to enlighten ourselves and others , guard against checking or chilling a single earnest sentiment . For what is the human mind , however enriched with acquisitions or strengthened by exercise , unaccompanied by an ardent and sensitive heart ? Its light may illumine , but it can not inspire . It may shed a cold and moon-light radiance upon the path of life , but it warms no flower into bloom ; it sets free no icebound fountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationality prevented him from being a papist . Does not the same cause prevent many of us from unburthening our hearts and breathing our devotions at the shrines of nature ? There are influences which environ humanity too subtle for the dissecting knife of reason . In our better moments we are clearly conscious of their presence , and if there is any barrier to their blessed agency , it is a formalized intellect . Enthusiasm , too , is the very life of gifted spirits . Ponder the lives of the glorious in art or literature through all ages . What are they but records of toils and sacrifices supported by the earnest hearts of their votaries ? Dante composed his immortal poem amid exile and suffering , prompted by the noble ambition of vindicating himself to posterity ; and the sweetest angel of his paradise is the object of his early love . The best countenances the old painters have bequeathed to us are those of cherished objects intimately associated with their fame . The face of Raphael 's mother blends with the angelic beauty of all his Madennas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again meet in their works . Well does Foscolo call the fine arts the children of Lore . The deep interest with which the Italians hail gifted men , inspires them to the mightiest efforts . National enthusiasm is the great nursery of genius . When Cellini 's statue of Perseus was first exhibited on the Piazza at Florence , it was surrounded for days by an admiring throng , and hundreds of tributary sonnets were placed upon its pedestal . Petrarch was crowned with laurel at Rome for his poetical labors , and crowds of the unlettered may still be seen on the Mole at Naples , listening to a reader of Tasso . Reason is not the only interpreter of life . The fountain of action is in the feelings . Religion itself is but a state of the affections . I once met a beautiful peasant woman in the valley of the Arno , and asked the number of her children . " I have three here and two in paradise , " she calmly replied , with a tone and manner of touching and grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as human nature is , it is in the highest degree natural that rare powers should be excited by voluntary and spontaneous appreciation . Who would not feel urged to high achievement , if he knew that every beauty his canvass displayed , or every perfect note he breathed , or every true inspiration of his lyre , would find an instant response in a thousand breasts ? Lord Brougham calls the word " impossible " the mother-tongue of little souls . What , I ask , can counteract self-distrust , and sustain the higher efforts of our nature but enthusiasm ? More of this element would call forth the genius , and gladden the life of New England . While the mere intellectual man speculates , and the mere man of acquisition cites authority , the man of feeling acts , realizes , puts forth his complete energies . His earnest and strong heart will not let his mind rest ; he is urged by an inward impulse to embody his thought . He must have sympathy ; he must have results . And nature yields to the magician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from the marble , the speaking figure stands out from the canvass , the electric chain is struck in the bosoms of his fellows . They receive his ideas , respond to his appeal , and reciprocate his love . Constant supplies of knowledge to // the intellect , and the exclusive culture of reason may , indeed , make a pedant and logician ; but the probability is , these benefits , if such they are , will be gained at the expense of the soul . Sentiment , in its broadest acceptation , is as essential to the true enjoyment and grace of life as mind . Technical information , and that quickness of apprehension which New Englanders call smartness , are not so valuable to a human being as sensibility to the beautiful , and a spontaneous appreciation of the divine influences which fill the realms of vision and of sound , and the world of action and feeling . The tastes , affections and sentiments , are more absolutely the man than his talent or acquirements . And yet it is by and through the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are at best but fragmentary evidences . It is remarkable that , in tho New Testament alInsinus to the intellect are so rare , while the " heart " and the " spirit we are of " are ever appealed to . Sympathy is the " golden key " which unlocks the treasures of wisdom ; and this depends upon vividness and warmth of feeling . It is therefore that Tranio advises- " In brief sir , study what you most affect . " A code of etiquette may refine the manners , but the " heart of courtesy , " which , through the world , stamps the natural gentleman , can never be attained but through instinct ; and in the same manner , those enriching and noble sentiments which are the most beautiful and endearing of human qualities , no process of mental training will create . To what end is society , popular education , churches , and all the machinery of culture , if no living truth is elicited which fertilizes as well as enlightens ?

It was under the excitement of wonder and love , that Byron tossed on the lake of Geneva , thought that " Jura answered from her misty shroud , " responsive to the thunder of the Alps With no eye of mere curiosity did Br/ant follow the lonely flight of the Water-fowl . Veneration prompted the inquiry , " Whither midst falling dew , When glow the heavens with the last steps of day , Far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue Thy solitary way ? " Sometimes , in musing upon genius in its simpler manifestations , it seems as if the great art of human culture consisted chiefly in preserving the glow and freshness of the heart . It is certain that in proportion as its merely mental strength and attainment takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire the habit of receiving all impressions through the reason , the teachings of Nature grow indistinct arid cold , however it may be with those of books . That this is the tendency of the New England philosophy of life and education , I think can scarcely be disputed . I have remarked that some of our most intelligent men speak of mastering a subject , of comprehending a book , of settling a question , as if these processes involved the whole idea of human cultivation . The reverse of all this is chiefly desirable . It is when we are overcome , and the pride of intellect vanquished before the truth of nature , when , instead of coming to a logical decision , we are led to bow in profound reverence before the mysteries of life , when we are led back to childhood , or up to God , by some powerful revelation of the sage or minstrel , it is then our natures grow . To this end is all art . Exquisite vocahism , beautiful statuary and painting , and all true literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prying critics , or furnish the world with a set of new ideas , hut to move the whole nature by the perfection and truthfulness of their appeal . There is a certain atmosphere exhaled from the inspired page of genius , which gives vitality to the sentiments , and through these quickens the mental powers . And this is the chief good of books . Were it otherwise , those of us who have had memories might despair of advancement . I have heard educated New Englanders boast of the quantity of poetry they have read in a given time , as if rich fancies and elevated thoughts are to be dispatched as are beefsteaks on board our steamboats . Newspapers are estimated by // their number of square feet , as if this had anything to do with the quality of their contents . Journeys of pleasure are frequently deemed delightful in proportion to their rapidity , without reference to the new scenery or society they bring into view . Social gatherings are not seldom accounted brilliant in the same degree that they are crowded . Such would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affective powers , were enough considered ; if the whole soul , instead of the " meddling intellect " alone was freely developed ; if we realized the truth thus expressed by a powerful writer- " within the entire circle of our intellectual constitution , we value nothing but emotion ; it is not the powers , but the fruit of those powers , in so much feeling of a lofty kind as they will yield . " One of the most obvious consequences of these traits appears in social intercourse . Foreigners have ridiculed certain external habits of Americans ; but these were always confined to the few , and where most prevalent have yielded readily to censure . There are incongruities of manners still more objectionable , because the direct exponents of character and resulting from the philosophy of life . Delicacy and selfrespect are the fruits , not so much of intellect as sensibility . We are considerate towards others in proportion as our own consciousness gives us insight . The sympathies are the best teachers of politeness ; and these are ever blunted by an exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find educated New Englanders unconsciously invading the privacy of others , to indulge their idle curiosity , or giving a personal turn to conversation in a way that outrages all moral refinement . This is observable in society professedly intellectual . It is scarcely deemed rude to allude to one 's personal appearance , health , dress , circumstances , or even most sacred feelings , although neither intimacy nor confidence lend the slightest authority to the proceeding . Such violation of what is due to others , is more frequently met with among the cultivated of this than any other country . It is comparatively rare here to encounter a natural Jan. gentleman . A New England philosopher , in a recent work , * betrays no little fear of " excess of fellowship . " In the region he inhabits there is ground for the apprehension . No standard of manners will correct the evil . The peasantry of Southern Europe , and the most ignorant Irishwomen often excel educated New Englanders in genuine courtesy . Their richer feelings teach them how to deal with others . Reverence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallowed avenues through which alone true souls come together . The cool satisfaction with which character is analysed and defined in New Englund , is an evidence of the superficial test which observation alone affords . A Yankee dreams not of the world which is revealed only through sentiment . Men , and especially women , shrink from unfolding the depths of their natures to the cold and prying gaze which aims to explore them only as an intellectual diversion . It is the most presumptuous thing in the world , for an unadulterated New Englander , however cute and studious , to pretend to know another human being , if nobly endowed ; for he is the last person to elicit latent and cherished emotions . lie may read mental capacities and detect moral tendencies , but no familiarity will unveil the inner temple ; only in the vestibule will his prying step be endnred . Another effect of this exaggerated estimate of intellect is , that talent and character are often regarded as identical . This is a fatal but very prevalent error . A gift of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soul . Training , or native skill , will enable any one to excel in the machinery of expression . The phrase-artistical , whether in reference to statuary , painting , literature , or manners , implies only aptitude and dexterity . Who is not aware , for instance , of the vast difference between a merely scientific knowledge of music and that enlistment of the sympathies in the art which makes it the eloquent medium of passion , sentiment and truth ? And in literature , how often do we find the most delicate perception of beauty in the writer , combined with a total want of * Emerson 's Essays , 2d Series . New England Philosophy . // genuine refinement in the man ! Art is essentially imitative ; and its value , as illustrative of character , depends not upon the mental endowments , but upon the moral integrity of the artist . The idea of talent is associated more or less with the idea of success ; and on this account , the lucrative creed of the New Englander recognizes it with indiscriminate admiration ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human bosom , of more celestial temper . It is a nobler and a happier thing to be capable of self-devotion , loyalty , and generous sympatbies , to cherish a quick sense of honor and find absolute comfort only in being lost in another , than to have an eye for color , whereby the rainbow can be transferred to canvass , or a felicity of diction that can embalm the truest pictures in immortal numbers . Not only or chiefly in what he does , resides the significance of a human being . His field of action and the availability of his powers depend upon health , education , self-reliance , position , and a thousand other agencies ; what he is results from the instincts of his soul , and for these alone he is truly to be loved . It is observable among New Englanders , that an individual 's qualities are less frequently referred to as a test of character than his performances . It is very common for them to sacrifice social and private to public character , friendship to fame , sympathy to opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is an obvious disposition among them to appraise men arid women at their market rather than their intrinsic value . A lucky speculation , a profitable invention , a saleable book , an effective rhetorical effort , or a sagacious political ruse-some fact which proves , at best , only adroitness and good fortune , is deemed the best escutcheon to lend dignity to life , or hang as a lastino* memorial upon the tomb . Those more intimate revelations and ministries which deal with the inmost gifts of mind , and warmest emotions of the heart , and through which alone love and truth are realized , are but seldom dreamt of in their philosophy . There is yet another principle which seems to me but faintly recognized in the New England philosophy of life , however it may be occasionally cultivated as a department of literature ; and yet it is one which we should deem essentially dear to man , a glorious enVOL . XVI. - NO . LXXIX. 7 dowment , a crowning grace of humanity . It is that principle through which we commune with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellows the pictures of memory into pensive beauty , and irradiates the visions of hope with unearthly brightness ; which elevates our social experience by the glow of fancy , and exhibits scenes of perfection to the soul that the senses can never realize . It is the poetical principle . If this precious gift could be wholly annihilated amid the commonplace and the actual , we should lose the interest of life . The dull routine of daily experience , the tame reality of things , would weigh like a heavy and permanent cloud upon our hearts . But the office of this divine spirit is to throw a redeeming grace around the objects and the scenes of being . It is the breeze that lifts the weeds on the highway of time and brings to view the violets beneath . It is the holy water which , sprinkled on the Mosaic paveument of life , makes vivid its brilliant tints . It is the mystic harp upon whose strings the confused murmur of toil , gladness and grief , loses itself in music . But it performs a yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetical principle that we form images of excellence , a notion of progress that quickens every other faculty to rich endeavor . All great men are so chiefly through unceasing effort to realize in action , or embody in art , sentiments of deep interest or ideas of beauty . As colors exist in rays of light , so does the ideal in the soul , and life is the mighty prism which refracts it . Shelley maintains that it is only through the imagination that we can overleap the barriers of self and become identified with the universal and the distant , and , therefore , that this principle is the true fountain of benevolent affections and virtue . I know it is sometimes said that the era of romance has passed ; that with the pastoral , classic , and chivalrous periods of the world , the poetic element died out . But this is manifestly a great error . The forms of society have greatly changed , and the methods of poetical development are much modified , but the principle itself is essential to humanity . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wide as is the empire of utility , as long as the stars appear nightly in the firmament , and golden clouds // gather around the departing sun ; as long as we can greet the innocent smile of infancy and the gentle eye of woman ; as long as this earth is visited by visions of glory and dreams of love and hopes of heaven ; while life is encircled by mystery , brightened by affection and solemnized by death , so long will the poetical spirit be abroad , with its fervent aspirations and deep spells of enchantment . Again , it is often urged that the poetical spirit belongs appropriately to a certain epoch of life , and that its influence naturally ceases with youth . But this can only be the case through self-apostasy . The poetical element was evidently intended to mingle with the whole of human experience ; not only to glow in the breast of youth , but to dignify the thought of manhood , and make venerable the aspect of age . Its purpose clearly is to relieve the sternness of necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacredness and hope even around suffering-as the old painters were wont to depict groups of cherubs above their martyrdoms . Nor can I believe that the agency of this principle is so confined and temporary as many suppose . It is true our contemplation of the beautiful is of short duration , our flights into the ideal world brief and occasional . We can but bend in passing at the altar of beauty , and pluck a flower hastily by the way-side ;  --  but may there not be an instinct which eagerly appropriates even these transitory associations ? May they not be unconsciously absorbed into the essence of our life , and gradually refine and exalt the spirit within us ? I can not think that such rich provision for the poetic sympathies is intended for any casual or indifferent end . Rather let us believe there is a mystic language in the flowers , and a deep meaning in the stars , that the transparency of the winter air and the long sweetness of summer twilight pass , with imperceptible power , over the soul ; rather let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sweet excitement of adventure , and the impassioned solemnity of grief , with a kind of spiritual chemistry , combine and purify the inward elements into nobler action and more perfect results . Of the poetical principle , the philosophy of life in New England makes little account . Emblems of the past do not invite our gaze down the vistas of time . Reverence is seldom awakened by any object , custom , or association . The new , the equal , the attainable , constantly deaden our faith in infinite possibilities . Life rarely seems miraculous , and the common-place abounds . There is much to excite , and little to chasten and awe . We need to see the blessedness of a rational conservatism , as well as the inspiring call for reform . There are venerable and lovely agencies in this existence of ours which it is sacrilege to scorn . The wisdom of our renowned leaders in all departments is too restless and conscious to be desirable ; and it would be better for our boasted " march of mind , " if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dragged along in the procession . " An extravagant spirit of utility invades every scene of life however sequestered . We attempt not to brighten the grim features of care , or relieve the burdens of responsibility . The daughter of a distinguished law professor in Europe wa* in the habit of lecturing in her father 's absence . To guard against the fascination of her charms , which it was feared would divert the attention of the students , a curtain was drawn before the fair teacher , from behind which she imparted her instructions . Thus do we carefully keep out of sight the poetical and veil the spiritof beauty , that we may worship undisturbed at the shrine of the practical . We ever seek the light of knowledge ; but are content that no fertilizing warmth lend vitality to its beams .

But what the arrangements of society fail to provide , the individual is at liberty to seek . Nowhere are natural // beauty and grandeur more lavishly displayed than on this continent . In no part of the world are there such noble rivers , beautiful lakes and magnificent forests . The ermine rohe of winter is , in no land , spread with more dazzling effect , nor can the woodlands of any clime present a more varied array of autumnal tints . Nor need we resort to the glories of the universe alone . Domestic life exists with us in rare perfection ; and it requires but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the fireside as rich in poetical associations as the terrace and verandah of Southern lands . Literature , too , opens a rich field . We can wander through Eden to the music of the blind bard 's harp , or listen in the orange groves of Verona , beneath the quiet moonlight , to the sweet vows of Juliet . Let us , then , bravely obey our sympathies , and find in candid and devoted relations with others , freedom from the constraints of prejudice and form . Let us foster the enthusiasm which exclusive intellectual cultivation would extinguish . Let us detach ourselves sufficiently from the social machinery to realize that we are not integral parts of it ; and thus summon into the horizon of destiny those hues of beauty , love and truth , which are the most glorious reflections of the soul@@184091442.txt Ix the following brief notice of this celebrated actor , the reader must not expect to find anything like a complete biography .

They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist himself and of their relation to his career , or their influence upon his character . Moreover , neither he himself nor any friend competent to the task , has given the world a history of him sufficiently in detail to do him justice . Even Rellstab , from whose account this sketch is taken , has only thrown together the information gathered at different times , when chance brought him into the society of // IDevrient , who often related , with simplicity and ingenuousness , occurrences of his past life . We must content ourselves , therefore , with a meagre outline ; by which we may obtain , however , some faint impression of the features of one whose name is not the less immortal , that his greatness in hi* peculiar art can not be perpetuated in marble , or on the speaking canvas . Louis DEYRIENT was born in Berlin on the 15th day of December , 1784 . His father belonged to the mercantile class , and destined him for the same business : he was sent to Potsdam to learn the trade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . He did what many other boys of genius , oppressed by the authority of superiors , have done-ran away from home , determined to seek his own fortune in the great world . He arrived in Berlin hungry and thirsty , having had no breakfast ; and was fain to drink the beer which had stood in the glasses since the preceding day . After this first experience of the troubles of independence , he made his way to Charlottesburg , where a friend of his father succeeded in inducing him to return home , having undertaken to bring about a reconciliation . This occurred when he was about ten or twelve years of age . It made him rather more careful in future ; but the causes of his discontent still existed ; and as his faculties developed with years , he became resolved to put an end to the struggle by escaping from his constraint . He had long determined to embrace the life of an actor . He did so , in 1803 ; and it was at Gera , in the company of Lange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He appeared under the name of Herzberg ; and thus went with the company to Naumberg , Zeitz , Rudolstadt , and other small towns in the neighborhood , till some time after he formed his first engagement in the theatre at Dessau . No details have been preserved of this important period in the life of our artist . During his abode with the strolling company , the scenes he passed through must have presented a strange intermixture of the richest romance with the boldest reality . How interesting would his own memoirs of these times have been ! Only one or two anecdctes have been retained by his friend 's recollection ; and these owe their interest chiefly to the droll , graphic and original manner in which they were related by the actor himself , over a bottle of wine . " We had passed , " he said on one occasion , " through several of the small towns with our company , and obtained great applause , but marvellous little money . In fact , we fared very scantily , and whenever , in the representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be served , the appearance of luxury was even more hollow and deceitful than usual . XVe sat down with craving stomachs at a table covered with paste-board dishes , and poured from empty flasks into our pewter cups . When , in the height of revelry , we had to drink to each other , our glasses were filled with colored water , or cold tea , instead of the Rhine-wine that should inspire is . Quite accustomed to these economical shifts , we were at length engaged to play at the castle theatre in R- , the capital of the Prince de R- . Among other pieces , " The Robbers " was to be represented . Everything required for the performance was furnished by the prince 's steward , who delivered the articles to the manager of our company . We had at that time a tragedy hero with a tremendous bass ; his throat was used to beer and brandy , and he could empty a can of Merseburger at a single draught . When he played at drinking irom an empty bottle on the stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imaginary liquor , the satisfied drawing of his breath as he stopped , deceived the spectators admirably . This night he appeared in the part of Karl Moor ; and called for wine after his first wild and passionate scene , with stentorian voice , striding up and down the stage in all the terrible energy of his part . An immense goblet was brought to him , filled with wine , a circumstance quite as unexpected by him as any of the rest of us . Without looking at it . he took it from the hands of the attendant , and gazing the while earnestly on 8pielberg ( it was in his part to drink in this abstracted manner ) brought the goblet to his large mouth , opened to receive its contents . But no sooner had he tasted the nectar within , than , forgetting his part , the theatre , the audience , and the royal box filled with persons intent on his performance , // he suddenly changed countenance , started back , and shouted to Spielberg " By jingo ! this is real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the read- er could have heard the actor 's description of the comic scene that ensued , his picture of the confusion of the dramatists , and the amusement of the audience , he would have thought it a capital farce in itself . Another anecdote he used to tell with much humor , as follows : - " We had for a stage director a stiW pedantic old fellow , who looked down on us lads with as much haughtiness as the Emperor of China on European sailor-boys . So confident was he in his own dignity , that he might he quizzed to his face , for the suspicion that he was laughed at would never enter his head . I was an exception , and often teased him with ironical questions , which he would never notice but with the most elaborate contempt . " We were still at Castle R- , and the stage director availed himself of the facilities afforded him without scruple in asking . One night a new play was to be represented , and he made unusually large demands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard all . And finally , my excellent lord-steward , ' concluded he , ' I must ask a great favor of you . I saw yesterday , while the dishes were being carried from the Prince 's table , a magnificent silver salt-cellar ; can you lend it to me ? I pledge myself that it shall not be lost . ' At these words , the old man threw a contemptuous look at me , as if he would have added-that worthless lad shall have no chance of stealing it . That old-fashioned salt-cellar ! ' cried the steward , surprised . What can you want with that ? It is big as the Strasburg Cathedral ; I will procure you another , a more elegant one . ' Oh no , my friend ! ' interrupted the director ; 1 must have that one , and no ether . Its size fills the eye , and will produce a fine effect . ' Very well , ' answered the steward , if you have need of the thing , it is at your service . ' I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt-cellar , but was convinced that there was some piece of folly behind it all , and felt unwilling to share the public ridicule with him ; I therefore stepped up to him , and asked very modestly how the splendid salt-cellar was to be used in the piece . The old man frowned at me , and said shortly , I shall know how to use it . ' With this answer he turned away haughtily , muttering something about the curiosity and forwardness of youngsters . I was forced to be content . The performance came on , and all went off admirably . We obtained great applause . The director played the part of a count , who tyrannized over his beautiful daughter ; I was the secretary , her lover . In the third act we were discovered ; at the catastrophe the daughter falls senseless , and the father calls to the attendants- ' Salts , salts ! the countess is in a swoon Scarcely had he pronounced the words , when I comprehended what was to follow , though I had no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , carrying the salt-cellar , as tall as a tower , upon a waiter . The count probably intended sprinkling his unconscious daughter with its contents . But the immense salt-cellar , which had been an heirloom in the Prince 's family , and always adorned his table , was instantly recognized by everybody . Such peals of laughter arose from pit and boxes , as were absolutely deafening ; and the chamberlain who carried the waiter , supposing himself the object of such uproarious mirth , let fall the salt-cellar , and scampered in a fright off the stage . " The first considerable theatre on which Devrient appeared , was that of Breslan . Here his genius began to develop itself ; and the fire of his early youth was tempered by the results of study and experience . His favorable reception , and the propitious external circumstances that attended his performances , contributed to nourish self-confidence . He felt that he was destined to be , not merely a clever or fortunate , but a great artist . Not that he was spared those inward strugglesthose alternations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every gifted mind . But , on the whole , he gained a standing in Breslan , where his early aspirations began to be realized . The proof of his rising greatness lay not merely in the continued and increasing esteem , amounting to enthusiasm , which he won from a large and discerning public ; he had now opportunity to measure himself by distinguished contemporaries , who trod the same path , and whom he had once looked upon as unapproachable . The comparison did not // discourage him . IFFLAND came to 3reslau ; came repeatedly , and appeared in many of his best parts , in which Devrient had also distinguished himself . In spite of the fame that went before this artist ; in spite of the splendor in which , being regarded as at the head of the theatre of the capital , he appeared on a provincial stage , the public , at his first appearance , compared Devrient with him , and did not decide between the two candidates for their favor . This trial tested the strength of the youthful aspirant ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own powers ; and from this moment the exulting sentence of his heart was " Anch ' io son ' *ilhiore ! " The testimony of numerous contemporaries assures us of Devrient 's triumph at this period . But still more conclusive is the fact that Jifiand himself feared the growing renown of his rival . He would not invite him to play at Berlin , though Devrient desired nothing so much as to appear in his native city and before the friends of his boyhood . Iffland must not be condemned ; it was painful to him to see the eminence he had gained by toil , arid held so long , disputed by another . He afterwards made amends for his injustice . He would not suffer himself to be dethroned by a youthful artist , so long as bis hands could hold the sceptre ; but so soon as his own strength declined , he fixed upon him as his successor , and yielded to him the place of authority . It was Iffland , who , towards the close of his life , procured for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus in a manner restored the long exiled son to all the rights of birth as an artist . How affecting is this proof of devoted attachment to his art , in one about to leave the world ! How mournfully is the thought forced on our minds , that the glory of a great actor , though its splendor may illuminate a world of his contemporaries-is as evanescent as splendid ! that he can leave no monument to posterity ! Iffland felt this truth ; and sought to perpetuate his renown by finding a worthy representative , who should still animate his picturesque creations . Happy was he , that he found a successor ; but on whom has fallen the mantle of Devrient ? Beside the hoary tree stood then a vigorous sapling , crowned with luxuriant verdure ; this now is stricken down , and who can tell if the barren winter shall ever again give place to spring Iffiand died in the autumn of 1814 ; in April of 1815 , Devrient appeared in the character of Franz Moor , on the Berlin stage . Long will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character difihrently from all his predecessors ; it diff*red from the representation of Iffland ; nay , from the conception of Schiller himself He improved upon the poet 's thought . When Schiller threw off his gigantic work , he was carried away too much by feeling and imagination , to permit himself to weigh the results of this ferment of his genius in the scale of reason . It may not be amiss should we endeavor to give some idea of Devrient 's personation of this part . Always careful in his costume , he was here particularly so . In the first act he wore a dark under dress and doublet , ornamented with gold embroidery ; and a dark crimson Spanish cloak , with a white collar . His neck appeared long and bare ; and the contour of his features , the fire of his eyes , shaded by thick bushy brows , and even the arrangement of his hair , accorded with his peculiar conceptions of the character . There was all the terrible energy of wickedness ; but he preserved our respect by the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versatile skill displayed in his hypocritical humility . There was no trace of that disgusting self-prostration , which other players have introduced into this part . As long as the scene with old Moor and Amalia continues , where Franz plays the hypocrite , the spectator remains in painful suspense , not knowing what is to come of these deceitful smiles , and this soft affected sympathy . Then Franz is alone ; he breaks into a laugh that causes the inmost soul to shudder , and flings mockery after his father , whom he has just led to the door with assumed respect . The mask falls , and the monster stands before us ; not the contemptible , degraded being some have conceived , but a dreadful image , armed with steel and poisonthe Medusa of the drama-that turns the gazer to stone . This impression of terror , with a glimpse of the power Franz so passionately craves , and so fearfully uses-forms the ground - work of Devrient 's representation . It is // difficult to give an idea of the effect of the first monologue , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole house ; expectation spoke in every face ; every one held his breath , anxious not to lose a word or look of the actor . He spoke in a voice half-suppressed : the words seemed but half to escape from his involuntary agitation . All his action was rapid and passionate , but betrayed internal excitement rather than displayed it . Only a few words were uttered with all the brazen strength of his voice ; but the expression uf passion was instantly che*ked , as if he was terrified at himself-and lost in the angry stamp of his foot . Still fascinated with terror , though breathing more freely , the spectators gazed after him as he left the stage with the resolve of unprincipled ambition on his lips . It is not necessary to follow the actor scene by scene through the piece , or to observe how admirably he carried on his conception to the close . But a few points may be noticed in which his looks and tones can never be forgotten by those who have witnessed them . For instance , his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - when the mask falls before his father . Here he stood with clenched hand , every muscle rigid as iron ; his look was lightning , his voice the thunder ; demoniac rage glared in his distorted features . No wonder that the old man shrinks back with a feeble cry of horror , before such a picture . As powerful , though quite different , is the horror excited in his second monologue , where he harbors the fiendish design against his father 's life . The self-possession , the icy coldness , with which he considers this design , the exultation into which he finally breaks out , are so appalling as to chill every heart . But all this is weak to his representation in the fourth act , where the sight of coming retribution fills us with poetic terror . Our interest is no longer confined to the individual character , claiming sole attention ; we behold the outraged majesty of the moral law , about to crush the miscreant who has despised and sought to destroy it . It would be impossible to give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power with which Devrient in the fourth act shows us the bold villain changed first into the suspicious and finally the fearful , trembling and despairing wretch . A critic of high standing gives the preference to Devrient 's representation over the poet 's , as apprehended by the reader , in this part of the piece , especially . His scenes are as follows : Karl Moor , who is with Amalia , as Count Brand , in the picture gallery , has been standing with her before his own portrait . After both have left the stage , Franz comes on , with these words- " Since the Count has been within these walls , it is as if a spectre of hell followed my steps . " Devrient is wrapped in his cloak , his hand pressed against his forehead , as in deep thought . His whole appearance betrays inward agitation ; and when he removes his hand , and lifts up his face , his distorted features show plainly that the monitor in his breast has begun to make its voice heard . his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his steps falter , and a perceptible shudder at times goes through his frame . He stands before Karl 's picture ; a thousand thoughts crowd upon his brain ; the past and future are connected , and the guilty one feels in his inmost soul the approach of retribution . He calls Daniel , questions him hastily and abstractedly , and at last sends him after Hermann . Now he has time to collect himself , so that he appears not self-betrayed before the accomplice of his wickedness . Deceived hopes of reward , and an awakened conscience , had converted that accomplice into a fearful enemy . the falling out of the two villains is painted in a masterly manner . Franz , conscious of his guilt , begins with flattering words ; Hermann derides him ; the quarrel waxes fierce ; Franz grasps his pistol ; Hermann holds one to his breast . In this moment , Devrient , as an artist , is truly sublime . Rage and hate , fear of his determined foe , and the consciousness of impotence , are seen struggling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands bent with half-averted face , his hand stretched out as if to parry the blow ; glancing furtively over the left shoulder , as if to see if his enemy had really a murderous design , while his right hand , holding the pistol , has fallen powerless , and his knees seem to tremble beneath him . Hermann leaves him thus : but the spectral , avenging // Nemesis remains . Overpowered by his emotion , in which anger preponderates , he sinks into a seat , and the words escape him : " 0 , that thou shouldst have given thy fate into this miscreant 's hand ! Moor , Moor ! T was a fool 's act ! " The manner in which the actor uttered these words , can never be forgotten . He smote his hard hand against his brow-speaking in a tone of bitter rage , half aloud , but which could be heard distinctly in the farthest corner of the house ; " Des war dumrn I " As yet self-reproach for his fatal error overpowers every other feeling ; but at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render that error harmless by a decisive deed . He resolves to murder the Count with his own hand , and hastens on his way . But the measure of his crimes is full ; his strength departs . For the first time , the awful image of conscience rises before him , and lays upon him an icecold hand . Till now she has stood afar off , and beckoned with faint warnings ; now she has seized her victim , and he can not escape . lie suddenly stops while going rapidly off the stage , glances fearfully behind and around him , and pale and shuddering , asks " Who steals there behind me Never has a more admirable portraiture been seen than this of Devrient . Every step , every convulsive motion of the hand , every movement of the head was full of meaning . He throws back hastily his black cloak ( for he wears mourning for his father ) , as if affrighted by its contact . Terrified , he looks around to see if the spectre visibly follows him . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . It is no longer the same person whom we saw a few moments before , bent on a deed of sin ; the face is pale and haggard ; the muscles rigid ; the teeth chatter ; the eyes roll wildly ; the hair seems to rise with horror . He strives to conquer his mortal anguish by strength of will ; his bodily eyes see no spectre , and he would banish it from his mind . He thinks on his meditated crime , and would stifle his terror at thought of the deed itself by an idea of the possibility of failure . " Should he see me in the mirror ! " he mutters . In vain ! all his efforts avail him nothing under the load of guilt that crushes his soul . His limbs only half obey his will ; they totter under him , though his VOL XVL-NO* LXXX , 12 right hand yet grasps the dagger . Thus pale and distorted , he stands in the front of the stage ; he neither stands still nor walks on , but a trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His right hand falls slowly : one finger after another looses its hold on the weapon , till it barely hangs by his side ; and the murmur- " He is my brother ; I will not lay hand upon my brother ! " is wrung from his lips , while his left hand is passed across his forehead , and through his disordered hair . The interest is now at its height ; a deathlike stillness reigns throughout the house . At last the dagger falls with a clash to the ground , and this unexpected sound , which startles even the spectator , unmans the criminal with excess of terror . He starts away , is gone , and the audience sit in breathless suspense , wondering if all has been a dream ; no one venturing , for the first few moments , to interrupt the fearful silence . This is the highest triumph of the artist , and is worth far more than the tumultuous applause that succeeds it . The fifth act begins ; hut though the interest of the drama is not diminished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rule holds good in Art as well as Nature , that the foreboding exceeds the reality . At the close of act fourth , the furies that are soon to seize upon the criminal , are dimly seen through the gloom ; in the fifth , judgment is executed , and our vague horror is exchanged for pain and pity . But Devrient understood his art too well to give the spectator leisure to compare or analyze emotions . Like a pale ghost5 driven by conscience from repose , the criminal rushes through the desolate hall of the castle . His disordered haiA his ashen face , his rigid stare , his treuP bling limbs , reveal the torture of his soul . With difficulty he holds the candlestick in his hand , till old Daniel , awakened by that fearful cry , hastens to support the unhappy man . Franz then tells his dream . To attempt to describe here the varied expression of the actor would be a degree of presumption . No one who has seen , can forget his delineation ; especially the anguish of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rage with which he springs up , stamping his foot // and exclaiming- " I will not pray ! " The poet has here in a manner saved the character from the reproach of weakness and cowardice . Devrient knew how to make use of this point to the greatest effect . The triumph of his art is chiefly seen in the last outbreak of the criminal 's rage , when he is brought in chains before Karl , and sees his judge in his injured brother ; and in the moment when overcome by fear of his impending doom , he throws himself at his feet for mercy . In both these scenes , the physical expression was wonderful . Devrient had remarkable power in this way , and it enabled him to represent with startling effect , scenes in which any other would have appeared ridiculous . For instance , when Franz Moor , bound hand and foot , throws himself prostrate on the ground , that which would have spoiled the tragic effect in the acting of another , heightened it in his , reaching , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a large portion of the effect depends on changes of countenance usually thought beyond the control of the will , Devrient proved himself equally great . The effect of his Franz Moor was beyond imagination . The theatres were always filled to overflowing ; deep stillness prevailed from the moment he appeared on the stage , and the audience became almost indifferent to the other scenes . An English officer at Berlin , in 1818 or 1819 , who knew not a word of the language , witnessed his performance , and was entirely absorbed in the interest of the piece , being able to trace the story by the expressive pantomime of Devrient . He declared that his own country had no actor to compare with him . In his wonderful control over his muscles , no one could equal or imitate him . Another dramatic critic , speaking of Devrient , says : " lie furnishes a proof how much the dramatic poet is dependent on the actor for effect . Devrient made Franz Moor the central character of the piece , to which all the others were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had seen Fleck in Karl Moor some years before , when none could turn their eyes from him to regard any other personage . Yet the part of Franz was then in the hands of no bad actor . " In short , had this great artist appeared in no other character than that we have briefly noticed , it would have remained a monument of his genius in the memory of all who had the good fortune to see him , and of the friends of the drama ; and caused his name to be transmitted with honor to posterity. * It is not admitted that Franz Moor was in all respects the greatest part in which Devrient appeared ; but it was his own , and might he termed an original creation . He differed in this from all his predecessors . Among his other great partswere King Lear , Shylock , the Moor in Fiesco , Richard the Third , Schewa in the " Jews " of Cumberland , with several others in comedy ; all characters in which Iffiand had distinguished himself . Besides these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remembrance . His performance of Lear gave him a wide celebrity . Though he gave this character , as Schroder , Fleck , and Iffland had done before him , that is , according to nature , and Shakspeare 's conception , still it received some coloring from his individuality , as it must with every artist of genius . Devrient here used to great advantage the singular power he possessed , of changing his countenance . In the face of Lear could be read the traces of that passionate vehemence , which had swayed him in youth , and which age had not yet subdued . But in the midst of his passion were gleams of kindness and of feeling . Affection beamed in the eyes that could so readily flash with anger , and spoke from those lips , that had pronounced the soul-appalling curse upon his child . In the whole representation of the old king lay the expression of a gigantic , but shattered strength . In many parts the acting of Devrient had a pathos that moved every heart . For instance , when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast and grasps the golden chain , * In 1843 , a young actor , Doring , had obtained considerable reputation in the part of Franz Moor . His was a reproduction of the creation of Deyrient . Resembling that artist in form and somewhat in feature , he adopted the same style , and revived the recollections of many who saw him in his youth . // the royal ornament , upon his neck ; the convulsive motion , the tinkling of the chain , joined with the expression of irremediable wo in his face , pierce the very heart . At times he would pass his hand wearily over his bald bead , as if striving to wipe off the anguish that oppressed him ! The words - " Let me not he mad ! " accompanied by this action , sent a cold shudder through the breast of the spectator , for he seemed with the unfortunate king to discern the shadowy spectre of madness advancing through the gloom , and about to seize upon its victim . This part was so fatiguing to Devrient , mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but seldom ; and in his later years was so exhausted by it , that he would faint between the acts . In the last years of his life he gave it up altogether . One of the parts in which Devrient deeply affected his audience , but failed to obtain the approbation of the learned critic Tieck , was that of Shylock . He could speak the Jewish dialect in all its varieties . He made use of this talent in Shylock , and so idealized it , that so far from injuring the tragic and poetical effect , it heightened it by keeping the national prejudices and peculiarities of the Jew more vividly before the mind . It was such a distinction as the dark skin of the Moor , continually reminding us that there could be no brotherhood between him and the European . Tieck reproached Devrient with giving the character too much dignity and tragic passion ; it should be , he thought , more skulking , knavish , and crafty . The interest in Devrient 's acting was kept up in spite of the abhorrence his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scene where he is crushed . The most breathless attention prevailed in the house up to the moment when he vanishes from sight ; and then the remaining scenes were heard with impatience , so eager was the audience to call for and thank the great actor for his admirable personation . The character of Richard the Third was long studied by Devrient , and only exhibited by him late in life . With his friend Hofflnann he used to hold conferences about Richard , and how the scenic difficnlties were to be removed . Other friends were also consulted , and their suggestions received by the actor . His personationshowedthe deep thought he had bestowed upon the part . The manner in which he gave the scenes before the last night , was worthy of all praise . The king gives orders , while undoing his armor ; and when it is to be removed , holds it as if involuntarily , on his breast . " I must leave it uncertain , " said Devrient to one of his friends , " if the tyrant is influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his enemies . He feels , however , that his hour is near ; his inward disquiet is betrayed by his gloom and intervals of abstraction . His spirit is already in the battle , of the result of which he begins to be afraid . While they take away his arms , he points out with his sword the position of the forces , and seems to forget all around him . " It was a peculiarity in IDevrient 's personation , that Richard 's loss of his firmness and self-command is dated from the mother 's prophetic curse . He may be right or not ; the thought is a grand one  --  to represent even a Richard , who in his bold villainy had trampled on all sacred relations , forced thus to acknowledge the most sacred of all . " All his drums , " says Devricut , " can not drown the maternal voice : he had heard-he must hear it ; the solemn truth is more powerful than all his delusive arts . " This and other examples may prove to the reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , follow blind impulse in his acting , but carefully weighed and studied the part . We regret that we can not afford space further to examine his personation of this and other tragic characters , in which he has been pronounced , beyond comparison , the first actor Germany has produced . Besides his triumphs in tragedy , Devrient drew from the great mine of Shakspeare 's poetry a character rich in comic humor-Falstaff In this part he was admirable : exhibiting so much grace in his humor , as to lend wings , as it were , to the awkward bulk of his hero . He infused into him a lightness and liveliness of life , such as Shakspeare conceived , and such as only could form the bond of union between the bold-spirited prince , and a being to all outward appearance so entirely his opposite . Leaving Shakspeare , to glance at characters in other dramas , our respect for the actor must increase in propor // tion as it declines for the poet ; for he may be said to have created out of nothing pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforgotten . Among these are some of Kotzebue 's heroes . The tailor Fips he presented with so much life and humor , such droll characteristic behavior , and such a physiognomy , as would have moved an assembly of Areopagites to laughter . As a contrast to this , his personation of the Poor Poet , in which he has filled up all the author 's deficiencies , inimitable in pathos , lives in the recollection of all who witnessed it . Long was the public of Berlin delighted with Devrient 's charming performance in the comedy of " Die Drillinge " of Bonin . It is almost incredi-. ble with what admirable versatility he played in the three parts of the three twin children . His accomplishment in different dialects was here available . His fluency in the commonest Berlin dialects , and the peculiar accent of the various lower classes , was astonishing . This served him often ; for instance , in K6ruer ' s comedy of the " Watchman . " With several other German dialects he was as familiar as if he had learned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this great artist appeared on the stage for the last time , as Schewa in Cumberland 's " Jews . " Both actor and audience seemed to feel a presentiment that their hour of final parting was near . Perhaps this was seen in his evident feebleness of body , which did not , however , lessen the effect of his performance , but , on the contrary , added a characteristic feature to the part he had assumed . The sympathy of the audience was deepened by their knowledge that he had lately suffered under a long illness , from which he was not yet fully recovered . At the close of the piece , he was eagerly called for . It was his custom not to go before the audience in the costume of his part , but to remove his paint , lay aside such portions of his dress as he could in a moment , and appear wrapped in a cloak or upper garment . He did so on this occasion ; and his exhausted looks and enfeebled appearance touched every heart with sorrow . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the assembly for the last time . In sadness he left the theatre that had so often witnessed his triumphs . The flame of his genius flickered , and was about to vanish for ever from the sight of man . A few weeks after came the news of his death . He expired the 30th December . His funeral , on the 2d of January , was attended by a large number of his admirers and friends . Friends bore his corpse to the grave , and it was interred with solemn ceremonies . A monument now stands on the spot where rest his remains . The probability that Devrient 's life was shortened by his habits of intemperance , can not be denied . A great part of the day , and too frequently the night , was often spent in drinking with his friends . But his indulgence never assimilated him to the coarseness and profligacy of other revellers . He was always the man of refinement , and the gentleman ; though his social spirits and good humor were enlivened by the stimulus of wine ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his nature to enter into the spirit of his boon companions ; he would converse freely with those who spoke on the subject of art , and jest with those disposed to fun . There was a time in Berlin , when a house of entertainment , from being frequented by himself and Hoffmann , acquired such celebrity that it was visited by crowds of citizens and strangers , eager to see the two famous men . Some listened to their conversation at a distance , while some were so fortunate as to obtain a seat at the same table . Many will remember seeing them both , night after night , after the play was over , at Lutter and Wegener 's , where Devrient always had a place reserved for him , after having played perhaps in Lear or Franz Moor . " That is he , " was murmured from table to table , as he entered and took his seat by his friend . The flow of wine let loose the fountains of wit and humor . Hoffmann would use his weapon of satire with merciless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre , concertsall furnished materials . Devrient 's good humor would parry the strokes ; jest would call forth jest , and missiles of wit would be exchanged . Then Hoffmann , who was a ready draughtsman , would take his pencil and sketch caricatures , with which to illustrate his sarcasms . Many of these drawings are preserved , in a collected book , and shown as curiosities . Rellstab , the // biographer of Devrient , used often to be present at these meetings , and records , to the credit of his hero , that , even when Hoffmann 's satire spared not even those present , Devrient never was heard to ridicule those whose envious intrigues caused him inconvenience . He always spoke of them with forbearance and patience , never indulging even in a good-humored joke at their expense . Lutter and Wegener 's establishment became the talk of the whole city , for seldom an evening passed that some piece of wit , or humorous incident , was not reported from it . One little anecdote , for instance , is mentioned of a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supped there . A new theatre was building , and the work proceeded with the customary slowness of the Berlin masons . Devrient and his companions often observed the work through the windows , with equal mirth and vexation . One morning they saw a workman standing on the brick wall , who looked about him as if quite at leisure , and at length slowly drew a snuff-box from his pocket . The phlegmatic ease of his whole manner amused the spectators , and Devrient cried , " I will lay a wager , I can drink a flask of champagne before that fellow , with box in his hand , takes his pinch of snuff ! " The wager was accepted ; Karl flew to the cellar for the wine ; in a moment the cork flies , and I ) evrient tosses off the first foaming glass . The company look from him to the mason , and watch his movements . He taps with two fingers on the box ; the second glass gces down ; he opens the lid , the third glass is emptied ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers ; the flask is already half emptied . " Lost ! lost ! " exclaim the other betters in triumph . The mason holds the pinch in his fingers , looks listlessly around him and yawns ; an acquaintance comes up ; he offers him the box , which is as coolly received ; and stands talking for a moment , the pinch still in his fingers ; - Devrient cries , " I am ready ! " He has won the bet ! The workman , little suspecting how interested the party within the house had been in his movements , now takes the snuff , with a long irispi ration , while the house echoes with the laughter of the company . Another incident is related , concerning Karl , the waiter above-mentioned . Devrient was remiss in settling his accounts . Karl had often reminded him of the debt ; and was , at length , ordered to do so in a manner rather more urgent than usual . Devrient took the bill , and looked at him who had brought it , with his rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had committed some blunder . After the actor had surveyed him thus sternly for some time , he turned to his companions at the table and repeated , in a pathetic tone , the words of King Philip in Don Carlos : " Der Knabe Karl fangt an mir ftirchterlich za werden . " * ' The company burst into a roar of laughter ; the waiter stood a moment embarrassed , and then retired ; and Devrient lived on credit as before . Countless anecdotes could be related out of the life of this actor ; but , besides that we have no space for them , they would lose their spirit unless told with his own vivacity and humor . He used to amuse his friends with many stories of himself , where he had been placed in some comic or ludicrous situation . One of these was his excursion on horseback with a friend , who had persuaded him to ride to Charlottesburg . He found his horse very troublesome , and exchanged with his friend ; but the new nag proved less manageable than the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed ; they ate and drank freely , and gathered strength for the ride back . Devrient by this time believed himself an accomplished horseman . " We went on well , " continued he , " till at length the devil got in both me and the horse . We were passing the country-house of M- , the rich Jew , who was sitting with his family on the piazza . I had drunk enough to fill me with daring ; I fancied myself a first-rate rider , and resolved to have some sport with the Jew . Certain that no one would recognize me in the dark , and least of all on horseback , where no mortal had ever seen me , I rode up to the piazza , put // my head over the balustrade , and bawled out some impertinent nonsense to M- , intending to ride away instantly . My companion , when he saw what I was about , rode ofF at full speed , to escape recognition in such company , for he was an officer . I also gave the spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood stock still . I belabored him with hands and feet . He would not budge a step , but began browsing the roses that came through the railing . Meantime Mr. M- comes forward , with light in hand , and sees a forlorn figure like a soldier condemned to ride the wooden ass . He knew me at once , of course . Good evening , Herr Devrient , ' *said he ; you are just in time , we are sitting down to table ; will you alight and sup with us ! ' I knew not what I did , for the sky and earth seemed to wheel around me ; nor can I remember what I answered to his invitation . I only know that two of his servants took my horse by the bridle , and assisted me to dismount ; and then -J can not tell how-I found myself seated at the table , between Mr. and Madame M- . But I swore never in my life to mount a horse again ! " Candor obliges us to state , that De . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove either a happy or a kind husband . It may easily be understood that the qualities which made him an agreeable companion at the convivial board , did not particularly fit him for domestic life . The nights spent in revelry , for not unfrequently the morning found the company yet assembled , were no preparation for a peaceful day at home . Yet it is not to be supposed that Devrient was essentially incapacitated for quiet home enjoyment ; he was only lacking in stability , and the resolution that could have kept him from excess . With regard to Devrient 's general scholarship and accomplishments , he was thoroughly versed in no particular branch of art , science , or literature ; but had read most of the German , and the best foreign writers , carefully , and showed his own judgment respecting them to be founded on knowledge . His opinion of Hoffmann , to whom he would not allow the praise of being a painter , musician , or a classic , was juster than a friend 's usually is found . In politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local partizan , but as an observer of men , and interested in the fate of nations . His breast was kindled with sympathetic fire , when the spirit of the French people awoke . " One day , " says Rellstab , " we met in the corridor of the opera house ; the Dumb Girl of Portici was to be represented . What brings you to the Opera ? ' I asked , in surprise . He looked at me with flashing eyes , drew his furred cap closer over his brows , folded his cloak about him , and answered in those tones that can only be heard in his tragic parts . The Revolution revives me ! The chase of the sea tyrants ! ' It was a jesting reply ; but it could he seen where its earnest meaning lay . His eyes-his whole look , his tones were most expressive . The great events of July , 1830 , when the flames of freedom burst their prison , and consumed the yoke , and melted the fetters of a nation , rapt his soul also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , as the phmnix rises from her ashes at the call of the Genius of Freedom , beckoning her upward and onward to meridian glory . Here must we close this brief and imperfect sketch of the greatest actor of Germany , with renewed regret that none of his friends have furnished the public with a collection of the many characteristic anecdotes extant , which would constitute even a more faithful personal history than an elaborately written life . " Posterity weaves him no garland ; " says the poet of the actor ; it is therefore doubly the duty of his contemporaries to fix , if possible , the fleeting shadow of his triumph . How feebly can this be done , at best , through the cold medium of words !
