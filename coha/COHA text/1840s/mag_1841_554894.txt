txt THIS is , in many respects , a remarkable book . It is a successful attempt to describe a class of men , and a course of life , which , though familiarly spoken of by most people , and considered as within the limits of civilization , will appear to them now almost as just discovered . To find a new subject in so old a sphere of humanity is something ; and scarcely second to this are the spirit and skill with which it is handled . It seems as if the writer must have been favored with // a special gift lbr his novel enterprise . It is a young sailor 's narrative at the end of his only voyage , it is his first attempt as an author , and ceiiainly the last which , considering his previous condition and pursuits , he could ever have dreamed of making . rhot*gh it was written from a desire and purpose to enlighten peopie as to We state and evils of a seafaring life , though it constantly offers matter for serious reflection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with very humble materials , yet it is as entertaining as a well-contrived fiction , it is as luminous as poetry , and its interest never flags . Thus it is likely to he a standard work in its particular line , at least till it instructs some other adventurer to surpass it . We think we can see , in the good reception it has had , much more than sudden admiration of a novelty ; and in the book itself , much more than the rapid fruit of youthful spirits and fancy . Hard labor is necesary to effect any thing considerable in literature ; and probably few works ever cost more , if we may reckon the toils , sacrifices , and temptations of a common sailor , as a part of his preparation for a memorable narrative of sea life . It is so unpretending in its purpose and tone , that , instead of setting out with commendation and prophecy , it would have been more natural to come at once to what it offers the reader . it may , tl ) en , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the sea really is ; what the life of a mariner is in the merchant service ; and the daily history of all that is going on in the little craft , or stately ship , which is holding its solitary course for months together , in search of commodities for landsmen . The voyage is not undertaken for discoveries , conquests , or any public object whatever . There is nothing grand or brilliant in the idea of a few officers and men in charge of a peaceful vessel , from port to port ; with no further interest in the winds and waters than as they hasten or retard its course ; and looking for nothing so eagerly , as to come to anchor and begin landing a cargo , or taking one on board , that they may make for home again . The writer has no liberty to select picturesque sittiations and aspects , invent interesting personages and incidents , that he may carry his reader into grand adventures of fictitious maritime life . Not that there will ordinarily he any want of facts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description ; but these must come in their // order , and occtipy no more than the place they hold in the series of daily affairs , and in the mind of the writer at the time . Exaggeration or disproportion is , of all things , the most to be shunned . For he is upon a matter of business , of experience ; he is to make us see and feel what is passing . Needless repetition may be avoided , but nothing must be fabricated . These may seem hard conditions , where a man is expected to make an entertaining book . So much the better , if he succeeds . But let us not undervalue realities . All sorts of facts may be so represented as to be dull and unaffecting , for the reason that they are not understood by the storyteller . They are not realities to him , nor yet the occasions of fancy . He tells every thing as if he were counting . His mind has not been active upon his experience ; it makes use of nothing , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . On the other hand , any course of life may have its exciting history to one differently constituted . As to the work before us , it would perish but for its truth , and the truth might perish but for its vivacity . This is the secret , if there be one , of its attraction . Something , no doubt , is to be attributed to the idea one never wholly loses , of a young man , separated from an easy home and liberal studies , and subjecting himself , as a common sailor , to the hardships of a long voyage , and , as it turned out , of the worst sort , - in the hope that an entire change of employment might do something for removing what seemed an incurable weakness of the eyes . The contrast is not without effect upon the reader . The author , too , has not overlooked it . " The change from the tight dress-coat , silk cap , and kid gloves of an undergraduate at Cambridge , to the loose duck trowsers , checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat of a transformation , was soon made , and I supposed that I should pass very well for a jack-tar . But it is impossible to deceive the practised eye in these matters ; and while I supposed myself to be lcoking as salt as Neptune himself I was , no doubt , known for a landsman by every one on board as soon as I hove in sight . A sailor has a peculiar cut to his clothes , and a way of wearing them which a green hand can never get . The trowsers , tight round the hips , and thence hanging long and loose round the feet , a superabundance of checked shirt , a low-crowned , well-varnished black hat , worn // on the back of the head , with half a fathom of black ribbon hanging over the left eye , and a peculiar tie to the black silk neckerchief , with sundry other minutim , are signs , the want of which betray the beginner at once . Beside the points in my dress , which were out of the way , doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular salt , who , with a sunburnt cheek , wide step , and rolling gait , swings his bronzed and toughened hands athwart-ships , half open , as though just ready to grasp a rope . " - pp. 6 , 7 . Besides tbe circumstances of the writer , the novelty , the originality of his subject is , as we have already remarked , a part of its attraction . Most readers have hut a vague idea of life at sea , though every one has his dream , as he has about every strange thing that falls to another . A boy , born and bred in a seaport , especially if it be a small one , is for ever upon the wharves , or in a boat , wondering what is going on in some vessel ridiug at anchor , or just floating out of sight . If he is sent to school in the country , he feels for a time as if imprisoned and stifled ; he longs for the free air , the sounds and moving objects , of the ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salt weeds and tarred rope , and even the fragrance of docks . No sound of pipe or shell can equal that of the waters . A sort of calenture is upon him . He has visions of far distant ships , of strange skies , people , and traffic , and home can bind him no longer . So of landsmen generally , if they think of the sea and of ships as something more than a field for labor or war , something more than to enrich merchants or vindicate national honor , the image of maritime life is accompanied with ideas of poetical inspiration , of religious feeling , of intrepidity and generosity , as growing naturally from a sense of peril and dependence , and the presence of grand or unusual phenomena . By the aid of mystery , which even the little they know , and especially the more they are ignorant of , throws over the adventurers upon the sea , a degree of dignity , or , it may be , of undefined but not painful terror , is attached to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sailor 's humor , so characteristic for its composition of stoicism and drollery . Every thing assures them , that his state and influences are peculiar . He is a privileged person . He has dared what they tremble merely to hear of . He has a right to despise people who live all the time ashore . Fancies // like these possess landsmen in full force , when they read the narratives of discoverers and great admirals , or the reports of wrecked sailors , and above all , when a man of genius , who has himself known the sea , invents a story of a ship 's fortunes . It is not disputed , that much truth is obtained by the inexperienced from sources like these . The imagination probably forms many adequate conceptions . It is no discredit to other sea-stories to say , that this has points in which it differs from them . We have here not only a real voyage , but , what we never had before , the whole history of a long trading voyage , told by a sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea with the facts as he found them who went out to work , not to speculate or describe ; who gave himself up to the service as devotedly , as he would do and bear all things in any other line of duty ; who was resolved to enter heartily into his new mode of life , to see all its fair sides , and make the best of its annoyances ; and whose narrative is the simple expression of his experience and prudent observation , - a narrative of things as they happened , of impressions as they were made , of convictions as they grew and settled upon his mind during a pretty f ) atient trial of a wholly new line of life . Such is the view that will be taken of the writer and his book , by those who know nothing of the sea , and those who know every thing . The truth speaks out everywhere . We should say , that it was all over with dreaming now , except in some few incurable cases . But it would be juster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with full compensation , so much more animating and productive is the truth , as here set forth , than our former guesses . The author has evidently made use of a copious journal , or drawn upon a very faithful memory ; for the succession of things is in perfect order of time , and , if any part of the voyage is omitted , we are not aware of it from the want of minute details . Still , there is very little appearance of the mechanical keeping of a journal . Notes of the ship 's place , of winds , of bells more or less , come in as they are needed ; that is , as they will make a statement more distinct , by placing us near to what is going on . But it is the well sustained spirit of a strictly personal narrative , which animates and defines every thing . The presence of the writer , his interest // in affairs , his hopes , anxieties , and vexations , his natural reflections , his temper of mind , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , because the voyage is made an occasion for exhibiting the author , but because his purpose is to describe it as it caine under his own eye , and specially affected himself . The effect is , that a narrative of no small variety , and embracing many persons and transactions , is bound together by a principle of unity , which could scarcely be more perfect and operative if he had been at liberty , like Defoe , to invent his facts , and group them at his pleasure . The whole economy of the ship , in all sorts of weather , and even the mystery of hide-droghing , hidecuring , and hide-loading , with their humble details , and , sometimes , obscure nomenclature , partake of the interest which belongs to matters of more obvious and natural attraction in themselves . The reader would no sooner pass over the most ordinary particulars , than he would the " slipping for a southeaster , " or the perils of doubling the Cape . The style we had never thought of as a distinct thing , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , because it calls for no separate remark , and is content with doing its work . It is plain , str*tight-forward , and manly , never swollen for effect , or kept down from apprehension . There is no appearance of seeking for words ; but those that will best answer the purpose , come and fall into their proper places of their own will ; so that , whatever the transitions may be , the composition flows on with natural , stream-like varieties , while we partake of the changing influences without a word of comment and probably with little consciousness . This we suppose is the perfection of style , so far as impression is concerned ; and to some extent it will always be found in an intelligent writer , who , without thinking much of himself , or of making a sensation , says honestly how things were , and how they affected him . We must not , however , attribute too much to sincerity , or even to intelligence . Where language is employed with singular fitness and ease , a writer must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at little trouble in managing it . It would be easy to cite short passages , that have a defined beauty of some kind ; those , for example , in which a few lively words are rapidly thrown together , as if a thing must be told at once or never , for nothing can be suffered to delay // the course of the story , any more than of the ship . Some instances of such brisk and effective description may be observed in the few passages which we select for a more general purpose . We begin with the preparations for flying before a southeaster , in the Bay of Santa Barbara , on the coast of California . " This night , after sundown , it looked black at the southward and eastward , and we were told to keep a bright lookout . Expecting to be called up , we turned in early . Waking up about midnight , I found a nian who had just come down from his watch , striking a light . He said that it was beginning to puff up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had called the captain ; and as he threw himself down on his chest , with all his clothes on , I knew that he expected to be called . I felt the vessel pitching at her anchor , and the chain surging and snapping , and lay awake , expecting an instant summons . Jn a few minutes it came , - three knocks on the scuttle , and All hands ahoy ! bear-a-hand up and make sail . ' We sprang up for our clothes , and were about halfway dressed , when the mate called out , down the scuttle , Tumble up here , men ! tumble up ! before she drags her anchor . ' We were on deck in an instant . Lay aloft and loose the topsails ! shouted the captain , as soon as the first man showed himself . Springing into the rigging , I saw that the . Iyacucho 's topsails were loosed , and heard her crew singing out at the sheets as they were hauling them home . This had probably started our captain ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had been many years on the coast , and knew the signs of the weather . We soon had the topsails loosed and one hand remaining , as usual , in each top , to overhaul the rigging and light the sail out , the rest of us laid down to man the sheets . While sheeting home , we saw the . Iyacucho standing athwart our bows , sharp upon the wind , cutting through the head sea like a knife , with her raking masts and sharp bows running up like the head of a greyhound . It was a beautiful sight . She was like a bird which had been frightened , and had spread her wings in flight . After the topsails had been sh*eted home , the head yards braced aback , the fore-top-mast staysail hoisted , and the buoys streamed , and all ready forward for slipping , we went aft and manned the slip-rope , which came through the stern port , with a turn round the timber-heads . All ready forward ? asked the captain . Ay , ay , sir ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! All gone , sir ; ' and the iron cable grated over the windlass // and through the hawse-hole , and the little vessel 's head swinging off from the wind under the force of her backed head sails , brought the strain upon the slip-rope . Let go aft ! Instantly all was gone , and we were under weigh . As soon as she was well off from the wind , we filled away the head yards , braced all up sharp , set the foresail and trysail , and left our anchorage well astern , giving the point a good berth . Nye s off too , ' said the captain to the mate ; aid , looking astern , we could just see the little hermaphrodite brig under sail , standing after us. " - pp. 77-79 . The accounts of ships in different points oF view will be understood by the least initiated readers , - for example , that of a vessel under full sail . " Notwithstanding all that has been said about the beauty of a ship under full sail , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under all her sail . A ship coming in or going out of port , with her ordinary sails , and perhaps two or three studding-sails , is commonly said to be under full sail but a ship never has all her sail upon her , except when she has a light , steady breeze , very nearly , but not quite , dead aft , and so regular that it can be trusted , and is likely to last for some time . Then , with all her sails , light and heavy , and studding-sails , on each side , alow and aloft , she is the most glorious moving object in the world . Such a sight , very few , even some who have been at sea a good den I , have ever beheld ; for from the deck of your own vessel you can not see her , as you would a separate object . " One night , while we were in these tropics , I went out to the end of the flying-jib-boom , upon some duty , and , having finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , admiring the beauty of the sight before me . Being so far out from the deck , I could look at the ship , as at a separate vessel ; - and , there , rose up from the water , supported only by the small black hull , a pyramid of canvass , spreading out far beyond the hull , aod towering up almost , as it seemed in the indistinct night air , to the clouds . The sea was as still as an inland lake ; the light trade-wind was gently and steadily breathing from astern ; the dark blue sky was studded with the tropical stars ; there was no sound but the rippling of the water under the stem ; and the sails were spread out , wide and high ; - the two lower studding-sails stretching , on each side , far beyond the deck ; the top-mast studding-sails , like wings to the top-sails ; the top-gallant studding-sails spreading fearlessly out above them ; still higher , the two royal studding-sails , looking like two kites flying from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little sky-sail , the apex of the pyramid , seeming actually to touch the stars , and to be out of reach of human hand . So quiet , too , was the sea , and so steady the breeze , that , if these sails had been sculptured marble , they could not have been more motionless . Not a ripple upon the surface of the canvass ; not even a quivering of the extreme edges of the sail , - so perfectly were they distended by the breeze . I was so lost in the sight , that I forgot the presence of the man who came out with me , until he said , ( for he , too , rough old man-of-war 's man as he was , had been gazing at the show , ) half to himself , still looking at the marble sails , How quietly they do their work ! " - pp. 462 1*4c23 . One peril at least must be given . We take the description of a gale encountered near Cape Horn , on the outward voyage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great cloud of a dark slate-color was driving on us from the southwest ; and we did our best to take in sail , ( for the light sails had been set during the first part of the day , ) before we were in the midst of it . We had got the light sails furled , the courses hauled up , and the topsail reef-tackles hauled out , and were just mounting the fore-rigging , when the storm struck us . In an instant the sea , which had been comparatively quiet , was running higher and higher ; and it became almost as dark as night . The hail and sleet were harder than I had yet felt them ; seeming almost to pin us down to the rigging . We were longer taking in sail than ever before ; for the sails were stiff and wet , the ropes and rigging covered with snow and sleet , and we ourselves cold and nearly blinded with the violence of the storm . By the time we had got down upon deck again , the little brig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every drive rushed in through the how-ports and over the bows , and buried all the forward part of the vessel . At this instant the chief mate , who was standing on the top of the windlass , at the foot of the spenser mast , called out , Lay out there and furl the jib ! This was no agreeable or safe duty . yet it must be done . An old Swede , ( the best sailor on board , ) who belonged on the forecastle , sprang out upon the bowsprit . Another one must go ; I was near the mate , and sprang forward , threw the downhaul over the windlass , and jumped between the knight-heads out upon the bow-sprit . The crew stood abaft the windlass and hauled the jib down , while we got out upon the weather side of the jib-boom , our feet on the foot.ropes , holding on by the // spar , the great jib flying off to leeward and slatting so as almost to throw us off of the boom . For some time we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two huge seas , one after the other , plunged us twice into the water up to our chins . We hardly knew whether we were on or off ; when coming up , dripping from the water , we were raised high into the air . John ( that was the sailor 's name ) thought the boom would go , every moment , and called out to the mate to keep the vessel oW and haul down the staysail ; but the fury of the wind and the breaking of the seas against the bows defied every attempt to make ourselves heard , and we were obliged to do the best we could in our situation . Fortunately , no other seas so heavy struck her , and we succeeded in furling the jib after a fashion ' ; and , coming in over the staysail nettings , were not a little pleased to find that all was snug , and the watch gone below ; for we were soaked through , and it was very cold . The weather coatiaued nearly the same through the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select a single example , with some doubt , however , whether it is half as laughable as the account of shipping a sea , on a later page . C* We had now got hardened to Cape *veather , the vessel was under reduced sail , and every thing secured on deck and below , so that we had little to do but to steer and to stand our watch . Our clothes were all wet through , and the only change was from wet to more wet . It was in vain to think of reading or working below , for we were too tired , the hatchways were closed down , and every thing was wet and uncomfortable , black and dirty , heaving and pitching . We had only to come below when the *vatch was out , wring out our wet clothes , hang them up , and turn in and sleep as soundly as we could , until the watch was called again . A sailor can sleep anywhere , - no sound of wind , water , wood , or iron can keep him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three blows on the hatchway , and the unwelcome cry of All starbow lines ahoy ! Eight bells there below ! Do you hear the news ? ( the usual formula of calling the watch , ) roused us up from our berths upon the cold , wet decks . The only time when we could be said to take any pleasure was at night and morning , when we were allowed a pint pot full of hot tea , ( or , as the sailors significantly call it , water bewitched , ' ) sweetened with molasses . This , bad as it was , was still warm and comforting , and , together with our sea biscuit and cold salt beef , made quite a meal . Yet even this meal was attended with some uncertainty . We had to go ourselves to the galley // and take our kid of beef and tin pots of tea , and run the risk of losing them before we could get below . Many a kid of beef have I seen rolling in the scuppers , and the bearer lying at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was always the life of the crew , but whom we afterwards lost overboard , standing for nearly ten minutes at the galley , with his pot of tea in his hand , waiting for a chance to get down into the forecastle ; and seeing what he thought was a smooth spell , ' started to go forward . He had just got to the end of the windlass , when a great sea broke over the bows , and for a moment I saw nothing of him but his head and shoulders ; and at the next instant , being taken off of his legs , he was carried aft with the sea , until her stern lifting up and sending the water forward , he was left high and dry at the side of the long-boat , still holding on to his tin pot , which had now nothing in it but salt water . But nothing could ever daunt him , or overcome , for a moment , his habitual good humor . Regaining his legs , and shaking his fist at the man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed , A man s no sailor , if he ca n't take a joke . ' The ducking was not the worst of such an affair , for , as there was an allowance of tea , you could get no more from the galley ; and though the sailors would never suffer a man to go with out , but would always turn in a little from their own pots to fill up his , yet this was at best but dividing the loss among all hands . " Somethino ' of the same kind befell me a few days after . The cook had just made for us a mess of hot scouse , ' - that is , biscuit pounded fine , salt beef cut into small pieces , and a few potatoes , boiled up together and seasoned with pepper . This was a rare treat , and I , being the last at the galley , had it put in my charge to carry down to the mess . I got along very well as far as the hatchway , and was just getting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern out of water , and passing forward , dropping it down again , threw the steps from their place , and I came down into the steerage a little faster than I meant to do , with the kid on top of me , and the whole precious mess scattered over the floor . Whatever your feelings may be , you must make a joke of every thing at sea ; and if you were to fall from aloft and be caught in the belly of a sail , and thus saved from instant death , it would not do to look at all disturbed , or to make a serious matter of it . " - pp. 39-41 . What can be brighter , than these contrasts of the latitudes of Cape Horn in winter , and the luxury of the Atlantic tropics three or four weeks later ? // " For eight days we lay drifting about in this manner . Sometimes ,  --  generally towards noon , - it fell calm ; once or twice a round copper ball showed itself for a few moments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puff or two came from the westward , giving some hope that a fair wind had come at last . During the first two days , we made sail for these puffs , shaking the reefs out of the topsails and boarding the tacks of the courses ; but , finding that it only made work for us when the gale set in again , it was soon given up , and we lay to under close-reefs . We had less snow and hail than when we were farther to the westward , but we had an abundance of what is worse to a sailor in cold weather , - drenching rain . Snow is blinding , and very bad when coming upon a coast , but , for genuine discomfort , give me rain with freezing weather . A sno*v-storm is exciting , and it does not wet through the clothes ( which is important to a sailor ) ; but a constant rain there is no escaping from . It wets to the skin , and makes all protection vain . We had long ago run through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way of drying them than by the sun , we had nothing to do but put on those which were the least wet . At the end of each watch , when we came below , we took off our clothes and wrung them out ; two taking hold of a pair of trowsers , - one at each end , - and jackets in the same way . Stockings , mittens , and all , were wrung out also , and then hung up to drain and chafe dry against the bulk-heads . Then , feeling of all our clothes , we picked out those which were the least wet , and put them on , so as to be ready for a call , and turned-in , covered ourselves up with blankets , and slept until three knocks on the scuttle , and the dismal sound of All starbow lines ahoy ! Eight bells , there below ! Do you hear the news ? * drawled out from on deck , and the sulky answer of Ay , ay from below , sent us up again . On deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a dead calm , with the rain pouring steadily down , or , more generally , a violent gale dead ahead , with rain pelting horizontally , and occasional variations of hail and sleet ; - decks afloat with water swashing from side to side , and constantly wet feet ; for boots could not be wrung out like drawers , and no composition could stand the constant soaking . In fact , wet and cold feet are inevitable in such weather , and are not the least of those little items which go to make up the grand total of the discomforts of a winter pussage round the Cape . Few words were spoken between the watches as they shifted , the wheel was relieved , the mate took his place on the quarter-deck , the look-outs in the bows ; and each man had his narrow space to // walk fore and aft in , or , rather , to swing himself forward and back in , from one belaying pin to another , - for the decks were too slippery with ice and water to allow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely necessary to pass away the time , one of us hit upon the expedient of sanding the deck ; and afterwards , whenever the rain was not so violent as to wash it off , the weather-side of the quarter-deck , and a part of the waist and forecastle , were sprinkled with the sand which we had on board for holystoning ; and thus we made a good promenade , where we walked fore and aft , two and two , hour after hour , in our long , dull , and comfortless watches . The bells seemed an hour or two apart , instead of half an hour , and an age to elapse before the welcome sound of eight bells . The sole object was to make the time pass on . Any change was sought for , which would break the monotony of the time ; and even the two hours ' trick at the wheel , which came round to each of us , in turn , once in every other watch , was looked upon as a relief . Even the never-failing resource of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have failed us now ; for we had been so long together that we had heard each other 's stories told over and over again , till we had them by heart ; each one knew the whole history of each of the others , and we were fairly and literally talked out . Singing and joking , we were in no humor for , and , in fact , any sound of mirth or laughter would have struck strangely upon our ears , and would not have been tolerated , any more than whistling , or a wind instrument . The last resort , that of speculating upon the future , seemed now to fail us , for our discouraging situation , and the danger we were really in , ( as we expected every day to find ourselves drifted back among the ice , ) clapped a stopper upon all that . From saying , when we get hone , ' - we began insensibly to alter it to *f we get home , ' - and at last the subject was dropped by a tacit consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below were no more varied than the watch on deck . All washing , se*ving , and reading was given up ; and we did nothing but eat , sleep , and stand our watch , lending what might be called a Cape Horn life . The forecastle was too uncomfortable to sit up in ; and , whenever we were below , we were in our berths . To prevent the rain , and the sea-water which broke over the bows , from washing down , we were obliged to keep the scuttle closed , so that the forecastle was nearly air-tight . In this little , wet , leaky hole , we were all quartered , in an atmosphere so bad , that our lamp , which swung in the middle from the beams , sometimes actually burned blue , with a large circle of foul air about it . Still , I was // never in better health than after three weeks of this life . I gained a great deal of flesh , and we all ate like horses . At every watch , when we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid were overhauled . Each man drank his quart of hot tea , night and morning ; and glad enough we were to get it , for no nectar and ambrosia were sweeter to the lazy immortals , than was a pot of hot tea , a hard biscuit , and a slice of cold salt beef to us , after a watch on deck . To be sure , we were mere animals , and , had this life lasted a year instead of a month , we should have been little better than the ropes in the ship . Not a razor , nor a brush , nor a drop of water , except the rain and spray , had come near us all the time ; for we were on an allowance of fresh water ; and who would strip and wash himself in salt water on deck , in the snow and ice , with the thermometer at zero ? *- pp. 407 , 408 . Now we come at once to the tropics , for never was there a finer wind , or a ship more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now to the northward of the line , and every day added to our latitude . The Magellan Clouds , the last sign of south latitude , were sunk in the horizon , and the north star , the Great Bear , and the familiar signs of northern latitudes , were rising in the heavens . Next to seeing land , there is no sight which makes one realize more that he is drawing near home , than to see the same heavens , under which he was born , shining at night over his head . The weather was extremely hot , with the usual tropical alternations of a scorching sun and squalls of rain ; yet not a word was said in complaint of the heat , for we all remembered that only three or four weeks before we would have given nearly our all to have been where we now were . We had a plenty of water , too , which we caught by spreading an awning , with shot thrown in to make hollows . These rain squalls came up in the manner usual between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical sun ; work going lazily on , and men about decks with nothing but duck trowsers , checked shirts , and straw hats ; the ship moving as lazily through the water ; the man at the helm resting against the wheel , with his hat drawn over his eyes ; the captain below , taking an afternoon nap ; the passenger leaning over the taifmail , watching a dolphin following slowly in our wake ; the sailmaker mending an old top-sail on the lee side of the quarter-deck ; the carpenter working at his bench , in the waist ; the boys making sinnet ; the spun-yarn winch whizzing round and round , and the men walking slowly fore and aft with the yarns . // -A cloud rises to windward , looking a little black ; the skysails are brailed down ; the captain puts his head out of the companion-way , looks at the cloud , comes up , and begins to walk the deck. - The cloud spreads and comes on ; - the tub of yarns , the sail , and other matters , are thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slide drawn over the forecastle. - Stand by the royal halyards ; - the man at the wheel keeps a good weather helm , so as not to be taken aback . - The squall strikes her . If it is light , the royal yards are dewed down , and the ship keeps on her way ; but if the squall takes strong hold , the royals are dewed up , fore and aft ; light hands lay aloft and furl them ; top-gallant yards dewed down , flying-jib hauled down , and the ship kept off before it , - the man at the helm laying out his strength to heave the wheel up to windward . At the same time a drenching rain , which soaks one through in an instant . Yet no one puts on a jacket or cap ; for if it is only warm , a sailor does not mind a ducking ; and the sun will soon be out again . As soon as the force of the squall has passed , though to a common eye the ship would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up to her course again ! - Keep her up , sir , ' ( answer ) ; - Hoist away the top-gallant yards ! - Run up the flyingjib ! - Lay aloft , you boys , and loose the royals ! - and all sail is on her again before she is fairly out of the squall ; and she is going on in her course . The sun comes out once more , hotter than ever , dries up the decks and the sailors ' clothes the hatches are taken off ; the sail got up and spread on the quarter-deck ; spun-yarn winch set a whirling again ; rigging coiled up ; captain goes below ; and every sign of an interruption is removed . " - pp. 429 - 431 . But it is time to speak of this volume as something more than an agreeable narrative or description . It abounds in matter for serious reflection . When a reader , who has known little of a sailor 's life , finishes the book , ( with gratitude , it may he , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought most likely to spring up is , - what a dreadful doom is this of the common mariner , trained as he must be to habits which he can never hope to change , and reduced to a degradation which we must hope he has lost the sense of . He is a slave of the worst kind , for his toil is a peril , - industry and exposure go hand in hand . Even the apathy of habit is degrading as well as useful ; for , if dangers have lost their power to intimidate , they have also lost their power to excite . Deeds worthy of the highest // chivalry are done without the spirit of chivalry . The man has become a machine . If he perishes , why , danger is his element , as he and his comrades know , and death or an escape must be looked on with an equal eye . His fare is wretched while it lasts , and famine or scarcity is not unlikely to follow . He has hardly any indulgence of leisure or playtime , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something for the ship . His sleep is broken his day-time monotonous . Hard masters are over him , and ill-usage the probable recompense of so much suffering for others . Hunger and stripes , wet and cold , - this is his portion at sea . On shore , he is confounded hy the contrast of his situation ; he is at the mercy of sharpers ; he soon makes a beast of himself , and poverty or crime , probably both , drive him again to the forecastle . Let the hot-headed boy read this book before he makes up his mind to run away from home and follow the seas . Let parents read it , before they suffer a child of delicate training and unformed character to enter this den of horrors . Such may be the reader 's first thoughts on closing the book , and they are well accounted for by some statements in relation to this particular voyage , and , perhaps , warranted by the experience of many voyages . But we should not exaggerate real miseries , though universal , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looked at truly , if we would learn how far they are necessary , and whether they may not he mitigated . The spirit of the book we have just read teaches us no lesson of sweeping condemnation , but is as judicious as it is honest . We have no right to hold any course of life to be inevitably an evil and a shame , which Heaven has opened to humnan labor , and which our tastes , wants , or avarice have invited and encouraged multitudes to follow . Hardship , surely , is not the ground on which any human condition is to be condemned or shunned , even though it be of man 's inflicting . How few of us have it in our power to choose our course of life , and how few would be the better for having the decision left to themselves . If we take into view those hardships only of a sealife which are obviously unavoidable , and compare them with the common lot of men , we shall not pronounce the sailor to be the only one whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are apt to be carried to extremes , // by those who would reconcile the poor to their privations , and apprize them of their privileges ; but they are certainly useful when they lead the considerate to deduct something from the palpable ills of one station , by measuring them with the less notable , but not less certain , trials and exposures of another . As to the discipline of a ship , we do not learn , however strict it may be , however despotic the authority of the master , however unequal the comforts of officers and men , that these are subjects of complaint among good sailors . They may require , as any inferior would do , that the ordinary discipline should be uniform , intelligible , and , perhaps , reasonable ; and , in doing so , the appeal would be direct to the interest of their superiors , for in no other way can the heart be brougbt to act with the law , and the best part of human agency be secured . The important question is , whether nothing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laborers who are subjected to overseers , which may act upon them as moral beings , and give them just notions of their duties and rights . Their worst hardships are owing to the degraded character of the class . The impression is against them at the outset . They feel that the commander looks to his power for their fidelity ; and probably many of them know , that he can depend on nothing else for his security . What a miserable relation is this between men , who are to live together for months or years , within narrow walls , so far from the restraints and supports of social life . Our author has attempted , in his closing chapter , to show what may be done to improve the condition of a sailor , to strip it of its accidental evils , and bring it to a level , in point of moral influences at least , with that of other laborers . His calm and reasonable statement , sustained by the authority of experience and his later reflections , recommends itself to the notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , who are trying to effect reforms by investigating the evils incident to particular occupations and classes , and applying a remedy , as far as possible , to individual cases . It was after witnessing the infliction of punishment upon two of the sailors , under circumstances of brutal ferocity , that his mind was turned seriously to the purpose of doing something in behalf of this suffering class . // " After the day 's work was done , we went down into the forecastle , and ate our plain supper ; but not a word was spoken . It was Saturday night ; but there was no song , no sweethearts and wives . ' A gloom was over every thing . The two men lay in their berths , groaning with pain , and we all turned in , but for myself , not to sleep . A sound coming now and then from the berths of the two men showed that they were awake , as awake they must have been , for they could hardly lie in one posture a moment ; the dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark hole in which we lived ; and many and various reflections nd purposes coursed through my mind . I thought of our situation , living under a tyranny ; of the character of the country we were in ; of the length of the voyage , and of the uncertainty attending our re* turn to America ; and then , if we should return , of the prospect of obtaining justice and satisfaction for these poor men and vowed that , if God should ever give me the means , I would do something to redress the grievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings , of whom I then was one . " - pp. 129 , 130. * Hard as the life may have been , which he has recorded in these pages , he would have no cause to regret it , if the only fruit were , that it has enabled him to do a good office for his former brethren . We may add to this , that he has supplied a want of the common reader . Another field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our knowledge , with the real hardships of the case exposed , and with the genuine alleviations and sotirces of iml ) rovcnient that belong to it . It is goo ( l to see the spirit of man in his deeds and endurance , as well as in his meditations and poetical visions . It is one way of invigorating literature , of giving ( lefiniteness to speculation , and bringing prudent sympathy and charity to the study of our nature , capacities , arid wants . " We must come down from our heights , " says our author , " and leave our straight paths , for the by-ways and low places of life , if we would learn truths by strong contrasts ; and in hovels , in forecastles , and among our own outcasts in foreign lands , see what has been wrought upon our fellow-creatures by acci* dent , hardship , or vice . " In looking back upon what we have written , we see that The shipmaster , hero in question , was a thorough seaman ; but the distinguished houce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on his return , of his treatment of his men , found no further occasion for his services . // we owe it to the author to commend yet more distinctly than we have done , an excellent trait of his work . It is plain , that he saw and experienced enough to irritate sorely a man of the calmest temper . On one occasion , that to which the last extract relates , he was witness to an abominably cruel exercise of a shipmaster 's power , and at other times suffered from it himself , in less aggravated forms . But his tone is throughout dispassionate and reasonable . Bad as he has had cause to know a despotism on board ship to be , in hands unfit to he trusted with it , he is not at all blinded to those exigencies of the case , which admit of no other government . " I have no fancies about equality on board ship . It is a thing out of the question , and certainly , in the present state of mankind , not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the orders and ranks of the service ; and , if I expected to pass the rest of my life before the mast , I would not wish to have the power of the captain diminished an iota . It is absolutely necessary that there should be one head and one voice , to control every thing , and be responsible for every thing . There are emergencies , which require the instant exercise of extreme power . These emergencies do not allow of consultation ; and they who would be the captain 's constituted advisers might he the very men over whom he would be called upon to exert his authority . It has been found necessary to vest in every government , eVen the most democratic , some extraordinary and , at first sight , alarming powers ; trusting in public opinion , and subsequent accountability , to modify the exercise of them . These are provided to meet exigencies , which all hope may never occur , but which yet by possibility may occur , and , if they should , and there were no power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the government at once . So it is with the authority of the shipmaster . It will not answer to say , that he shall never do this and that thing , because it does not seem always necessary and advisable that it should be done . He has great cares and responsibilities ; is answerable for every thing ; and is subject to emergencies which perhaps no other man exercising authority among civilized people is subject to . Let him , then , have powers commensurate with his utmost possible need ; only let him be held strictly responsible for the exercise of them . Any other course would be injustice , as well as bad policy . " - pp. 461 , 462 . The authQr , while he urges the importance of a fair consideration of the testimony of common sailors in courts of // justice , asks for no new legislation on the relations of officers and crews . He does not even propose the abolition of corporal chastisement . He would have officers compelled to be reasonable and humane , by a sense of responsibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws at home ; but there is not a word in his volume tending to loose the bonds of a salutary discipline . In short , he has laid readers under obligation for a fund of instruction and amusement ; sailors , for impressively pleading their cause and owners and officers , quite as much as either , for maintaining their just authority.
