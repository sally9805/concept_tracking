txt THE first of these books , as an elementary work , is the most valua* ble contribution to the science of which it treats that has been issued from the American press . As a patient thinker , clear reasoner , arid methodical expounder of science , the author of it has few equals in the nation . Both of his books , we mean that on Moral Science , and the one before us , are remarkable for an arrangement at once minute and comprehensive , which seems to embrace the whole scope of the subject , and not to neglect its smaller branches and divisions . He posesses himself , in the first place , of all that has been written upon a topic , and then disposes of it in the most exact , orderly , and economical manner . Of course , none but the more general principles of science are furnished us , but these are given with so much clearness and precision , and their grounds and mutual relations are so felicitously explained , that we are at once put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to our knowledge , but old truths are rendered of easy acquisition . In one respect , we think Mr. Wayland has introduced an improvement , that is , in making " Exchange , " which is usually treated of under the head of Distribution , a separate and distinct head of itself . An inquiry into the principles according to which the commodities of traffic are exchanged for each other , including , as it does , an investigation of the properties of a medium of exchange , or the origin and true functions of money , is of too an important a nature not to have a distinct place allotted to it . To treat of it under the same division with profits , wages , and rent , is to classify things essentially distinct . The second work aspires to a higher character than . that of President Wayland 's , although it relates only to a single branch of eco * The Elements of Political Economy , By Francis Wayland : New York , 1837 . A Treatise on Currency and Banking , By Condy Raguet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , By Henry Vethake : Philadelphia , 1838. // nomical science . That branch is , however , an important one , which has of late years attracted unusual attention , which has seldom been systematically managed , and which has given rise , perhaps , to more controversies , and to more crude and fantastic opinions , than any kindred question . If this book , therefore , had no other merit , it was , to say the least , seasonable . But it has higher claims to our regard . It is a most admirable treatise , generally correct in its teachings , full of important suggestions , well arranged , precise in its language , transparent in diction , and judicious in spirit . The nature of money , whether metalic or paper , the utility of banks , the limited and proper sphere of credit , and the general doctrines of trade , are explained with great perspicuity , skill , and amplitude as well as fidelity of illustration ; we should dissent , no doubt , from some of the author 's notions as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but should have no hesitation to commend his essay as an intelligent , profound , systematic , and well-reasoned exposition of an intricate but important topic . His views are expressed with freedom , but not hardihood , with that firmness and confidence which ever attend a mind conscious of urging truth . Mr. Vethake 's book differs from both of the former books , as well in manner as in matter , but is in several respects more valuable than either . It is less elementary than the first , and more comprehensive than the second . He is not , however , an agreeable writer , nor is his method the most luminous and satisfactory . His sentences are often lo**g and difficult , the links of his ratiocination are imperfectly supplied , and particular views are sometimes expanded to tediousness . But he is one who , to a thorough mast cry of what others have written , unites no small degree of originality . What he excels in , is the mode in which the subject is introduced . Definitions , which he regards as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not arbitrarily given : no position is taken for granted ; from one series of facts he ascends logically to another ; and , what is especially to be remarked , he treats of the moral relations , in connexion with the other aspects , of his subject . As to his novel innovation , in comprehending immaterial as well as material products under the denomination of wealth and capital , it has not yet struck us as so important as he would represent . But we shall start no controversy on that point . It can not be denied that the controversies of political economists have brought their whole science into disparagement . There are those who regard it as a rude jumble of individual opinions . A number of writers , among whom Coleridge and Carlyle are conspicuous , make no concealment in treating it with feelings akin to contempt . They are accustomed to say that its professors are ever at loggerheads , that none of its definitions are unquestioned , that not a single one of its boasted principles are settled , that purporting to be experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at the beginning . To us these are silly objections . If the disputes of its teachers are grounds for rejecting a doctrine , what one is left to us ? Must we deny the deductions of Newton , because we have read of the whirling vortices of Descartes ; must we gain say Locke , because of the vibratiuncles of Hartley , or is Christianity to be despised , because it is taught in a thousand different churches ? The truth is , as some one has justly observed , that in all intellecttial pursuits , a period of confusion necessarily precedes a period unanimity . In the outset the elements of the subject are new and intractable ; they have not been thoroughly embraced by the mind ; they are mingled with , and distorted by , innumerable prejudices ; while the intellect , impatient of acquisition , is prone at the first partial glimpse of truth , to dash into a hundred vagaries , arid only recovers its sobriety and temper , by long conflicts and severe discipline . Political Economy , in running at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has journeyed through the wilderness , to enter at last the land teeming with rich harvests in the prospect . Like Pilgrim in the allegory , the slough s , the giants , the lions , the shadowy valleys it has passed-it remains to it only to press forward to the celestial city . Looking more closely into the matter , we find there is one circumstance , common to all sciences , which retards their more early developement . It is the want of a proper method . It is the disposition inquirers fall into , of pursuing a subject , each after his own fashion , without much regard to propriety or order . They set their faces in a particular direction , and then commence work with all their might , turning neither to the right nor the left , scarcely looking back , and pushing right on with indefatigable zeal and infinite pertinacity of purpose . Vhen they arrive at the goal , they find themselves as far from the true object of their search as when they begun . They have striven laborously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will-'o-the-wisp , through bogs , briars , and pools , to be deserted in some dark place , where it is quite impossible either to go on or return . After all their struggles , like children who have chased the golden bow formed in the glittering rain drops , they suddenly discover themselves in the midst of clouds and haze . No matter how penetrating their sagacity or vigorous their logic , they are turned out of the way and seek in vain for the truth they are anxious to grasp . It were idle to doubt the acumen arid intellectual force of the ancient philosophers , but after the toil of centuries , to what did their boasted revelations of science amount ? reacher succeeded teacher , school followed school , without adding more than a particle to the sum of useful human knowledge . The sophists of Greece gave way to Socrates ; Socrates to Plato , who in his turn was compelled to retire before the mightier genius of Aristotle , until the doctrines of both were alike forgotten in the interminable wranglings and wild vagaries // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , that philosophers had not yet possessed themselves of a suitable method . It was the glory of Bacon to turn their minds in a more fruitful direction . He it was that exposed the folly of their proceedings , and by announcing the true method of nature , the method of observation and induction , placed them in the path which alone could lead to useful or honorable results . That method , as is the case with truth always , is noted for its simplicity . It may be described in few words , as the interpretation of nature . Man , says he , must dismiss his prejudices , must relinquish those idols which usurp the throne of the mind , and with the humility of a little child , set himself down , not to anticipate , but to learn the nature and workings of the vast world of animate and inanimate beings around him . To this the eager intellect of man is indisposed , and the consequence is , that it runs into much foolishness and many conflicts . Political Economy , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who undertook to investigate it have commenced by constructing a system before they were acquainted with facts . As imprudent architects , they framed their plans and cut out their superstructure before they procured their materials or measured their means . Forgetting that the only foundation of science are facts minutely observed and rigidly compared , their conclusions came to be individual notions , rather than scientific principles . The error was more atrocious , because Political Economy of all studies is eminently inductive . It rests upon facts , and by that method alone which begins with facts can it be successfully pursued . The object of it is to ascertain the laws that govern the production of wealth . These laws are nothing more than general expressions of what takes place under certain circumstances of human intercourse , and to be accurately learned must be carefully observed , to the exclusion of all deductions which are not made after the strictest principles of reason . They are generalizations of facts , facts brought together and compared with a view to the discovery of the general truths which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended over the whole ground , the views are partial and inadequate , and subjects have been caught up only in a single aspect . When the economist , of the last century contended that the gain of one nation was the loss of another , or that the imposition of taxes was not felt by the industry of a nation , they had glanced merely at one side of the question , neglecting a vast mass of dependent and correlative truths . And so when the advocates of productive tariffs cOnten ( l that the interposition of government stimulates the productive powers of labor , they see only a part of the subject , and are like schoolboys who essay to give an opinion of the calculus before they have mastered the multiplication table . If they had taken a larger view of the question , embraced a greater number of // its elements , traced the mutual and interacting influence of different circumstances , the toil would no doubt have been greater , but the result would have been complete . When one sets about investigating the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws regulating its distribution , and the manner it is most advantageously consumed , he is inquiring as to what actually occurs in a certain condition of human affairs . His whole business is to mark facts as they arise ; and then , after collecting a sufficient number of instances , it may ascend to such obvious deductions as the known principles of human action and the nature of things may warrant . This duty faithfully performed , he will find no trivial labor . The disturbing causes , or in the language of mathematics , the variable quantities are so many in every economical problem , that patient reflection alone can lead to a satisfactory solution . A hasty glance at tables of statistics , a rapid survey of collections of indigested data , sweeping conclusions from a limited number of instances , are not enough . These may serve for weaving together beautiful hypotheses , but not for the uprearing of a consistent theory . Apart from the deficiencies of its method , Political Economy has but just escaped from the struggles attending its birth and childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not written in the speech of men . It began with that reformation of political and social relations which emancipated industry from the shackles of despotism , when freedom was first beginning to make head against force , and the earth came to be regarded not as a seat for the strife of rapacious barons , but as a field for the exertions of thrifty people . Among the ancients , it could not be cultivated , because the objects to which it related were despised . Labor was a mark of degradation and a term of reproach . It was a mode of activity suited to slaves and the outcasts of a debased populace . The great body of the people , as well as the rich men , the orators , the philosophers , the magistrates , and the priests , absorbed in the pursuit of an idle glory , disdained the humble occupations of husbandry and trade . Descended from those rude ages when men were employed in the duties of self-protection or conquest , and the cares of useful industry were left to women , menials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ancestors against manufacturing or commercial labor long after the original cause had ceased to exist . Under the discipline of Lycurgus the Spartans were expressly enjoined not to engage in what were esteemed degrading employments , and in the other state of Greece , the manners , feelings , and entire structure of society conspired to raise a no less effectual prohibition . The spirit of their literature , their legislation , and their philosophy cast contempt upon the simpler forms of labor . Aristotle , when he mentions mechanics , speaks of them as a set of worthless and despicable beings ; Plato banishes them altogether from his imaginary republic ; even Cicero , with his more liberal genius , confesses that there can be nothing elevated in a workshop ; // and Seneca tasks his ingenuity to defend the name of Democritus from the charge of having contrived the first arch , and that of Anacharsis from the disgrace of having made a potter 's wheel . It may be esteemed in exception to this general condemnation of manual labor , that agriculture was held in higher repute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet , " Far back in the ages The plough with wreaths was crowned , " and we know that Cato delighted in his gardens and fields , that Cincinnatus was taken from his farm to the dictatorship , that viclorious Captains retired from the triumph to the cottage , and that Columella has treated at length of the culture of the soil and of the innocent pleasures of rural occupations . But with these men , agriculture was esteemed not so much as a branch of useful labor , as a safe retreat from the turmoils and trouble of a more ambitious life . They turned to it in the spirit which Virgil has beautifully expressed in the Georgics. " 0 fortunatos nimium , sna si bona norint , Agricolas quibus , ipsa , procul discordibus armis , Fundit humo facilem victuni justissimatellus . " It was as a refuge from the discord of arms , as a sure haven into which one might comfortably glide after the stormy passage of life , that they deemed it honorable and sung its praises . As a means of procuring subsistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses , or of adding to the conveniences of society nt large , they committed it to the regards of the untaught hind and his fellow ox . Mart , in their view , was born to accomplish a noble destiny , to engage in the defence of the state , to lead armies to battle , to enslave neighboring provinces , to contend in the fervid race , to listen to enraptured orators , to solve the problem of existence , to minister in the temples of the gods , to lounge amid the wits of the portico , and to drink wisdom from inspired lips in the groves of Academe . From a race imbued with such principles , and accustomed to such exercises the science which related to the physical well-being of nations could never have sprung . The social relations in which its interesting questions have their origin did not exist , and if they had , the peculiar turn of their intellectual exertion would even have prevented them from investigating the laws and methods of economical progress . It is on this account that the ancients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in their public administrations as well as in the regulation of private pursuits were alike injudicious and ignorant . With the downfall of the Roman Empire , the circumstances favorable ' to an enlarged study of economical science , were somewhat but only slightly improved . The same repugnance to regular industry , and the same fondness for abstract inquiries , contributed to the fostering of the same prejudices and errors . An unsettled state of society , passing // alternately through the vicissitudes of force and sloth , allowed no opportunity either for the adoption of regular habits or the prosecution of useful study . When the deluge of barbarians from the north broke over the western provinces of the Roman Empire , centuries passed away in confusion before the troubled elements were permitted to subside . The exigencies of violence prevented the cultivation of the fields and interrupted the commerce of the towns . Powerful men , drawing around them hosts of their dependents , exhausted the energies of the social system in warlike struggles and predatory excursions . The lands fell into the hands of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of primogeniture and entail , they ever afterward remained . Neither the landlord nor the tenant was devoted to their cultivation , because to the former there was wanting the inclination , and to the latter , the inducement . Both were satisfied if they could be made to provide for the demands of the hour . In this way they fell into neglect and gradual decay . The trade of the towns , without a stimulus in the prosperity of the surrounding country , degenerated into the transient and uncertain exchange of products of immediate need . There was no accumulation , no distant interchange of commodities , no bargaining beyond the higgling of the stalls , or the chance traffic with pedlers and marauding companies . At the same time the clergy had assumed the control of seats of learning , and introduced into the common stu*. dies the scholastic and subtle spirit of controversy which distinguished their own pursuits . Logic , divinity , grammar , metaphysics , were the staple of their acquisitions . No light was shed upon the art of conducting the ordinary business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national wealth , no questions started as to the means of ameliorating or advancing the physical welfare of mankind . But gradually , through the privileges granted to the inhabitants of cities by princes anxious to defend their power from the inroads of the great barons , better influences came to prevail . Order and security , which were the natural consequences of the protection afforded by the superior rulers , furnished traders with the opportunity of enlarging the sphere of their operations . Commerce , by degrees , expanded its objects and its exertions . The knowledge acquired during the Crusades to the East , created a desire for luxuries and the finer sorts of manufactures . Markets were opened in towns for the superfluous products of the country , and the country was encouraged to make use of its productive powers by the prospect of growing civilization and wealth . Merchants emerged into notice , because of the pecuniary facilities they were enabled to extend to governments ; while , along with the increasing ambition of opulence , there came the disposition to examine into its causes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this period that Political Economy was born , or rather that the materials were begun to be collected , out of which it S2 // was to be subsequently formed . Men of acute genius , with their sagacity whetted by a pervading love of gain , addressed themselves to the analysis of wealth , of the social arrangements which led to its production , of the institutions that retarded its increase , of the natural agents that assisted labor , of the principles of barter , of the facilities of intercourse , of the influences of population , and of the nature and utility of the various modes of human employment . Who were the first authors that treated systematically of these points , it would exhaust our space to enumerate . Both in Italy and England tracts were from time to time put forth in elucidation of the commercial difficulties and troubles that successively arose . Many of these were written with skill , and foreshadowed faintly the great doctrines of later writers. * But they are disfigured by the immaturity and prejudices that marked the opinions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of inquiry . Like the dry leaves upon the shores of a stream , they are marks of the swelling and falling of the tide of public feeling , as it was swayed hither and thither by one delusion or one conviction after another . In this respect they are interesting to those who carry their researches into the minuter channels of knowledge . To others , and to the general reader , it is sufficient to he informed of the greater incidents that modify the advancement of opinion . Political Economy has had three or four several important epochs , which diversify the history of its course , while they distinguish the conspicuous changes through which modern society has passed . These may be separated as ( 1 . ) The era of the rise and decline of the mercantile or manufacturing systems ; ( 2 . ) The era of the prevalence of the economists or the agricultural system ; ( 3 . ) The advent of Adam Smith ; and ( 4. ) the succession of Maithus , Ricardo , and the more recent authors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could desire . I. The constant use that was made , from the earliest ages , of gold and silver , both as a medium of exchange and a measure of value7 naturally led to the idea that they were the chief constituents of wealth . As the opulence of individuals and nations was estimated by the amount of money in their possession , it became the policy of states to accumulate as great an amount of the precious metals as possible within their respective domains . Laws were everywhere framed , by repressing every species of trade which might lead to a diminution of the precious metals , to prohibit the subtraction of coin . In Spain and Portugal these enactments were carried to such a severity as to make the exportation of gold and silver a penal offence , * Notices of the more important may be found in McCullough 's Introduction to Adam Smith , an essay abounding in learning and judicious reflection , the first7 and we believe the most complete , history that has been given of the rise and prc* *sress of the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the spirit of commerce came to prevail , merchants found this system of restraint to be irksome and inconvenient , and sought by a variety of expedients to lessen the burdens it imposed . The East India Company , in particular , which had long carried on a lucrative traffic with the Indies , the main part of which was effected by means of the precious metals , protested against the fetters which had been placed upon their exportation . They did not , however , arraign the prevailing doctrine , that money was the sum and substance of wealth , but endeavored , by a coinplex series of reasonings , to prove that , under certain circumstances , the exportation of it was beneficial , in producing what was termed a favorable balance of trade . Their argument was this : - rhat it was idle to attempt to prohibit the exportation of gold and silver , if there was a demand for them abroad , because the great value concentrated in a small bulk enabled them to be easily smuggled , and because the foreign goods often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity . So plausible was this view , and so strenuously was it defended by a class supposed to be acquainted with the operations of commerce , it was not long in obtaining a general adoption . rI*he efforts of the state were then turned to bringing about an advantageous foreign trade . To extend the exports of domestic , and to diminish the imports of foreign , goods , became the great end . In this view , a system of restrictive measures was advanced , which at once perfected the mercantile theory . High duties , sometimes amounting to absolute prohibitions , were laid upon the introduction of all goods that could not be produced at home , and especially upon those coming from nations with which there was supposed to be an unfavorable balance of trade . At the same time , to encourage e xportation , bounties and drawbacks were granted either to stimulate new kinds of home production , or to favor such as was held of special use . Commercial treaties were instituted , securing to the merchants of particular nations trading privileges above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same design , in distant and fertile parts where the merchants of certain natiolhs might possess themselves of an entire monopoly of their trade . By this method , fetters and obstacles were set round the energies of commerce . The spirit of exclusiveness pervaded every branch of itbut , as it afterward turned out , only to narrow the circle of its exertions , and to impair its profitableness as well as its utility . Experience taught those most directly interested , that by consenting to the notion that the precious metals were wealth , they had sanctioned an error , and the discovery of this mistake led them to question the solidity of other parts of their theory . Gold and silver came to be considered of the same nature with other commodities , and the restraints put upon the exportation of these were in consequence , after no little controversy , gradually abandoned . But many absurdities , generated // by the original doctrine , were reserved to be exploded at a later day . Had these men carried their researches further , they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the whole superstructure reared upon it was false . The object of commerce is not to augment the sum of the precious metals in a country , but to multiply and enlarge the comforts and conveniences of its population , an effect best accomplished by permitting to individuals the largest freedom , both in the selection and management of their pursuits . Bounties , duties , monopolies , and restrictive regulations , of what kind soever , have but one effect , either to divert capital and labor from the objects to which they would naturally be directed , to those less advantageous , or to tax productive employments generally , for the sake of sustaining one or two enterprises which , without assistance , would be unprofitable . For if these enterprises were of themselves profitable , they would be undertaken without external help , and if they were not profitable , they could only be made so by drawing aid from more useful and lucrative sources . II . While the commercial system was undergoing a fierce discussion in England and on the Continent , an opposite system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a physician of the time of Louis the Fifteenth . He had been led to investigate the depressed condition of agriculture , and in the course of his inquiries the whole subject of wealth came under review . He examined into its sources , and attempted a systematic analysis of its elements . His partiality for agricultural pursuits conducted him to the doctrine that the earth is the only source of production . He was confirmed in this view , by observing that of all classes engaged in industry those who cultivated the soil were alone able to pay rent for the mere use of natural agents , or to realize from their products a net surplus above the cost of production . Other classes he allowed were useful in conducting the economy of society , but their business produced no value , because the value accruing from manufacturing or transporting their products only replaced the original capital they consumed in the operation . The community he therefore divided into three orders : the first , proprietors of land , who contribute to production by the expenses incurred in improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such other ameliorations as tended to render the land more prolific ; the second , the cultivators of the soil , farmers and their dependents , whose actual labor in ploughing , sowing , planting , amid reaping , added to the variety and amount of the annual produce ; and third , mechanics , artificers , and merchants , who added nothing to the wealth of society , because the value they added to commodities was only equivalent to the stock which employed them , together with its ordinary profits . A natural deduction from this theory was , that the productive classes , as they were termed , bore all the expenses of the state ; and it was accordingly proposed that the taxes laid by the civil // authorities should be made to fall directly upon the net produce or rent of land . Quesney 's reasoning wrought conviction in the minds of a large body of disciples , among the more eminent of whom were Turgot , Marquis de Mirabeau , and Dupont de Nemours , who , by the exclusiveness of their zeal and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the Economists . rjihe weakness of their system is obvious enough . Production does not consist , as they imagined , either in materials themselves or in the creation of materials , but in the creation of utility , which can only be effected by human exertion . Land is without value until the hand of industry has been applied to it , and then only , because by means of its products the wants and comforts of human beings are supplied . The utility of anything is its adaptability to the gratification of human desires , and whether this property has been given to it by the labor of the husbandman , the artificer , or the merchant , whether by raising it from the soil , or by modifying it through some process of manufacture , or by conveying it from place to place , it is equally fitted to human use , and equally possesses a value for which other values will be given in exchange . The source of its value , then , is the labor expended upon it in the course of bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of immediate use . ILL The advent of Adam Smith , in 1776 , like the rising of the sun , dissipated the clouds that had been gathered in the twilight of economical science . rpo his great work on the Wealth of Nations is the glory due of having demonstrated the errors of his forerunners , and of erecting a system of truth and consistency in their place . He was fitted above all the men of his time for the peculiar task his genius accomplished . He belonged to that school of free inquirers and independent thinkers , just then in its vigor , who carried an unsparing analysis into all the institutions and notions of the past . The friend of Hume and many of the more celebrated French Philosophers , he was thoroughly imbued with that spirit of reform , which in their cases was carried to such a pernicious extreme , but which in his case was restrained by his sympathy with those researches only that concerned the physical well-being of society , and his want of interest in the higher inquiries connected with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather clear-sighted than comprehensive ; what he saw at all he saw distinctly ; he grasped it with great tenacity , and adhered to it with a firmness of purpose which was a proof both of the penetration of his vision and the energy of his will . But unlike them , he was not fond of the glitter of paradox , h*id no rage for mere innovation , and in what direction soever he subverted , was prepared with materials and instruments in hand , to undertake the labor of reconstruction . Accordingly he was not content with merely picking to pieces the fabrics raised by those who had gone before him , but in all instances set about rebuilding what he had dostroyed , // on the very spot of its former glory . He was acute , subtle , and well-informed in the particular sphere in which he labored . He was extensively possessed of all that had been written and said upon the problems of Political Economy . A life of alternate practical observation and abstract study had imparted to him a knowledge of details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By practice as a writer upon general subjects , he became skilful in the art of communicating the results of his meditations to others , and habits of literary intercourse had taught him the secrets of simplicity , grace and ease of style , an attainment quite as necessary to the construction of a great work on any science , as diligence of research , compass of view , or soundness of reasoning . With small deference for authority , he had still enough of it to keep him from fantastic theorizing , and to give his writings that practical cast which obtain for them a ready hearing in the audience of general society . Had he been more abstruse , he would have been less popular , and had he been less bold , he would have been not so much adapted to the spirit and tendency of his age . His wreat work is a formal treatise on the science of national wealth . It is divided into five parts , under the minor arrangements of which he has managed to touch almost all the questions that relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first book is devoted to an exposition of the causes that assist the productive powers of labor , and of the laws which regulate the distribution of the results of that labor among the different classes composing the community . this topic , it will be perceived , includes the question as to the effect of the division of employments , the functions and uses of money , the nature and influences of price , the wages of industry , the profits of capital , the rent of land , and the various subordinate inquiries involved in the more general subjects . The second book is but an expansion of the first , on so much of his theme as comprehends an investigation of the nature , accumulation , and employment of stock . He explains the different kinds of capital , the methods by which it is increased , the origin of interest , and the comparative profits of the many branches of enterprise in which capital is used . The third is more theoretical in its views , designed to illustrate by a series of observations and arguments the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial industry are gradually renewed . The fourth book is an examination of pre-existing systems of political economy , in which the principles of free-trade are developed at length , particularly in their application to the fetters placed upon external commerce and internal production . And the fifth book treats of the revenue of the sovereign , by which is meant the principles which govern taxation and the other modes usually resorted to for supplying the expenses of government . In each of these books there are numerous and extended digressions on points suggested in the course of treating the more general topics . Some of these unfold his most important doetrines , // and are all valuable , if not for the science they contain , at least for the variety of learning and beauty of illustration in which they abound . But Smith is not to be taken as an infallible guide . There are defects as well as excellencies in his work . Of the former , are commonly specified his want of precision in language , his irregular and confused arrangement , his frequent discusiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his leaning to the doctrines of the Economists , and his great errors as to the nature of the value and the origin of rent , which modify , perplex , and distort several of his most radical conclusions . these are , however , defects easily obscured in the splendor of those services which he rendered to his chosen science . Had he done no more than adorn a dry and distasteful subject with the blandishments of rhetoric , mankind would have been indebted to him for a vast amount of pleasure and instruction . But he did more . He was the first to appreciate the vital importance of carefully analysing the phenomena of wealth . He was the first to apply to them that experimental method which raised physical science from the dunghill to the temple . He was the first to detect and demonstrate the absurdities of those older systems which had so long held the world in bondage , reigning alike with supreme authority over the meditations of the philosopher , the plans of the merchant , and the prejudices oft he vulgar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its simplicity and beauty , the eternal doctrine of Free Trade . He laid hold of the matter at its roots . He dismissed from his mind all that others had done or fancied they had done . He began a career of independent investigation . He went thoroughly into its depths . He scattered the mists which had been collected in the dawn of thought . He put to flight the bug-bears and monsters conjured up by the warm imagination of heated partisans . He dragged to light all the mysteries that were thought to lurk behind the principles of commerce . He established on immutable foundations the safety , the profitableness , the moral uses , of an unrestrained prosecution of industry , and an unfettered intercourse among nations . That the restraints imposed upon commerce were an evil , that they were founded in the narrowest spirit of selfishness , and supported by the shallowest reasons of ignorance , that they were clogs to enterprise as well as obstacles to civilization , that they depressed the physical energies of a people , while they retarded their social advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either as intelligent , benevolent , progressive . or even trading creatures , he proved by a logic so infrangible , and illustrations so clear , that to this day it has baffled the most ingenious intellects to resist the force of his reasonings or find a flaw in his doctrines . this is , then , his pre-eminent distinction . He was the apostle of Free Trade . As Paul had carried Christianity into // all the cities of the heathen world , and as Bacon had applied the torch of a true method to the logomachies of the schoolmen , so Smith lifted up the light of the glorious principle of Free Trade , in the midst of the hosts who rallied around the banners of monopoly and restriction . In this he has shown himself a benefactor of the race that must take rank among the greatest . And the higher the attainments of society in wisdom , charity , and justice , the more vividly will it retain the remembrance of his services and worth . Of those who have followed in the path of Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom have been generally accorded the merit of the most distinguished place . The former , by his inquiries into the subject of population , and by the discussions to which those inquiries gave rise , opened a comparatively new field for investigation , and added to the number and interest of the problems which belong to the science . He attempted to unfold the relation which subsists between the procreating principle of human nature , and the productive powers of the earth . A long series of observations , drawn from the experience of man under all the circumstances of his condition , led him to the conclusion that the tendency of population is to outrun the means of its subsistence , and that consequently unless the productive powers of the soil were augmented , poverty , destitution , and famine were the inevitable lot of a certain portion of the human race . His view was fortified by numberless facts taken from the history of the ancient nations , of the ravages of diseases , of the desolations of war , and of the consequences of emigration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind ; a host of opponents instantly rose up against it . They questioned the fundamental principles of Malthus , they denied his inferences , and to this day , they hold a divided empire with the modified opinions which later writers have introduced . Without attempting to decide the contest , it will be admitted by the adherents of both parties , that whatever may be said of the truth of Malthus 's doctrines , they have awakened a new and keener interest in economical science , and expanded the sphere of its investigations . Mr. Ricardo , if he has not rendered the same , has rendered an equal service . By the acuteness and penetration of his intellect , by the mathematical accuracy of his logic , his searching and unsparing analysis , and the independence with which he has traced all the phenomena of wealth to their remotest relations , has won and deserved the rank of the most accomplished and influential modern teacher of the science . The American writers upon Political Economy have made but few advances upon the developements of their English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started as to the truth of one or two particular doctrines , but generally , such as the science exists in foreign treatises , it has been received in this country We can not think , however , that the discussions , to which our recent // commercial experience has given rise , have unfolded certain applications of old truths , that are a vast improvement upon the principles which obtain in the old world . The carrying of the doctrines of free trade into the business of banking is a new , and , it strikes us , a most important , application of an admitted scientific fact . We are not informed to whom the honor of originally suggesting the idea is due , but we first met with it , enforced with great vigor of logic , in a political journal , the Evening Post , published in New York , under the editorial management of William Leggett , one of those fearless thinkers and writers of whom the world sees an example only two or three times in the course of a century , and of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauty of his poetry , the extent of his attainments , and the dignity and elegance of his prose writings . The suggestion itself is worthy of the profoundest attention of legislators , and that class of the community most interested in a sound and stable currency . No nation has had a more instructive experience on the subject of currency than the United S tates . One scheme of banking after another has been tried , with the same result , an utter failure . The plan of a national bank has been found to be inconsistent with the prosperity , morals , and iiberti*s of the country . Banks created by the States , under a vast variety of regulations , have failed in accomplishing the prime object of their creation , that of furnishing a sound and equable circulating medium . There is , therefore , no other resort but to leave the business of discounting and circulating notes , where almost all other kinds of business are left , to the control of individual sagacity and enterprise . It is a gross mistake , a we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature to be more necessary here , than in the other branches of trade . Had we space , and did it consist with the design of the present article , this point could be made clear . Meanwhile let the following observations suffice : 1 . Charters of incorporation , apart from political objections , are an endorsement , by the state , of the solvency and character of the corporators , which gives a fictitious value to their issues over and above what is due to them on account of their real and personal worth . This enables them to force more money into circulation than the natural wants of society require , and thus facilitates the fatal tendency to excessive speculation . 2 . Every capitalist has a natural right to dispose of his property and his credit in the manner he thinks best , provided he does not infringe the equal rights of others ; and , according to the acknowledged principles of free trade , while promoting his own advantage is most likely to advance the interest of the community at large . 3 . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only could establish confidence enough to procure a free circulation for their bills . voL. viii . NO. xxxlv. - ocToBER , 1840 . T // 4 . Such men are the best qualified , having a great interest at stake , to decide upon the claims of men applying to them for accommodations. 5 . Banking would be more precisely adjusted to the business of the country , because there would be fewer inducements to , and no opportunities for , excessive issues , personal liability and interest lessening the former , and unlimited competition destroying the latter . And 6 . The greater part of the ordinary circulation would consist of the metals , while paper would be appropriated to its rightful sphere , the heavier transactions of trade . These principles , too briefly stated perhaps to he apprehended in all their force , we hold to be no less important than correct , and are destined to a general adoption by society , if not by the power of reasoning , by the compulsion of circumstances . Artificial modes of business-and what can be more artificial than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prepare the way for more natural arrangements . The long series of terrific explosions to which our commerce has been exposed , can not close so long as the chief cause is permitted to remain . That cause is the attempt to regulate , through the awkward contrivances of legislation , what if left to itself would work as smoothly and beneficially as the unperverted mechanism of the human system . The interference of quacks and bunglers is the signal for derangement . There is enough in these brief historical references to show us that the advancement of society consists in the gradual approaches made to a general adoption of the doctrines of economical science . As it has thrown aside one restraint after another , and ascended step by step in the scale of well-being , it has only illustrated the truth of those great principles which science had long before developed . Theory has ever anticipated practice ; for the deductions of individual men precede the convictions of the mass . It is on this account never dangerous for society to strive to realize the condition which just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being dangerous , indeed , it is the dictate alike of wisdom and of policy to pursue the course indicated and sanctioned by admitted scientific principles . In Political Economy , for instance , we are of opinion that it would be for the highest good of society , to put in instant practice the important maxims composing the body of that science . We believe it would be good , because the relations of society would in that way be brought into closer correspondence with truth . He might take any one of its doctrines , and by showing its intimate connexion with the physical welfare , as well as with good order and morality , satisfactorily elucidate this point . The single principle of free trade is full of examples . That principle has a vital relation to much that concerns the happiness and moral elevation of man . It is important in its application to both the internal and external arrangements of a nation . Its practical acknowledgment would tend to the develope // ment and perfection of individual character . By throwing men upon their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of self-dependence and train them to habits of perseverance and economy . They would learn to value that labor which was the only source of their distinction . All modes of industry would be found to be equally necessary to comfortable social existence ; which would depress those jealousies springing from the supposition of the superiority of one class over another , and beget a mutual respect among those who were alike contributing to the necessities and enjoyments of their fellows . But the most valuable influence of freedom in the cho*ice and prosecution of pursuits would be in equalizing human conditions . there is something in men that renders them averse to the contemplation of a great disparity in the social state of beings obviously designed for a political state of equality . Distinctions , whatever maybe thecause that produces them , breed ill-will and discontent , separating classes from all interchange of sympathies , and making the one arrogant and overbearing , and the other envious , restless , and bitter . So strong are these feelings that the most powerful restraints of education and self-discipline are often too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , to *liffuse through it universal and permanent friendly feelings , to soften manners , to introduce courtesy in intercourse , the laws , customs , and methods of trade which fetter one man while they facilitate another must be altogether abrogated . Place men upon an equal footing , as to the advantages of social life , and you cement the bonds of society and refine the tone of its manners . By creating a greater mutual dependence , you increase mutual respect . And the same is true in regard to the intercourse of nations . Nothing has done more to separate distant peo*e , than the restraints laid by the policy of government upon the most perfect freedom of commerce . It has converted the world , from what it should be , the home of a vast family of brothers , into a slaughter-house for indiscriminate and reckless butchery . This truth has not been dwelt upon enough by political writers , and can not be too strongly impressed upon public attention . Let us , therefore , devote the remainder of this paper to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement of national civilization and peace . The restraints imposed upon commerce are , we repeat , productive of the worst moral effects . Tariffs , navigation laws , duties , restrictive regulations of whatever name , and for whatever purpose they are established , are hostile to the highest interests of all the parties concerned . The very base upon which they rest is laid in falsehood and ill-will . All systems of restrictions begin with the idea that nations are of necessity adversaries . Whereas the truth is , that nations are naturally friends . Every arrangement of Providence indicates that they were intended to live in harmony . Nations are but aggregates of individual l*eings , endowed with the same affections , hopes , and fears , &amp;ul*jects of // the same earthly fortune , heirs of the same destiny , and members of one broad indissoluble brotherhood . Whatever may have been the design of that diversity of condition that prevails among men , it was not that they should be enemies . In all that concerits the grand and permanent characteristics of their nature they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with which no contrivances of policy , no requirements of government , and no claims of kindred can dispense . Mankind are parts of a great fraternity , superior in many respects to commonwealths or families , and imposing , by its broader relations , duties to which those imposed by relations more feeble and confused must inevitably give way . It is true , men are placed in different . circumstances of life ; that in their capacities , their characters , and their local position , there is a contrast almost as marked as that between themselves and the brute ; that they are born under different skies , live after a different plan , imbibe different principles , and die with different hopes ; but these are diversities which , though they may create a repugnance of sentiment and an uncongeniality of taste , are no justifications of deep and unrelenting hostility . They were intended for other purposes than the gratification of feelings of mutual antipathy . They are the source of blessings , both economical and moral , of an elevated kind . Diversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the multiplicity of human enjoyments. the niggardness of one region is compensated by the luxuriance of another ; if the south yields its generous fruits , the north offers its useful ores ; the agriculture of one place is returned for the manufactures of a second , while the commerce of a third accomplishes the labor of the exchange . Political divisions concentrate the strength of scattered individuals ; they facilitate the administration of public affairs ; they adapt social institutions and laws to the relative degress of social advancement made by various people , and assist in training nations to virtue by the discipline of change and progress . There are , therefore , better reasons for the diversity of which we have spoken than that nations may make war upon each other . Separation and unlikeness are not necessarily antagonism . Enmity is the afterthought of selfish statesmen , who are cradled in prejudice or nursed in folly , and who come , under the influence of a corrupt ambition , to laugh at rectitude as a jest , and to sport with the happiness of millions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy which such men have originated that fills nations with bitter and passionate animosity . Let their own schemes be successful , they care not what becomes of the interest of the multitude . They tax and levy contributions without number and without end . They have waged wars , seized thrones , blotted out whole nations , convulsed the earth with feuds , and crimsoned its fair fields with blood . Year after year they have plunged the debased people deeper in degradation . Thus war and wo have been multiplied ; thus the estrangement between nations has widened so that long ages will // hardly close the gap ; arid thus the spirit of implacable enmity has been fostered , until it has become almost a matter for the sternest moral courage to assert the original relationship of men , to proclaim the duty of mutual respect , or to insist upon the supreme obligation of cherishing peace . Tariffs and commercial restrictions are modes in which this detestable spirit of enmity manife*ts itself . They are a part of an odious system of selfishness and seclusion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ordinations of Providence , and continued such by the necessities of their being . Surely a fouler libel upon God and humanity could not well be perpetrated . These restraints , by arresting national intercourse , diminish whatever of civilizing influence there is in commerce . Their very design is to render one people independent of others by the careful exclusion of all foreign products . An opinion prevails that a nation may be made competent to supply its wants solely from its own resources . qarried out , this opinion contemplates a state of perfect isolation , in which the various nations of the earth would be no more to each other than are the inhabitants of different spheres . Of course , commerce of any kind is inconsistent with the assumptions upon which this doctrine rests . If each nation is adequate of itself to supply its infinite wants , all other nations , so far as mutual alliance and intercourse is concerned , might cease to exist . As curiosities they may be interesting , but as the means of furnishing various products and enlarging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Like those frozen regions of the north which no eye sees , or those burning deserts of the south which no foot visits , they would be for all practical purposes the merest blanks of creation . The agency of commerce in dispensing civilization and refinement would be annihilated . What does the policy propose but to cut off that circulation and exchange of products among nations , which is as much their life and health as the circulation of the blood is the life and health of the body ? Whether it is adopted in practice on a larger or smaller scale , this is its effect to the extent in which it is adopted . Thinkers of all ages and of all nations agree in ascribing as much of the elevation and advancement of the human race to commerce , as to almost any other single cause . If they have been mistaken in their estimates of this influence , it is high time the minds of men were disabused of the error . On the other hand , if there is a reality in that influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extent of the benefits , and the best way of expanding them , and especially what obstructions are in the way of a more general propagation of them . Commerce strikes us as an important instrument of civilization , because it assists in the formation of those moral opinions and habits , which are essential to the right ordering of a commonwealth , and of that liberal spirit which is the spring of a generous foreign policy . The opulence it pours into the Lap of - enterprise is // the least of its advantages . We value it for its efficacy in enlarging the scope of human thought , expanding the sympathies , softening and refining the manners , and cherishing harmony and good-will among nations having so many occasions of discordancy . When a people are confined to their own narrow limits , bound up in the contemplation of selfish interests , engrossed wholly by partial aims , the range of their best feelings is circumscribed , they fall into contracted and intolerant modes of thought , and anything like expansion and loftiness of principle is never attained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whatever is of foreign origin is treated with contempt ; a rancorous and bigoted scorn of foreign improvements is engendered , and the whole people degenerate into a most ignoble and worthless character . China , with her natural wealth , with her immense population , with her facilities of intercourse , might , under an open policy , centuries since have awed the world by the grandeur of her power , at the same time that she blessed it with the munificence of her literary and moral acquirements . As it is , there are few so poor as do her reverence , Nations , like men , like families , to escape the evils of a most brutal ignorance *and selfishness , must depart occasionally from the small circle of their own peculiar interests , must mingle in the general strife , and take part in the common race for glory and power . A new life is then infused , old encumbrances are shaken off , every faculty is exerted , every muscle is strained , and the great task of improvement is undertaken resolutely . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wealth accumulates , elevated usages 6btain , and habits of industry infix themselves in the social economy . Nothing can be plainer than the mode in which these results are accomplished . Intercourse with others expands the sphere of thought . Knowledge removes the causes of many foolish and hurtful prejudices . The asperities of selfish feeling are worn away by constant contact . The principles of science and literature are in their nature diffusive , and national intimacy begets national forbearance and deference . For these reasons , commerce , from the earliest step made in national progress , has stimulated and strengthened every element of social growth . The first seats of civilization were on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , and along the gulfs and streams which were first navigated . When society threw off the despotism of the Middle Ages , its most quickening impulses were received from the spirit of adventure and trade which then began to animate men . The establishment of a mercantile class was the most effective encroachment made upon the tyranny of the nobility . Men of all orders rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very soon it grew powerful enough to assert its dignity and claim respect . Providence came to its aid , by forcing kings and nobles , impoverished by war , to solicit its friendship . Each day added to the consciousness // of its importance , until it swelled into a magnitude and strength that rivalled the powers that were before enslaving the world . Once established , society breathed freer ; the barbarous manners of the olden time were modified , prosperity advanced , and refinement extended its influence to every description of the people . As the spirit of commerce has spread , the blessings of civilized existence have been proportionably diffused . The manners of men have relaxed , and from the study of war they have turned to the cultivation of the gentler arts of peace . If , then , commerce is the handmaid of civilization , if it accustoms nations to peaceful pursuits , is it consistent with the highest interest of humanity to restrain its honorable exertions ? Every fetter imposed upon its perfect freedom of action postpones the prevalence of justice and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at enmity no more.
