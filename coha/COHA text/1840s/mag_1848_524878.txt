txt ALL created life exists under two as*ects , and includes in itself what may be denominated a two-fold form of being . In one view , it is something individual and single , the particular revelation as such , by which , in any given case , it makes itself known in the actual world . In another view , it is a general , universal force , which lies back of all such revelation , and communicates to this its true significance and power . In this form , it is an idea ; not an abstraction or notion simply , fabricated by the understandiug , to represent its own sense of a certain common character , belonging to a multitude of individual objects ; bjut the inmost substantial nature of these objects themselves , which goes before them , in the order of existence , at least , if not in time , and finds its perpetual manifestation through their endlessly diversified forms . All life is at once ideal and actual , and in this respect , at once single and universal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a true subsistence and not a mere notion , ) to be without parts and without limits . It in6ludes in itself the possibility , indeed , of distinction and self-limitation ; but this possibility made real , is nothing more nor less than the transition of the idea over into the sphere of actual life . In itself , it is boundless , universal , and always identical . It belongs to the very conception of the actual world , on the other hand , that it hould exist by manifold distinction , and the resolution of the infinite and universal into the particular and finite . All life , we say then , is at one and the same time , as actual and ideal , individual also , and general ; something strictly single , and yet something absolutely universal . These two forms of existence are opposite , but not , of course , contradictory ; their opposition involves , on the contrary , the most intimate and necessary union . The ideal is not the actual , and the actual is not , as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full negation of what is affirmed in the other ; and still they can not be held for one moment asunder . The ideal can have no reality , except in the form of the actual ; and the actual can have no truth , save as it is filled with the presence of the ideal . Each subsists only by inseparable union with its opposite ; each is indispensable to the other , as the complement of an existence , that could otherwise have no force . The bond which unites them , accordingly , is not mechanical and outward merely . The life in which they meet , is not to be regarded as , in any sense , two lives . The two forms of existence which it includes , are at the same time the power of a single fact , in whose constitution they are perfectly joined together , in an inward way . The ideal and the actual , the general and the particular , are both present in all life , not by juxtaposition or succession , but in such a way as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is both general and particular , at the same time  --  the ideal in the actual , and the actual in the ideal ; and each is what it is always , only by having in itself the presence of the other , as that which it is not . Take , for instance , the life of a particular plant or tree . Immediately considered , it is something single , answerable to the outward phenomenal form under which it is exhibited to the senses . But it is , at the same time , more also than this . lit becomes a particular plant or tree , in fact , only as it is felt to be the revelation of a life more comprehensive than its own , a life that appears in all plants and trees , and yet is not to be regarded as spln6ing from them , or as measured by them , in any respect . The gener* 1 veget* ble life is not simply the sum of the actual vegetation that is going forward in the world . It is before this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its growth for in its nature it has no bounds , while this last is always necessarily finite , made up of a definite number of individual existences . Still it is nothing apart from these existences , which serve to unfold its pres 406 April , // ence and power ; and which , in doing so , and only in doing so , come also to be what they are in truth . The life of each particular tree is thus at once the universal vegetable life , in which all trees stand , and the single manifestation to which this life has come in that particular case . Abstract from it the invisible , ideal , universal force or fact , which as a mere particular tree it is not , hut which belongs to it only in common with other trees , and you reduce its existence at once to a sheer nullity : an object absolutely single in the world , could never he anything more than a spectral prodigy for the senses . So also , if it be attempted to sunder the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save as it shows itself through particular plants and trees . The claims of the particular here , are just as valid and full , as the claims of the general . We have no right to push either aside , in order to make room for the other . The ideal or general can not suhsist without the actual or particular ; and it is equally impossible for this last to suhsist without the first . They can subsist both , only in and by each other ; and it is this mutual comprehension and inbeing of the two precisely , which gives life its proper realness and truth . The real is not the actual as such , nor the ideal as such , hut the actual and ideal perfectly blended together , as the presence of the same fact . The same order holds in the sphere of humanity . Every man comprehends in himself a life , which is at once both single and general , the life of his own person , separately considered , and the life at the same time of the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universal conception of humanity enters into him , as it enters also into all other men ; while he is , besides , this or that man , as distinguished from all others by his particular position in the human world . Here again , too , as before , the relation between the general and the particular or single , is not one of outward conjunction simply ; as though the man were , in the first place , complete in and of himself , and were then brought to stand in certain connections with other men , previously complete in the same way . His completeness as an individual involves of itself his comprehension in a life more general than his own . The first can have no place apart from the second . The two forms of existence are not the same in themselves , but they are indissolubly joined together , as constituent elements of one and the same living fact , in the person of every man . All this belongs to our constitution , considered simply as a part of the general system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organically one with it as the basis of his being . His life roots itself in this sphere , only to ascend hy means of it into one that is higher . It becomes complete at last , in the form of self-conscious , self-active spirit . The general law of its existence , as regards the point here under consideration , remains the same ; but with this vast difference , that what was mere blind necessity before , ruled by a force beyond itself , is now required to become the subject of free intelligence and will , in such way as to be its own law . It is as though the constitution of the world were made to wake within itself to a clear apprehension of its own nature , and had power at the same time to act forth its meaning by a purely spontaneous motion . Reason and will are concerned in the movement of the planet through its appointed orbit , in the growth of the plant , and in the activity of the animal ; but in all these cases , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The planet obeys a law , which acts upon it irrespectively of all consent on its own part . So in the c* se of the plant : it grows by a life which is comprehended in itself , but in the midst of all , it remains as dark as the stone that lies motionless by its side ; its life is the power still of a foreign force , which it can neither apprehend nor control . The animal can feel , and is able also to move itself from place to place ; yet in all this , the darkness of nature continues unsurmounted as before . The intelligen cc which rules the animal is not its own ; and it can not be said to have any inward possession whatever of the contents of its own life . This consummation of the world 's meaning is reached at last , only in the mind of man , which becomes thus , for this very reason , the microcosm or mirror , that reflects back upon the whole inferior creation its true , intelligible image . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and will , by which it 1848. 407 // is actuated , are required to enter into it fully , and to become , by means of it , in such separate form , self-conscious and self-possessed . This is the idea of personality , as distinguished from the conception of a simply individual existence in the form of nature . Man finds his proper being at last , only in such life of the spirit . Personality , however , in this case , does not supersede the idea of individual natural existence . On the contrary , it requires this as its necessary ground and support . The natural is the perpetual basis still of the intellectual and moral . The general character of life , therefore , in the view of it which is before us at this time , is not overthrown by this exalt* tion , as has been already intimated , but is only advanced by it into higher and more significant force . It still continues to revolve as before , between the two opposite poles , which we have found to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our contemplation the s me dualistic aspect , resulting from the action of these forces , whose inseparable conjunction at the same time forms its only true and proper unity . It is still at once actual and ideal , singular and universal ; only now the union of these two forms of existence is brought to be more perfect and intimate than before , by the intense spiritual fusion to which all is subjected in the great fact of consciousness . Consciousness is itself emphatically the apprehension of the particular and single , in the presence of the universal . The two forms of life flow together , in every act of thought or will . Personality is , by its very conception , the power of a strictly universal life , revealing itself through an individual existence as its necessary medium . The universal is not simply in the individual here blindly , as in the case of the lower world , but knows itself , also , and has possession of itself , in this form ; so far , at least , as the man has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own constitution . The perfection of his nature is found just in this , that as an individual , inseparably linked in this respect the world of nature , from whose bosom he springs , he shall yet recognize in himself the authority of rc* son , in its true universal character , and yield himself to it spontaneously as the proper form of his own being . Such clear recognition of the universal reason in himself , accompanied with such spontaneous assent to its authority , is that precisely , in the case of any human individual , which makes him to be at once rational and free . The person is necessarily individual ; but in becoming personal , the individual life is itself made to transcend its own limits , and maintains its separate reality , only by merging itself completely in the universal life which it is called to represent . Personality and moral freedom are , properly speaking , the same . By this last we are to understand simply , the normal form of our general human life itself . As such , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opposite poles , in a free way . In the sphere of nature this union is necessary and inevitable ; in the human spirit , it can be accomplished only by intelligent , spontaneous action , on the part of the spirit itself . The individual life in this form , with a full sense of its own individual nature , and with full power to cleave to this as a separate , independent interest , must yet , with clear consciousness and full choice , receive into itself the general life to which it of right belongs , so as to be filled with it and ruled by it at every point . Then we have a proper human existence . Moral freedom then , the only liberty that is truly entitled to the name , includes in itself two elements or factors , which need to be rightly understood , first , in their separate character , and then in their relation to each other , in order that this idea itself may he rightly apprehended . It is the single will moving with self-conscious free activity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which it comes to exist , are the sense of self on the one hand , and the sense of a moral universe on the other , the sense of independence , and the sense of authority or law . It is the perfect union of the single and the universal , the subjective and the objective , joined together as mutually necessary , though oppo*ite , polar forces in the clear consciousness of the spirit . Let us direct our attention now , for a moment , separately to e* ch of these great constituents of freedom . Freedom supposes , in the first place , entire iNl ) EPENDENcE on the part of its subject 408 April , // It can have no place accordingly , as we have already seen , in the sphere of mere nature . God is free in upholding and carrying forward the world , in this form , according to its appointed laws ; but the world itself is not free . Its activity is for itself altogether blind and necessary , accompanied with no self-apprehension , and including in itself no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no possible alternative but to obey ; while yet its obedience carries in itself no light or love , no intelligence or will . Nature is held in slavish bondage to its own law , as a power impressed upon it perpetually from abroad , and in no sense the product of its separate life . The earth rolls round the sun , the sap mounts upward in the tree , the dog pursues its game , with like subordination to a force by which they are continually mastered , without the least power to master in return . Animal impulse and instinct are no better here , than the plastb* power that fashions the growth of the plant . There is individual existence in each case , included in the bosom of a genera.l ideal life , and comprising action powerfully turned in upon itself ; but there is no independence : the subject of the action hangs always , with helpless necessity , on the action itself , and is borne passively along upon the vast objective stream of the world 's life , without concurrence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of self-conscious spirit , then , that individual independence becomes possible . Hence it involves two things , the light of intelligence and the power of choice . Both of these , in their very nature , refer to an individual centre , or self , from which their activity is made to radiate , and towards which , again , it is found continually to return . All knowledge begins and stands perpetually in the consciousness of self ; and every act of the will may be denominated , at the same time , an act of self-apprehension . It belongs to the conception of individual life universally , that it should be in itself a centre of the manifold activities by which it makes itself known . In the sphere of nature , this relation holds in the form only of a blind plastic law , or at least in the form of an equally blind instinct . In the sphere of consciousness , which is above nature , it is no longer blind , but clear . The subject is not simply an individual centre , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form first , it attains to what we call subjective independence . By means of intelligence , the individual self emerges out of the night of nature into the clear vision of its own existence , and is thus prepared to embrace itself as a separate living centre . It is no longer an object merely as before , acted upon from abroad , but is constituted a subject , in the strict sense of this term , having possession of itself , and capable of self-action . Mere intelligence , however , is not of itself independence . If a planet were endowed with the power of perceiving its own existence , without the least ability to modify it in the way of self-control , it is plain that it would be just as little independent as it is in its present state . Cox*-sciousness in absolute subjection to nature , would be , indeed , a species of bondage , that might be said to be even worse than that of nature itself . And so if the intelligence were ruled and actuated , not by nature , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result would be the same . No matter what the actuating force might be , if it were even the Divine will itself , which were thus introduced into the conscious life of the individual , so as to carry this along with overwhelming necessity in its own direction , the subject thus wrought upon from abroad , without the power of self-impulse , could not be regarded as having the least independence . The case calls for something more than mere intelligence . To this must be joined also the power of choice . The supposition , indeed , which has just been made , is in its own nature impossible . Reason and will necessarily involve each other ; and the light of intelligence , therefore , can never be sundered in fact , ( but only hypothetically , ) from the motion of choice . Self-consciousness is itself always self-action . Individual independence , we say , requires the power of choice ; that the selfconscious subject shall not be moved simply from abroad , but have the capacity of moving itself , as though it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be itself bound by a force which is foreign 1848. 409 // from its own nature , the man in whom it dwells can not be free . It lies in the very conception of freedom , that the subject of it should have power to choose his own action , and that this power should involve the possibility of his making a different choice from that which he is led to make in fact . He acts from himself , and for himself , and not in obedience merely to an extraneous power , whether in the sphere of nature , or in the sphere of spirit . The action springs truly and fully out of his own conscious purpose and design , and is strictly the product of that separate living nature which he calls himself . This is what Kant makes so much account of , in his philosophy , as the autonomy of the will . The idea is one of vast importance , notwithstanding the great abuse which has been made of it in his school . The will , in its very nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , it must be a law to itself , in such sense that its activity shall be purely and strictly its own in opposition to the thought of everything like compulsion exerted upon it from abroad . It is a world within itself , no less magnificent than th' t with which it is surrounded in the external universe ; and it may not b invaded by any form of power , that is not comprehended from the beginning in its own constitution . All such power , proceeding from earth , or bell , or heaven , must be counted heteronornic , nd contradictory to its nature . The will can endure no heteronomy . It must be autonomie , subjectively independent , the fountain of its own activity , wherever it is found in its true and proper exercise . This then is the first grand constituent of Moral Freedom . The idea implies universally the presence of an individual will , which , as such , is perfectly unbound from all heteronomic extraneous restraints , and carries in itself the principle of its own action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There can be no liberty where there is no subjective independence . But such autonomic will is not of itself at once , as some appear to think , the whole conception of f eedom . This requires nother constituent factor , no less essential than the first ; the presence , namely , of an objective universal LAw , by rhicih the individual will is of right bound , and without obedience to which it can never be true to its own nature . Self-consciousness is itself the power of a life that is general and universal , as well as individual . All life we have already seen to be the union of these two forms of existence in fact ; though in the sphere of nature , of course , the fact prevails only in an outward and blind way . With the light of intelligence , ho xvever , including in itself the force of self-apprehension and self-action , it must itself enter into the life of the subject under the same character . That is , the union of the general and individual must hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of this , in coming to know himself properly as an individual being , shall have at the same time the apprehension of a life more comprehensive than his own , and , indeed , truly universal , in the bosom of which his own is carried as the necessary condition of its existence . It is the complete sense of this , theoretically and practically felt , that gives us the fact of personality ; which is just the consciousness of an individual life , in the form of reason and will , as the universal truth of the world 's life . Reason can not be something merely particular or private . It is universal in its very nature . It is so theoretically , and it is so , also , of course , practically . In entering the sphere of thought and will , then , as distinguished from that of mere nature , man comes into conscious union with a life which is more than his own , and which exists independently altogether of his particular knowledge or choice . lie does not create it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sea of existence already at hand , and altogether objective to himself as a separate single subject ; while he knows it to be in truth , at the same time , the only proper form of his individual life itself subjectively considered . If this were not the case , there could be no room , in his case , for the idea either of intelligence or freedom . A purely particular or single intelligence would be *s blind as the stork , which knoweth , we are told , her appointed times in the heaven ; and a purely particular or single will , in like manner , would be as little free as the wind , which is said to blow where it listeth , or as a wave of the sea driven of the same wind , and tossed hither and thither without object 410 April , // or rule . Reason and will , to be truly subjective , must be apprehended always as truly objective , also , and universal . This necessity lies , as we have said , in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all personal life in the case of men . But the idea now of such universal reason and will , is itself the conception of law , in its deepest and most comprehensive sense . This is nothing more nor less than this boundless objective authority or necessity , in which the individual life of the human subject is required to enter freely that it may be complete . The law , in this character , is of course an idea , not an abstraction . It has in itself , accordingly , the two grand attributes of an idea , universality and necessity . Its universality is not simply this , that it represents collectively all individual wills , or objects of will . On the contrary , it excludes every sort of distinction and comparison . No individual will , as such , can enter into the constitution of the law . It is absolute , and one within itself , merely revealing its presence through the single wills into which it enters , without deriving from them at all its being and force . So , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be preserved in prosperity and order without it , or that the world itself may have been pleased to agree in establishing its authority as sacred . It is a necessity which is altogether unconditional , and which rests eternally and unchangeably in the nature of the law itself . As thus universal and necessary , the being of the law is infinitely real . It is not simply the thought or conception of what is right , not a name merely or mental abstraction representing a certain order of life which men are required to observe ; but it is the very forms of truth and right themselves , the absolutely independent power by which they exist in the world . As in the sphere of nature , the law is in no respect the product of the forces which are comprehended in nature itself , but forms rather the inmost life of its entire constitution , which could not consist at all if it were not held together by this bond ; so here in the sphere of free intelligence Rlso , it is by no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and free , can be upheld for a single hour . The world , in its moral no less than in its physical constitution , lives , moves and has its being , only in the presence of the law , as a real existence in no sense dependent upon it for its character . Not indeed as though it might be supposed to exist , with its own separate entity , in no connection with the actual world whatever . As the ideal life of nature , it can not be sundered from the actual manifestation in which this consists ; and as the absolute truth and right of the moral universe , it can not subsist except through the consciousness of the thinking and willing subjects of which this universe is composed . Abstracted from all subjective intelligence , its objective reality is reduced to a nullity . It is only in the form of reason and will , which have no being apart from selfconsciousness , that the law can have any true subsistence whatever . It supposes an intelligible and intelligent universe . But still it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its actual constitution . In the order of being , though not of time , it is older than the universe . Without reason and will there could be no law , and yet all reason and will stand in it from the very start , and can enter into no living subject whatever except from its presence , as their ulterior objective source and ground . Concretely real in this way , and not simply an abstraction , the law has its seat primarily , as Hooker expresses it , in the bosom of God . Not so , however , as if God might be supposed , in the exercise of any private arbitrary will of his own , to have devised and ordained it as a proper scheme after which to fashion the order of the universe . The universality of the law excludes , as we have already seen , the idea of all merely private or particular will , even though it were conceived to be in this form the will of God himself . God 's will , however , is not private or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense as is required by the nature of personality , but objective and universal at the same time ; these two forms of existence , subjective and objective , being with Him absolutely commensurate and identical . God is not the author of the law , as something standing out of himself and beyond himself ; he does not make it , as a man might 1848. // frame an instrument to serve some purpose which he has , under another form , in his own mind . Still , less , of course , may the law be said , in any sense , to make urn , as though it were a power before Him in authority , determining the manner of his existence . It has its being only in God and from God ; not however as something different from the Divine mind itself . It is the necessary form of God 's infinitely wise and holy will , as exercised in the creation and support of the actual universe , considered both as nature and spirit . Thus resident primarily in the Divine will , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in its objective character , passes over into the actual order of the world , and reveals itself here also as a power to be acknowledged and obeyed , under the most real and concrete form . In the sphere of nature the universal and *ingular are brought together , not directly and immediately , but through the medium of the partiGular , constituting what we denominate the species or kind , as distinguished from the genus . Thus the tree is not what it is , by receiving into itself at once the universal vegetable life ; but only as this life has previously undergone a distinction within itself , by which it may be recognized as vegetation under this or that specific form ; it can become a tree , only as it puts on at the same time the type of some particular tree , locust , for instance , or ash , or elm , so as to be known accordingly in this character and no other . And just so in the sphere of the moral world , where the law has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not carried over at once into the consciousness of each individual subject in an original and independent way ; but the case requires necessarily that it should , in the first place , resolve itself into certain particular orders or forms of authority , through which intermediately its presence may afterwards thus actualize itself in full for the single will . As no single man is the human race , but only a part of it , having the truth of his being in the organic relations by which he is comprehended , through the family and state , in the whole ; so the law , which is an objective rule and measure for the whole , and only for the parts as comprehended in this , and not as sundered from it , can never come near to any man in the way of an absolutely singular and exclusive revelation . It can reach him really , only by passing through the organic system , in which alone it takes cognizance at all of his existence . Under such view , it has an actual concrete being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very constitution of its rational and moral life , as imbodied in the form of human society and made to reveal itself continually in the process of human history . Such , we say , is the conception in general of the law , which is the other grand factor or constituent of Moral Freedom ; the first having exhibited itself to us before in the necessary independence or autonomy of the individual subject . It remains now to consider how these two great forces are joined together in its constitution . Separately considered , they seem tio oppose and overthrow each other . If the will be absolutely autonomic and independent in its subjective character , how can it be absolutely bound at the same time by a force that comes from beyond itself , the purely objective authority of law ? And if it be thus bound , placed under necessity , comprehended in a power which is broader than itself , and older than itself , how can it be said to be in any proper sense its own law , and the fountain of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here can escape the power of this contradiction . If we suppose the single will to be , in the first place , something complete by itself , and then think of the law as existing in the same separate way , each including in itself the claims which belong to it , as they have now been described , the two conceptions must nece*-sarily contradict each other , and can not be brought in such form to any true reconciliation . If the subject feel himself in mere juxtaposition with the law , having it over against his consciousness as a form of existence different from his own , it will not be possible for him to assert his own independence , without resenting and resisting the pretensions of the law at the same time , as a heteronomic , foreign force . Nor will it be possible for the law , in the same circumstances , to acknowledge or respect the independence of the human April , // subject . It must necessarily assume the tone of command , arraying against him the majesty of its own everlasting nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thou shalt , crushing his liberty completely to the earth . In such a relation , there is no room for the idea of moral freedom . It is slavish in its very nature . The liberty which the subject may still pretend to assert for himself , becomes necessarily licentiousness and sin ; while , on the other hand , any obedience he may seem to yield to the law , as being thus forced and external , can have no reality or worth in the view of the law itself . Such is the relation which holds in fact between human consciousness and the law in a state of sin . The two forms of existence are still incapable of being absolutely sundered ; but they are bound together only in an outward , unfree way . The law can not relax its right to rule the sinner 's will ; but it stands over him merely in the attitude of despotic commination . The sinner , too , can never emancipate himself entirely from the sense of the law , for that were to lose his hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over against him only as an objective might , in whose favor he is required to renounce the separate self , which he has come to regard as his true and proper life . Hence continual rebellion only , and continual guilt . The law , in such circumstances , has no power to bring light or freedom , strength or peace , into the soul . It is necessarily the ministration only of sin and death . Emphatically it works wrath . In distinction from all such merely outward and mechanical conjunction of the two opposing forces , liberty and authority , from which can proceed at best only a powerless , unfree morality , the true idea of human freedom , we say now , requires their internal organic union as constituent elements of one and the same life . The opposition of the two forces , in this case , remains in its full strength ; each is left in the possession of its separate independent character ; neither is permitted to exclude or overwhelm the other ; but the opposition is simply that which belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that they may , at the same moment , be drawn together with the greater force , and whose union , as it is the result , is also the indispensable condition always of the separation out of which it grows . Such polar distinction enters , in fact , into the very idea of concrete existence . Where there is no distinction , there can be no concretion , but only meaningless and powerless abstraction , or , at best , the ideal possibility of an existence which has not yet become real . Distinction , however , involves opposition , or the setting of one thing over against another . Only where this has taken place , then , is there any room for the union that all proper reality implies . But such union shows the two sides thus sundered , to he at the same time necessary to each other . The opposition is polar only , and as such conservative and not destructional . All organized , concrete existence , physical or spiritual , will be found to carry in itself a polarity of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the point in hand , by referring again to the constitution of life , as we have already found it to hold in the sphere of mere nature . The ideal and the actual , a universal generic nature on the one hand , and a particular single existence on the other , enter jointly into the constitution of every plant that springs froni the bosom of the earth . These two forces , at the same time , are in their own character truly different and distinct . Their distinction takes the form of actual , direct opposition . What the one is , the other is not . Each is in itself the negation in full of the other . And yet they are here brought perfectly together , in the constitution of the same life ; not by mechanical juxtaposition , but in the way of mutual interpenetration and interfusion , so that each is made to grow into the other , and by such concrescence only , comes to be at last what it is found to be in fact . The two sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opposition to each other is by no means abolished in such sense as to be taken wholly out of the way ; it still exists , but it exists as something comprehended in a higher action , which is , at the same time , the perfect union and reconciliation of the forces from which it springs . The opposition is polar . The union is organic . Bring all this into the sphere of con1848. 413 // sciousness , so that the union in question shall be , not blind and unavoidable , but the movement of clear , spontaneous intelligence , acting from itself and for itself , and we have the conception of Moral Freedom . The existence here is not a mere object , wrought upon by an action strange to itself , but a subject which has come to be possessed of its activity as the very form of its own being . It is as though the planet , moving in its appointed orbit , were made to awake within itself to the clear knowledge of its own nature , with full power at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to itself might seem best ; while it should still continue true notwithstanding , as before , to the path prescribed for it , no less bound by objective law , but bound always only by its own consent . Should such a rational planet , in the exercise of its liberty , strike off from its orbit , affecting to play the part of some wandering comet , it must , in the same moment , become unfree ; as much so , at least , as when carried forward in its true course by the force of mere blind natural law . Only the power of choice making it possible for it to become a comet , but yet spontaneously embracing the true planetary motion in fact , identilied thus with the sense of law , could constitute it the subject of freedom . Neither as bound simply , nor as simply unbound , would the planet be free ; but only as bound and unbound , at the same time , and in the same continuous action ; the two forms of existence joined together as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness ; the law coming to its proper expression only in the independence of the subject , and the independence of the subject having no reality , save under the form of obedience to the law . What may be thus imngined in the case of a planet , to illustrate the conception in hand , is the very constitution of man in his normal state . He is formed for freedom , and becomes complete only in this character , by the possibility he carries in himself of such a living , conscious free union , as has now been mentioned , of the great polar forces of the world 's life . He has a will of his own , and he is at the same . time under a law which is not himself ; he is conscious of both , as making realities in his existence ; and , to crown all , he is capable of so acknowledging both , that they shall actually grow into each other as the same consciousness . The union of the two powers , in such case , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the flowing together of the ideal and actual , in the constitution of a plant or tree ; only with the difference , that what is blindly necessary there , has become here the self-comprehending activity of the living nature itself . This is Freedom . In no other form can it exist for men at all . It is the action of the individual will , moving of its own accord and apart from all compulsion , in the orbit of the law , with clear sense of its authority , and clear private election in its favor , at the same time . This implies , of course , that the will is of the same nature with the law . They are thus related , in fact , as we have already seen . In obeying the law , the will obeys in reality its own true constitution ; as much so as fire does , for instance , in exhibiting the properties which show it to be fire , and not water . So , in breaking away from the law , it necessarily becomes false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent contradiction is resolved in the idea of freedom as now described . Authority involves necessity , while liberty is the very opposite ; and still both are here inseparably joined together , in such way , indeed , that neither can exist at all , in its true form , without the other . Freedom , in order that it may be free , must be bound . But in this case it is self-bound ; not arbitrarily , however , to a rule of its own invention , which would be again to be unfree , but in obedience to the law , as the necessary form of its own existence . The will of the subject is ruled by a force that comes from beyond itself , and yet it is strictly autonomic at the same time ; even as the rose blooms forth always its proper single life , though it is only as filled with the general law of vegetation that it has power to bloom at all . The law so enters the subject , as to become within him a continually self-originated obligation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to find in it no foreign constraint whatever . Such is the proper theory of human freedom , whether considered as religious or as simply political . It is formed by the union of liberty and authority , so joined together that neither is allowed to exclude 414 // or oppress the other ; the two constituting thus the force of a single life . Where this inward organic conjunction of the elements now named is wanting , one of them either excluding the other altogether , or at best enduring its presence only in an outward way , the whole idea must be to the same extent necessarily overthrown . It matters not , in such case , which of the two factors may thus prevail at the cost of its opposite , the result will be the same . In the one direction , we shall have authority turned into despotism ; in the other , liberty converted into licentiousness ; both alike fatal to all true freedom . To be wholly bound , and to be wholly unbound , come here to the same thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery . The world has a continual tendency to fall over , either to one or the other of these extremes . Thus we have , on one side , authority coupled with blind obedience , and on the other a spirit of insurrection against all legitimate rule , making up to a great extent the history of human life . Our own age leans especially towards the extreme of exalting individual liberty at the expense of just authority . Time has been , when the whole civilization of the world showed an opposite character . It was necessary indeed , in the nature of the case , that the process of our modern culture , the fruit of Christianity , and the only culture that may be regarded as worthy of the name , should commence in this way . Its foundations were to be laid deep , in the first place , in the sense of law and a corresponding spirit of obedience to its authority . Long ages of discipline IArere required for this purpose , in the course of which it was hardly possible that wrong should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undue depression of its opposite element , the liberty of the individual subject . The discipline became , in fact , as we all know , tyrannical and oppressive just in this way , by refusing to recognize the rights of those who were subjected to it , as the time of their minority came to an end , and made it proper that these rghts should be brought into full and free exercise . Instead of making it their business to train their subjects for personal independence , the true design of all sound government , both Church and State pursued the policy only of repressing every aspiration in this direction , and sought to hold the world in perpetual vassalage to mere power on their own side ; as though a parent , long accustomed to rule his children with absolute control , should , at last , insist on extending over their full adult life itself the same kind of rule , without any regard whatever to the wants and capabilities of their advanced state . The relation between authority and obedience became , in this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asunder , as though each belonged to a different sphere from the other . The authority claimed to be of divine force for itself , under a fixed outward form ; while the merit of obedience was supposed to lie in its blind , uninquiring subjection to the will thus imposed upon it from abroad . In one word , the claims of the subjective were overwhelmed , and well nigh crushed by the towering pretensions of the objecfive . No wonder that this extreme should at length become insupportably onerous to the ripening consciousness of the Christian world . it opened the way gradually for a powerful reaction towards the opposite side . This gave birth finally , when the fullness of time had come , to the great fact of the Reformation ; which may be regarded as a solemn Declaration of Independence , on the part of the human mind , against the tyranny by which it had been wronged for centuries , in the name of religion and law . A grand epoch certainly , in the history of the world 's life , whose consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . These belong of course , not simply to the Church in a separate view , but to every sphere , whether of thought or action , that is comprehended in our common human existence . Art , science , government , and social life , all have been affected by the change . A new stadium is in progress , for the universal life of the world ; having for its object now the full assertion of what may be styled the subjective pole of freedom , in opposition to the long historical process that went before , in favor of its opposite side . Protestantism is the fountain thus of all modern liberty , religious and political alike , Its tendency has been , from the beginning , to break the chains of authority 1848. 415 // as previously established , and to engage the human mind to a bold vindication of its own rights in opposition to all blind obedience of whatever kind . Nor is it to be imagined at all , that the new position which has been reached in this way , can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed before . The period of blind submission to the sense of the objective , whether in Church or State , when priest and king were held to be superior by divine right , to the divine constitutioa itself by which they were created , we may well trust , has forever passed away . But it does not follow at once from this , that the past was all wrong , or that the present is all right . A just consideration of history would lead us rather to suppose , that the new direction it has taken , may itself be liable to abuse , in a way answerable to the wrong whinh existed before on the opposite side ; which would nGt imply certainly , that we must fall back again to the things we have happily left behind , but only that we should so far right our course , as to steer clear of the rocks that threatea us from either side , and so press forward to the true and proper destiny of our race . That the principle of iiAividual liberty has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in some cases , in the progress of the Protestant era , is acknowledged on all sides ; and it needs no very profound or extensive observation , to see that our own age in particular is peculiarly exposed to danger just in this direction . It leans constitutionally towards an undue assertion of the prerogatives of the individual life , over against the idea of authority as something absolute and universal . False liberty , inthis form , does not consist , of course , in the open rejection of the law in itself considered . On the contrary , it usually affects to make great account of the law ; but it is always only in a mechanical and outward way . The law is not viewed as a necessary constituent of freedom itself , but simply as an outward rule and measure of its supposed rights . The subject starts with his own independence as an interest full and complete in its separate character , and obeys the law accordingly in his way , not by entering it as a life beyond himself , but by requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . He has no conception of freedom as the union of liberty and authority . It is for him , at last , the exercise only of separate personal independence on his own part . By the right of private judgment , he means to assert the right of thinking for himself regardless of the thoughts of all other men ; and so also in the case of private will . He does not deny , indeed , that truth and right are universal in their nature , and as such not to be created or controlled by his particular mind . But the authority which belongs to them in this view , remains for him always more or less a mere abstraction . It does not come near to him under a concrete form , in the actual constitution of the world with which he is surrounded . He is without reverence accordingly for the powers by which it is properly represented . He sees nothing divine in history . The Church is to him the mere aggregation of a certain amount of private thinking on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of its own members , standing by their permission , and liable of right to be taken down by them , or changed into a new form , at their own good pleasure . All this involves , of course , an immense error ; though it is one which it must ever be difficult to bring home clearly to the consciousness of the popular mind . Liberty without law is licentiousness , whether in the sphere of thought or will ; and law , to be real , must be the sense of a general concrete authority , actually comprehended in the constitution of the living world to which we belong . Where this may be wanting , it is not possible that there can be any true religious or political freedom . The exaltation of private independence , the rights of the individual as they are called , at the cost of all proper objective authority , is just as fatal here as the exaltation of authority at the cost of individual rights . There is a vast amount of cant and falsehood abroad on this subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which we have need to stand continually upon our guard . With any right conception of the nature of freedom as now explained , it will not be possible for us , on the other hand , to fall in with the views of those who would persuade us that the only remedy for the 416 April , // qwq at all times a very shallow philosophy , though it be unfortunately very common , which can see contradiction only in the polarity now mentioned , and is urged accordingly to affirm and deny with regard to it , in such a way as to exclude the possibility of any reconciliation between the tendencies thus opposed . No authority can be moral that does not seek liberty as its end ; and no liberty can be free that is not filled with the sense of authority as the proper contents of its own life . That it may be difficult to bring this theory of freedom into practice , is readily admitted ; but this forms no proper argument against the truth and value of the theory itself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it belongs . Still , however , there is no other way in which it is possible for the end to be . secured that is here in view . Man must be at once independent and bound , self-governed , and yet obedient to authority , in order that he may at all fulfil his own destiny , in distinction from the system of mere nature with which he is surrounded . For this he is to be educated and formed , under the influences which are comprehended in human society for the purpose . He comes not to moral freedom at once , but is required to rise to it by regular development , out of the life of nature in which his existence starts , and in which it continues always to have its root . In our present circumstances , moreover , the process is greatly embarrassed and obstructed by a false law of sin , which is found too plainly seated in our constitution . It becomes accordingly a most complicated problem , to bring our common human life , in this view , into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs through the history of the world 's entire social constitution , from the beginning of time to its end . The family , the State , and the Church , are all comprehended alike in the service of this great design . They surround the human subject with the force of law from the cradle to the grave , and from the rudeness of savage life onward through all stages of subsequent social refinement ; but it is only that he may be educated for the full use finally of his own proper personal independence , in set free from all bondage , whether objective or subjective , by the clear spontaneous union of his private will with the law to which it is necessarily bound . It lies in the very conception of this vast educational process , including as it does not only all stages of the single life from infancy to old age , but all stages also of the general ethical life in the progress of nations , that the two great compound forces by which the problem of freedom is in the course of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate action , a constantly fluctuating relation ; the pressure of authority being necessarily greater , and the sense of independence less , in reverse proportion to the actual development of the true idea of freedom in the subject . Here , of course , a wide field is thrown open for the exercise of political and ethical science , in determining the claims of duty and right , as related to each other in any given stadium of morality . On this , however , we are not called now to enter . It may be sufficient to conclude with the general rule , drawn from the whole subject , that no one can be true ethically to his own position , whether as a child or as a man , high or low , rich or poor , in power or out of power , who , in the use of his liberty , whatever it may be , is not ruled at the same time by a sentiment of reverence for the idea of an objective authority extended over him in some form , in the actual social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for authority , is to have always to the same extent the spirit of a slave . In no other element is it possible to think what is true , or to act what is right.
