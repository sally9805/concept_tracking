txt In discussing this question it must be premised , that it assumes as conceded , that neither the acknowledgment of Texan independence , nor the annexation of Texas , was wrongful , or furnished any just cause for Mexico to commence war against the United States ; and that Texas was defacto et dejure an independent state ; for if these three points be decided against the United States , Mexico stands justified before the world for her course in the whole Texan controversy ,  --  the march of the United States army to Corpus Christi , was as much an act of war as the march to the Rio Grande , and the act in question would be entirely immaterial . Assuming , then , the rightful independence of Texas as a state or nation , what was its western limit ? 1st . Had it any limits ? 2d . If it had , were they the Nueces or the Rio Grande ? 3d . If it had no limits , had it a right , under the circumstances , to fix them and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ? 4th . If it had not the latter right , was it justi*ed by the law of nations in advancing its army to the Rio Grande , in consequence of the hostile or threatening position and conduct of Mexico ? None will deny that the rights of the United States in this respect were precisely the same after the annexation , as those of Texas before . More might be expected from the magnanimity of the one which was strong , than the other which was weak ; but , as respected a strict justification of acts towards Mexico , both stood just alike . Regarding the annexation as peaceful , and not changing the relations between thn United States and Mexico , it must also be considered that no war existed between Texas and Mexico , for if war did exist between the two , then , the annexation itself , being a union with one of two belligerents , was an act*of war , and this question of boundary would not arise . If war did exist , and no boundary had ever been settled , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it could , and fix its boundary whenever it pleased , until the other should be disposed to enter into a just treaty to establish one . Had Texas , as admitted into the United States , any western limits , and if so , what were they ? Had it " a local habitation , " as well as " a name ? " The same Congress which declared its independence , in March 1*3G , declared the Rio Grande the boundary from its mouth to its source . That this was the setting up of a new state from part of an old one ; that it was just as rightful to declare the independence and jurisdiction to extend to the Rio Grande as to any other line not actually occupied by those who declared it ; that it was just as good a title to the country up to that line as to any other part of it , can hardly be denied , As to any settlement or portion of // the people within the limits specified who did not join the new state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the jurisdiction of Mexico unimpaired ; and that those on the left bank of the Rio Grande which remained under the laws and jurisdiction of Mexico , continue ( l rightfully to belong to the latter . Suppose that the inhabitants along the west bank of the Sabine had chosen not to participate in the new organization , and never displaced the Mexican authorities , while all the residue of the country did ; it might with equal propriety be said , that the declaration and subsequent achievement of independence would have given Texas no right to the Sabine as an eastern boundary ; and so as to any small portion of the inhabitants of the country declared independent . Where a new nation is established in an extensive country , it may often happen that particular towns , villages or districts embraced within it , may stand out and not submit to the authority of the new government for a long time after the great mass of the inhabitants have formed and consolidated their national institutions and laws ; and still the rightful jurisdiction of such government may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people of a territory is not necessary to the declaration or achievement of its independence . rrhe smaller number must submit to the greater .

" The country which a nation inhabits , whether that nation has emigrated thither in a body , or the different families of which it consists w6re previously scattered over the coui*try , and then uniting . formed themselves into a societythat country , I say , is the settlement of the nation , and it has a peculiar and exclusive right to it .

If this fact were well established , and there was no particular reason for establishing the boundary which would include people so situated in the new state , there would be great force in this argument . It will be necessary , therefore , to consider what grounds the new nation had to declare this particular boundary , and whether the country such nation inhabits extends to such boundary within the rules acknowledged by the laws of nations on thatpoint , as well as the evidence of the jurisdiction which Mexico ever exercised oyer such inhabitants , it is said that a declaration or claim does not make a title to a country never possessed by those who make it , and in many senses this is true ; but if such declaration and claim are not items of evidence and important links in the chain of title , few states have any title at all to their wild lands . " All mftnkind have an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one : and those things belong to the person who first takes possession of them . Vben , therefore , a nation finds a country uninhabited and without an owner , it may lawfully take possession of it , and after it has sufficiently made known its will in this respect , it can not be deprived of it by another nation . " - ( Vattel 's Law of Nations , Book I. , chap . xviii. , SS 204. ) // claims unsupported by any actual possession or use , and in this he is correct . But when there is an actual possession of a small part of an extensive and unexplored country , the question how far a claim of jurisdiction over the wilderness beyond the actual settlements confers title as against other nations , is never free from difficulty , and must depend upon the peculiar circumstances of each particular case . That the claim of Mexico to the immense territory between its actual settlement and the southern limits of the United States may be justly doubted on principles of natural law , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled " Peace with Mexico , " at page 32 , in spite of his predilection for the Mexican side of every question he discusses . At least it must be admitted that claims are good as against other claims , and natural objects , such as rivers and mountains , are entitled to very great consideration in determining the reasonableness and justice of a claim founded on actual possession of contiguous territory . Let these principles he applied in fairness and candor to the boundary in question . That Texas was embraced within Louisiana , as ceded by France to the United States in 1803 , is now admitted by Henry Clay , in his recent Lexington speech ; was maintained by Mr. Monroe and Pinckney , in 1805 , and by Mr. Monroe 's administration , in 1818 , and is hardly disputed by any one . That it was first taken possession of by the French , under La Salle , is indisputable ; and that Spain took the whole of Texas , up to the Rio Grande , under tile treaty with the United States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , in 1835 , undertook to form themselves into a new nation , in consequence of the annihilation of the Constitutional Government of the Mexican States , of one of which they had been part , they had some color of right to claim that the Texas which they inhabited extended to the Rio Grande . It was only sixteen years since the country was ceded , not to Mexico , but to Spain . During that period Mexico had established her independence of Spain ; but it would be more difficult to show that any part of Texas participated in the Revolution , than that the inhabitants on the left bank of the Rio Grande did in that of Texas . The people of Texas raised their standard of independence , and the Dictator of Mexico flew with his army to reduce them to subjection . In March , 1836 , the independence of Texas to the RioGraride was declared ; in April , the army of Santa Anna was conquered , and he himself captured ; in May following , Santa Anna acknowledged the independence of Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army allowed to recross the Rio Grande . It is said this acknowledgment amounted to nothing , because Santa Anna was a prisoner of war . As against a Constitutiorial Republican Government , it might not he bindifg ; but , as he was himself Prince and Dictator of the nation , he owned the nation in his own right as much as any absolute sovereign in Europe . Can any one dispute the power of such a sovereign to yield up his whole kingdom as conquered , to redeem his own life and liberty ? His power to yield a part of his territory is as clear as his right to exchange prisoners , or give any other equivalent for his liberation . In 1837 , the United States acknowledged the independence so declared , which , of course , included the asserted boundary . Other nations followed the example . Texas extended her laws over the country to the Rio Grande , erected counties , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , and constantly asserted her title to the whole country between the Nueces and Rio Grande , granting empresario contracts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted this state of things to continue for eight years , without an act of hostility against Texas , ex // cept the capture of ' a party of Texans on the west side of the Rio Grande , and another at Santa Fe , and a single incursion into Texas , which was repelled , though it must be confessed , not without protests , proclamations and proriunciamentos enough to convince the world , if not that they intended to re-conquer Texas , certainly that a Mexican threat meant nothing at all . During all this time , Mexico had never declared the acknowledgment of the independence of Texas by the United States , as an act of hostility towards her , nor as altering the friendly relations between the two countries . On the contrary , in April , 1839 , she entered into a convention with the United States for the satisfaction of claims of citizens of the United States against Mexico ; and in January , 1843 , she procured from the United States a friendly extension of the time for complying with her former stipulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , she knew full well that the latter was bound by her very acknowledgment of the independence of Texas as a state , with limits declared by law to extend to the Rio Grande , to treat Texas , and not Mexico , as the rightful claimants of jurisdiction and territory up to that boundary . A war puts an end to all treaties , and a treaty also puts an end to all prior causes of war . Mexico was thus estopped by her own act from complaining of the recognition by the United States of Texas to the Rio Grande . During all this time Mexico permitted the actual independence of Texas , and never made a pretence that the boundary was wrong , or that she had any better claim to the country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande , than any other part of Texas . She went for the " whole or none , " until after the passage of the annexation resolutions by the United States Congress . After that she sought to get up a better issue upon which to pick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annexation , and offered to acknowledge Texas , with the Nueces as a boundary , on conditions , &amp;c . This is the first that is heard from Mexico about this boundary . If it is said that Texas had no actual possession of the country in dispute , it may be answered , that Mexico had very little of any more claim to actual possession than Texas . True , inhabitants of Mexico , under the Federal Constitution , were in possession of several small places on the left bank of the Rio Grande , and had some scattering settlements along that shore ; but it is equally true that Texas had towns and settlements on the right bank of the Nueces ; and so , as between the two , neither the scattering settlements of one or the other , for a few miles along the bank of either river , could *give either country a title by possession to the immense tract of land between the two rivers . It is said that Texan independence extended no farther than actual Texan occupation ; and as Texas was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory not actually possessed by Texas belonged to its former owner , Mexico . This looks very plausible , and may be correct as to whole or considerable districts of inhabited country , whose inhabitants adhered to the remnant of Mexico , or who asserted their own independence . The Texan revolution , had there been no other cause , would of itself have been a dismemberment of the Mexican nation , and so the Mexicans have always regarded it ; but without that , the abrogation of the Constitution by a military Pictator , had the same effect . The integrity of the nation was broken - its entirety gone  --  the former Mexico had ceased to exist , and with it had ceased the title which the entire nation had to the eminent domain of all its unsettled lands . If Texas could claim and hold only to the extent of its actual settlement , all the other states were in the same predicament ; and after each state had its limits assigned to it , seven-eighths of the Mexico that // was would have remained without an owner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other portion of it , had just as good a right to a portion of the vacant lands as against all or several of the parts which rern*ined when reunited under another government , as it would have had , as against the residue of liexico , had each state or district set up for itself . By the revolution , therefore , Texas had not lost its right and interest in the immence domains of the Mexican confederacy . It had , then , a right to fix for itself a reasonable and natural boundary , including contiguons vacant territory ; and was not bound to stop short of a strip from 150 to 250 miles wide , immediately contiguous and unoccupied , because the next convenient natural and reasonable boundary would include some fe*v people who had belonged to other states or settlements in the Mexico that was , who had not united with them in their new organization of a state , especially when such a boundary was a great river , extending the whole length of the state , and was the ancient boundary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very nature of the case , no new state could ever be formed from a dismembered nation or community , if it were necessary to procure the assent of all the people within the proposed limits . " In cases of doubt , every territory terminating on a river , is presumed to have no other boundary than the river itself , because nothing is more natural than to take a river for a boundary , when a settlement is made ; and whenever there is a doubt , that is always to be presumed which is most natural and probable . " - Vattel 's L*w of Nations , Book I , chap . xxii. , 267 . " The whole space over which a nation extends its government , becomes the seat of its jurisdiction , and is called its territory . " - Ib . Book I , chap . xviii. , 205 . Texas for ten years maintained a regular government , making and executing its laws , and was acknowledged and respected by the principal nations of the world . During all that time , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and laws . The Mexicans had once penetrated Texas as far as San Antonio in 1842 , and the Texans had once made an expedition to Santa Fe , and once across the Rio Grande to Mier , but both incursions were soon repelled* Santa Fe , Loredo , and perhaps some other little places had their alcaldes , and perhaps some other offices which were inseparable from any idea of civil society in the minds of all the Spanish race , and were of their own choosing . A marauding party of hungry soldiers of the government of Mexico occasionally quartered upon these settlements , and by such parties the Mier and Santa Fe prisoners were captured . Whatever of laws and government the people had , they brought from Spain ; and as they never submitted to any authority , except that of their priests , it was of little consequence to them , that jurisdiction over them was asserted by France previously to 1803 , the United States from that time to 1819 , by Spain always , ( for Spain did not concede the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iturbide as emperor of Mexico , from . 1820 to 1822 , by the Mexican United States from 1824 till the Constitution and Confederation were overturned by a Military Dictator , and every successive chief of Mexican banditti , called the army , ever since . Did either any or all of these claims give any right or claim of jurisdiction over the extensive country in question , superior , or even equal to that of the government of Texas ? This argument extends to all the territory east of the Rio Grande . To a portion of that territory the Texans had even a better claim . As members of the State of Coahuila and Texas , which adopted a Constitution in 1827-as one consolidated state , and not a federation of two states , they // had a right and interest in all the unappropriated lands within that state , which extended not only to , but far west of the Rio Grande . Has any body heard of the State of Coahuila and Texas since the revolution of 1535 ? Has there ever been any State of Coahuila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the consolidated government of Mexico , Coahuila and Tamaulipas were declared Departments of the nation , and submitted to it as often as an army came along and overawed them , but always resisted when they could . What became of the rightful title of the State of Coahuila and Texas to the eminent domain of their lands ? Had any people a better claim to it than the Texans ? They were the only state which continued , and might have claimed to succeed to the whole territory of which they were before lawfully seized . They , however , relinquished all beyond the Rio Grande , and distinctly claimed the residue as part of their domains . When they had the power , did they lack the right to maintain their declaration ? Mr. Gallatin , in bis recent pamphlet , says : " That the idea of this river being the boundary is preposterous ; because it would include a large portion of New Mexico , and the charter of Louisiana was expressly bounded on this province . " it is not perceived how this could show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not on the river . So this proves nothing , except that the two territories joined each other . As to the lower Rio Grande , Mr. Gallatin says : " The whole contested territory lies within the limits of Tamaulipus , which never was under the Mexican Government connected in any shape with Texas . " And again he says : " Texas and Coahuila were declared to form a state ; and the River Neuces was made the boundary of Texas . When Texas declared herself independent , it was the insurrection of only part of a state ; for Coahuila remained united to Mexico . " What a mixture of mistaken fhcts and misapplied principles are here presented ! We can not find that the Nueces ever was made a boundary at all , in any act of Mexico , previously to the revolution in Texas . And if it was ever made the limits of the Spanish Province of Texas , the evidence of it has escaped observation , after a somewhat diligent research . When the Spanish settlements were made in the wilderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was very large in those ' regions , and Spain claimed the whole , lands , seas , and islands , with everything annexed . In Thompson 's General Atlas , published at Edinburgh , in 1817 , the Nueces is not designated as a boundary of anything . in a pamphlet , pubIshed by Asahel Longworthy. in 1832 , and written in 1831 , giv ing the constitutions of Mexico , and Coahuila and Texas  --  a history of the landlaws , and description of the lands in Texas , he says , pp. 40 and 41 : " The writer of this has travelled across Texas from the Rio del Nort* to the Sabine . " * * * * After speaking of Matamoras , he adds : " The soil of that part of ' Texas between the Rio del Norte and the Neuces , to the distance of fifty or sixty miles towards the interior , is of good quality , but greatly deficient in timber and good water . " * * * " The lands south and adjoining the Nueces are rich valleys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settler in Texas , have written thus , if ' the State of Tamaulipas then claimed title to the Nueces ? In the early settlement of Texas , the French and Spaniards fought one another from Natchitoches to Golmad ; but it never occurred to them that the United States and Mexico would ever quarrel about the Nueces as a boundary , and therefore they took no notice of that line . Previous to the independence of Mexico , there wet e hardly inhabitants enough in all Texas to attract the attention of the government , or require the fixing of any limits . When the // State of Coabuila and Texas was formed , it was declared to be one and inseparable ; and to prevent all idea of disunion , or division into different states , a name was adopted , signifying inhabitants of the state , embracing both names , ( Coahuitejanos and Coawheetahanos , ) inhabitants of Coahuila and Texas . For the purpose of conveniently administering the government , the state was divided , not into two parts , Coahuila and Texas , but three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grande , and Monclova  --  the boundaries of neither of which are specified at all . And it was expressly declared , that the State " consists of ' the union of all its inhahitants. " - ( Constitution *f ' 1827 . Preliminary Sections , 1st and 7th . ) The Nueces is not mentioned in the Constitution ; but as most the Texan settlements of that day were far east of that river , it has been recently assumed by some as the western limit of the province . It is also proper here to observe , that when this Constitution was adopted , the limits of the state itself were not fixed with reference to other states ; but it was provided that they should be fixed by a constitutional law. - ( Preliminary Dispositions , 6 . ) The same was undoubtedly the case with Tamaulipas . Down to the subversion of the Federal Constitution these limits were never fixed . The state could not , therefore , have been bounded by the Nueces towards Tamaulipas . The next mistake of fact is as to the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Coahuila remaining annexed to Mexico . In 1834 , when Santa Anna submitted the Federal Constitution , the legislature of the state was divided into two parties , one for Santa Anna and the other for the Constitution ; and two distinct organizations were got up , one at Monclova and one at Saltillo . The latter annulled the decrees of the legislature from the time of its election in 1833 , and in conjunction with the military , proclaimed a military governor . Afterwards the difference was adjusted , and in March , 1835 , a Legislature of the whole state assembled at Monclova , and a governor having been chosen , entered upon the duties of his office . The Texan members were in favor of forming a new state , which was opposed by the others ; but a majority of both parties united in presenting to the Mexican Congress a protest against the arbitrary acts of Santa Anna . Santa Anna immediately sent General Cos to enforce submission to his usurpation . The milit*iry party again organized in Saltillo . The governor called out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken prisoner , and escaped . The state authorities were deposed by the decrees of the Mexican Congress dictated by Santa Anna , and the refractory members of the legislature , who remained in Coahuila , were arrested by military orders , imprisoned , and finally hanished. - ( Wilson 's Amencaz History , rip . 640 , 641 . ) Thus was the state annihilated before the Texas revolution commenced . The State of Coahuila is a creature of imagination . Part of the state was subdued by the forces of Santa Anna , and may since have formed a department of the so called Mexican nation . There was , therefore , in the Texan revolution , no insurrection of part of a state , like one or more counties or districts , in their political capacity asserting their independence ; but the former state was crushed and annihilated , arid the people at large were left free to make a new government for themselves . If the part of the country to which General Taylor marched " never was , under the Mexican Government , connected in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we deny , it has nothing to do with the question in dispute . The state constitution of Tamaulipas , equally with // that of Coahuila and Texas , was crushed by the military usurpation of Santa Anna , and both the attributes and name of a state were denied to her . The boundaries fixed for that state , under the federal and state constitutions , were of no effect as soon as both constitutions were destroyed ; and the people in every part of the territory were left without a overnment , but not without their natural rights . g The civil revolution in Mexico put an end to the civil divisions ; nothing was left but the country , the people , and the rights of men . A new state was formed from original elements , and became a permanent , established and law administering government , with its limits duly and formally declared to the world . With a full knowledge of those claims , the principal nations of Europe had acknowledged her independence . Had anypoweron earth a better claim to the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas ? Where is the evidence of the indubitable title of Mexico to any part of it ? How had Mexico acquired , and how long had she exercised her undisputed and peaceable jurisdiction over any part of the territory or its inhabitants ? The JJnitod States acknowledged the independence of Mexico , as it did of Texas . when it found it in fact independent ; but Spain did not acknowledge such independence , till long after the Texan revolution . During the first Presidential term of four years under the Federal constitution , the President , ( Victoria , ) and Vice-President , ( Bravo , ) with their respective partizans , waged open war against each other . Within a year after the election of the second President , Pedraza , ( 1829 , ) Guerrero , a military chief , usurped the Presidency , and Bustamente the Vice-Presidency , and drove away the lawful President and government . In the same year , Spain sent 4000 troops to Tampico , to re-establish the royal authority , but this expedition failed . Bustamente , the Vice-President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Santa Anna , drove him to the mountains . In 1832 , Santa Anna pronounced against Bustamente , and in favor of Pedraza , the lawful President , and once more a lawful government was restored . As soon as Pedraza 's term was out , ( 1833 , ) Santa Anna contrived to be elected President under the constitution , but within two weeks he was proclaimed Dictator by the army , and with pretended reluctance , yielded to the demands of the military , and the overthrow of the civil power . In 1S34 Santa Anna formally dissolved the Constitutional Government , summoned a new Congress on a plan of his own , and established a consolidated government , abolishing the state governments and constitutions . Now , while Mexico itself was rent with san*uinary wars between the chieftains of the military , and nobody could tell to whom the Capitol itself owed allegiance ; while Spain , as well as some of the Mexican leaders , claimed jurisdiction over the inhabitants and country east of the Rio Orande and while the Dictator , Santa Anna , acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawful government , had acknowledged the independence and limits of Texas , and still retained control in Mexico , is it not surpassingly strange that some of the tender-hearted and patriotic statesrr*en of he United States should arrive at the conclusion , that the title of Mexico to the territory east of the Rio Grande was clear and indisputable ? By the acknowledgment of the independence of Texas , the United States were as much committed as to the declared limits of its territory , as they were by the former acknowledgment , as to the declared limits of Mexico . Having acknowledged the latter as the lawful government of the territory east of the Rio Grande , they were no more bound to consider any inhabitants within those limits as subject to Mexico , than to consider any of the inhabitants of Mexico as subject to Spain . From that // moment the Spanish settlers within the limits of Texas , who had never been civilly organized under the laws of the state , were as much the subjects of ' Spain as of Mexico . Their allegiance was claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other districts of Mexico-they never submitted to any government any longer than the soldiers were in sight ,  - -  took no notice of the political changes in the city of Mexico , and were about as wild and independent as the Camanche Indians . There has been scarcely any thing like government or law in New Mexico or California for fifty years past . But there were some people within the claimed limits of Texas who had been at times quartered upon by the Mexican soldiers , and did not dispute their authority ; and they , especially those at Point Isabel , and along opposite Metamoras , it is contended , gave a title to Mexico , over the whole country , away through the wilderness to the Nueces , far superior to that of Texas to the great , natural , convenient , reasonable , and historical boundary *Iext beyond its actual settlements , the Rio Grande . It is respectfully submitted to the impartial reader to decide which of the two claims is the best . The people of the new State of Texas had been deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their own resources to form and sustain a government ; they had been members of a State not only claiming , but lawfully possessed of the country to and beyond the Rio Grande , and had taken many titles from such state , of lands bounded on that River ; they had been subjected to a bloody and merciless war waged against them by the Dictator of Mexico ; they had been successful in their struggle for independence , and shown themselves merciful to the tyrant who butchered their citizens in cool blood , after receiving their capitulation as prisoners of war ; they cleared their state of all signs of an enemy and consolidated their government ; and had they not a better title to the whole of their declared limits , than the miserable military myrmidons of the detestable tyrant Santa Anna ? This view of the subject presents a clear title as against Mexico , independent of the acts of the Government of the United States , which were imperative upon the Executive , to maintain that boundary in fulfilment of the pledge of the national faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . It was annexed with declared limits , and the Western were as positive as any other . How sensible men can contend that the President needed an act of Congress , to authorize the march of the United States army from one part of a state to another , is more than we can comprehend . Especially if the annexation was , of itself an act of war , being a union with one of two belligerants , as contended , we are entirely at a loss to comprehend , how the President can be to blame for carrjing into effect the resolutions of Congress itself . This view of the matter fully justifies the President , and makes the advance to the Rio G'rande at least as justifiable as the annexation itself The radical vice in the reasoning of those who consider both wrong , consists in considering the Imperial or Dictatorial Centralized Government of Mexico , without states , as identical with the Federal Government of 18*4 , consisting of independent states , and having jurisdiction of all the territory formerly possessed by Spain , whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unfortunate and inaccurate concession of President Van Buren in decliniiig the application of Texas for annexation in August , 1837 , that such annexation would be a violation of " treaty obligation ' * to Mexico , and the zeal with which the idea was seized upon and used by the northern opponents of annexation , on the ground of slavery , are believed to be the chief causes of all the arguments which Mexico and other foreign nations have used to // kindle the flame of war between the two countries . If there had been no slavery in the United States or Texas , the politicians of this country would never have furnished Mexico with any fallacious arguments against their own country , on the question of annexation . So far from any violation of treaty obligations with the Mexico that was when Mr. Van Buren made this concession , the treaty to which he alluded was made with the Mexican Confederacy under the Constitution , which embraced Texas ; whereas after that confederacy was destroyed , and the United States had acknowledged another nation East of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely distinct government , and as much a new state or nation , as the Republic of Texas . Secondly-Assuming that no boundary wassettled between the two countries , it was the moral duty of each to offer to settle one by fair negociation , which would embrace the giving of an equivalent for territory relinquished by one to secure the desired convenient boundary to the other . This Texas had always been ready to do ; and this the United States , in a spirit of kindness and good will to Mexico , expressly offered to do , notwithstanding the menacing and insulting attitude assumed by Mexico . Two successive ministers were insultingly sent home , after every effort to conciliate . Mr. Gallatin has adopted the quibble about the word used by the Mexican minister , when he agreed to receive an envoy from the United States , with full power to settle all matters in dispute ; and says that , though the question asked by Mr. Black , the consul , was-whether an envoy , with full power to settle all matters in dispute , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico would receive the Commissioner of the United States . That this is a mistranslation is obvious , from the fact that Mexican ingenuity never resorted to the quibble . In the correspondence with Mr. Slidell , the government of Paredes put their refusal to receive him as a minister , upon the ground that Herrera 's government had done wrong in agreeing to receive an envoy or ordinary minister ; and it was this agreement of Ilerrera to receive a minister , that caused his overthrow . The answer was then nothing more or less than an affirmative answer to the question , with the qualification that the fleet of the United States should be withdrawn from Vera Cruz . This condition shows that a negociation by a minister , on a peace basis , was contemplated . There was no intimation of any desire , that the appointment should be qualified or restricted , but , on the contrary , that the power should be full and perfect . But , supposing the United States had mistaken the import of the consent , was Mexico justified in plunging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a mere informal communication ? In order to justify or cxease the conduct of the Mexican Government in refusing to accredit Mr. Slidell , it is necessary to pronounce a judgment of condemnation against the Government of the United States in the whole prior controversy ; and if such judgment he just , it is of little consequence how the pointin question shall be decided . If the question of boundary could only be settled by negociation , was it not as much the duty of Mexico as of the United States to open the negociation ? Yea more : - was it not peculiarly proper for them to re-open the intercourse which they themselves had suspended by the insulting rejection of Mr. Shannon ? Assuming the United States in the right , as to the annexation , we arraign Mexico , before the world , as the culpable author of the war , and the cause of all the bloodshed and devastation which have resulted from her wilful refusal to negociate . But it is asked , why the United States should have insisted upon // negociating through an ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of annexation ? Why should they not have so insisted ? Mexico claimed that the annexation was a hostile aggression upon her ; hut this the United States could not admit with any regard to the national honor , or , what was more important still , to truth and justice . The United States did admit that the boundary of Texas was a fair subject of negociation , as they had annexed that state , with a reservation of the power to adjust the boundary . Mexico declined negociation in toto , until satisfaction should be made for the annexation itself , as an aggression upon her . She never intimated any idea of being satisfied with a commission to establish a boundary . The appointment of such a commission would have been a legitimate object of the very negociation which she declined . It was as absurd for Mexico to expect the United States to appoint a special commissioner to settle for the annexation of Texas , as it would have been for the United States to have insisted that Mexico should appoint a special commissioner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shannon , before receiving an ordinary minister from Mexico . As the stronger , however , the Urited States could afford to forget the indignity offered her , and take the initiative in re*opening friendly negociations . Was not this condescension enough to the pride of Mexico , without submitting to the degradation of sending a special commissioner , to ask pardon from a government to whom no offence had been offered , but from whom repeated wrongs and insults had been received ? There were other reasons why a minister with full ' powers should have been insisted on . Mexico had violated her treaty whereby she solemnly promised to pay our citizens large sums of money forwroilgs which she herself acknowledged , and placed herself in a hostile and threatetling attitude towards us , which required us , at great expense and sacrifice , to stand prepared to defend the country against her threatened hostilities . It was necessary to ask justice at the hands of Mexico , instead of making apologies to her ; and it would have been too regardless of the rights of our injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her prevaricating pretelices for delay . The United States then did all that justice and magnanimity , good will and even forbearance required , to avoid the direful calamities of war and procure a peaceful settlement of a boundary . What was next to be done 3 How was a boundary tO be settled ? There was hut one resource left , and that was , to take possession up to the limits already declared by Texas , and which the United States is now bound to regard as correct till otherwise fixed by treaty with Mexico . Mr. Gallatin concedes , ( p. 15 , ) that such a declaration of limits might be imperative upon the executive of ' the state not to conclude any treaty of peace with Mexico without such boundary was agreed to . If so , was it not equally imperative upon the President after annexation , until altered by treaty as provided by the resolution of annexation , to maintain that as the true boundary ? Here was a line , then , already fixed , as far as one party was concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not need even an act of congress to authorize the taking and holding up such line . Congress had already adopted that boundary , and the President was bound to maintain it . If no annexation had taken place , and Texas had marched her forces to the Rio Grande , would not all the world have held her justified ? The United States had the same rights , and were acting in behalf of Texas . They did not , however , assume to exercise all the rights of Texas , for they studiously avoided all interference with the Mexicans found within the country , armed and unarmed , and made known to the // Mexicans their intention not to meddle with them , but treat the country as a territory in dispute between the two nations . This was done-molesting nobody , and informing the commander of the forces of Mexico of the pacific intentions of the United States ; and this after a refusal of Mexico to negotiate ! How this can be construed into an aggression upon Mexico is surely more than we can comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the threatening position of General Taylor , as a pretext for the hostilities which he was bound to commence , under any circumstances , by the posi .. tive instructions of his government , given without any reference at all to that matter . And still this Mexican pretence is good authority with some of the great statesmen of the United States , who denounce the war on our part as a war of pretexts ! See Mr. Webster 's speech at the Mass . State Convention in 1847 , and Mr. Gallatin 's pamphlet before cited . As to the position of General Taylor , threatening Matamoras , it is a pretty goodjustification that the armies of Mexico were previously on their march , with the avowed intention of invading the United States . The United States were authorized to assume a threatening position under such circumstances , as they had before done in sending their fleet to Vera Cruz . Thirdly . The threatening and hostile attitude of Mexico fully justified the advance of General Taylor to be ready to repel the threatened invasion . All writers upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to wait for actual hostilities from a country threatening war ; hut that where an injury is obviously intended , and about to be inflicted upon a country by its neighbor , the threatened party may justly strike the first blow . When the traveller sees the weapon of the robber aimed at him , it is not necessary to wait for him to fire before disabling him ; and the same rule applies to nations as to individuals , as the following passage from Vattel 's Law of Nations will show " Let us then say , in general , that the foundation or cause of every just war is injury , either already done or threatened . The justificatory reasons for war show that an injury has been received ; or so far threatened as to authorize a prevention of it by arms . * * * When , therefore , we would judge whether a war he just , we must determine whether he who undertakes it has in fact received an injury , or whether he be really threatened with one . * * * Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right to make war . " Now had not Mexico both done and threatened injury to the United States ? Had she not violated her treaty , insulted the nation through its ministers , suspended all intercourse , and continually menaced us with hostilities ? And were not her armies on the march for the invasion of Texas , to wreak their vengeance on its inhabitants ? Should the United States have waited till they had surrounded and massacred two or three hundred Texans , as they did those of the Alamo , to whom they gave no quarter-or murdered an equal number of disarmed prisoners , as they did Fannin and his men , in the time of the revolution ? What devastation would Arista 's 7,000 troops have committed in Texas , hut for the stout heart and clear head of the old hero , Gen. Taylor , and the unsurpassed gallantry of the officers and men of his little Spartan army . No matter about special pleadings ; no matter whether the going to the frontier to repel invasion by the one party , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of the war . We do not deem this point of sufficient importance to call our friends liars , who differ from us in opinion . It is // enough for us to feel and know that our country was right in what was done , and that the conduct of its rulers is fully justified before the country , the nations of the earth , and the God of battles . * We have thus demonstrated 1 . That tha war had its origin in the absurd and fallacious pretences of the Mexicans in regard to the independence and annexation of Texas , which were not invented by them , but by political leaders in the United States . 2 . That when the Republic of Texas was formed , there was no lawful government in Mexico , to whom any of the inhabitants owed allegiance , and that the people of Texas had good authority to extend the jurisdiction of the Republic they established to the Rio Grande . 3 . That the Dictatorial , or consolidated government of Mexico , established in part of that country west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceable possession of any of the country east of the Rio Grande , sufficient to give it any color of right to jurisdiction over the inhabitants or country . 4 . That after the conquest of Santa Anna and his army hy the Texans , the acknowledgment of the independence and western boundary of Texas by Santa Anna , as the price of his life and release , and the actual evacuation of the whole country to the Rio Grande by the Mexican troops , the United States and other nations were fully justified in acknowledging and regarding Texas as an independent nation within those limits . 5 . That after the government of Texas had maintained itself for ten years without rebellion or revolution , while the part of Mexico which remained was constantly in a state of anarchy and civil war , the United States had as good a right to treat with Texas for part or the whole of its territory , as it would have had to treat with Mexico for any part of that country which remained . 6 . That at the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mexico existed , and the acceptance of Texas , even had it been a Mexican province , and as an act of war , would have been fully justified . 7 . That in truth no actual war existed between Mexico and Texas at the time of the annexation , and the measure was properly treated by the United States as not at all hostile to Mexico , and every effort was made to preserve the friendly relations of the two nations , consistent with the honor of the United States . S. That Mexico , by refusing to negotiate , clearly placed herself in the wrong , and rendered the war inevitable . 9 . That in ordering the United States army to the Rio Grande , the President was as clearly justified as he would have been in ordefing them to any other part of the declared and acknowledged limits of the State of Texasthat he was but carrying out the Annexation Resolutions of Congress , and did not need another act of the same Congress to justify him . 10 . That Texas never was oounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , as early as 1831 , as extending to the Rio Grande , and that too immediately opposite Matamoras. 11 . That it is immaterial whether any and what boundaries are now established for Texas or Tamaulipas , or both , by the Mexican Government , as the civil revolution put an end to the civil divisions . 12 . That if there was no western boundary of Texas settled , as against Mexico , having endeavored in vain to negotiate , the United States were fully justified in maintaining the boundary declared by Texas . 13 . That no matter whose territory it was into which the United // States ' Army mai'ched , such march was fully justified , according to the law of nations , on the ground of the threatened hostilities and advancing armies of Mexico . 14 . That the United States did everything which a generous and magnanimous nation could do , to avoid the horrors of war , and were to blame only for their forbearance , which encouraged the insolence of the Mexicans ; and that the whole responsibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the London Times and other English journals , who are so fond of placing before their readers every thing unfavorable to the claims of the United States , and also the New-York Tribune , which takes even stronger ground against the United States in this controversy , to place the substance of our arguments candidly before their readers , and then answer them if they can , or if not , acknowledge that they ca n't . As to the consequences of this war , however lamentable the loss of the many valuable lives already sacrificed , we firmly believe the result will prove beneficial to both countries . As Mexico is responsible for the war , she must make large concessions of territory to the United States , as an indemnity for her former indebtedness and the expenses of the war , before peace can be re.established , without disgrace to the United States . This territory will be highly valuable to the United States , but was of no sort of value , but rather an embarrassment to Mexico . It will open a new field of enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the manufacturing and agricultural districts of the United States . it will cause the Mexicans to perceive the importance of doing justice to strangers , and maintaining and enforcing laws to pievent their being plundered and robbed ; and , what is more important , that the Mexicans and the Spanish race are not superior to all the rest of the world . We do not believe at all in giving money to Mexico , to buy a peace . We hold that the United States have been right throughout , and are entitled , upon the principles of strict justice , to a full satisfaction from Mexico . No matter what it costs , or what sacrifices we may still he compelled to make to obtain it , this we must have , or submit to a sacrifice of our national honor . This the Mexicans fully appreciated , when they made it a sine qua non of peace , that they should retain the country between the Nueces and Rio Grande . They would thereby place the United States in the wrong , in the commencement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and never will agree to any such thing . Mr. Gallatin and others who maintain that the United States have been in the wrong in the whole controversy , including the ann*xation of Texas , in spite of all their Christian charity and benevolence towards the poor wronged Mexicans , and their strong professions of a desire to do them full justice , still propose only to withdraw the United States forces . to the east side of the Nueces , retaining all of what they call TexaW*o ourselves . Now , if the annexation of Texas was an aggression upon Mexico , or an unjust seizure of one of her provinces , as these good Christian statesmen contend , why do they not come up to the mark and propose , like honest men , to restore the whole of Texas . There would then be no difficulty in making a peace , for the amount which the United States would be required to pay Mexico for the expenses of the war , would raise a respectable army for the conquest of Texas . Whatever danger there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where religion is established by law ,  --  . -  --  or in annexing by // conquest , under arbitrary governments , which trample upon the rights of all their subjects , and conquer only to enslave ,  --  a free nation , which shows equal toleration and protection to all religions , and conquers only to bestow freedom , has no such danger to fear . We had the same forebodings . from equally great men , in the case of the a quisition of Louisiana ; but the result has belied all their predictions . Let us boldly go forward , then , in our onward march of national greatness , and fearlessly extend our boundary as far as the justice of our claims and the circum*. stances of war may carry them ; and let our motto be- " Justice to allhumiliating concessions to none .
