txt /q/us mind , and which , if properly struck , will be sure to vibrate in union with the master hand , and which did call forth the treasures and assistance of a Lafayette , and caused a Kosciusko to bleed ; that these men . who advanced and maintained these principles before the world , did it only that they might gain the world 's assistance and its applause , while they had determined , within themselves , to violate every principle they professed , or only that they might be better able to impose on their brother man a tyranny equal in cruelty to any the world had ever witnessed ,  --  is advancing a doctrine so abhorrent , we can scarce believe , had it not been asserted , it could have been entertained a moment . And yet what is it but saying all this , when we allow it to be understood , without any qualification , that our fathers , the moment it was in their power to frame laws to govern the country to which they had resorted , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a permanent footing , and that with malice prepense , a system of which they at least made a show , on account of its barbarity and the manner it was imposed upon them one cause of war ? Such a judgment seems too contrary to all of our preconceived notions of their integrity , to be for a moment admitted ; and , if there was any thing in their actions that would at all give countenance to such a construction of their conduct , some excuse ought to be found , some reason , either good or apparently so , which may have appeared , to their /z/ minds , to justify them in a course so opposite to what might have been expected . It is not our intention , however , to advance the idea that all the men of that age were perfect . That there were men who would not have been willing to act in such a hypocritical manner ; and that there were many who did use their utmost influence to fasten upon the country this system of abominations , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do any thing , provided this should be effected ; and that many , after our independence was gained , took no active interest in it , and would have been very glad had no change taken place , but , after it did take place , threw in what weight they could to prevent any alteration in their domestic concerns ,  --  we have no doubt . And that such persons did effect much , and did , perhaps , prevent a general emancipation from slavery throughout the United States at the time , there can , perhaps , be no doubt ; neither can there be any doubt that , through their solicitations , and the honest fears of others , as to the consequence of having in their midst , without more than ordinary restraint , a comparatively ignorant , barbarous , and heathen people , the subject of emancipation was kept in the back-ground , or involved so mysteriously as to be left , by those who would have taken a different course , to future generations , to correct any error they may have committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , part in that struggle , and by whose influence it was in the main carried /z/ on . were thwarted and prevented from doing as they would . Having gone through one struggle , and being , as they themselves say , advanced in years , they left what of the work they had not finished to those who might come after them . But , after all , although they did not proclaim a general emancipation to the colored race , yet we think they left no word by which slavery could be justified or maintained in the Constitution of our country ; and that , so far as that instrument is concerned , it can not be supported . This , we are aware , is an assertion contrary to the expressed opinion of many distinguished men . But , when a guaranty is given , we think there ought to be something more than inuendoes to maintain it ; that the subject to be guaranteed should be expressly stated ; that nothing should have been left to inference ; that , in a case so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been left no doubt on the subject ; and yet , in all of the public documents that were given to the American people and to the world , the subject of slavery is not mentioned but with reprobation . The nation at large were , no doubt , opposed to slavery . No one , in that age , dared to assert slavery was a blessing ; ho one seemed to think it was so ; but every demonstration that was made in regard to it was of a contrary character . The trade has been termed , at least when conducted on a foreign shore , piracy ; and their abhorrence of it has been shown , in a greater or less degree , in the various laws that have been made on /z/ the subject . We must admit , however , they suffered , against the consent of the most active men in the revolutionary struggle , this piracy to continue twenty years after our present government was established , and , by so doing , laid the foundation of the troubles we now experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not feel over-anxious to leave on record any justification , on their part , of its being done ; and that the present ideas in regard to it are but of late growth . The idea of its being a blessing , as a permanent institution , does not appear to have entered their heads . It was solely the want of laborers in the more southern States that induced them to consent to have it continued , and not because they had any sympathy for the system . It was urged that the white man could not work on the rice plains of the South ; and , unless there could be a colored population there , they would have to remain a wilderness , ' and that the African would be better off in this country than in his own . These ideas , with the fear they should not be able to maintain their liberties and the best good of the country without a union of the States , induced them to consent to its temporary continuance . Its perpetuation , however , was not thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , the young giant was ' discovered while it was but a suckling . But it is asked how it is , then , that that which was considered so great an evil , at the time of which we are speaking , should in so short a time /z/ become to be considered of so much utility that it must not be spoken of but with approbation , and that the statesmen in both of the great political parties of our country so universally uncover their heads in its presence , and bow down to it as to a god from whom they have received their very existence . Mr. Birney , in his letter to the Hon. Mr. Elmore , of South Carolina , in answer to certain inquiries made of him respecting the intentions and prospects of the abolitionists of the North , states the case in a clear and distinct light . He says ,  --  " The ascendency that slavery has acquired and exercises , in the administration of the government , and the apprehension now prevailing among the sober and intelligent , irrespective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be ranked among the events of the last two or three years that effect the cause of the abolitionist . The abolitionists regard the Constitution with unabated affection . They hold in no common veneration the memory of those who made it . They would be the last to brand Franklin , and King , and Morris , and Wilton , and Sherman , and Hamilton , with the ineffable infamy of attempting to engraft on the Constitution , and therefore to perpetuate , a system of oppression in absolute antagonism to its high and professed objects , one which their own practice condemned ; and this , too , when they had scarcely wiped away the dust and sweat of the Revolution from their brows . " Whilst abolitionists speak thus of our constitutional fathers , they do not justify the dereliction from principles into which they were betrayed , when they imparted to the works of their hands any power to contribute to the /z/ continuance of such a system . They can only palliate it , by supposing that they thought slavery was already a waning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , ( 1787 , ) slaves were comparatively of little value , there being then no great slave staple ( as cotton is now ) to make them profitable to the slaveholder. 1 " Had the circumstances of the country remained as they then were , slave labor , always and every where the most expensive , would have disappeared before the competition of free labor . They had seen , too , the principles of liberty embodied in most of the State Constitutions ; they had seen slavery utterly forbidden in that of Vermont , instantaneously abolished in that of Massachusetts , and laws enacted in the other New England States , and in Pennsylvania , for its gradual abolition . Well might they have anticipated that justice and humanity , now starting forth with fresh vigor , would , in their march , sweep away the whole system ; more especially as freedom of speech and the press , the legitimate abolisher , not only of the vice of slavery , but of every other that time should reveal in our institutions or practice , had been fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on congress to put a stop to the African slavetrade , without which it was thought at that time to be impossible to maintain slavery as a system on this continent , so great was the havoc on human life . Authority was also granted to congress to prevent the transfer of slaves , as articles of commerce , from one State to another , and the introduction of slavery into the Territories . 2 All this was crowned by the power to prevent the admis- 1 The cultivation of cotton was almost unknown in the United States before 17S7 . It was not till two years afterwards that it began to be raised and exported . ( See report of the secretary of the treasury , July 29 , 1836. ) 2 The following is the opinion of the late Chief Justice Jay as to this part of the constitutional question . It is contained in a letter /z/ sion into the Union of any new State , whose form of government was repugnant to the principles of liberty set forth in the Constitution of the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably enough supposed- would , at least , prevent the growth of slavery , if it did not entirely remove it . Congress did , at the same time , execute one of them ,  --  deemed then the most effectual of the whole , but , as it turned out , the least so . " from him to the venerable Elias Liule , and can be added to what has been said and written on the subject of slavery : " Nov. 17. 1815 . I concur in the opinion it ought not to be introduced , nor permitted in any of the new States ; and that it ought to be gradually diminished and abolished in them all . " To use the constitutional authority of congress to prohibit the migration and importation of slaves into any of the Slates does not appear questionable . " The first article of the Constitution specifies the legislative powers committed to congress . The ninth section of this article has these words : ' The migration or importation of such persons as any of the now existing States shall think proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the year 1808 ; but a tax , or duty , may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person . ' " I understand the sense and meaning of this clause to be , that the power of the congress , although competent to prohibit suck viigration and importation , was not to be exercised with respect to the then existing States , and them only till the year 1808 , but that congress were at liberty to make such prohibitions as to any new State which might in the mean time be established . And , further , that , from and after that period , they were authorized to make such prohibition a lo all the States , whether new or old . ' - Slaves were the persons intended . The name slaves was avoided , on account of the existing toleration of slavery , and its existing discordancy with the principles of the Revolution , and from the consciousness of its being repugnant to those propositions in the Declaration of Independence : ' We hold these truths to be self-evident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ' /z/ He then goes on to state that the interdiction of the African slave trade did not diminish the trade itself , or mitigate its horrors . It simply transferred from Africa to America " its profits from African princes to American farmers . " He doubted if slavery would have extended over so large a space as it now does , if the trade had not been interdicted ; for the cheap rate at which slaves could have been imported would have prevented the rearing them on American soil ; and , if the internal commerce could be restricted , slavery would soon die of itself . They could not maintain it on account of the competition of free labor . And the not using by congress of the power it possessed , or rather to the unfaithful application of their power to other points , on which it was expected to act for the limitation and extirpation of slavery , that the hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its present audacious position by steps at first gradual , and for a long time almost unnoticed ; afterwards by intimidation and corruption , up to the time of the " Missouri compromise , " by which the nation was defrauded of its honor ; and that , up to this time , slavery was looked upon as an evil that was to yield to the expanding and enlightened influences of our Constitution , principles , and regulations . He then proceeds : " It has already been said we have been brought into our present condition by the unfaithfulness of congress , in not exerting the power vested in it , to stop the domestic slave-trade , and in the abuse of the power of /z/ admitting new States into the Union . Kentucky made application , in 1792 , with a slaveholding Constitution in her hand . With what a mere technicality congress suffered itself to be dragged into torpor ! She was part of one of the original States , and therefore entitled to all their privileges . " It should have been entitled to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community that upholds it . " One precedent established , it was easy to make another . Tennessee was admitted in 1796 , without scruple , on the same ground . " The next triumph of slavery was in 1803 , in the purchase of Louisiana , acknowledged afterwards , even by Jefferson who made it , to be unauthorized by the Constitution , and in the establishment of slavery throughout its vast limits , actually and substantially under the auspices of that instrument which declares its only object to be ' to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . ' " In this case the violation of the Constitution was suffered to pass with but little opposition , except from Massachusetts , because we were content to receive in exchange multiplied commercial benefits and enlarged territorial limits . " The next stride that slavery made over the Constitution was the admission of the State of Louisiana into the Union . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . ' At this point , it might have been supposed the friends of freedom , and of the Constitution according to its original intent , would have made a stand . /z/ But no ; with the exception of Massachusetts , they hesitated , and were persuaded to acquiesce , because the country was just about entering into a war with England , and ihe crisis was unpropitious for discussing questions that would create divisions between different sections of the Union . ' We must wait till the country is at peace . ' Thus it was that Louisiana was admitted without a controversy . " Next followed , in 1817 and 1820 , Mississippi and Alabama , admitted , after the example of Kentucky and Tennessee , without any contest . " Meantime , Florida had given some uneasiness to the slaveholders of the neighboring States ; and , for their accommodation chiefly , a negotiation was set on foot by the government to purchase it . " Missouri was next in order , in 1821 . She could plead no privilege , on the score of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was relieved from the pressure of her late conflict with England ; it was prosperous and quiet ; every thing seemed propitious to a calm and dispassionate consideration to the claim of slaveholders to add props to their system by admitting indefinitely new States to the Union . Up to this time the evil of slavery had been almost universally acknowledged and deplored by the South , and its termination ( apparently ) sincerely hoped for . By this management , its friends succeeded in blinding the confiding people of the North . They thought , for the most part , the slaveholders were acting in good faith . It is not intended by this expression that the South had all along pressed the admission of new States simply with the view to increase its own relative power . By no means : slavery had insinuated itself into favor because of its being mixed up with ( other ) supposed benefits , and because its ultimate influence on the government was neither suspected nor /z/ dreaded . But on the Missouri question there was a fair trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution . The former triumphed , and by the prime agency of one l whose raiment , the remainder of his days , ought to be sackcloth and ashes , because of the disgrace he has continued on the name of his country , and the consequent injury he has inflicted on the cause of freedom throughout the world . Although all the different administrations had , in the indirect manner already stated , favored slavery , there had not been , on any previous occasion , a direct struggle between its pretensions and the principles of liberty engrafted on the Constitution . The friends of the latter were induced to believe , whenever they should be arrayed against each other , that theirs would be the triumph . Tremendous error ! Mistake almost fatal ! The battle was fought . Slavery emerged from it unhurt , her hands made gory , her bloody plume still floating in the air , exultingly brandishing her sword over her prostrate and vanquished enemy . She had now all for which she had fought . Her victory was complete ,  --  the sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest was still more strongly fortified by the acquisition and the establishment of slavery there , as it had already been in the Territory of Louisiana . " The Missouri triumph , however , seems to have extinguished every thing like systematic or spirited opposition , on the part of the free States , to the pretensions of the slaveholding South . " Arkansas was admitted but the other day , with nothing that deserves to be called an effort to prevent it , although her Constitution attempts to perpetuate slavery /z/ by forbidding the master to emancipate his bondman without the consent of the legislature , and the legislature without the consent of the master . Emboldened , but not satisfied , with their success in every political contest with the people of the free States , the slaveholders are beginning to throw off their disguise ; to brand their former notions about the ' evil , political and moral , ' of slavery as ' folly and delusion ; ' 1 and , as if to ' make assurance doubly sure , ' and to defend themselves forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the renovation of the Constitution , they now demand openly  --  scorning to conceal that their object is to advance and establish their political power in the country  --  that Texas , a foreign state , five or six times as large as all New England , with a Constitution dyed as deep in slavery as that of Arkansas , shall be added to the Union . " Thus we have given Mr. Birney 's views of the manner slavery has advanced in the country , because we think they are plain , explicit , and to the point , and show how slavery has advanced by successive steps from being considered the worst of evils to that of the greatest good ; and , by showing this , we shall be able more clearly to perceive why our fathers did not in any manner guarantee , or even countenance , slavery , by any of their public acts ; but , on the contrary , as we shall attempt to prove , so far as they did go , their acts went to break up the whole system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , if advantage had been taken of their words by our colored popula- 1 John C. Calhoun , in the senate of the United States , made use of this expression . /z/ tion , shivery would have ceased to have existed at the time of the declaration of our independence ; and we think it can now be sufficiently shown the system has never been by law established , but that ways have been provided for its final extirpation . Such being the case , nothing but the supineness of those , both white and colored , who were and are interested , has perpetuated it in our land . In order to substantiate these assertions , it may be thought proper and necessary , since so much has been said and admitted to the contrary , to show on what they are founded , and how such a position can be maintained ; and , in order . so to do , it may be necessary to go back in our history , to ascertain what were the principles not only of the men who framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of their predecessors . Having the biography of so many of the men who first came to this country , belonging to our own race , as well as the history of the time of their first landing to the time spoken of , we can perhaps come to a just conclusion . It would hardly be necessary to assert all of our fathers had a clear conception of the value of , or even desired , universal liberty ,  --  that they were all pure , honest , and true men ; consequently we will not , however much we might wish , and we shall not , attempt to maintain such a proposition ; or that men did not come to this country with the avowed purpose and express desire , not only of making money in the ordinary modes of traffic , but that many came for the very purpose of trafficking in /z/ slaves , and of accumulating property through their agency ; and that this object and design was kept in view , either among themselves or their descendants , from the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that their influence was felt through these successive periods , and manifested itself in the acts of the men who promulgated the Declaration of Independence , who formed the confederation , and , finally , of those who adopted the Constitution . We have seen how that influence has been extended from that time to this , and that by false arguments and false reasonings they have produced the results we now witness . But that the great body of the people who came to this country , either before the declaration of independence or since , or of those who took a part in the proceedings of the revolution , were men who favored slavery , we think can not for a moment be admitted . Perhaps it may not be necessary to quote from the principal men of that day , or to go into a long and labored argument to show that they were on the side of freedom , because it would seem like arguing a point that every one admitted , and that it was too plain and palpable on the face of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it is not denied ; but yet , when respectable journals , and men in high authority , say our revolutionary fathers guaranteed slavery to the South , or left it in such a manner , that , while each and all of the different States were bound to suppress , or help suppress , an insurrec-/z/ tion that might occur among the slaves , they put it out of their power to say or do any thing against its continuance , or left no way by which it could be brought to an end by the courts , we can not conceive it in any other light than the admission that , while the men of that day made the strongest professions in favor of liberty , they were , at the same time , preparing the country for the vilest system of bondage ; in other words , making them the greatest of hypocrites ,  --  a character we do not think they deserve . It is certainly evident our Pilgrim fathers , with the advice of Robinson , came here to enjoy their civil and religious privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great principles . Although , in the course of time , - many of these principles may have been disregarded , as in the persecution of Roger Williams and the Quakers , and in some of their number holding slaves , yet , after proper discussion , and seeing the bearing to which their actions tended , they gave up the contest : and the apparent result of every trial of this kind fixed deeper , broader , and stronger , in the minds of our fathers the love of liberty ; so that no persecution of the same kind has ever taken place a second time . However much individuals might have wished a different order of things , or however much they may have been mistaken in any of their works , no sooner was the result of their actions understood by the general mass , that the great doctrine of general or individual liberty was endangered , than they /z/ at once rallied with all their powers of opposition , and caused the obnoxious measures to qease . The refusing of civil privileges , excepting to church members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as it was found to interfere with individual liberty , it was done away . Penn , with his followers , certainly entertained the same notions , and came here for a similar purpose . The German population , also , that settled in New York and Pennsylvania , entertained , in a greater or less degree , the same idea : this we think is evident in the attachment which the German population in the State of Pennsylvania still manifest towards what is called the republican party in the United States . Wherever and whenever they become convinced that one party , rather than the other , embodies the republican principle , there they are sure to side ; and , in fact , it is appealing to this principle alone , and convincing them that the persons who would obtain office will maintain their sentiments , that any have the most distant hope of success . l Mr. Haynes , in a speech made in the senate of the United States , January 21 , 1836 , said : " The people whom I represent are the descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the most precious of their possessions , an ardent love of liberty ; and , while that shall be preserved , they will 1 The result of the past election , we can not but think , was in part caused by appealing to this very principle . /z/ always be found manfully struggling against the consolidation of this government as the worst of evils . " The State of North Carolina was settled for the most part by Quakers , and the people of that State have been , from the beginning , less attached to slavery , if we can judge from the proceedings of their public bodies , than most of the Southern States . At the time of the formation of the Constitution their delegates received no instructions on the subject of slavery , while those from South Carolina and Georgia did . The delegates from this State were left to act according to their own judgment on the subject , and it may be it was through the influence of the Quakers they were so left . Now while it may not be questioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the simple purpose of making money , let the mode of making it be what it might , yet there can be no question but that a great proportion came here , though they may have wished to have bettered their condition , for the purpose of avoiding the tyranny practised in the old world . It was uncomfortable to them , and they wanted to live in a situation where they shouid not be under so much restraint ; and , considering the small ness of the island of Great Britain , it may be presumed that those who came from thence in a great measure sympathized with one another in this thirsting after a greater civil liberty than they there enjoyed ; and though they separated far and wide when they arrived on these shores , yet the same /z/ spirit animated them , and the same thoughts filled their breasts . ' In all their controversies with the mother country , this Spirit was ever uppermost : it manifested itself at the time of William and ' Mary , of Chromwell ; and finally it broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution . At this time it had gained , if we may so speak , a form and substance . The repeated discussions on the subject throughout the colonies , for a series of years , had matured and brought out the idea in prominent relief . The idea this land should be the land of the free , that this great continent should and ought to be governed by impartial laws , and not by that system of favoritism , tyranny , and misrule , that was so general throughout the kingdoms of Europe , was fully developed . They meant to establish a government of peace and good-will to all men , and where every one might " sit under his own vine and fig-tree without any to molest or make afraid . " We find them in all of their proceedings , however much they may have been opposed by individuals , or however often they may have been prevented in so doing , laboring to carry out this idea to its fullest extent ; and it is evident that one of the obstacles in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in slaves . They felt its injurious effects ; and Mr. Jefferson made it one of the grounds of complaint in the draft of the Declaration of Independence  --  and it was approved by the committee who were appointed to make this draft  - -  that Great Britain should have forced these people /z/ upon them in the manner she did , against the remonstrances and wishes of the colonies . But as certain individuals in this country had entered into the traffic , and many had what they considered their property in these people , interest was made to have that clause in the Declaration struck out , and it was done . But the great principles that animated them still remained embodied in the instrument ; and , the moment it was adopted by this country , every slave was free ; and such undoubtedly must have been the understanding of the men who promulgated it , unless they should be accused of the want of understanding the meaning of the words they had used . Could the men of that age use the language " that all men are created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain inalienable rights , that among these are life , . liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " without being aware , if the negro was a man , he must be included ? We think not . No exception was made to him , and his situation was fully understood by the man who wrote these words , and by the people who adopted them as their own ; and the only cause why the negro did not receive at that time universal freedom throughout the States was , as we believe , because they had no champion among their own number to assert and make known their rights , and bring their cause before the mind of the public . Certain it was , the men of that age expressed themselves openly and unequivocally , and we humbly think it was owing to their not being seconded /z/ by our colored friends , they did not succeed in their wishes . l But a supposed interest , joined with a real or pretended claim of others , of the consequence of freeing so many in their midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they supposed , or pretended they were , of the ideas of civil liberty , and hearing nothing from this race to the contrary , they were prevailed upon to pass over the subject in silence , though they did not and would not give up the principle which , if carried out , would cause the freedom of every man in our land . As an evidence of this , we find that slavery , , in those States where the whites greatly overbalanced the colored people , was immediately or prospectively abolished , and the most prominent men of those days took an active part in having it done . 1 General Warren , in his address on the 6th of March , 1775 , only one hundred and nine days before his death on Bunker Hill , delivered in the Old South Church , on the anniversary of the celebrated Boston Massacre , gave utterance to the following sentiments : " That personal freedom is the natural right of every man , and that property , or an exclusive right to dispose of what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are truths that common sense has placed beyond the reach of contradiction . And no man , or body of men , can , without being guilty of flagrant injustice , claim a right to dispose of the persons or acquisitions of any other man , or body of men . unless it can be proved that such a right has arisen from some compact between the parties , in which it has been explicitly and freely granted . ' ' /z/ As an evidence of the fact of the desire our fathers entertained for universal liberty , and that this country should be the land of the free , we shall quote from some of the state papers put forth by congress , and from the observations made by distinguished men of that day . We shall begin by taking an extract from " A Declaration by the Representatives of the United Colonies of ? sorth America , setting forth the causes and necessity of their taking up arms .

" Extract from the Address to the American People by Congress , May 8 , 1778 .

Look at the army at Yalley Forge : almost naked in the dead of winter ; almost literally without food or raiment , or they had such only as was barely enough to support their animal wants ; nay , they had not enough to satisfy their hunger , or to shield them from the severity of the cold . Take the British officer 's account , which we shall shortly give , of Marion 's situation ; and Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with him ; for they did not always have enough even of potatoes . Imagine to yourself an army of men living in the woods , sustaining themselves upon roasted potatoes , their plates sheets of bark , their tables logs , and their fingers for knives and forks , day after day , month after /z/ month , exposed to the hot sun and chilly damps of a southern climate : and all , as is said , for " liberty ; " and liberty not so much for themselves as for posterity . If they were wrong , it seems , at least , we should be charitable towards such failings ; but yet here is the principle for which we contend ,  --  that it was for liberty , and liberty alone , that produced our Revolution , and that this was the mainspring and moving power that put in action the men of that day ; and without it the Revolution could not have been carried on , nor , so far as human observation can be made , could it have been successfully terminated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a disenthraldom of the state from a foreign power , an independency of government , but it was the liberty of the individual that was sought ; it was to shield him from oppressive taxes , to protect him from being quartered upon by a brutal soldiery , and their money from going to build up a rich few in the island of Great Britain . 1 1 la the Introduction to the Biographical Dictionary , compiled by J. J. Rogers , it is said that Mr. Benjamin West told Mr. J. Adams , while he was minister to the court of St. James , that the cause for taxing the colonies without their consent arose from the fact that the courtiers around George III . urged him to build for himself a more elegant palace than the one he was then living in , as it did not compare with the palaces of other kings on the continent ; and when he was informed that there was not money enough in the treasury to supply his wants for that purpose , ( a million was aked for , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , he consented to make the attempt ; and the famous stamp act was passed in March , 1765 . His palace was to have been built in Hyde Park ; and Mr. West showed Mr. Adams the /z/ We do not here quote from the Declaration of Independence , because we shall have occasion so often to refer to its language it is not necessary . Gov . Hancock , in a speech made in 1784 , in commemoration of the Boston Massacre , makes use of the following expressions : " Security to the persons and property of the government is so obviously the design and end of civil government , that to attempt a logical proof of it would be like burning tapers at noonday to assist the sun in enlightening the world ; and it can not be virtuous or honorable to attempt to support a government of which this is not the great and principal basis ; and it is to the last degree vicious and infamous to attempt to support a government which manifestly tends to render the persons and properties of the governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a friend to righteous government , founded on the principle of reason and justice ; but I glory in publicly avowing rny eternal enmity to tyranny " Mr. Hancock was chosen president of the convention of Massachusetts , to take into consideration the adoption of the present Constitution , but did not attend till the last week of the session . It was said a majority of the convention would be against the adoption , and that the governor was with the opposers. 1 " Certain amendments were proposed to remove the objections of those who thought some of the articles deprived the people site which was there marked out for that purpose . Thus , for the sake of a palace , George III . lost a kingdom . /z/ of their rights . He introduced those amendments with great propriety , and voted for the adoption of the Constitution . His name and influence doubtless turned many in favor of the federal government . " It will be seen in the sequel that some of these amendments , written probably to do away , in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , in fact , special reference to the slaves in the Southern States ; and it will be found that , with slight amendments , retaining , however , all the principles contended for , they were finally added to the Constitution . It was this man , in conjunction with Samuel Adams , who headed the opposition to the proposed tyrannical measures of the British government , who makes objection to the proposed Constitution , not only on account of his jealousy for State rights , but on account of its acknowledging slavery at all , and the fear he entertained what might be the result ; and it was the same person who , when General Washington proposed to Congress to bombard the town of Boston , while occupied by the British , and while Mr. H. was - president of that body , and because it was known most of his property was invested in real estate there , " the house resolved itself into the committee of the whole , in order to give him an opportunity to give his opinion . " * After he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole in the following words : " It is true , sir , nearly all the property I have in the /z/ world is in houses and other real estate in the town of Boston ; but if the expulsion of the British army from it , the liberties of our country require their being burnt to ashes , issue the order for that purpose immediately . " Samuel Adams , who with Hancock were the only two individuals the English government could not pardon for their rebellion in the first stages of the difficulties , objected to the adoption of the Constitution as proposed , and stated he could not give it his support unless certain amendments were recommended to be adopted . After consultation , amendments were prepared , which were brought before the convention , and referred to a committee , who made some inconsiderable alterations , which being accepted , the Constitution was adopted . Some of these , as we have just remarked , were afterwards agreed to as amendments to the Constitution , and form at present a part of that instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present day should like , because they are not so distinct as we could wish ; yet they secure the person from excessive fines , and secure him , before punishment , a trial by jury , and also freed him from cruel and unusual punishments . He also objected to the article that made the State amenable to the courts of the nation . He thought it would reduce them to mere corporations . l 1 It is said that , when it was found Messrs . Hancock and Adams were opposed to the adoption of the Constitution , the people of Boston held a meeting in the tavern called the Green Dragon , and passed some very spirited resolutions on the subject , urging its /z/ We do not know whether Gen.

His expressions occurred on the occasion of the British sending a flag from Georgetown , South Carolina , for the exchange of prisoners . The young officer , after transacting his business , being invited to dine , was seated on the trunk of a fallen pine , and one of the men was requested to hand the dinner ; whereupon he drew a quantity of sweet potatoes from the ashes near by , and , after blowing them with his mouth , and wiping them with the sleeve of his shirt , set them between the general and the officer on a large piece of bark . The young man not relishing his food very well , and not able to refrain from laughing at his reception in the American generals camp , and at the bill of fare , observed , after other conversation , he did not believe it would be easy to reconcile his feelings to a soldier 's life on Gen. Marion 's terms ,  --  adoption , and that these proceedings were the occasion of the attempt made by Hancock and Adams to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty and justice ; and , having recommended amendments which would secure the slave his individual rights , and the rights of the States , of which they were also very jealous , they satisfied their consciences to its other provisions ; and , after these amendments were adopted by congress , they ceased their opposition . /z/ " All fighting , no ' pay , and no provisions but potatoes . " " ' Why , sir , ' answered the general , ' the heart is all ; and when that is much interested a man can do any thing . Many a youth would think it hard to indent himself a slave for fourteen years . But let him be over head and ears in love , and with such a beauteous sweetheart as Rachel , and he will think no more of fourteen years servitude than young Jacob did . Well , now , this is exactly my case . I am in love , and my sweetheart is liberty .

' " The officer replied that , both as a man and as a Briton , he must certainly subscribe to this as a happy state of things . " ' Happy ! ' quoth Marion ; ' yes , happy indeed ; and I would rather fight for such blessings for my country , and feed on roots , than keep aloof , though wantoning in all the luxuries of Solomon .

Watson , his commanding officer , what made him look so sad , he said , ' Why , sir , I have seen an American general and his officers , without pay , and almost without clothes , living on roots , and drinking water ; and all for liberty ! what chance have we against such men !

And now , having left the important alternative , political happiness or wretchedness , under God , in a great degree in your hands , I pray the supreme Arbiter of the affairs of men so to direct your judgment , as that you may act agreeably to what seems to be his will , revealed in his miraculous works in behalf of America , bleeding at the altar of liberty .

" 3 We can not but think it was the views held forth /z/ in some of the preceding quotations , that arrested the attention of Lafayette , and finally the sympathy of the French nation . My honored grandfather  --  whose name was George Frost , who resided in the State of New Hampshire , and who was a member of the congress in 1778  --  9 , and who was also a judge in one of the State courts , and whose popularity was such , that , in one office to which he was elected , there was but one dissenting vote cast against him ,  --  before the Revolution , held slaves ; 1 but , as soon as the State government went into operation , he freely gave them their liberty , because , according to its bill of rights and its Constitution , which perhaps , from his standing , he may have had an influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at that time , ceased in that State ; it was the same in Massachusetts ; and , sooner or later , it ceased in all of the States north of Mason 's and Dixon 's line .

The woman , when she was told she was free , said she had a good home , she knew not where she could get a better , and she should like to , and she did , slay where she was . The young man sought a home elsewhere ; but , after a few months , finding it was necessary to support his animai existence by labor , and not finding any place better for that purpose , he was glad to return . As it was with them , so it would probably be with a good portion of our colored people at the South . " Wherever they have been properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would undoubtedly remain on the same estate on which they happened to be at the time they should receive their freedom . /z/ revolutionary struggle , ( and these are but few out of many , ) can it be possible that these men , when they came to provide for the administration of justice , and the general welfare of the country , which they had rescued from the hands of an oppressor , could have guaranteed to any portion of this country that they would maintain within its borders a system that would be in violation of every principle they had heretofore professed ,  --  that they would guarantee an institution which many among their number had already denounced as one of the evils against which they had struggled , and the means by which that system was perpetuated has been termed by our government piracy ? It can not be ! We would renounce the thought . That many of them may have been mistaken in their views , and that they did not fully carry out the principles they had promulgated , or rather they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , because we admit this , it is not necessary that we must deny them all desire , on their part , to have fulfilled all their obligations to their country and the world . They had a great work to accomplish ; they had much opposition to encounter , both from and open foes ; and we must be thankful they accomplished as much as they did , and now help carry out their principles of liberty , either upon the foundation they laid , or upon others , which greater light in this later age may havethrown in our path . But , before we lay any other foundation than that that is laid , let us clear away the rubbish that has been thrown upon it , and see /z/ if it is not sufficiently broad and well founded for all the purposes we would accomplish ; and , if it is so , we may be saved the trouble and expense of laying another . For this purpose , we will go to the Declaration of Independence , the Confederacy , and to the Constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these instruments ? Without commenting on the explanation since given of the expressions on the subject of the equality of man , that they are but a " flourish of trumpets. * ' what do they say ? /z/ The Declaration of Independence declares ,  --  " We hold these truths to be self-evident ,  --  that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; that , to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ; that , whenever any government becomes destructive to these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it , and to institute a new government , laying its foundation on such principles , and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . " Here , we think , are principles broad and comprehensive enough , and which , if carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were adopted by the people of the United States as their opinions , and the reasons why they took up arms - against the mother country , did annihilate , so far as words could , the whole slave system . That moment , every slave in the United States was /z/ free ; and , if our colored friends had taken advantage of the declaration here made , and laid in their claim to be included in the family of man , and as a portion of the people of the United States , we do not see , we can not see , how their claim could have been disallowed by the men of that age . In fact , we believe the writer of these sentiments , seeing how utterly the colored man 's rights were denied him , suggested to his mind the expressions here used , and he meant they should be broad enough to cover his case ; and , unless we deny to him and the men associated with him the knowledge of the meaning of words , and of their bearing , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every person in our country should be free . They made no exception to the African race ; but , on the contrary , it is well known the person who wrote this declaration made the observation , that he trembled for his country , when he reflected that God was just , and that he could not take sides with us in such a contest as might take place between the oppressor and the oppressed . We have seen what many of the most active men engaged in that Revolution have said ; we know what was the action of the States north of the Potomac ; and we must ' come to the conclusion that the people of that time both understood the meaning of the language here used , and meant to have the principles carried out to their fullest extent . In order to show that such must have been their intentions , we will go on and examine the Constitution , and endeavor to see how that harmo- /z/ nizes with these sentiments ; but , before going to that instrument , we will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederation was formed at the commencement of the revolutionary war . It was a league among sovereign States for the purpose of repelling a common enemy ; and , as it was formed in anticipation of an arduous contest , it is for the most part taken up in defining the powers of congress and the several States , as regards the preparations and carrying on of warlike operations , and in describing the powers of the several States , and that of congress in their action on this subject . They had just made their declaration of sentiments ; it was for liberty . They had taken up arms ; and it was for liberty . They were to be united ; and we perceive this idea of liberty to be the prominent one running through this whole instrument . Without making any other professions than those they had made in the Declaration of Independence , they , in the first place , simply style the confederacy " The United States of America . " Then each State was to have its own sovereignty , freedom , and independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a " league of friendship with each other , for their common defence , the security of their liberties , and their mutual and general welfare , " &c.; And , " the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in the Union , the free inhabitants of each of these /z/ States " ( paupers , vagabonds , and fugitives from justice excepted ) shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of free citizens of the several States ; and the people of each State shall have free ingress and egress to and from every other State , " &c.; This sentence is the only one to which allusion is in any way made to slaves in this country . A stranger could not determine that there were any , but by the word free as applied to persons ; and this word is not uniformly used before the term people , even in this very sentence . It was a word , undoubtedly even in its connection , forced in , much to the discomfiture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , " the people of each State shall have ingress and egress to and from every other State , " does not have the word free before it ; so that , under the Confederation , if this sentence should be construed in its enlarged sense , every slave , if he belonged to the family of man , would have the power of going from one State to another as he listed . He might be deprived of the privileges of a free citizen in every thing but locomotion . This , according to the strict construction of the language , was not denied him . In article 15th we have this expression : " Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in congress assembled , in all questions which by this Confederation are submitted to them . " Now we should construe this , that any question arising , in which the " common defence , " the " security of liberty , " the " mutual and general /z/ welfare , and the perpetuation of mutual friendship and intercourse , " was involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederation ; and , if they at the time thought slavery , was to interrupt these relations , they would probably have acted definitely on the subject ; but , as it was , they took an indirect course , and left it for the colored man to ascertain what his rights were from the principles they had established . But the Confederation 's it is well known , for its want of vitality in other respects , did not , as was urged by some , though denied by others , fulfil the intentions of the people of the country , and the Constitution was adopted . The question now arises , what were the intentions of the men who went to Philadelphia to form this Constitution , and the intentions of the men who sent them there ? Where shall we look to ascertain this ? Here was a large and extensive country . They had , by the course of Providence , been put in possession of it , and it belonged to them to make rules and regulations , or , in other words , laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from the mother country for the ostensible purpose of freeing it from the tyranny she was endeavoring to practise towards it , and this great continent , from Maine to Georgia , and from the Atlantic ocean to the Mississippi , was to be under the guidance and direction of the men who should compose the convention then about to sit . Had the principles that had actuated our revolutionary fathers changed ? had their love of the right , their love of liberty , /z/ at all declined ? had they forgotten the principles they had promulgated in the Declaration of Independence and their other documents ? No ! for the first words they promulgate to the world , after their arduous deliberation , were , " We , the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The object , as they say , was to establish justice , as if injustice had in some measure prevailed in the land , and also to see that right should predominate ; and , if there were any practices in the United States that militated against the right , then it was their intention they should be done away ; consequently , such evil practices would be in opposition to the object for which the Constitution was formed . Now if slavery is wrong  --  and it was so considered by our fathers  --  the system must come under the class of those practices . which they considered unjust ; and that they did consider slavery unjust may be proved from the fact that the war of the Revolution was wholly carried on , on the principle of resisting the attempts of Great Britain to enslave them by improper taxation : they could not bear to be unjustly taxed in their purse ; how much less , then , could they have borne to have their whole body and soul under the command of any one who /z/ seemed disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system as one of the greatest wrongs , and directly opposed to the first principles of justice . The next object was to insure the " domestic tranquillity . " The question here arises , how can this be secure ? evidently by " establishing justice ; " and any thing that is at war with justice is at war with peace ; and , consequently , no lasting tranquillity can be maintained so long as injustice prevails . Man seems as if he could not be at ease under oppression , as if his whole nature revolted at it , and wars have ever been the consequence of it . History of wars , both public and private , portrays a series of attempts to throw off the yoke of the oppressor ; and can the United States hope to secure peace in any other way than by acting uprightly ? If so , her hope must be vain . The only sure course is , not only in her foreign , but in her private , relations , to act towards all with that impartiality and good faith that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No other course can possibly secure tranquillity but such a course of action . Is slavery , then , treating the colored man in good faith ? does this give no occasion for offence in treating him as she does ? has he , under this system , all the rights of the white man ? can he come and go like him ? does he not perceive how widely different he is treated , and does he not take note of it ? Let the South Hampton insurrection answer ; let the Florida war answer ; let all the various insurrections and attempts at such be /z/ written in a book , and sum up their number , and see if he has been satisfied with his treatment , and if we can hope , by the continuance of such treatment , he will be likely to learn to acquiesce in it . No ! the facts are , no domestic tranquillity can be maintained under a system of slavery ; and even if our fathers thought it could , though we do not believe they did , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none , it would be our bounden duty , both as their decendants , and as Americans , in order to fulfil their object , to do away not only with slavery , but every other practice , so far as in our power , that should interrupt this tranquillity . And we must be false to our trust if we do not . We should be jealous of every practice , whatever it might be , that would have a tendency to bring into collision the different sections of this great family , and no one part of it can have the right to introduce such practices as would have such a tendency , without making itself liable to have its conduct scanned and questioned by the other part ; and if it can be proved that such would be the case , then the whole would have a right to interfere , and cause such proceedings to cease , and bring about a different order of things . Let it not be here said each part has a right to regulate their own affairs . None have a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , then have not the South the right to continue it ; and , viewing it in this light , has not the South been changing her mind on the subject of its guilt , in part , because the Constitution will not uphold her in her course ? There are THE ARGUxMENT. 59 many reasons to suppose it is so , and the cause of her sensitiveness is owing to the consciousness of her dereliction from duty , and the opposition of her practices from the first principles of right , and the object for which the Constitution was formed . The next object was to provide for the common defence . Even in this purpose , although it might more particularly be applied to foes without , and the securing ourselves from external attacks , the common defence can not be so well provided for when it is necessary that a good portion of our troops have to be employed in keeping in subjection a portion of our own people ; and therefore , in providing for the common defence , as wise legislatures , and a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would interfere with the facility of defending the country in the best possible manner . If , then , slavery , or any other circumstances , arise to prevent its defence , and these domestic relations come in to thwart , and to prevent the security of-the country from external foes , then the congress of the United States would not be fulfilling its duty , did it not do away , so far as in them laid , the obstruction , and prepare the country for the defence , one of the objects for which the Constitution was formed . We see not how we can get rid of such a conclusion ; and that slavery does lay the country open to the facility of external attacks , and that slaves , as a body , might be easily worked upon to join a foreign standard , might be easily conceived ; and that the Hon. John Q , . Adams was correct , when he /z/ asserted the whole system might come under the action of congress , by the way of the war powers . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is this to be done ? Certainly not by fostering and maintaining within our borders what is , and what has heretofore been , considered and acknowledged a moral and political evil ; because such a proceeding could not be for the general welfare . And here , again , we think , maybe seen one of the causes why our southern politicians are so anxious to have the character of slavery changed , and that it should be considered a blessing rather than a curse , and the reason of their anxiety to show that it was an institution of the Bible . 1 For none of them could hope , for a moment , now at this late day , to maintain that the slaves of this country had not been in the land a sufficient length of time to learn the plan of civilized society , if they had been properly instructed . They can not now complain of the want of time , because they have , in many cases , made it penal to teach a slave to read . Hence they would change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt , and would denounce every one who would not agree with them upon the subject as ' - being worthy of death without benefit of clergy . " Fatal mistake ! to suppose mankind will ever consent that wrong is risht. and right wrong . The public mind need or needed but to be enlightened on the subject , to cause /z/ them to express a universal execration of the foulness of its nature . Our fathers may in some measure be excused for not taking more summary measures for cutting off so unseemly an excrescence , from the opposition they had to encounter , and the trials and troubles they had already gone through : and , no doubt , the argument that they would receive within their civil privileges a body of comparatively heathen and ignorant people , who would not appreciate their situation , and might endanger , through their want of knowledge , in that part of the country where they were the most numerous , the free institutions which they had been so long laboring to establish : and it was mainly for this reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the expectation that what they had accomplished would soon extirpate the evil . But . as has been before remarked , it was a sad mistake ; and , since a sufficient time has elapsed to have instructed these men , so that that excuse can have now no weight , we should exert all our powers to do away an evil so monstrous , and relieve our land from a disgrace under which it is laboring , and from the necessary evils slavery must and does bring in its course , such as ignorance , dissipation , vice , immorality , and the consequent degradation and death to which these lead , and which are utterly opposed , not only to the general welfare of this country , but to a large portion of mankind in different quarters of the globe . The arts , sciences , manufactures , even agriculture , declines under its withering influences . /z/ Under the general welfare of the United States , which was placed in the power of congress to consult , might they not take into consideration the whole subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying there was any compact , for there was none : there is neither letter nor page where it can be found . But here is a declaration before the world , and this nation has committed itself , that this country shall be ruled by impartial laws , and that the congress of the United States shall consult in all things the general welfare of the people . And if they do not , then are they false to their trust , and do not fulfil the intention of our fathers ; and the objects for Which the Constitution was formed ore laid low in the dust , and we can not look to that instrument as a guide and a rule for the conduct of our representatives : nor can foreigners look to it as an instrument from whence they can learn the genius of our government ; and if they can not look here to find out the object for which it was formed , where can they ? evidently , nowhere . Here is the only official declaration given to the world , of the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted ; and if we of this generation have departed from these principles , and mean this great continent shall be ruled or governed on different ones , it is time we should change the caption to the Constitution , and place another in its stead , that mankind may not be deceived , and particularly those of the African race , if they should road this instrument to become acquainted with its principles , for the purpose of determining whether to come to our shores . /z/ The last and most important object for which the Constitution was formed was to secure liberty not only to themselves , but to us and our posterity ; or , as they expressed it , " the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . " They looked abroad upon this great land ; they found a great portion of this continent placed under their jurisdiction ; and , however fallible many and perhaps all of them may have been , and however anxious many may have been to secure to the few the principal portion of the government , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , and that it was by this alone any great improvement could be carried on in civil society , they made this the keystone of the arch that was to bear the weight of the republic . This was to be considered as paramount ; it capped the climax of the blessings to be communicated to generations yet unborn . They had become acquainted with the evils of individual slavery , as it then existed in the African ; they had successfully resisted the attempt of Great Britain to impose on them a political slavery ; and they now stood forth to the world , free and independent . They had , by severe exertions , secured to themselves freedom from the restraints of the mother country ; and they were now preparing to secure themselves from any unwarrantable exercise of power that might spring up among themselves , and preventany individual or individuals from gaining any unlimited power . Propositions had been made , and rejectedj-to create these United States into a /z/ monarchy , and to erect a throne in this country ; the people and the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question on which they were acting : , the meaning of the words they were using , and their import . They consented to no proposition they did not mean to carry into effect ; but every thing , so far as we can understand their determination , was distinct and plain , though all of their subsequent acts might not have been so . In that assembly , as there ever will be in all assemblies of men , there may have been some who would have gladly perverted the powers delegated to them , to subserve their own vile purposes , or who , through righteous fear of the consequences of popular government , wished to give as much power to the executive as they thought would be necessary to carry out any measure that congress might consider right , independent of the general mind ,  --  men who , having no faith in the power of the people to take care of themselves , and who were ever anxious to provide for them suitable directors and governors , and consequently were continually proposing guards and checks for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both directly and impliedly , powers to congress that the people , in their conventions , did not wholly approve ; and , consequently , many amendments in favor of liberty were proposed , and wen- in part adopted , and now make a portion of this instrument . In Virginia , and in many of the States , the opposition was very strong , because congress assumed so /z/ much ; and though in the caption it would seem as if there was nothing frightful , yet , as we shall see , the expression " we the people " produced in the breast of one man , if no more , great distrust ; and , if the people ever became so corrupt as to change the meaning of terms , and call wrong right , and right wrong , as they have seemed of late willing to do , then , indeed , might such an expression be fearful , but not otherwise . Thus we have gone over the caption of our Constitution ; and , if it should have its principles carried out in good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who should legislate for the country might be deceived in their course of action . No one , however , could have any cause to complain that his individual rights were wrested from him , as the courts would at all times be open for his protection . We will now take up in order the different articles of the Constitution that have a bearing on our subject , and try to ascertain what may be their meaning . In article 1st , 2d section , 3d paragraph , we have this expression : " Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the States which may be included within this Union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other persons . " On this it may be supposed there was considerable debate ; and , as it is the strong hold on which many here /z/ ground their assertion that the Constitution guaranteed slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consider it in its various relations . We have examined the secret proceedings of the convention which prepared the Constitution , but we can not find in them any thing said at the time on which to make up a judgment of the intent and meaning of this clause , and consequently our remarks here will be drawn from what appears on its face . To one unacquainted with all the circumstances of the case , the language would undoubtedly be unmeaning . They would not know what was meant by the " three fifths of all other persons . " They here find that taxes and representation were to be apportioned by reckoning together all free persons , and those bound to service , and three fifths of all other persons , excluding Indians not taxed . Now the term free persons might have relation , and be used in opposition , to those bound to service , or to paupers , as well as other individuals ; and , unless we knew there were slaves in this country , we could not suppose , from what had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and undoubtedly our fathers were ashamed to use the term slave , as applied to the condition of any people then under their jurisdiction . They therefore avoided it ; and it would seem as if some one had worded this phrase in such a manner that it would not require an alteration of the Constitution for the purpose of having representatives chosen , or taxes collected , provided the system of slavery should be done away , and were careful to have it so /z/ worded as to exclude the idea , as much as possible , that they had any thing to do with it ; and although it has been asserted that , because the Constitution recognized the system so far as to base taxation and representation upon it , ( for it is maintained , and without doubt it is the case , the three fifths of all other persons meant slaves , ) consequently slavery is guaranteed , does this necessarily follow ? We think not . It only says , while there are any other persons in the community besides free persons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five of all others should be considered but equal to three ; but if there were no such other persons , there could be none to be so reckoned , and consequently every man would be considered as a man , enjoying all the privileges of a freeman ; so that the construction of the sentence evidently looked to the time when there should be no such other persons . But , even taking it as looking to the perpetual continuance of slavery , and that taxes and representation were to be apportioned accordingly , and our fathers made the bargain with their eyes open , and that for these considerations , as has been alleged , they agreed to this section , because slaves should be taxed in proportion to their representation , and that , for this reason , we have guaranteed the preservation of this property , we maintain that , as the consideration has been taken away , the corresponding obligation is also taken away . It was then expected that this government in a great measure would be supported by direct taxes , and conse- /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of representatives in proportion to the free inhabitants would be balanced by the greater amount of taxes they would have to pay in proportion to their representation ; and , if they did make such a bargain , though in morals it could not or should not stand , yet perhaps it may be said it should continue to be binding upon all future generations . But we ask what is now the case ? and what brought about a different arrangement ? and why are there at this present day no direct taxes for the support of government ? We say , because the South , finding she had made a bad pecuniary bargain , took advantage of the reluctance which most men , and particularly the poor man . had of paying away money in a direct manner for the use of the powers that he , joined in with this reluctance , and used her persuasion to induce a majority of congress to raise their taxes indirect means , upon the imports of the country ; and , although it was done with much opposition of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as advancing the idea , and agreeing with the northern mechanic , that such a course would help manufactures , succeeded in gaining her object thereby , as undoubtedly she well understood , threw most of the burden of the government on the North ; for they could say to themselves , and without doubt did , " As our slaves do not use much , if any , foreign goods , we shall have but little or no duty to pay for what they consume , while we shall have sixty-one votes for every hun- /z/ dred of our slaves , to elect members to congress . Saving what foreign goods we and our immediate families may consume , we can arrange it so that the coarse clothing that will answer for our slaves can be manufactured in this country , or else have it free of duty , and , by this operation , save ourselves from the onerous necessity of paying taxes , and throw them all off on our northern friends . " This , whether they reasoned so or not , they effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure against her wish , or at least against the wish of those who made the bargain , and it being said , and at last finding manufactures might be made profitable , if they could have the home trade , and that there was a prospect , if it could be secured to her , she would be able to maintain herself against foreign capital , consented , and a tariff was made , when it was thought by the South it might also be a benefit to her . But , after a series of years , when it was ascertained that the " peculiar institution " there was not congenial to such labor , then threats , bravadoes , and all the arts and contrivances of which their fertile geniuses were capable of devising , were put in requisition to reduce the duties on all goods to such an amount as would just enable the government to get along without affording any protection to manufactures , or having that at all in view . Now , although there may be no objection to having things as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the North guaranteed slavery to the South ( though we do /z/ not admit she ever did ) has been forcibly taken from her , and she is no longer under any obligation to fulfil her part of the contract . The value received is gone , and taken , too , without her consent : and therefore she is under no further obligation for any guaranty that may be said to have been given for the continuance of so foul a system , admitting , also , ( which is not admitted , ) she had a right to make such a compact , or guaranty . But , so far as has been made public , there is no evidence any such was given , or ought , or could have been given . And , besides , we think it would be a very pertinent question to ask ,  --  did the colored man agree to be considered but three fifths of a man ? did he acknowledge the right of the delegates , assembled to form the Constitution , to legislate for him ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates were to take away all his rights ? and has he ever yet acknowledged the justice of those proceedings ? It can safely be answered , no ; not until he has a right to vote , and be heard on the floor of congress , can it be said he has agreed to his debasement . V ither can the American congress ever usurp the right without involving itself in the most palpable guilt . They therefore did not , they could not admit , and they would have been ashamed to have expressed openly , if they could have admitted , there was a person in the land from whom they were taking away the right of being fully heard before those who were exercising the right of taxing him . Here , however , the influ- /z/ ence of the slaveholder was felt , and here it came up in opposition to the free spirit of the land , and endeavored to bend it to its own purposes , and , after long , labored , and vexatious discussion , and an express determination to trig the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent was at last obtained , that , if there were any other persons in the community than free persons , and those bound to service for a term of years , then they should be considered but as three fifths of a man . But , in such a forced consent as that , when so many other rights were thought to be involved , can it now be argued that this consent must be held in the light of a guaranty to maintain forever a system of slavery in our land ? We think not ; the most that can be made of it is , an evil of such magnitude existed , they felt themselves powerless to root it out ; but , if the system is maintained , that community who upholds it shall not have so extensive political privileges as the one that does not , a portion at least of her people are but three fifths of other men . Whether there is not a deep censure of those States that will suffer their population to be so degraded , implied in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a question . In the first clause of the Sth section , article 1st , power is given to congress " to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises ; to pay the debts , and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States ; that all duties , imposts , and excises shall be uniform /z/ throughout the United States . ' ' Now , if it should be denied congress was the representative of the people , but of the States , and , as such , had no power to interfere with the internal policy of the States , yet this clause would show that , as representative of the States , it was vested with the power to provide for the common defence and the general welfare : and , having the power , it is their duty to attend to both these subjects ; and , if a discussion should be had on any subject involving either , and , consequently , if any State , or number of States , are pursuing a system of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the obstruction removed , and to see that the United States , as a whole , are not injured ; and if it can be proved  --  and we think it can be  --  that slavery is an obstruction to the common defence , and requires constant care and vigilance of our army , and , consequently , is an expense to the countr and . further , that the general welfare suffers by its continuance , that it injures the morals , the peace , and harmony of the communities in which it exists , and the advancement of civilization , and the general cause of truth , of virtue , of science , &c.;  --  then , we say . this clause places it in the power of congress , whether it is done as " we the people , " or as we the States , to put an end to its continuance . It can not be argued that a State . " i- any number of States , may institute such practices within their borders as to require the protective oversight of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these others to say aught against /z/ their conduct . If , therefore , congress should open its doors , that its evils may be discussed , and , after mature deliberation , it is found the evils attending it are not so great as has been represented , as a mere political body they can say so ; but if , on the contrary , it can be shown its character is bad , that it is an incubus upon the body politic , a violation of the laws of God and of human nature , then it would be their duty , if there is no other way provided , to act in the premises , and do away a system whose evil consequences to the community are apparent , however much any particular section of country may be wedded to it . The sixteenth paragraph of the same section and article has relation to the " power of congress over any district that might be ceded to the United States , as the seat of government , and the places purchased for the erection of forts , magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the seventeenth to the making " all laws which shall be necessary for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department thereof . " The legislative power over the places mentioned above is " exclusive ; " no one else is to share it with them , and , consequently , it must be as unlimited as any of the State legislatures . We do not see in either of these paragraphs any allusion made that it was necessary for them to conform to the proceedings of other States to determine them in their actions in regard to the territories over /z/ which they were to exercise their authority . The expression is  --  and this , let it be remarked , was made before the seat of government was located  --  that over any spot " not exceeding ten miles square they were to have exclusive jurisdiction , " as also the same over the other places , above enumerated , they should wish to purchase of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this subject , of the power of congress over the spaces allotted for their use , we can not but come to the conclusion that no State is to share the power of legislation with them , and that this power of legislation is exclusively in congress : the States relinquished their right when they ceded the territory . Article 2d , section 9th , first paragraph : ' : The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , but a tax , or duty , may be imposed on such importation , not exceeding ten dollars for each person . " Though nothing is said , in this article , what is meant by the words migration and importation , as respects persons , we will admit , for the sake of the argument , that they referred to slaves , though it might be supposed the putting on such a forced meaning to the word migration was altogether gratuitous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression " importation of persons " might , without any great departure from the principle of construction , mean any body else beside slaves . /z/ Yet we will let it all pass , and say it was slaves that was meant ; and , in so doing , we must confess here was a great dereliction from duty ; and though we can not agree with some that all the delegates who formed the Constitution were sent there to have such a sentence inserted in that instrument , yet it must be confessed there was exertion made to have it done ; and our fathers , in imitation of the reed that bends before the storm , gave way to the influences around them , hoping they might erect their heads after the wind had passed , with more security of escaping the destruction which they might think awaited them had they been less complying . But , even here , they studiously avoided the word slave ; and they gained a point ; for , in the Confederation , they had no control over the subject in the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it to an end in twenty years , and they have so done . They have further declared the act to be piracy , with the penalty of death attached to all those who should be found engaged in the traffic . Our southern friends can decide for themselves , whether is the greater crime , buying slaves in Africa and bringing them to these shores , or buying them in one district of this country and sending them to another . For ourselves , we can see none , and must conclude , if it is piracy in the one case , it is robbery in the other . Their country has branded the foreign slave-trade with its proper definition , and we hope a brand equally as infamous will be applied to all who may engage in the buying or selling their fellow-men , whether it be on the land or on the water . /z/ But it may be said , for this acknowledgment of the lawfulness of slavery an equivalent was given ; that a clause , which had been introduced by the committee of derail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assent of two thirds of the members present in each house , " should be omitted , the Southern States being anxious for such a clause , and the North not wishing such an one ; and , because that clause was omitted , the North is now bound . But here , again , the bargain is up , the time for its continuance having ceased in 1808 ; and now the North have as much reason for such a clause as the South ; in fact , if that clause had been in , we never should have had an embargo ; and our merchants , whose interest was here unworthily sought , had , in the distressing times of that restriction , to pay the forfeit of their selfishness . Article 3d , section 2d , first paragraph : " The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity , arising under this Constitution ; the laws of the United States and treaties made under their authority , " &c.; ; " to controversies between two or more States , between a State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States , and between a State and the citizens and foreign States , citizens or subjects . " This section refers to the powers of the judiciary ; and , as perhaps it may be one of the most important , it deserves the most profound considera- /z/ tion . As , however , we are not connected with the law technically so called , we may and undoubtedly we shall be excused , if we do not , or can not , explain and illustrate all the bearings of its different phrases , or be able to illustrate in so full a manner as we could wish the meaning of the term " law and equity , that may arise under this Constitution . " But we do think , if we know the meaning of the words " law and equity , " that it would be in the power of the slave , or any of his friends , to bring his case before the Supreme Court of the United States , to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law " or with " equity , " or consistently with our present Constitution ; whether it acknowledges in terms , or by language , in its ordinary acceptation , that could be so construed as to give one citizen or one person of the United States the right over the liberty of another ; whether , in the jview of this Constitution , all of the people of the United States do not stand on an equal footing , and that it does not acknowledge , by that clause in the 4th article of the amendments , " the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated ; " and also , in the 5th article of the amendments , no person shall " be deprived of his life , liberty , and property , without due process of law ; " and also , in the Sth , " excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inde-/z/ pendenoe , that " all men arc created equal , and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " &c.; ; and that this is the principle on which to found their judgment as to the ' Maw and equity ' 1 that should be awarded to every individual embraced within the limits of the United States , universally  --  not to particular individuals ,  --  not to black , yellow , or white ,  --  not to the free alone ,  --  but to the bond , if there were any such . The words arc : the right of the people to be secure , " &c.; : not to the free people , but " the people , " without distinction , and " no person shall be compelled , " &c.; ; not no free person , or no while person , but no person , applying person universally ; nor shall " excessive bail be required , " &c.; " nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the yellow man , can maintain his character as a man , then must he come under the denomination o one of the persons or people spoken of ; and , consequently , no State legislature , or any person in a State , no , nor even congress itself , could dare presume , under this clause , and these articles , to hold , or restrain , or punish , any individual , unless for crime or in case of rebellion , against their consent . The language , it appears to us , is explicit , plain , and straight forward ; and if there were , or could have been , slaves , after the Declaration of Independence was adopted , this article , with these amendments , were amply broad to meet every case ; /z/ and nothing but the not bringing their case before the courts , on the part of those interested to be free , could have prevented them from becoming so . It appears to us the court was given jurisdiction in the premises , and the language in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , or any of the people , should be violated in their persons , their property , their liberty , or their life . No allusion whatever is made to there being two classes of persons , or that this language was to be applied to two distinct people ; but , on the contrary , every person , and all the people embraced Avithin the jurisdiction of this government were to receive impartially its protection ; and the faith of the government is clearly in fault , if there are any now within its jurisdiction who ' are denied the privileges here set forth in the 4th , 5th , and 8th articles of the amendments , if a case where a man 's liberty was involved has been decided by the courts in favor of slavery ; but we believe , in the highest court of the country , no such decision has been made . The 11th article of the amendments appears to clash with this section ; for it says the court shall have jurisdiction in " controversies arising between two or more States , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different States , between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States , and between a State , or the citizens thereof , and foreign States , citizens , or subjects . " The 11th article of the amendments says , " The judicial /z/ power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state . " In the one it expressly says it shall have jurisdiction in controversies arising between a State and citizens of another State , or a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign State ; in the other , it says it shall not be so construed . The meaning of the amendment , if we understand it , is , the court shall not take cognizance- of any action , brought by a citizen of another of the States , or a citizen or subject of a foreign state , against one of the States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the object of this clashing , or why this amendment was put in . Mr. Marshall , as we shall perceive in another part of this work r says it was occasioned by the indebtedness of the States , and , in their sovereignty , they did not wish to be brought by a member of another State , or by foreigners , before the court in an action of debt . We know not our case is affected by this inconsistency , or that it does prevent a suit being brought before the court to liberate a man held as a slave ; and therefore we shall leave it for our lawyers to speculate upon , and reconcile the differences that exist between the original article and the amendment , whenever they may have an occasion . The courts , however , have jurisdiction in all cases , both original and appellate , in a controversy /z/ between a State and the " citizens thereof , " and this is sufficient for our purpose ; for , if the negro , or the slave , whether white or black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that court decide he can be held in servitude against his consent , without crime , and punished also for no crime , then may he not appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , and inquire whether it is lawful , under and in pursuance of the Constitution , " the people may be seized in their persons , houses , papers , and effects ; " or that " any person may be deprived of his life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; " or that " cruel and unusual punishments " may be " inflicted . " But , it may said , the slave is not a citizen , and therefore he can not come before the court ; but is not the court competent to try that fact , whether he be a citizen or no , if his citizenship should be denied ? and whether , if there is any technicality in the meaning of the word citizen in some eases , the use of the word person in the amendments does not destroy that technicality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , it would seem , would be the first point in the case for their decision ; and whether the expression , " nor shall any person be subject for the same offence , " &c.; " nor be deprived , " &c.; will not include all persons , whether white or black , bond or free ; and , whether in the expression , " the right of the people to be secure fn their persons , " &c.; the colored man must not be included as one of the people , and that he should be defended against any " cruel or unusual punish- /z/ merit ; " not simply as might be practised by the government of the United States , but - whether practised towards him by a State or any of the citizens thereof ; in fact , whether the United States , or a State , can allow any of its people to be deprived of their liberty by any one of its citizens ; and , if so , whether the United States , or the State , is not itself guilty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , we should say it was ; and , if wc are correct , is there not a suppression of the truth , when it is asserted that the different States have nothing to do with slavery as it may exist in any particular State , when it is known the United States have given the courts , both state and national , power over this subject , and made it their duty to protect the people in their life , liberty , &c.; if they are called upon so to do ? We leave those who have made the assertion to answer the question . The next expression which is said to allude to the slave is contained in the third paragraph , 2d section , 4th article . It is in these words : - No person , held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , or may not have been , inserted in the Constitution , whether there had been any slaves in the country or not , so long as it was considered important to collect debts of /z/ those who might leave their employers for different parts of the country ; and , in one so extensive as this , it might have been done to the employer 's detriment ; and as , according to the general rule of nations , they do not give up their inhabitants to any other without special laws on the subject , it might have been thought necessary that a perfect understanding on this subject should be had among the States , and that those bound or held to service in any one State , if they should leave that service and flee into another , if claimed as those that were held , should be given up ; but even then not until the party who claimed should prove the service or labor was due . It may be well to observe , that , in that article which provides for the apportionment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to service " were to be reckoned among the freemen , and as equal to them in determining the number to be chosen , and the amount to be raised ; that this class of people , in that day , was so numerous as to be taken notice of independent of those held as slaves . If " those bound to service " was meant to be in contradistinction to the " three fifths of all other persons , " whymay not this section allude to them ? For ourselves , we perceive no intrinsic difference in the meaning of the two words " bound " and " held , " when applied to those in servitude , saving that , in using the word " bound , " there seems to be some obligation attached to both parties , while there appears to be none in the word " held . " A person may hold a thing without his possessing any right for so /z/ doing , and we believe this distinction was noticed at the time . But when the expression , " to whom such service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave to the expression " held ' " ' all the meaning of the word u bound , " or , otherwise , there can be no sense to the expression ; consequently we should give the same meaning to both words . But , to say a slave owes any thing , we must give up the principle he is a slave , because , according to the laws of slavery , the slave can not own any thing , and , consequently , can not owe any thing : he is a thing ; he owns and owes nothing . But , if it is said this paragraph was inserted in the Constitution in reference to slaves , we answer , we have no doubt those who held slaves attempted to introduce an article whereby they could reclaim any of their pretended ( we say pretended ) bondmen , let him flee to what part of the Union he might : but they were foiled in their attempt ; they could not . in this instance , get the convention to grant them their wish . The person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runaway , even as we now permit a person to reclaim the service of any one who is bound or held as an apprentice , or had contracted for a certain amount of labor for a certain compensation : and that this language might and should be so construed , is somewhat evident by the similar language in the article alluded to above . We therefore think nothing in favor of slavery can be made out of this clause , according to the true principles of interpretation . It only shows how hard /z/ some persons tried to mar the face of the Constitution without being able to succeed . And that this was the meaning intended to be attached to this phrase we think there can be no doubt ; for it should be borne in mind that " Conditional servitude , under indentures and covenants , had from the first existed in Virginia . The servant stood to his master in the relation of debtor , bound to discharge the cost of emigration by the entire employment of his powers for the benefit of his creditor ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system , and many Englishmen , Scotch , and Irish were sent here in opposition to their own wishes , yet they differed from slaves in the " duration of their servitude , " and " the laws of the colony favored their enfranchisement . " It has been said the amendment that was made to this article goes to prove that slaves were meant , and that its bearing is now different from what it was as originally introduced : but we do not perceive it alters the force of the construction of the passage as we have given it ; that is , that it was people that owed - service , and not slaves , that were meant ; and , if so , it explains the reason ( and we can not account for it on any other ) why Franklin and his associates , who did all they could to oppose slavery , let this section pass without opposition . But it may be objected , as we have said , that the sentence " held to service or labor " has a different meaning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the com- 1 Bancroft 's History of the United States , vol. i. p. 176. /z/ mittee of revision made the alteration in the original article for the purpose of making the slaveholder more secure , and that their striking out the words " justly claiming " renders it more certain . But , when we consider the words " to whom such service or labor may be due " were added , they place the subject on its true basis , that is , of debt ; and a debt can not be contracted without the consent of both parties . Consequently they did not succeed in their wishes , though the slaveholder afterwards proceeded , and the magistrates in the free States very unjustly , as we think 5 have allowed them to pursue their unlawful and vile purposes , without ever bringing up this question of debt ,  --  the very question on which their whole claim can constitutionally rest . According to the Madison papers , Mr. Butler and Mr. Pinckney , from South Carolina , moved " that fugitive slaves and servants be delivered up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to insert the following : " If any person bound to service or labor in any of the United States shall escape into another State , he or she shall not be discharged from such labor or service in consequence of any regulation subsisting in the State to which they escape , but shall be delivered up to the person justly claiming their service or labor ; which was agreed to nem . con . ' ' ' But when the Constitution came to be revised , this resolution , besides the other amendments made to it . had the words " rightfully claiming " stricken out , and the words " on claim of the party /z/ to whom such labor or service may be due " added ; thereby , instead , as we have seen it asserted , of retaining the point of the original resolution , nullifying its effect when applied to one held in bondage against his own consent , and placing it , as it should have been placed , on account of debt : consequently , no man should be given up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 4th of the same article has this expression /z/ " The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion , and , on application of the legislature or executive , ( when the legislature can not be convened , ) against domestic violence . " A question here arises : what is a republican form of government ? Its usual acceptation is , when the people make their own laws , through ox by their representatives . The question reGurs , then , is the colored man of this country represented , or can he be , in a slaveholding State , by conforming to any laws or rules the legislature of any of these States prescribes ? We believe not ; he , as we have said before , is considered a thing , and therefore is thrown without the pale of citizenship , and is under a most tyrannical government . He is denied this republican form of government , which the Constitution guarantees to him ; and consequently the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should be of no effect . Let it not be said Greece and Rome held slaves , though they had a /z/ republican form of government , and therefore it is competent for the American citizen to hold them , and yet continue their republicanism . To this we object , as those only , and their descendants were slaves who were taken in war ; they were made slaves rather than to destroy or imprison them ; they were considered enemies to the state : the negro has never been a prisoner of war to this country , neither is he considered its enemy . But , after all , has the Christian American citizen no better model for his conduct and his mode of government than pagan Greece and Rome ? We think he has , or ought to have . Article 7 of the amendments : " In suits of common law , when the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved j and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the common law . " Now , admitting a person can be held in slavery , if his value is considered above twenty dollars , he certainly , according to this article , should have his case tried by a jury , instead of being delivered up simply by a hearing before a magistrate , as has been universally the case when he has been claimed ; which would be , if it was merely a question of dollars and cents , most clearly a violation of the Constitution , and which ought not to be suffered . How much more , then , ought it not to be suffered , when a man 's liberty is involved ! This closes all , so far as we can conceive , that /z/ has reference to , or has a bearing on , the subject of slavery in the Constitution ; and we have already commented on the 4th , 5th , 8th , and 11th articles of the amendments ; and we know not it is necessary , in this place , to say any thing more in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5th article of the amendments , which can be seen by reference to the report of his argument on this subject before the legislature at Albany , N. Y. We will observe , however , one of these articles of amendments was introduced into the Massachusetts convention for the very purpose of having a bearing on slavery , as we shall hereafter show . Upon a review then of this instrument , with these amendments , we can not but come to the conclusion that each and every man in this country is by the Constitution free , and that , save only those who reside in the Indian Territories , each and every man is bound , individually and collectively , by this instrument , to protect each and all in their inalienable rights , there being no exception to any one , be he of what clime or origin he may : it is enough to say he is an inhabitant of the United States or its Territories , and that is sufficient to constitute him a freeman . /z/ Having now gone through with our criticisms on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles upon which it was founded , we now , for a further illustration , and to show our ideas are not wholly unsupported , propose to quote from the language of some of the men w r ho discussed this document before its ratification by the people , to ascertain if they did not and must not have known how fully the subject of slavery was under the power of congress , or that of the courts . " We will , however , in the first place , adduce some testimony from the early history of the country , to throw light upon , and to exemplify , if possible , in a clearer manner the position we have taken : and , although some of the quotations apparently may not have a bearing upon the subject , yet they will all , we trust , serve to keep distinctly in mind the great principles of liberty , its value , and the steps taken by our fathers to secure it to the inhabitants of this country ; and as we shall find they never , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the Constitution , so they did not do it at that time . Mr. Bancroft , in his late History of the United States , observes ,  --  " Zemenes , ( 1537 , ) the gifted coadjutor of Ferdinand and Isabella , the stern grand inquisitor , the austere but ambitious Franciscan , saw in advance the danger which required centuries to reveal , and refused to sanction the introduction of negroes into Hispaniola , believing that the favorabie climate would increase their numbers , and infallibly lead them to a successful revolt . A severe retribution has manifested his sagacity . Hayti , the first spot in America that received African slaves , was the first to set the example of African liberty . " 1 But " the rich returns made by Sir John Hawkins , of sugar , ginger , and pearls , for a cargo of Africans imported into Hispaniola , attracted the notice of queen Elizabeth , " 2 and ll she became , in conjunction with her subjects , " " at once a smuggler and a slave merchant ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odious distinction of having first interested England in the slave-trade , and , by his success , induced his queen to continue the traffic , it may be some consolation to the people of England to reflect they are among the first to restore 1 Bancroft 's History of the United Slates , vol. i. p. 172. 2 Bancroft 's History , vol. i. p. 173. 3 Is not queen Victoria , in conjunction with her ministers , a smuggler , and , conducting like queen Elizabeth , if not a slave merchant , something equally as bad , yea , worse ,  --  a public poisoner of her fellow-men , in the attempt which she , in conjunction with them , . is now making to introduce opium into China , against the laws of that country ? We can not but think they are making themsslres obnoxious to both charges . /z/ those rights which have been so long taken from the negro .

One would think they should not be behind the people of that age , who denounced those who trafficked in slaves , and who called such " malefactors and murderers , " and that they should act " as Richard Saltonstall , a worthy assistant , who felt himself moved , by his duty as a magistrate , to denounce the act of stealing negroes , as expressly contrary to the law of God and the law of the country . " These guilty men were committed for the offence , and . after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , " bearing witness against the heinous crime of man-stealing , " ordered the negroes to be restored , at the public charge , to their native country , with a letter expressing the indignation of the general court of their wrongs . And in 1652 , when it was perceived " that the people of Warwick and Providence were disposed to , buy " negroes , " to /z/ hold them as slaves forever/ ' " it was enacted they should not be so held ; 1 but , at the end of ten years , they should be set free ; and if any one sold them to be held as slaves a longer time , they should forfeit to the colony forty pounds , which was twice the value of the slave at that time . " After speaking of the law relating to marriages , he observes ,  --  " The benevolence of the early Puritans appears from other examples . Their thoughts were always fixed on posterity . Domestic discipline was highly valued ; but , if the law was severe against the undutiful child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slave-trade was forbidden , under the penalty of death . " " The early laws did not permit any man to be kept in prison for debt , except when there was some appearance of some estate which the debtor would not produce . Even the brute creation was not forgotten ; and cruelty towards animals was a civil offence . The sympathies of the colonists were wide ; a regard for Protestant Germany is as old as emigration ; and , during the thirty years ' war , the whole people of New England held fasts and offered prayers for the success of their Saxon brethren . " 2 " When the executive council of state in England ( 1650 ) had granted to Mr. Coddington a commission for governing the island within the jurisdiction of Rhode Island , Mr. Williams , through the agency of Sir Henry Vane , got the commission vacated , and the town-meeting of Providence made him the following address : ' From the first beginning of Providence colony you have been a noble and true friend to an outcast and despised people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovingkimlness and favor .

We have not felt the new chains of Presbyterian tyrants ; nor , in this colony , have we been consumed by the overzealous fire of the ( so called ) godly Christian magistrate . We have not known what an excise means ; we have almost forgotten what tithes are . We have long drunk of as great liberties as any people that we can hear of under the whole heavens . When we are gone , our posterity and children after us shall read in our town records your loving-kindness to us , and our real endeavor after peace and righteousness . ' " l Good foundation these for making a population to guarantee slavery ! Speaking of the population of Virginia , Mr. Bancroft remarks ,  --  " But the distinctions of society were more marked by the character of the plebeian population of Virginia . Many of them had reached the shores of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that age , to a temporary servitude . Some of them even were convicts ; but it must be remembered the crimes of which they were convicted were chiefly political . The number transported to Virginia for social crimes was nevec considerable ,  --  scarcely enough to sustain the sentiment of pride in its scorn of the laboring population , certainly not enough to aflect its character . Yet the division of society inio two classes was strongly marked , in a degree uncqualed in any northern colony , and unmitigated by public care for education . The system of common /z/ schools was unknown . ' Every man , ' says Sir William Berkley , in 1671 , ' instructs his children according to his ability , '  --  a method which left the children of the ignorant to hopeless ignorance . " The instincts of aristocracy dreaded the general diffusion of intelligence , and even the enfranchising influence of the preaching of the ministers . ' The ministers , ' continues Sir William , in the spirit of the aristocracy of the Tudors , ' should pray oftener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no free schools nor printing ; and I hope we shall not have these hundred years ; for learning has brought disobedience , and heresy , and sects , into the world , and printing has divulged them , and libels against the best government . God keep us from both . ' " l A wish many , we suspect , even in Virginia , begin to think has been brought too literally to pass . But Mr. Bancroft continues : " Thus , in addition to the difficulties which the degraded castes of servants encountered in their endeavors to lift themselves into distinction , the power of the government was exerted to depress whole classes of society . We rightly abhor the envy which delights in debasing excellence ; it is a still greater crime against humanity , to combine against the masses in their struggle for intellectual and social advancement . " Still , servants were emancipated when their years of servitude were ended ; and the law was designed to secure and hasten their enfranchisement . " " The facility of escape compelled humane treatment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws were less tolerant . The statute which declares who were slaves followed /z/ the old idea long prevalent through Christendom : ' All persons , not being Christians , imported into this country by shipping , shall he slaves . ' Yet it was added , ' Conversion to the Christian faith does not make free . ' " In reading such passages , one can hardly help exclaiming , how little was , and even is , Christianity understood ! But he says ,  --  " The early Anglo-Saxon rule interpreted every doubtful question in favor of liberty  --  declared the children of freemen to be free . Virginia was humane towards the white race  --  was severe towards the negro . Doubts arose if the offspring of an Englishman by a negro woman . should be bond or free ; and the rule of the Roman law prevailed over the Anglo-Saxon : the offspring followed the destiny of its mother . " A greater barbarity could not be inflicted , as we have some where else remarked . The passing of the children , by the ancient heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not to be compared to it in iniquity . " Enfranchisement of the colored population was not encouraged . The female slave was not subject to taxation ; the emancipated negress was tithable . " " The death of a slave was not accounted a felony , since it can not be presumed such is the language of the statute ' that prepensed malice , which alone makes murder felony , should induce any man to destroy his own estate . ' The legislator did not understand human passions . No such opinions now prevail . Finally , it was made lawful for ' persons pursuing fugitive colored slaves to wound or even to kill them : ' ; the master /z/ was absolute lord of the negro , ' ( 1672 . ) ' After a long series of years the institution of slavery renewed a landed aristocracy , closely resembling the feudal nobility ; the culminating point ( 1705 ) was when slaves were declared to be real estate , and ( 1725 ) might be constituted adscripts to the soil . ' " From these circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that State to the government of the country , and , from the developements that are now making every day , we may add , the anxiety now exhibited by our southern people to rule the land may be attributed to the same unhallowed source ; and if the people of the North do not awake from that lethargy which seems to hang over a great portion of the people , the same causes that operated to create an aristocracy at the South will , before they are aware , bind them with fetters which will take more than a Hercules to sever ; and this continent , instead of being what our fathers designed it  --  a home for the oppressed , and a dwelling-place for the free  --  will be but the prison-house for the slave and that of the lordly tyrant , where each will dread the other 's presence , and that of ravening wolves will be the characteristic of its inhabitants . In 1685 , during the Monmouth rebellion , many of the convicts were sent to this country , and , " such was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shipped to the colonies , where they were sold for indented servants : the courtiers round James II . exulted in /z/ the rich harvest which the rebellion promised , and begged of the monarch frequent gifts of their condemned countrymen . Jeffers heard of the scramble , and indignantly addressed the king : ' I beseech your majesty , that I may inform your majesty that each prisoner will be worth ten pounds , if not fifteen pounds , apiece ; and , sire , if your majesty orders as you have already designed , persons that have not suffered in the service will run away with the booty . ' At length the spoils were distributed . They were in part persons of family and education , accustomed to elegance and ease . ' Take all care , ' wrote the monarch , under the countersign of Sunderland , to the government in Virginia  --  ' take all care that they continue ten years , at least , and that they be not permitted in any manner to redeem themselves by money or otherwise , until that term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our colony with such clauses as shall be requisite for this purpose . " No Virginia legislature sanctioned such malice , and in December , 16S9 , the exiles were pardoned . " * Perhaps it may be well to stop here and note there were , in Virginia at least , other bondmen beside negro slaves ; and the fact of there being such men , and also those who had sold their time , and , consequently , who were indebted to the individual who had bought it , suggested to the minds of the framers of the Constitution the wording of the clause that relates to the running away of a person from service , and in strict language can be applied to none other . Whatever may have been /z/ the intention of some , or however this language may have- been construed since the Constitution has been adopted , the language can not in any way be applied to the slave ; for , as we have said before , he is a thing ; he possesses and can possess nothing ; consequently he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of these facts the clause was permitted to pass . Consequently , whether a slave was brought from the South to the North by his master , or came of his own accord , he could or should not be treated otherwise than as a freeman , possessing all the rights of a freeman , so long as he conducts himself with propriety , and has entered into no contract with his master for services to be rendered . These , however , are but the views of a private citizen , and they may be of little worth . We , however , should be inclined to treat the planter as the Jew of Venice was treated , and say to him , if a pound of flesh is really owed to yon , take it , but do not spill a drop of blood ; step not beyond the written language . We do not make use of this language in the spirit of caviling , or in a spirit of dishonesty , to get rid of the obligations that are properly imposed upon us , but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ordinary construction . We should not think it necessary to go out of our way to construe the language to favor the slaveholder , as we should have to do did we render it to comply with his wishes . Let us not be misunderstood . We do not advance the idea , . that this clause of the Constitution was brought forward for the purpose of /z/ securing the runaway apprentice , or the person who had sold his time : but , on the contrary , we do suppose it was advanced for the purpose of securing the runaway slave ; but those who did not wish to be guilty of this crime ,  --  of returning a slave to his master ,  --  not only refused to entertain a direct proposition of the kind , but also an indirect one , and so amended the latter by adding the words " to whom such service or labor may be due , " ' as effectually destroyed its character as a clause by which a runaway slave might be recovered . In speaking of the settlement of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various nations of the Caucasian race assist in colonizing our central States . The African , also , had his portion of the Hudson . The West India Company , which sometimes transported Indian captives to the West Indies , having large establishments on the coast of Guinea , at an early day introduced negroes into Manhattan , and continued the negro slave-trade without remorse . We have seen Elizabeth of England a partner in the commerce , of which the Stuarts , to the day of Queen Anne , were distinguished partners : the city of Amsterdam did not blush to own shares in a slaveship , to advance money for its outfits , and to participate in the returns . In proportion to population , New York had imported as many Africans as Virginia . That New York is not a slave State , like Carolina , is due to climate , I not to the humanity of its founders . Stuyvesant was instructed to use every exertion to promote the sale of negroes . They were imported sometimes by the way of the West Indies , often directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest bidder . The average price was less than one hundred dollars . The /z/ monopoly of the traffic was not strictly enforced , and a change of policy sometimes favored the export of negroes to the English colonies . The enfranchised negro might become a freeholder . " " With the African came the African institution of abject slavery ; the large emigration from Connecticut engrafted on New Netherlands the Puritan idea of popular freedom , " &c.; " Their presence and their activity foretold a revolution . " l William Penn , in a letter to his wife on taking leave of his family , writes , " Live low and sparingly till my debts are paid , " 2 though he wished no expense to be spared in the education of his children ; for , by parsimony here , he considered all lost that was saved ; but agriculture he proposed as their employment . ' : Let my children be husbands and housewives ; " evidently meaning , whatever may have been his practices respecting the holding of slaves , that his children should depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if William Penn thought all was lost that was saved in not instructing his children , what must have been lost to the country , if he was correct , by not instructing the children of the African ? The sum , we think , would be more than twelve hundred millions of money ; and who can doubt but it has been ! We have before quoted the remarks made by Mr. Haynes of the character of the people of South Carolina , and have also spoken of the inhabitants /z/ of North Carolina , and it may not be necessary for us to go farther in our quotations , to show the nature of the population that came to these shores . Much might be brought from other sources , but we will make what we have quoted suffice . While slavery was introduced at an early age by the aristocracy , including kings and queens , and , like alcohol , served to intoxicate the people , and came very near making them forget the very nature of man , yet the love of liberty continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various conflicts it had to maintain , till , finally , it burst out in our revolutionary struggle . The Declaration of Independence , as has been said , formed a new era in the history of mankind ; all seemed to be impressed with the importance of liberty , and more confirmed in their views . Yet slavery existed , and what was to be done ? Many , no doubt , were inclined to let it rest , and work out its own cure as best it might . Others , on the contrary , were anxious to have it expelled the land , sensible of the inconsistency which they as a people exhibited while these violations of man 's rights continued . " When first introduced , like spirituous drinks , few were sensible of the evils that might result ; and , while the practice appealed to the selfish principle of oui nature , many gave way to this feeling , and were willing to let future consequences take care of themselves . It has been remarked , the first cargo of slaves ever brought into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrims arrived on /z/ the shores of Plymouth ; and the Dutch captain who brought , could not find a market for them , and , upon his refusing to take them away , the people at last took pity at their forlorn situation , and giving a small compensation , received them to their houses . Hence arose that mighty evil that is now threatening destruction to our social institutions . /z/ We now turn to the convention that formed the Constitution , and to the proceedings of the several State conventions , and also to some remarks taken from Mr. Wirt 's life of Patrick Henry , and from the Federalist , all tending to show that , while our fathers came to this country for freedom , they meant to transmit this blessing to posterity ; and that they did , for the most part , think they had attained this object , and that what they did not accomplish themselves , they left their children to perform . We will , however , observe , that , in these debates , it will be noticed there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another party who were jealous for our State rights , and who feared a consolidated government . Whether those who wished for a strong government thought the people were really unable to take care of themselves , and , consequently , required the strong arm of the law to preserve the peace , &c.; or , being conscious they meant , or wanted to produce , such a state of things as would make one portion of the community dependent on the other , and thereby create a jealousy and a distrust in the breast of different portions of society against each other , /z/ making a powerful government necessary , we will not decide ; perhaps both reasons entered into the breast of some , and determined them in their course of action . Bat , on the whole , a sincere desire is manifested to do what they thought was for the best good and interest of the country . It appears the members of the convention , from South Carolina and Georgia , were alone instructed on the subject of slavery ; and it was through their influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can judge , - that any equivocal expressions on the subject of slavery were introduced into the Constitution . The Virginia delegates , in the first place , received instructions to use their exertions to have the trade abolished ; but they were , for some reason or other , withdrawn . South Carolina and Georgia , therefore , have the unenviable distinction of having been the cause of the continuance of slavery , or , rather , that there was no direct action of the convention on the subject . Since , then , having gained some points , they have taken advantage of these to effect their whole object , and they would now try to make us believe the whole government was made for them , and that they have a right to do with it as they think proper ; and , by combining their action , they have been enabled to effect their purpose : and , while our government has been apparently a free one , it has , for the most part , been ruled by the slaveholder 's influence . Hon. John Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided by /z/ majorities less than the number of representatives on the floor of congress , in consequence of slaves being represented : and we have suspected he lost his election because he would not bend to the dictation of Georgia on the subject of her Indian difficulties , and that this was the cause of the expression , that " his administration must be put - down , if as pure as the angels of light . " It has been often asked , how happens it slaveholders have always carried their point , when there has been a majority of members from the free States ? The best solution , besides that the South have always been united on subjects that have affected their interest , while the North has been divided , was once given us by a lady ; it was this :  --  The slaveholders , being an independent community by themselves , freed from the necessity of toil , each and all of them being masters , they could bear the utmost democracy ; because , each being a lord , they wanted none higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , to be extremely democratic , because they would not be driven to labor . They had a class below them ; they therefore could always appeal to the democratic feeling at the North , and get a true response ; while those at the North possessing an aristocratic feeling , knew the principles they advocated were destructive to their interest , they , possessing no bondmen , and depending upon legislative enactments to maintain their dignity , constantly found themselves in opposition to the priv- /z/ ileged class at the South : hence there has always been " a division . But we trust our people are beginning to open their eyes to the nature of slavery , and , perceiving it has a tendency to reduce all the working classes to the same state , they will put forth their power , and check its pretensions , before it is so fastened on the country that they will be unable to break its chains ; and , as far as in us lies , we would now warn them , if they do not lay aside the foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , with united resolutions , to put an end to so iniquitous a system while it is now in their power , they must not complain if they themselves , or their children , should be brought under the same system of oppression . They must help free their brother man from the yoke , or else have it placed upon their own necks . We , think this is evident , and that there is no alternative . 1 But to return to our extracts from the Secret Proceedings of the Convention that formed the Constitution of the United States , including some taken from a speech delivered by the Hon. Luther Martin before the legislature of the State of Maryland , who was called upon , after his return from the convention held in Philadelphia , 1787 , by the legislature of that State , to give " an account of those transactions in which " he " had had a share . " In this speech , Mr. Martin observes ,  --  1 To bear us out in the supposition that some change of the kind has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Address of President Harrison . p /z/ " The delegates of Delaware were expressly instructed to agree to no system which should take away from the States an equality of suffrage , secured by the original articles of confederation . " " The object of Virginia and other large States to increase their power and influence over others did not escape observation . " l A number of propositions , in the form of resolutions , were proposed to the convention for their consideration , as a basis on which to form a new government , and were submitted to a committee , who. among others , reported the following :  --  7th . The right of suffrage in the first branch of the legislature ought not to be according to the rules of representation , namely , in proportion to the whole number of white and other free citizens , and inhabitants of e - age , sex , and condition , including those bound to service for a term of years , and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description , except Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That a republican constitution , and its exist lutes , ought to be guaranteed to each State by the United ; es . " 2 In discussing these among other propositions , was argued the small States would not agree to representations founded on numbers ; if they did they would 1 " ' overwhelmed ; " that slavery was the worst that could ensue , and we considered the system proposed the most complete , most abject system of slavery that the wit of man ever devised , under the pretension of framing a government for free States ; that we never would submit to present certain evils in dread of a future , which might ings , p. 13. s Secret Proceedings , pp. 14 and 1G. /z/ be imaginary ; that we were sensible the eyes of the country and of the world were upon us , " &c.; ; x that , while they were willing to " form a strong and energetic federal government . " they were opposed to consolidation , and they wished u the world at large " should " judge " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . " They did not mean to give up the independency of the States , and give the large States a weight in the Union in proportion to the number of their inhabitants . The argument was , that each individual in the community , when he enters into society , independent of wealth , talent , or strength , had equal rights ; and if , because of any of these distinctions , one should have " more votes than another , it would be inconsistent with the freedom of that other , and would reduce him to slavery ; " 2 and consequently it would be the same with the States . On that part of the Constitution which allowed the importation of slaves till the year 1808 there was much diversity of opinion , and the representatives from South Carolina and Georgia asserted that their States would never agree to a system that put it in the " power of the general government to prevent the importation of slaves , and that they , as delegates from those States , must withhold their assent from such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight of /z/ the States had decided they would not consent to have a general provision , as reported by the committee of detail , putting it out of the power of congress from ever prohibiting the importation of slaves , " without confining it to any particular period . " Mr. Martin says they were willing to agree to this clause as it now stands , but the " same reasons which caused them to strike out the word ' national and not admit the word ' stamps , ' influenced them here to guard against the word ' slaves . ' They anxiously sought to avoid the admission of expressions which might be ' odious ' to the ears of Americans , although they were willing to admit into their system those things which the expressions signified. " l When , therefore , the convention had determined not to accept the report of the committee , three States only voting in favor of it , and the delegates from Georgia and South Carolina saying their States would not agree to a system that gave it in the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A committee of one member from each State was chosen by ballot to take this part of the system under consideration , and to endeavor to agree upon some report , which would reconcile these States : " to this committee was also referred the following proposition , which had been reported by a committee of detail , to wit : " No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of two thirds of the members present in ' . Secret Proceedings , f . G3 . THE NATIONAL CONVENTION . Ill each house , " 1  --  a proposition which the " staple and commercial States " were solicitous to retain , lest their commerce should be placed too much under the power of the Eastern States , but which the latter were as anxious to reject . " This committee , " of which Mr. Martin was one , " met and took under consideration the subjects committed to them . " He says he " found the eastern members , notwithstanding their aversion to slavery , were very willing to indulge the Southern States at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern States would , in their turn , gratify them by laying no restriction on navigation acts ; and , after a very little time , the committee , by a great majority , agreed on a report , by which the general government was to be prohibited from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited time ; and the restrictive clause relative to navigation acts was to be " omitted . " Here are some of the considerations of that compact of which we have heard so much ; and , however disgraceful it might have been , let it be borne in mind the contract , so far as they are concerned , is fulfilled , the consideration has been paid , the pound of flesh was granted , and has been taken . But let us observe here , we consider this crying out compact as one of their ruse , of which - the South has proved herself sufficient master , in order to frighten the North into her proposals ,  --  not because she cares about the par- /z/ ticulai measures she proposes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from taking into consideration the situation of the slave , and knowing the North is adverse to constant changes and fluctuations in her commercial pursuits , and that the South is not advancing in so rapid a manner in her improvements , in her jealousy she presses her undertaking , till she sains what she thinks is her object , and then some one steps in to make a compromise . We have seen so much of this we begin to grow tired and sick : and we trust the people of the North , if we are correct in our surmises , " will be able to stand in the evil day . " and not bow down to every golden calf that may be set up . But Mr. Martin goes on to observe .  --  " This report was adopted by the convention , but not without considerable opposition . It was said we had just assumed a place among independent nations in consequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great Britain to enslave us ; that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation of those rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , but in common h all the rest of mankind ; that we had appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance , as the God of freedom , who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the rights which he had thus imparted to his creatures ; that now , when we had scarcely risen from our knees , from supplicating bis mercy and protection in forming our government over a free people , a government formed pretendedly on the principles of liberty , and for its preservation ,  --  in that government to have a provision , not only of putting out of its power to restrain /z/ and prevent the slave-trade , even encouraging that most infamous traffic , by giving the States the power and influence in the Union in proportion as they cruelly and wantonly sported with the rights of their fellow-creatures , ought to be considered as a solemn mockery of , and an insult , to , that God whose protection tee had thus implored , and could not fail to hold us up in detestation , and render us contemptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was said that national crimes can only be , and frequently are , punished in this world by national punishments , and that the continuance of the slave-trade , and thus giving it a national character , sanction , and encouragement , ought to be considered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and vengeance of him who is equally the Lord of all , and who views with equal eye the poor African slave and his American master ! " It was urged that , by this system , we were giving the general government full and absolute power to regulate commerce , under which general power it would have a right to restrain , or totally prohibit , the slavetrade : it must , therefore , appear to the world absurd and disgraceful to the last degree that we should except from the exercise of that power the only branch of commerce which is unjustifiable in its nature , and contrary to the rights of mankind . That , on the contrary , we ought to prohibit expressly , in our Constitution , the further importation of slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , to make such regulations as should be thought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of slavery , and the emancipation of the slaves already in the States . " That slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism , and has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported , as it lessens the sense of /z/ the equal rights of mankind , and habituates to tyranny and oppression . It was further urged that , by this system of government , every State is to be protected both from foreign invasion and from domestic insurrections ; and , from this consideration , it was of the utmost importance it should have the power to restrain the importation of slaves , since in proportion as the number of slaves increased in any State , in the same proportion is the State weakened and exposed to foreign invasion and domestic insurrection ; and by so much less will it be able to protect itself against either , and therefore by so much , want aid from , and be a burden to , the Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , as we were giving the general government power , under the idea of national character , or national interest , to regulate even our weights and measures , and have prohibited all jwssihiJitij of emitting paper money , and passing insolvent laws , &c.; it must appear still more extraordinary that we prohibited the government from interfering with the slave-trade , than which nothing could more affect our ional honor and interest . " These reasons influenced me , both in the committee and in the convention , most decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause , as it now makes part of the system . " 1 Mr. Martin thought by continuing the traffic " we should become indifferent to the common rights of men , and , as their own liberties were considered established , they had already become less sensible to these rights , and that in those States where the trade had already been prohibited , when they found that in their national character they Proceedings , p. 04. /z/ must ' share in its disgrace , ' they would also wish to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here , if there Was such an opposition to the continuance of the slave-trade for twenty years , when the Confederation had no control over it , and it was then in the power of each State to continue it to an indefinite extent , and this power was taken from them , and the whole subject was then placed , as is here intimated , in the power of congress , to put a stop to it in that time , and even a proposition to make preparation for the emancipation of the slaves already in the country ,  --  can it be said that these men , or even a majority in the convention , went to work to guarantee its continued existence ? No ; the excuse was , there was a considerable property engaged in the trade , and more laborers were wanted at the South ; and , by a mistaken policy , or a determined wickedness on the part of some , it was suffered to exist , in order that the one might be supplied , and the other have time to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No guaranty , we are assured , could have been obtained , or would have been given ; and , if the members of the convention would have done it by any of their acts , we shall by and by see the people , by the recommendation of their conventions , and the action of congress , put a veto upon it ; and it was urged , in one of these conventions , as a reason why the Constitution should be adopted , that it had given congress a power over the subject that was not possessed under the /z/ Confederation . Without , however , stopping hereto argue this point , we will leave the observations of Mr. Martin , and enter upon those made in the convention . We will , however , observe , there does not appear to be any thing reported to have been said on any of the articles that has special reference to slavery . Our quotations , therefore , must comprise those observations only that speak of the general object for which the government was formed . The report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates , of New York , for his own use , and was copied from his papers , after his death , by Mr. John Lansing , Jr . There were four propositions made for the consideration of the convention . Mr. Edmund Randolph , of Virginia , offered a series of resolutions as principles on which the Confederation might be amended . In his ideas of government , he would include freemen only . Mr. Charles Pinckney ( S. C. ) offered a draft of a federal government : in this draft there is no distinction made ; the word ' - ' free " is not used before persons . In Mr. Patterson 's ( N. J. ) resolutions it was ; in Mr. Hamilton 's ( N. Y. ) it was not . Mr. C. Pinckney is reported to have said on the 4th resolve ,  --  " It will be necessary to inquire into the situation of the people of this country . Without this , we can have no adequate idea what kind of government will secure their rights and liberties . There is more equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country under the sun ; and this is likely to continue as long /z/ as the unappropriated western lands remain unsettled . They are equal in rights , nor is the extreme of poverty to be seen in any part of the Union . 1 From this situation he thought we could not draw any examples from the governments of Europe ; and , there being so few men of fortune , they could not establish a nobility , and equality of others would not admit of the distinction ; he therefore " laid it down as a settled principle , that equality of condition was a leading axiom in our government . " He thought " commerce could never interfere with our government , nor give complexion to its councils . " He thought we could not copy from Greece or Rome ; " we differed from the whole . Our situation was unexampled ; and it is in our power , on different grounds , to secure civil and religious liberty ; and , when we secure these , we secure every thing that is necessary to establish happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country : first , the professional men : second , the commercial men ; third , the landed interest ; " that the latter would be the governing power , and the other two would be dependent on them . He thought a national government would not suit them , and , consequently , there would be a mixed interest ; and , in that view , there would " in fact be but one order . " " Ours must be suitable to the people , and we were the only people who had sense enough to appoint delegates to establish a Secret Proceedings , p. 161. /z/ general government , and he thought the proposition from Virginia would satisfy the people . But a general government must not be dependent on State government . " These observations are quoted , not because they all apply to the case in controversy , but to show that in them there is a continual looking forward to an equality of condition , for which they were aiming , and on which the government was to be ' founded . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " The magnitude of the subject was embarrassing ; the great system of Henry IV . of France , aided by the greatest of statesmen , is small when compared to the fabric we are now about to erect . In laying the stone amiss we may injure the superstructure ; and what would be the consequence if the corner-stone should be loosely placed ? It is improper that the State legislature should have the power contemplated to be given them . A citizen of America should be considered in two points of view ,  --  as a citizen of the general government , and as a citizen of the particular State in which he may reside . We ought to consider in what character he acts in forming a general government . I am both a citizen of Pennsylvania and of the United States . I must lay aside my Stale connections , and act for the general good of the whole . We must forget our local habits and attachments . The general government should not depend on State governments . That the powers of peace , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reside in that government . And , if we reason in this manner , we shall soon sec the impropriety of admitting /z/ the interference of State government into the general government . Equality of representation can not be established , if the second branch is elected by State legislatures . When we are laying the foundation of a building which is to last for ages , and in which millions are interested , it ought to be well laid . If the national government does not act on State prejudices , State distinctions will be lost . I therefore move , that the second branch of the legislature of the national government be elected by electors chosen by the people of the United Stales. ' " l Much division prevailed on this point , and , as it will be perceived , the convention finally settled down upon the conclusion that the people , by districts in their several States , should choose their own representatives ; making the government , if any thing , not quite so national as the proposition made by Mr. Wilson would have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislatures of the State choose them . Mr. Hamilton , while speaking of the senate , observed , /z/ " This question has been considered in several points of view . We are now forming a republican government . Real liberty is neither found in despotism , or the extreme of democracy , but in moderate government . " 2 And , ao-ain , " There can be no truer principle than this ,  - -  that every individual in the community at large has an equal right to the protection of government . " 3 Mr. Madison , in speaking of the manner in which the different States should vote in con- /z/ congress , said " he would exclude inconsistent principles , in framing a system of government ; " l it was difficult to get delects amended ; and cited the case of Virginia and the Dutch as examples , both of whom found defects in their system of government , and it was with difficulty they had them removed . He observed , " If there was any real danger , he would give the smaller States the defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great danger to our general government is the great southern and northern interest of the continent being opposed to each other . Look to the votes in congress , and most of them stand divided by the geography of the country ,  --  not according to the size of the States . ' ' As it was then , so it is now , and must continue to be , till slavery shall be done away . This great statesman , from the commencement , saw the danger , and spoke of it . State lines , in the great controversies of the country , have been obliterated , and the great interests of our land have been decided independently of them . The slave States , ever true to themselves , have kept constant watch over their supposed interests , and have wielded the power they have possessed with such despotic sway , that they have almost tempted the North " to come out from among them , and be separate . " Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing , members from New York , left the convention before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 189. 8 Iu their letter to Gov . Clinton , they give two reasons for returning : " 1st . The limited and well-defined powers under which they acted , and which could not , on any possible construction , embrace /z/ had uniformly opposed the system , and , I believe , despairing of getting a proper one brought forward , or of rendering any real service , they returned no more . " l The number of those who signed the Constitution as proposed was thirty-nine . Ten delegates never attended , and sixteen did not sign that instrument , among whom were Elbridge Gerry and Caleb Strong , of Massachusetts . Rhode Island sent no delegates . General Washington , in his letter addressed to the president of congress , in submitting the constitution the convention had adopted , in his concluding remarks , says , " That it may promote the lasting welfare of the country so dear to us all , and secure her freedom and happiness , is our most ardent wish . " 2 Has that wish been realized ? Have the three million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that instrument ? None whatever ; but daily , hourly , are we departing from the principles he here expressed ; and our land , instead of becoming an abode of freedom and of happiness , is but the habitation of slavery and misery to a good portion of her population : thousands are groaning in their chains , and tens of thousands are bewailing their condition . They hear the exultation of freedom and of happiness ; an idea of such magnitude as to assent to a general constitution , in subversion to that of the State . 2d . A conviction of the impracticability of establishing a general government , pervading every part of the United States , and extending essential benefits to all . " /z/ but it passes them by : placed like Tantalus of old , the refreshing water of liberty rises to their lips , but they are never able to drink of its refreshing stream ; and , unless some come to their relief , they must , for succeeding ages , die in their distress , without being able to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink ; naked , and ye clothed me ; sick , and in prison , and ye visited me . " But we trust they will not long have to make this complaint , but that the South , as well as the North , will , when they become sensible of the cruelties the South is practising , be induced to render to her citizens that justice they have a right to demand , and which she ought to give ; and we shall find , when the word liberty is expressed in any of our public meetings , it will not be considered out of place , or any portion of the hearers manifest signs of discomfiture , as if its sound grated on their ears . In giving the above extracts from the Secret Proceedings of the Convention , it will be observed there does not appear to be any thing on which we could at once make up a judgment . The observations of Mr. Martin explain more fully the inducements which actuated the different members than can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given to the public ,  --  and we believe we have given all that was said directly upon the subject of slavery , either on the one side or on the other ,  --  we can not but deduce the idea that liberty was to be the basis on which the government was to be founded . If other ideas were /z/ advanced or insinuated , none dared openly to express them ; and we have only to regret they have been expressed louder than a whisper since , and that it has been thought necessary to calculate the value of the Union , or , in other words , to establish an aristocracy upon the ruins of democracy , which must inevitably be the case , if slavery be much longer continued . Mr. Edmund Randolph , in a letter addressed to the house of delegates of Virginia , upon the subject of adopting the Constitution , says , in speaking of the equality of suffrage . &c.;  --  " I hope Virginia will be seconded by a majority of the States . I hope she will be seconded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained ; then in preventing the eligibility of the president ,  --  of his power of nominating the judiciary , and filling vacancies during the recess of congress ; and , second , in taking from him the power of pardoning treason , in drawing the line between the powers of congress and of the individual States , in abridging the power of the senate , in incapacitating congress in determining their own salaries , " and " in limiting and defining the judiciary power . " Whether he saw , in any of the powers he wished to restrain , any that would bear on the peculiar institutions of the South , or whether he thought them detrimental to liberty in general , we are not able to say ; but this we think he might have seen in the powers given to the judiciary ,  --  a power sufficient to curb the South in her prosecuting the slave system ; and if he did , and was at all anxious this system should be continued , there were sufficient reasons for his anxiety on the subject . /z/ We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which recommended the Constitution to congress , and , through it . to the several States . We have seen , in some measure , the anxiety that was felt that a Constitution should be adopted , the objections made , the influence that slavery exerted , and the attempt made to incorporate it into that instrument , and the manner that attempt was frustrated . This , together with the struggle between the large States and small ones , independently of the slavery question , was almost the only point that produced any protracted discussion , and prevented any decision at once of the kind of government to be adopted . On the part of some , a confederation of the States was urged , and these desired the old Confederation should be amended : while those of the larger States wanted to have a weight in the government proportioned to their population : this , after long and laborious discussion , was settled by a compromise . The framing of the language of the Constitution , in those parts that are said to relate to slavery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ was used , and what exertions were made , by those who were opposed to the obnoxious practice of holding slaves , to prevent this practice , as a system , being incorporated in the body politic . However great the exertions to the contrary , unless a complete and entire perversion of the meaning of words is made , saving in the instance where the " three fifths of all other persons " was named , ( which may have , or may not have , any meaning at all , ) no person could make the language apply to slaves ; and , being so , we must suppose the friends of freedom gained the day , expecting , though the South might not give up their slaves immediately , they would yet so do in a short time . And , although there was no express provision in the Constitution as reported , that would give the slave his rights , yet , if the purposes for which it was adopted , as expressed in its caption , should be truly carried into effect , slavery would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few quotations from the Federalist . This book , it is well known , was written by Mr. Hamilton , and Mr. Madison , for the purpose of recommending and explaining the Constitution that had been proposed to the people of this country for its adoption . It was published in successive numbers over the signature of Publius , in the newspapers of that day , and afterward they were collected and put into a volume , having the above title prefixed . They were written in concert by the gentlemen named above , who took upon themselves to answer /z/ the objections that were made to the Constitution , on its being published to the world , with their attempt to do away any wrong impressions that might be entertained respecting its object , and the purposes that induced the convention to promulgate it . They undoubedly had much influence at the time to satisfy the American people of the cood intentions of those who framed it . and the advantages that might be expected to result from its being carried into execution . Great fear was expressed throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on that account , were brought against its adoption . Consequently , great anxiety was felt by its friends that all the real objections against it should be answered , and that it should be made at least to appear as perfect as possible . These gentlemen , therefore , undertook its defence , and the various conventions that were called were undoubtedly more or less influenced in their decisions by these writings . These gentlemen stood high in the affections of the people , and much confidence was placed in their judgment . In these papers , we shall find they asserted that the foundation principle of this government was liberty ; that it was for the security of this that they proposed this system of government . They believed liberty could not be secured without there being a power some where , sufficiently great to keep in check any outbreak ' arising from the ambition of individuals , or the turbulence of the multitude , or attacks from external foes . Whether /z/ right in these ideas or not , these were the expressed reasons given why a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , independent of , and in some measure dependent on , the State governments , should be adopted . Some of the States , particularly Rhode Island , had not fulfilled their engagements , or answered to the requisitions made upon them : there was no power to coerce them , and they refrained from making good the obligations that the country , at that time , was under , and they feared what might be the result if such a state of things continued . Whether these fears were well founded , or not , is another question ; but such were expressed , and such , undoubtedly , many entertained . They therefore exerted themselves to establish a government that would have the power to coerce that justice which would not be rendered without coercion , and that security to individuals in their lawful and peaceful occupations which might be liable to be interrupted by lawless and ambitious men , and to secure them from that rapacity which seemed to be the governing policy of many of the European nations . As this country might be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be prepared for such exigencies as might arise in those relations ; and , in alluding to this last consideration , Mr. Hamilton remarks respecting the memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of Austria and Bourbon , and between England and Holland /z/ for mastery of the seas , where the wars were urged on by the people against the wishes of the actual government . Speaking of the wars between England and France , he says ,  --  " The wars between these two last mentioned nations have , in a great measure , grown out of commercial considerations ; the desire of supplanting , and the fear of being supplanted , either in particular branches of traffic , or in the general advantages of trade , and navigation , and , sometimes , even the more culpable desire of sharing in the commerce of others without their consent . " * After speaking of the distracted state of the Grecian and Roman republics , he cites the arguments which the advocates of despotism have drawn , not only against the forms of republican government , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  " Happily for mankind , stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty , which have flourished for ages , have , in a few glorious instances , refuted their gloomy sophisms . And I trust America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices not less magnificent , which will be permanent monuments of their error . " 2 The question may be asked here , what is the basis of liberty of which Mr. Hamilton speaks ? Does it consist simply in having a representative government , where laws can be made by the people through their representatives , without any regard at all to the nature of those laws ? Does he mean that when the representatives get to- /z/ gether they may make laws enslaving each and every individual who has contributed to place them in power , or any other people , who have had no hand in placing them there ? and that the liberty of which he speaks consists only in preventing foreigners from having any control over their dominions ? and that , while they may lay ruthless hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them even plantation slaves , to satisfy their lust for power , they must say to the powers afar off , " presume not to come near ,  - -  touch not mine anointed ,  --  think not of invading our territory , our rights of government , for , if you do , we will bring the whole forces of our government to bear against you ? " Are these the purposes of government ? Are these the purposes for which the government of the United States was formed ? Or was it not rather that the individual , in his private relations , in his every-day employments , in his search after wealth , happiness , religion , should be secure in his person ? should have the whole power of the state put in requisition to save him from having his rights encroached upon , either by any other individual , by the government , or by foreign powers ? Was not this , is not this , the whole object of this government ? Is not this the basis , the proper , the only basis , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any other foundation ? If the individual is not to be defended in his lawful employments , wherein lays his security ; wherein has he any civil rights ? If he encroaches not on the peace and rights of /z/ others , is he not to receive the protection of the state ? Is he not to look to it to guard him from foes around ? If not so , of what use is the habeas corpus ? of what use are our courts of justice ? of what avail is all our apparatus to carry on our internal police ? If we rightly judge , it is for the protection of the individual , and that for his protection all just governments are formed , whether danger arises from external or internal foes ; and . if he is not protected , either the government is founded in fraud , or it is of no use . And if it was not for the protection of the individual , and the hotter to secure the advantages of the combined action of all the people of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we as a community avowed when we established our independence , then was this government founded in fraud , let the declaration of the individuals who proposed and advocated it be what it may . But , until it can be proved that any class of people was excluded , we must suppose a majority of our people included all within our borders who were to receive protection from the state . Mr. Madison , speaking of the objection drawn from the extent of the country , and that the people did not blindly follow any other nation in their form of government , but were ready to adopt such measures as " their own good sense , and the knowledge of their situation , and the lessons of their own experience , taught them , " said ,  --  " Happily for America , happily , we trust , for the tohole human race , they pursued a new and more noble /z/ course . They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society . They reared the fabric of governments which have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design of a great confederacy , which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate . If their works betray imperfections , we wonder at the fewness of them . If they erred most in the structure of the Union , this was the work most difficult to be executed ; this is the work which has been new-modeled by the act of your convention , and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide . " ' Mr. Hamilton , speaking of the defects in the Confederation , in relation to the principle of legislation for the States in their collective capacity , after alluding to the dangers that might arise to them by " rivalship , " ' ' intrigues of foreign nations , " &c.; said ,  --  " But , if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation , if we still adhere to the design of a national government , or , which is the same thing , of a superintending power , under the direction of a common council , we must resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as characteristic difference between a league and a government ; we must extend the authority of the union to the persons of the citizens ,  --  the only proper objects of government . " 2 Mr. Madison , speaking of the conformity of the plan to republican principles , observes ,  --  " The first question that offers itself is , whether the general form and aspect of the government is strictly /z/ republican ? It is evident , no other form would lie reconcilable with the genius of the people of America , with the fundamental principles of the Revolution , or with that honorable determination which animated every votary of freedom to rest all of our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government . If the plan of the convention , therefore , be found to depart from the republican character , its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible. " l After asking the question , what is a republican government ? and alluding to a number of governments which were called republics , but were not really so in fact , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it be derived from the great body of society ,  --  not from any inconsiderable proportion , or a favored class of it ; otherwise , a halldful of tyrannical nobles , exercising their oppression by a delegation of their powers , might aspire to the rank of republicans , and claim for their government the honorable title of republic : " and that " it is iicient for such a government , that the persons adminring be appointed , either by the people or their representatives ; and lhat they hold their offices , either duri. pleasure , for a limited time , or during good behavior . " He then compares the standard here set up , and he thinks it conforms to it . Speaking of the powers with which the Union would be invested , he says ,  --  ' ; It were doubtless to be wished that the power to prohibit the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808 , or rather that it had not been suf- /z/ fered to have immediate operation . But it is not difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed . It ought to be considered a great point gained in favor of humanity , that a period of twenty years may terminate forever , within these States , a traffic which has so long and loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy ; that within that period it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government , and may be totally abolished by a concurrence of the few States which continue the unnatural traffic , in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great a majority of the Union . Happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans , if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppression of their European brethren . ' 1 ' 1 x This , probably , is Mr. Madison 's real t view of slavery and its attendant trade . What he may have afterwards said in the convention of Virginia , we should be rather inclined to think , arose from the fear of what might be the political effect , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect that the Constitution might have on the system of slavery , when he found so much opposition of a certain class of the delegates in that convention . For we find that he here supposed that , in the prohibitory steps taken by so great a majority of the people of the Union , the few States  --  that is , Georgia and South Carolina  --  would finally acquiesce in those steps , and that he supposed it would be happy for the Africans , if they /z/ had an equal prospect before them of being redeemed from the oppression of their European brethren . Remember that , in the destruction of the slave-trade , it was generally thought slavery would cease ; and , if it could be wholly stopped , it undoubtedly would . What , then , we ask , must be Mr. Madison 's idea of guaranteeing the perpetual continuance of slavery to the South ? It is evident he never entertained the thought . He undoubtedly supposed it would die a natural death , when the trade ceased . Speaking of the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rules of the several States has long been remembered as a fault in our system , and as laying a foundation for intricate and delicate questions . In the fourth article of the Confederation , it is declared ' that the free inhabitants of each of these States  --  paupers , vagabonds , and fugitives from justice excepted  - -  shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States ; and the people of each State shall , in every other , enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce , '  --  Scc . There is a confusion of language here which is remarkable . Why the term free inhabitants is used in one part of the article , free citizens in another , and people in another , or what was meant by superadding to ' all privileges and immunities of free citizens , ' all the privileges of trade and commerce , can not easily be determined . " l But he says it seems to be an unavoidable conclusion , that the free inhabitants of one State shall enjoy all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as different States have different laws of naturalization , there might be a confusion ; and it was owing to mere casualty there had not been ; and , to remedy any evil that might result from such expressions , congress very properly had the power to introduce " uniform rules of naturalization ; while the right that our citizens had to go into any of the States was continued , and the word ' free ' before the word ' citizen ' was stricken out ; "  --  another evidence that slavery , so far from its being guaranteed , was meant to be destroyed . The same subject of the powers of congress being continued , he said ,  --  " In a confederacy founded on republican principles , and composed of republican members , the superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchical innovations . The more intimate such a union may be , the greater interest have the members in the political constitutions of each other , and a greater right to insist thai the forms of government under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 1 This is different language from that held by the editor of the Boston Quarterly Review , when he says , because the abolitionists have taken an interest in the welfare of the slave , and would attempt to make the practices of the people of this country conform to their professions , and fulfil their obligations to the world , being themselves implicated in this nefarious business , their action /z/ should be considered as a declaration of war . ' " We think the editor and Mr. Madison do not agree on the right of interference . Neither do we think this language conforms to the ideas thrown out byMr . Webster in his speech delivered in Richmond , Virginia , Oct. 1S40 , in which he says , " I hold , by the Constitution of the United States , that congress is absolutely precluded from interfering in any manner , directly or indirectly , with the institution of slavery , or with any other State institution . " Again he repeats , " There is no power , either in congress or the general government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution of domestic slavery ! " Neither does it agree with the language held by President Harrison , in his inaugural address , on the subject of the members of one State interfering with the internal policy of another . For Mr. Madison continues : " But a right implies a remedy ; and where else could a remedy be deposited by the Constitution ? Governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort than thi of a kindred nature . ' As the Confederate Republic of Germany , ' says Montesquieu , ' consists of free cities and petty states , subject to different princes , experience shows us that is more perfect than that of Holland and Switzerland . ' ' Greece was undone , ' he adds , ' as soon as the king of Macedon obtained a seat in the ampliations . ' In the latter case , no doubt , the disproportionateforce , as well as the monarchical form of the m Confederate , had its share of influence on the events . " /z/ " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a precaution , and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the State governments , without the concurrence of the States themselves . These questions admit of ready answers . If the interposition of the general government shall not be needed , the provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in the Constitution . But who can say what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular States , by the ambition of enterprising leaders , or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers ? To the second question it may be answered , that , if the general government should interpose in virtue of this constitutional authority , it will be , of course , to pursue the authority . " Speaking of the rule adopted for the ratio of representation and taxation , that they would both , in view of congress , depend upon numbers , he observes ,  --  " All this is admitted , it will perhaps be said ; but does it follow , from the admission of numbers for the measure of representation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxation , that slaves ouidit to be included in the numerical rule of representation ? Slaves are considered as property , not as persons . They ought , therefore , to be comprehended in estimation of taxation , which are founded on property , and to be excluded from representation , which is regulated by a census of persons . This is the objection , as I understand it , stated in its full force . I shall be equally as candid in stating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side . " " We subscribe to the doctrine , might one of our southern brethren observe , that repi'esentation relates more immediately to persons , and taxation more immediately to property ; and we join in the application of this /z/ distinction in the case of our slaves . But we must deny the fact that slaves are merely considered as property , and in no respects whatever as persons . The true state of the case is , that they partake of both of these qualities ; they being considered by our laws in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In being compelled to labor , not for himself , but for a master ; in beins vendable by one master to another master ; and being subject , at all times , of being restrained in his liberty , and chastised in his body , by the capricious will of another ,  --  the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank , and classed with those irrational animals which fall under the legal denomination of property . In being protected , on the other hand , in his life and in his limbs , against the violence of all others , even the master of his labor and his liberty , and in being punishable himself for all violence committed against others , the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member of the society , not as a part of the irrational creation ; as a moral person , not as a mere article of property . The federal Constitution , therefore , decides with great projwiety on the case of our slaves , when it views them in the mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , their true character ; it is the character bestowed on them by the laws under which they live , and it will not he denied that these are the proper criterion , because it is only under the pretext , that the laws have transferred the negroes into subjects of property , that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers ; and it is admitted , that , if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away , the negroes could , no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants . 4 ' ' /z/ In answer to an objection made , that , in the exposition of the Constitution , the federal government would follow the example of the States which held slaves , where the slaves neither voted nor increased the votes of their masters , which , if done , all of the slaves would be represented , it will be perceived he places it in the power of the different States to arrange the right of suffrage as they see fit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may at once have a right to a full representation ,  --  an evidence it was expected such would be the case ; for he says ,  --  " It is a fundamental principle of the proposed Constitution , that , as the aggregate number of -representatives allotted to the several States is to be determined by a federal rule , founded on the aero-rebate number of inhab ? itants , so the right of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be exercised by such parts of the inhabitants as the State itself may designate . The qualifications on which the right of suffrage depend are not , perhaps , the same in any two States . In some of the States the difference is very material . In every State a certain proportion of the inhabitants are deprived of this right by the Constitution of the State , who will be included in the census by which the federal Constitution apportions the representatives . In this point of view , the Southern States might retort the complaint , by insisting that the principle laid down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of particular States towards their own inhabitants , and , consequently , the slaves , as inhabitants , should have been admitted into the census according to their full number , in like manner with other inhabitants , who , by // the policy of other States , are not admitted to all the rights of citizens . A rigid adherence to this principle is waived by those who would be gainers by it . " All they ask i , an equal moderation be shown on the other side . Let the case of the slave be considered , as it is in truth , a peculiar one . Let the compromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted , which regards them as inhabitants , but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants ,  --  which regards the slave as the fifth of the many ' He then goes on and takes another ground to justify the convention . In the ratio of representatives they considered that property should be represented . " Government is instituted no less for the protection of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the other , therefore , may be considered as represented by those who have charge of the government ; and , consequently , he infers from this circumstance that the southern person would conclude that the property of the slaveholder should be represented in the manner it was proposed , as he adds ,  --  " Such is the reasoning which an advocate for the southern interest might employ on this subject : and , although it may appear a little strained in some points , yet , on the whole , I must confess it fully reconciles me to the scale of representation which the convention has established . " Mark , in these expressions of Mr. Madison 's , he speaks of the southern man 's arguments , not his own ; and that the whole of the arguments results ' Federalist , p. 3d7. /z/ in this ,  --  that when the master wants to maltreat the slave , then he is property ; but when the slave maltreats his master , then he is a person ; and when taxation and representation are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sort of hermaphrodite ,  --  he is three fifths of a man . Natural history gives no account of such an animal - he is a sort of being conjured up , just about that time , in the brain of some wiseacres . If there had been any record in history of any new animal created since the first formation of the world , we might suppose the slave was a sort of new creation , a being unique in his kind ,  --  as a south-western man would say ,  --  a sort of half horse , half alligator ; though , perhaps , no touch of the snapping turtle , or he might have been considered one of the descendants of the centaurs of old ,  --  half horse , half man , and , consequently , he must be treated as such . We must , on the whole , confess that , while Mr. Madison appears very ingenious in this chapter , his reasoning is very weak . Patrick Henry 's analysis of the proposed Constitution might very well apply here . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution should be established , though he had observed there should be no contradictory principles embodied in the instrument . The amendments to the Constitution , however , as it will be our object to prove , put at rest this reasoning , and has , or should have , restored the slave , ere this , to his rights . We think , on the whole , Mr. Madison  --  not only here , but in other /z/ places  --  tries to blind his own eyes and that of others to the real nature of the consequences which would naturally result on the adoption of the Constitution with regard to the slave . in speaking of the house of representatives , in relation to the supposed tendency of the plan of the convention to elevate the few above the many , he remarks ,  --  " If it be asked , what is to restrain the house of representatives from making le  --  ; al discriminations in favor of themselves , and a particular class of society ? I answer , the - genius of the whole system , the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , llic vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of America ,  --  a spirit which nourishes freedom , and , in return , is nourished by it . " If this spirit should ever be so debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature , as well as on the people , the people will be prepared to tolerate any thing but liberty . " We will ask here , if . in the new position which the South has now taken on the subject of slavery , it is a blessing , and not an evil ; that it must and should be sustained by laws , thereby constituting two distinct classes of society , one favored , and the other treated with contumely ; is it not just the state of society of which Mr. Madison speaks ? and if the American people sanction it , will they not tolerate anything " but liberty ? " and have we not already had a foretaste of what may be expected , if slavery is much longer continued , in the lynchings and burnings , gaggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c.; &c.; ? These things cast a shadow before not to be misunderstood , and we think this view of the subject completely puts to rest the ideas expressed in the previous quotation , and shows what a baseless foundation Mr. Madison had there to stand upon . Respecting the power of the Courts . Mr. Hamilton , in speaking of the judicial department , makes the following observations : " Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void , because contrary to the Constitution , has arisen from the imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power . It is urged , that the authority which can declare the acts of another void must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void . As this doctrine is of great importance in all of y the American constitutions , a brief discussion of the grounds on which it rests may not be unexceptionable . " There is no position which depends on clearer principles than that every act of a delegated authority , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No legislative act , therefore , contrary to the Constitution , can be valid . To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal , that the servant is above his master , that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves , that mere actions , by virtue of powers , may do not only what their powers do not authorize , but what they forbid . " If it be said that the legislative body are the constitutional judges of their own powers , and that the construe- /z/ tion they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments , it may be answered , that this can not be the natural presumption , when it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution . It is not otherwise to be supposed that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents . It is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority . The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts . A constitution is , in fact , and must be regarded by the judges as , a fundamental law . It must therefore belong to them to ascertain its meaning , as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body . If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two , that which has the superior obligation and validity ought , of course , to be preferred : in other words , the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute ; the intention of the people to the intention of their agents . " Nor does the conclusion , by any means , suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power . It only supposes the power of the people is superior to both ; and that , when the will of the legislature , declared in the statutes , stands in opposition to that of the people , declared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter rather than the former . They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws , rather than by those that are not fundamental . ' " ' " But , in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority , of original derivating power , 1 Federalist , p. 434 . QUOTATIONS FROiM THE FEDERALIST . 145 the nature and reason of the thing indicate the course of that rule as proper to be followed . They teach us that a prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority ; and that , accordingly , whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution , it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter , and disregard the former . " /z/ In answer to an objection made to the above construction of the powers of the Supreme Court , he adds ,  --  " In the first place , there is not a syllable in the plan which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every State . I admit , however , the Constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws ; and , whenever there is an evident opposition , the laws ought to give place to the Constitution . But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention , but from the general theory of a limited constitution ; and , as far as it is true , is equally applicable to most , if not all , of the State governments . There can be no objection , therefore , on this account , to the federal judicature , which will not be against the local judicatures in general , and which will not serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion . " 3 " It may be esteemed the basis of the Union , that ' the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States . 1 And , if it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess the means of executing its own provisions by its own authority , it will follow that , in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the Union will be entitled , the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its citizens are opposed to another State and its citizens . " ' " After having discussed and laid down the principles which ought to regulate the Constitution of the federal judiciary , we will proceed to test , by these principles , the particulars of which , according to the plan of the convention , it is to be composed : " First , to ' all cases in law and equity , arising under the Constitution and the laws of the United States . ' It has been asked , what is meant by ' cases arising under the Constitution , ' in contradistinction to those arising under the laws of the United States ? The difference has already been explained . All the restrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emit paper money ; but the interdiction results from the Constitution , 2 and will have no connection with any law of the United States . Should paper money , notwithstanding , be emitted , the controversies concerning it would be cases arising under the Constitution , and not under the laws of the United States , in the ordinary signification of those terms . This may serve as a sample of the whole . " It may also be asked , what need of the word ' equity ? ' What equitable causes can grow out of the Constitution and the laws of the United States ? There is 1 Federalist , p. 413. 2 A question may here be asked : If the States may not issue paper money under the Constitution , can they authorize an agent to do it : in other words , can they grant a charter to a bank , agreeably to this provision of the Constitution ? /z/ hardly a subject of litigation between individuals which may not involve those ingredients of fraud , accident , trust , or hardship , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction , as the distinction is known and established in several of the States . It is the peculiar province , for instance , of a court of equity , to relieve against what may be called hard bargains . There are contracts in which , though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit , sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law , yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortune of one of the parties , which a court of equity would not tolerate . In such cases , when foreigners were concerned on either side , it would be impossible for the federal judicatures to do justice without an equitable as well as legal jurisdiction , " ' In the foregoing quotations , we think it must be apparent to every one , that , in Mr. Hamilton 's opinion , the court held the rights of every individual in their keeping , and that , when appealed to , they would , in duty bound , be obliged to see him protected against all claims or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not inalienable ; and , if wronged or oppressed , either by individuals or a State , the power of the court was sufficiently great to overrule their acts , and restore the man to his just rights . For , if they have jurisdiction in case of hard bargains , we would ask what harder bargain can there be , than - that a man and all his posterity should be sold into slavery , even if the man consented , under peculiar /z/ difficulties , to his own sale , and afterwards repents : would not the court have jurisdiction ? If Mr. Hamilton is correct in the above observations , we think they would . How much more , then , should the court have jurisdiction , when the slave , in opposition to all his entreaties , is sold , and in various ways maltreated in the most shameful manner ! If the courts have jurisdiction in any case where the individual rights are concerned , we know of none which so loudly calls for their interference as that of the slave ; and we sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oil general subjects . Mr. Hamilton , in answer to an objection that the convention did not adopt a bill of rights , remarks , /z/ " There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point . The truth is , after all the declamation we have heard , the Constitution is itself , in every rational sense , and to every useful purpose , a bill of rights . The several bills of rights in Great Britain form its Constitution ; and , conversely , the Constitution of each State is its bill of rights . In like manner , the proposed Constitution , if adopted , will be the bill of rights for the Union . Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizen in the structure and administration of the government ? This is done in the most simple and precise manner in the plan of the convention ; comprehending various precautions for the public security , which are not to be found in any of the State Constitutions . Is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modes of pro- /z/ ceeding , which are relative to personal or private coti* cerns ? This we have seen has been attended to in a variety of cases , in the same plan . Adverting , therefore , to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights , it is absurd to allege that it is not found in the work of the convention . " ' After answering the objection , that it does not go far enough , he adds ,  --  " Whence it must be apparent that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions , entirely foreign to the substance of the thing . " Among the final reasons for adopting the Constitution , Mr. Hamilton adds ,  --  " The additional securities to republican governments , to liberty , and to property , to be derived from the adoption of the plan , consists chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the Union will impose upon local factions and insurrections , and upon that ambition of powerful individuals in single States , who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to become the despots of the people ; in the diminution of the opportunities of foreign intrigue , which the dissolution of the confederacy would incite and facilitate ; in the prevention of extensive military establishments , which could not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a disunited situation ; in an express guaranty of a republican form of government to each ; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility ; and in the precaution against the repetition of those practices , on the part of the State governments , which /z/ have undermined the foundation of property and credit , have planted mutual distrust in the breast of all classes of citizens , and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals . " From this it appears the conclusive reasons for adopting the Constitution , and the ones which were to cap the climax , were , the States were incapable of defending the individual 's rights ; they had not power to repel foreign invasions , or overcome the influences which ambitious men might obtain in a single State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome the jealousies that might arise between different States , and which would have a tendency to increase the military . and thereby endanger the good of society , its peace and happiness . /z/ We will now enter upon the discussion had in the several conventions of the States , which were called to take into consideration the subject of adopting the Constitution as promulgated by the convention at Philadelphia , premising , however , the Constitution as adopted was an entirely different thing from what was anticipated by the generality of the people at large : they expected an improvement of the Confederation , not a new system of government , as the Constitution proposed . In the debates on the Constitution in the convention of Massachusetts , Mr. King said , in the discussion of the third paragraph , 2d section , article 1st ,  --  " three fifths of all other persons : " ' - 'These persons meant slaves . By this rule is representation and taxation to be apportioned . And it was adopted because it was the language of all America . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the representation , the greater the taxation According to the Confederation , ratified in 1781 , the sums for the general welfare and defence should be apportioned according to the surveyed lands , and improvements thereon in the several States . But /z/ it had never been in the power of congress to follow that rule , the returns from the several States being so very imperfect . ' 1 ' ' On a question being asked by Mr. Widgery , " if a boy of six years of age was to be considered a freeman , " 2 Mr. King answered ,  --  " All persons born free were to be considered freemen ; and , to make the idea of taxation by numbers more intelligible , said five negro children of South Carolina are to pay as much tax as the three governors of New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Connecticut . " 3 " Judge Dana asked , ' Can that land flourish like this which is cultivated by the hands of freemen ? and are not three of these independent freemen of more real advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 4 " Mr. Nason remarked , ' Mr. King ought to have gone further , and have said three of our children in the cradle are to be rated as high as five of the working negroes of Virginia , and it will then appear that this State will pay as great a tax for three children in the cradle as any of the Southern States for five hearty , working negroes ; and , as it was hinted we had made a bad bargain before , we ought to make a better one now . ' " 5 " Mr. Dawes observed , the colored people of the Southern States must be considered as slaves or freemen ; if the former , and consequently as so much property , why should it not be wholly represented ? but our own laws and Constitution consider blacks as freemen , and so , also , docs our own natural justice . If , then , as freemen , they ought to be wholly represented . In either view , he could /z/ not see that northern men would suffer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage ought to be considered in the convention with that other portion of the Constitution , that prohibits the slave-trade in 1808 , and that it was left to the option of all the States to totally prohibit the introduction of slaves into any of the States ; and he asked , what could the convention do more ? The members of the Southern States , like ourselves , had their prejudices . It would not do to abolish slavery by an act of congress in a moment , and so destroy what our southern brethren considered as property . But we may say , that although slavery is not smitten by an apoplexy , yet it has received a mortal wound , and will die of consumption . " /z/ Messrs . King , Gore , and Parsons spoke of the advantage to the Northern States the apportionment of taxes gave them ; as also the Hon. Judge Dana , who , in concluding his remarks , observed ,  --  " I would rather be annihilated than to give my voice for , or sign my name to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberties or interest of my country . " 2 It may , perhaps , be well to remark here , though we have before entered pretty largely on this question , how completely the southern people have thrown off the advantage which our northern statesmen thought they had gained over the south by this system of taxation . Finding , as undoubtedly they must have done , how onerous it would be to pay a direct tax on each of their slaves , they immediately took advantage of the disposi- /z/ tion manifested at the North to raise a revenue on imports . The mechanics 1 of the North wishing to have their labor protected , and the South wishing to get rid of this direct tax . both succeeded in their wishes , and consequently a tariff on foreign articles was adopted . By this step , though opposed by much of the intelligence of the North , the South , in consequence of the small quantity of foreign products used by her slaves , has thrown a good portion of the expenses of the government upon the non-slaveholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , in the end , like all such bargains , turned out but a sorry affair ; and we , their children , have not much to boast of their acuteness in such matters , unless we have the charity to suppose they intended it should bear with such weight upon the holders of slaves the masters would be glad to let them go ; and , if so , we have only to regret they were not holden to their bargain . We would also have the observations made by Mr. Dawes remembered , particularly when he speaks of the power of congress* : " It would not do to abolish slavery by an act of congress in a moment . ' ' But to return : " Mr. Widgery insisted we had a right to be jealous of our rulers , who ought never to have power they could abuse ; 1 ' 2 and in another place observed , " lie hoped the gentleman would not think hard of it if we . ignorant men , can not see as clear as he does . The 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boston , just before the fitting of the convention . /z/ strong must bear the infirmities of the weak ; and it must be a weak mind indeed that could throw such illiberal reflections against gentlemen of education as the honorable gentleman complains of . To return to the paragraph : If congress , " continued Mr. W. " have this power of taxing directly , it will be in their power to enact a poll tax . Can gentlemen tell why they will not oppose it , and by this means make the poor pay as much as the rich ? " ' " Mr. Fuller was at a loss to tell how taxation and representation went hand in hand , when the requisition made on Massachusetts was thirteen times as great as that made on Georgia , when she sent eight representatives , and Georgia but three , the question was asked Mr. Gerry . Mr. Gerry answered , Georgia had increased its numbers by immigration ; and if it had not then , it soon would have , enough to entitle it to the portion assigned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire and Massachusetts , for two or three years , had in the field half of the continental army under Gen. Washington , and he thought , therefore , congress should have the power of laying taxes , in order to make the different States pay their proportion . " 3 " Mr. Widgery was opposed to the Constitution : his arguments were ,  --  the Confederation was well enough , and he was not afraid of foreign enemies . " " Mr. Neal went over the ground of objections to this section , on the idea the slave-trade was allowed to be continued for twenty years . His profession , he said , obliged him to bear witness against any thing that should favor the making merchandise of the bodies of 1 Elliot 's Reports , vol. i. p. 63. /z/ men ; ami , unless his objection was removed , he could not put his hand to the Constitution . Other gentlemen said , in addition to this idea , that there was not even a proposition that the colored man should ever be free , and Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , after we have established our own independence and freedom , we make slaves of others ? O ! Washington , ' what a name he has had ! How he has immortalized himself ! but he holds those in slavery who have as good a right to be free as he has ; he is still for self , and , in my opinion , his character has sunk fifty per cent . ' " 2 " On the other side , it was said that the step taken in this article towards the abolition of slavery was one of the beauties of the Constitution . They observed that , in the Confederation , there was no provision whatever for its being abolished ; but this Constitution provides that congress may , after twenty years , totally annihilate the slave-trade , and that all the States except two had passed laws to this effect . It might reasonably be expected it would be done . In the interim all the States were at liberty to prohibit it . " " The debate of this ninth section , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections and answers thereto as had been before used . Both sides deprecated the slave-trade in the most pointed terms . On one side it was pathetically lamented by Mr. Nason , Major Lash , Mr. Xcal , and others , that this Constitution provided for the continuance of the slavetrade for twenty years . On the other , the Hon. Judge Dana , Mr. Adams , and others , rejoiced that a door was now opened for the annihilation of this odious and abhorrent practice in a certain time . " 1 It must be remembered Washington , at his death , gave freedom to his slai /z/ " Mr. Heath observed he had been absent , and had not heard the remarks that had been made . But the paragraph respecting the migration and importation of such persons as any of the States ? ww existing shall think proper to admit , &c.; is one of those considered during my absence , and I have heard nothing on the subject , save what has been mentioned this morning ; but I think the gentlemen who have spoken have carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehend it is not in our power to do any thing for or against those who are in slavery in the Southern States . No gentleman within these zcalls detests every idea of slavery more than I do . It is generally detested by the people of this Commonwealth ; and I ardently hope the time will soon come when our brethren of the Southern States will view it as we do , and put a stop to it ; but to this we have no right to compel them . Two questions naturally arise , if we ratify this Constitution : Shall tee do any thing , by our acts , to hold the blacks in slavery 1 or shall we become partakers in other men 's sins J I ihink neither of them : each State is sovereign and independent in a certain degree , and they have a right and will regulate their own internal affairs as to themselves appears proper ; and shall we refuse to eat or drink , or be united , with those who do not think or act as we do ? Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partakers of other men 's sins ; for in nothing do we voluntarily encourage the slavery of our fellow-men . A restriction is laid on the federal government , which could not be avoided , and a union take place . The federal convention went as far as they could ; the migration and importation is confined to the States now existing only . New States can not claim it . Congress , by their ordinance for creating new States , some time since declared that the new States shall be republican , and that there shall be no slavery in them . /z/ But whether those in the Southern States will be emancipated after the year 1808 1 do not pretend to determine ; I rather doubt it . ' " Questions might here arise ,  --  whether , if slaves could be held in the old States , under the Constitution , with Mr. Heath 's understanding of the matter , they could be so held in the States that have been admitted since the Union was formed ; whether it is in the power of congress to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their borders by immigration ; also , whether the republican character that congress has guaranteed to each State , to which Mr. Heath alludes , would not also forbid slaves from being retained even in any State . After the Constitution had been discussed by paragraphs , and the whole brought up to be adopted , /z/ " Mr. Neal rose and said , that , as the Constitution at large was now under consideration , he would just remark , that the article which respected the Africans was the one that laid on his mind ; and , unless his objection to that was removed , it must , however much lie liked the other parts of the Constitution , he a sufficient reason for him Ltivc his negative to it . " 3 . Mr. Heath remarked , we are soon to decide on a system of government , digested , not for the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts only , not for the present people of the United States only , but , in addition to these , all those States that may hereafter arise into existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mil- /z/ lions yet unborn ,  --  a system of government , not for a nation of slaves , but for a people as free and as virtuous as any on earth ; not for a conquered nation , subdued to our will , but for a people who have fought , who have bled , and who have conquered  --  who , under the smiles of Heaven , have established their independence and sovereignty , and have taken equal rank among the nations of the earth . " ' After other observations 5 he says ,  --  " But I have observed , from the first , that many gentlemen are opposed to the system ; and this , I apprehend , arises from their objections to some particular parts of it . Is there not a way their minds may be relieved from embarrassment ? I think there is ; and I think no exertion should be spared in endeavoring to do it . He therefore recommended that the first representatives to congress be requested to exert their endeavors to have such checks and guards provided as appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Communicate what we judge proper to our sister States , and request their concurrence : is there not the highest probability every thing we wish may he effectually secured ? He thought there was ; and the gentlemen of the convention would have their difficulties under which they labored removed . ' ' ' ' Mr. Bowdoin , in the course of his observations , remarked ,  --  " From hence it follows that all the governments of the States ought to be of the same nature  --  of the republican kind ; and that the general government ought to be an assemblage of the spuit and principles of them all . " - Elliot 's Reports , vol. i. p. 128 . Idem , vol. i. p. 133. /z/ The following is an abstract of the amendments introduced by the president . Mr. Hancock , in order to induce the different members of the convention to give their sanction to the instrument : 1st . It is explicitly declared that all powers , not expressly delegated to congress , are reserved to the several States , to be by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summary of a bill of rights . The 3d amendment proposed was to quiet the apprehension of those who thought congress held too much power over elections . 4th . Congress can not lay direct taxes , except when the money arising from imposts and excises shall be insufficient for the public exigencies . 6cc . The 6th was to introduce the indictment by the grand jury , before any person should be tried for crime , before he should incur any infamous punishment , or loss of life . The Sth recommends a trial by jury in civil actions between citizens of different States . 1 There were nine amendments finally adopted . 1 These amend m en 's were in the hand-writing , as we have understood by a gentleman ' who attended all the sitiings of that convention , of Mr. James Sullivan . The same gentleman also remarked that there was a great deal of exertion made to keep the convention in ignorance of the real bearing that the Constitution , reported , might have on the system of slavery ; and he remarked , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least idea that slavery would have been supported by it , the Constitution would have been rejected in three days . This same gentleman , who had taken a very active part in favor of the Constitution , observed that it was generally supposed , by the principal men , that the South would soon perceive that slavery was a dark spot on her escutcheoD , /z/ " These amendments met the concurrence of Mr. Adams , and he thought they would be generally and that they - would , of their own accord , soon abolish it He . though not a member of the convention , thought a rejection would be : and ii required , as he said , a great deal of mana , ment to bring about the consent of the del s of the convention to the Constitntion . It had become well known , before the meeting of the convention , that Mr. Hancock and Samuel Adams we opposed to it . The merchants ar in favor of it in the : of Boston , calculating upon the humanity of these gentlemen , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lik to influence them , got up a large meeting of the mechanic ; : town , who held their meeting at the tavern called on . The house was filled to overflowing : and the street , and all the avenues about the house , were crowded with people . He , as secretary of the meeting , read a series of resolutions , that had been prepared by Mr. Christopher Gore , amended , as he said , by the committee who were appointed by the meeting to bring in resolutions , in order to make them appear more mechanical ; : were rather too refined , as ' bey supposed , for such a meeting lc adopt . They were read to the mee . : house , and thev adopted them by acclamation : they were then the people outside , and they also received them with enthusiasm . When Mr. Samuel Adams heard of the meeting the next day . and what thev had done , he was n : . I : . r I i hs believe there were many of the mechani u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Revere , the chairman of the n. ins , who was a mechanic and a great friend of Mr. Adams . ( Our B : ; ton folk have not yet forgotten how to carry a point , when they have determined upon it ! ) After it had been ascertained that there was a majority in the convention who would vote in favor of the Constitution , the citizens waited upon Mr. Hancock , who had been confined do : s sittings of the convention by - took him in a carriage , and , as it was said , about five hundred persons drew him to the hall of the convention ; and he had the honor of coming forward as a conciliator , and presenting to the meeting the amendments that had been prepared . It will be perceived they were written with a great deal of care , but ostensibly , and as asserted in the convention , to secure the rights and liberties of all . With . tier , the : antenance of Mr. Hancock , and the assent of Mr. A suns* with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made . ' " " Mr. Strong thought the amendments proposed would meet the several objections made . " 2 ' - Mr. Thompson observed , he could not say amen to the amendments ; he thought they might be voted for by some Indians . ' 1 ' ' 3 " Mr. Widgery did not see the probability these amendments would be made , if we had the authority to propose them . He considered the convention did not meet for the purpose of recommending amendments , but to adopt or reject the Constitution . He concluded by asking whether it was probable that those States that had already adopted the Constitution would be likely to submit to amendments . " 4 " Judge Dana advocated the amendments . He said they were not of a local nature , but extended to every part of the Union ; and he thought two thirds of congress , or two thirds of the conventions of the States , would adopt them . " * " Gen. Thompson said , we have no right to make amendments ; it was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gentlemen were convinced it was not a perfect system , and that it wanted amendments : this , he said , was different from the language assurance thru their delegates in congress should press these amendments till they should become a part of the Constitution , and in consequence of the State being then , as now , one of the most influential in the Union , her suggestions would have their weight , and would probably be adopted : with these assurances , the convention , as will be perceived , concluded to adopt the instrument ; and those who finally voted against it said they would cease their opposition . 1 Elliot 's Reports , vol. i. p. 131. * Idem , vol. i. p. 1 15. 3 Idem , vol. i. p. 1 15. * Idem , vol. i. p. 1 16.

However , as to the amendments , he could not say amen to them ; but they may be voted for by some men  --  he did not say Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the amendments , entered largely into the consideration of the 9th section , and , in the most pathetic and feeling manner , described the misery of the poor natives of Africa who are kidnapped and sold for slaves . With the brightest colors he painted their happiness and ease on their native shores , and contrasted them with their wretched , miserable , and unhappy condition in the state of slavery . " l " Rev. Mr. Backus spoke in favor of the Constitution , because he thought by its adoption it would be a means of destroying slavery . " 2 " Dr. Jarvis repels the charge , that these amendments have been artfully introduced to lead to a decision that would not otherwise be had . Without stopping to remark upon the total want of candor in which such an idea has arisen , let us inquire whether there is even an appearance of a reason to support this insinuation . The propositions are annexed , it is true , to the ratification , but the assent is complete and absolute without them . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this honorable body . Gentlemen , therefore , when they make such an unfair observation , do no honor to the sagacity of others . The propositions are general , not local ; they are not calculated for the peculiar interest of this State , but , with indiscriminate justice , comprehend the circumstances of the individual on the hanks of the Savannah , as well as the hardy and industrious husband/nan on the margin of the Kennebec . Why , then , they should not be adopted , I confess I can not conceive . He thought other States would adopt /z/ them ; that Massachusetts had her influence ; and , as they did away many objections that had been made , they would be annexed to the ratification ; and , if they would not be immediately adopted by the influence of her , delegation , they might ultimately be . " ' We will stop here to remark how pointed and distinct is this language : that the amendments proposed , that should have a bearing upon the condition of the slave , were not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been insinuated ; that they were not made for deception , or that it was intended to blind the eyes of any ; but they were so plain all would understand them , and that they meant them to apply to the slave in Georgia as well as to the freeman in Maine ; and it must be presumed the South so understood it . It could not be supposed their intellectual vision would be so abtuse as not to see their bearings ; and , consequently , if they should be adopted , the slave would be secure in his personal rights , and could not be punished but after a conviction of a crime by a jury , and then not to receive any " cruel or unusual punishment ; " and , as the amendments that were finally adopted by congress not only included these , with few alterations , but others more definite and distinct than the ones passed by this convention ,  --  such , for instance , in the latter clauses of the 1st article of the amendments , where " the freedom of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition government for redress of /z/ grievances ; " also the 4th article , where " the right of the people to be secure , " &c.; is asserted ; also a portion of the 5th , 6th , and 7th articles , where the rights of the people are guaranteed to them ,  --  the people of Massachusetts felt somewhat satisfied that justice would at length be done to the negro , and that she ceased for a time pressing his claim . For we think it will be perceived every slaveholder has , and does , make himself liable , under these amendments , to be prosecuted before our courts of law every time he presumes to whip or punish a slave without a " process of law , " stating wherein his fellow-man has injured him ; and then he should not take the law into his own hands ; for this , we think , was the intention and meaning of the amendments passed by the convention of Massachusetts . " Mr. Ames said the amendments appeared satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One gentleman , who was distinguished for his zealous opposition , has declared he ' would uphold both hands if they could be adopted . ' " " The only question which seems to labor , is this : the amendments are not a part of the Constitution , and there is nothing better than a probability they will be adopted . The nature of the debate is totally shifted , and the inquiry now is , not what the Constitution is , but what degree of probability there is that the amendments will be incorporated into it . " He then went on to consider the objections that had been made . Mr. Burrill , of York , spoke in favor of the Consti- Elliot 's Reports , vol. i. p. 157. /z/ union only as the prospect was that the amendments , from the representation of the delegates , would be adopted ; otherwise he had strong objections from the fear of its destroying the liberties of the country . 1 " Mr. Parsons demonstrated the impossibility of forming a bill of rights in a national constitution for securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the idea no was given to congress to infringe on any one of the natural rights of the people by this Constitution ; and , should they attempt it , without constitutional authority , this act would be a nullity , and could not be enforced . " 2 We will here ask if congress , that power which was made the supreme , could not infringe upon any of the natural rights of the people , and all such acts , if attempted , would be at once a " nullity , " could it be , or can it be , in the power of the States to do it ? Can the States have a greater control over the individual , the lesser power , than congress , the greater ? We must certainly answer in the negative . The States can not have a greater control over the individual than congress ; perhaps , with certain modifications , they may exercise a control , but it must be in conformity to the principles of the Constitution ; and if congress can not interfere with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor the individual of a State . The individual has never given these rights away , and , as the Declaration of Independence says , never can ; they are inalienable . How can the individual but be secure under our /z/ Constitution if its provisions be properly carried into effect ? As Judge Parsons may be considered good authority in this case , we must suppose the individual , wherever situated , and of whatever complexion , has these natural rights , of which he can not by any laws be deprived ; and if they are taken away it can not be considered lawful ; and , consequently , any claim over these rights must be a " nullity , " being in opposition to natural justice and our Constitution . " Mr. Stillman was in favor of the Constitution without the amendments , only as he thought it sufficiently guaranteed the liberties of the people . " Hon. Mr. Turner made an excellent speech in favor of the Constitution with the amendments . 1 Mr. Symms , who had opposed the Constitution as it was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " When his excellency the president came forward , as became his high office , in the character of a mediator , a ray of hope shot in upon the gloom that overspread his heart ,  --  of hope that we should still be united in the grand decision ! Speaking of the amendments , he said ,  --  Our committee , sir , are pretty well agreed as to the amendments necessary to be made ; and , in their report , it appears that these amendments are equally beneficial to ALL of the citizens of America . There is nothing local in them . Shall we then totally reject the Constitution because we are only morally certain they will be adopted ? Shall we choose certain misery in one way , when we have the best human prospect of enjoying our most sanguine wishes in another ? God forbid ! " 2 /z/ He concluded his speech by saying ,  --  " He withdrew his opposition from the consciousness that the amendments would be adopted . That from the known influence that Massachusetts held in the nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates in congress to urge their adoption , he concluded , there would be no doubt of their ultimate success ; and , consequently , by withdrawing his opposition , and conceiving the utmost need there was for a constitution for the country , he fell himself acquitted by his own conscience ; he hoped and trusted he should be by his constituents , and laying his hand on his breast I know I shall before God . " The time having arrived for taking the question , as to the adoption of the Constitution , the president made a short address . Among other things , he said ,  --  " I should consider it one of the most distressing misfortunes of my life to be deprived of giving my aid and support to a system which , if amended ( and I feel assured it will be ) according to your proposals , can not fail to give the people of the United States a greater degree of political freedom , and , eventually , as much national dignity , as falls to the lot of any nation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 187 yeas , 168 nays , most of those gentlemen who had opposed its adoption stated they should not continue their opposition , but should , as they had been fairly beaten , give in their adhesion , hoping it might prove the blessing that its advocates thought it would produce . /z/ The convention closed its proceedings by saying , /z/ " That , in acknowledging , with grateful hearts , the goodness of the Supreme Ruler of the universe , in affording the people of the United States , in the course of his providence , an opportunity deliberately and peaceably , without fraud or surprise , of entering into an explicit and solemn compact with each other , by assenting to and ratifying a new Constitution , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity , do , in the name , and in behalf , of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , assent to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' After so much had been said in the convention of Massachusetts , it may be thought surprising the amendments were not more pointed and distinct on the subject of slavery ; and , because they were not , it must be presumed General Thompson expressed himself as indignantly as he did . Yet . if the principles they embodied should be carried out  --  and no doubt it was hoped and expected they would be  --  and as the amendments actually adopted were more distinct , there can be no reason to suppose but those aniendments should be applied in the broadest sense , and be considered as having , if not exclusively , certainly a distinct reference to the condition of the slave . In the great anxiety to have a Constitution by a good portion of the 1 Elliot 's Reports , vol. i. p. 176. /z/ people of Massachusetts , and particularly among the leading men of those times , and fearing the consequences if they did not succeed , we may suppose they might be as guarded as they dare be , lest they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they meant should be a palladium for the general liberties of the country . Mr. Dawes was the only one , so far as is reported , who made any allusion to the prejudice that was then existing against the colored race : he seems to acknowledge that the South , as well as the North , possessed it ; and that was the reason why the three fifths representation was adopted . All the others were either silent on the subject , or else spoke in decided terms of the iniquity of slavery , and the abhorrence with which they viewed the whole subject . But they all seemed to think that the stopping of the slave-trade would consummate the overthrow of slavery ; and it was against that they mostly directed their remarks , thinking , if that traffic was made to cease , slavery would cease with it . In reviewing these interesting proceedings , we can not but remark the firmness and love of liberty which , with perhaps few exceptions , displayed itself in all of the observations of the men composing this convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , made to slavery and its continuance and the impossibility of having a constitution adopted at all , without the almost positive assurance that such provisions , in the form of amendments , should be made as /z/ would prevent the personal tyranny practised in a State where slavery existed ; and although scarce one in the whole convention , so far as the debates are reported , but appeared anxious for a constitution , and that there should be one similar to the one before them , yet we find , on account of the obnoxious paragraphs , which might be construed as having relation to the colored man , there was but nineteen majority in its favor , and many of these said they should vote in its favor simply on the ground that the amendments which the convention proposed would be adopted . And , as we find , these , with others securing the rights of the individual in a distinct manner , were adopted . Where , we ask , is the vaunted declaration , that the Constitution guarantees slavery ? Where , even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina and Georgia , together with a few slaveholders out of these States , and Virginia and North Carolina , afterwards attempted , in their several State conventions , to force the acknowledgement of slavery on the Union , the other States would not agree to it ; but , on the contrary , caused such amendments to be made as to give equal rights to all , as one member of this convention said , to those on the banks of the Savannah as well as to those on the margin of the Kennebec : and now , whether Georgia or South Carolina agreed to these amendments or not , so long as they agreed two thirds of the States could make amendments , and have remained in the Union after they were adopted , it can not be otherwise /z/ supposed than that they have placed themselves under all the liabilities which that instrument , with its amendments , impose . It can not be supposed these States were not aware of the nature of these amendments , nor how far they would extend . The debates of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took , and we see no reason why they should not abide the consecpienccs , when we know these consequences can not but redound to the glory of all concerned . Massachusetts , at that day , as well as at the present , was considered one of the first States of the Union . She had contributed more men and money to carry on the war than any other State , and her people thought , and thought justly , that her voice should be heard . Was it not so heard ? and were not the principles of liberty more fully incorporated into the Constitution through her influence , and that of some of the other States , if possible , than was at first embodied in the instrument itself ? Although we are aware there has been , and there probably was at the time , as without doubt there are some at this very time , who would be glad to take away the rights of any body , provided they themselves could or can ride into power or preferment by so doing , yet the yeomanry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we trust do hold , a different language , and that liberty and the right will yet be maintained , whatever may be the exertions to prevent them from being upheld . /z/ The observations made by most of the members of the convention , for adopting the Constitution , held in the State of New York , were , for the most part , directed to the subjects how best to secure the liberties of the State , and individuals of the State , without having any regard to the different races in the country . The situation of the colored man appeared to be , for the most part , passed over in silence ,  --  not because they had any desire to sanction the proceedings of the national convention on the subject , but because it seemed to the different members , who alluded to it at all , as out of their power to remedy . Take , however , this convention as a body , if we may judge by the report given of their proceedings , and we think they did not take a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were discussing . Most of their time was taken up in details , and in determining whether the ratio of representation was correct , and whether the liberty of the individual in their own State would be properly secured . But they left the colored man where they found him ; they left him , for the most part , /z/ to take- care of himself , whilst they looked out for themselves . We have , therefore , but little to say of their proceedings . The following is nearly all we could glean , which was thought had reference to the subject under consideration ; but what little we have collected , shows the negro was not forgotten ; that he had here the sympathy of some . But , in general , the convention seemed to think the absolute necessity of the case , if they wanted the Union , required them to acquiesce in the proceedings of the national convention ; but if they had been differently circumstanced , they would not have given sanction to its proceedings with respect to the slave . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been done , the others gave way , without an attempt to remonstrate , saving a Mr. Tread well , who , being absent , sent a communication on the subject , which was published at the end of their discussions . We should , however , judge there was not any very great talent displayed in this convention . A Mr. Smith attempted to make some general opposition ; but one word from Mr. Hamilton silenced him , and he at once surrendered at discretion . The consequence was , all the cannon were spiked , and nothing but small arm were afterwards used ; though these , we must admit , if properly directed , and made to bear on the right subject , may do as much execution as larger ones . , Hut , without further comment , we will introduce Mr. Robert R. Livingston . In speaking of /z/ the powers conferred on congress , in distinction to those conferred on the Confederation , " He showed , in a strong point of view , the danger of applying these , and deduced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its principles , and impeachable in its execution , as it operated upon States in their political capacity , and not upon individuals : and that it carried with it the seeds of domestic violence , and tended ultimately to its own dissolution . " 1 These observations , if true , should be particularly marked . The Confederation had nothing to do with the individual in the several States , while , by the Constitution , the congress of the United States has . For it will be perceived , if this is so , it is bound to see that the individual , wherever situated , whether upon the banks of the Savannah , or upon the margin of the Kennebec , if he be unlawfully seized in his person or effects , or receives any punishment without due process of law , should be protected and preserved from such outrages . " Mr. Smith objected to clause 3d , section 2d , article 1st . He could not see-any rule by which slaves were to be included in the ratio of representation . The principle of a representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing himself , it was absurd to give that power to a man who could not exercise it : slaves have no will of their own : the very operation of it was to give certain privileges to those people who were so wicked as to keep slaves . He knesv it would be admitted that this rule was founded on unjust principles , but that it /z/ Mas the result of accommodation ; which he supposed we should be under the necessity of admitting , if we meant to be in union with the Southern States , though utterly repugnant to his feelings . 11 ' After speaking for some time on the subject of representation , and the fear that the spirit of liberty might become extinct that had carried them through the war of independence , from the feeling that had already manifested itself in the different parts of the country , he concluded , by proposing a resolution for the apportionment of the representatives , of which the following is a part : " That there should be one representative for every twenty thousand inhabitants , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apportioned among . the States in proportion to the number of the inhabitants of the States respectively . " If this amendment had been adopted , it will be perceived that in the apportionment for representatives no regard would have been had to paupers , Indians , negroes , or slaves , but all would have been counted . Hon. Mr. Hamilton said ,  --  " The first thing objected to is the clause that allows a representation for three fifths of the negroes . Much has been said of the impropriety of representing men who have no will of their own : whether this is reasoning , or declamation , I will not presume to say . It is the unfortunate situation of the Southern States to have a great part of their population , as well as property , in blacks . The regulation complained of was one result of the /z/ spirit of accommodation which governed the convention ; and without this indulgence no Union could have been formed . But , sir , considering some of the peculiar advantages which we derive from them , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States possess certain staples ,  --  tobacco , rice , indigo , &:e.;  --  which must be capital objects in treaties of commerce with foreign nations ; and the advantages which they necessarily procure in these treaties will be felt throughout the United States . But the justice of this plan will appear in another view . The best writers on government have held that representation should be comprehended of persons and property . This rule has been adopted , as far as it could be , in the Constitution of New York . It will , however , be admitted that the slaves are not to be considered altogether as property . They are men , though degraded to the condition of slavery . They are persons known to the municipal laws of the States which they inhabit , as well as the laws of nature . But representation and taxation go together , and one uniform law ought to apply to both . Would it be just to compute these men in the assessment of taxes , and discard them from the estimate in the apportionment of representatives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without conferring some adequate advantage ? " ' Mr. Melancthon Smith observed .  --  " He did not mean to alter the clause in apportioning the representatives as regards slaves . He thought they would have to give that up . " ' Mr. Harrison , speaking of the objection that had been made to the apportionment of the representatives , and the withdrawal of the objection by /z/ the person who made it , said ,  --  " I think the concession does honor to the gentleman who had stated the objection . He has candidly acknowledged that this apportionment was the result of accommodation , without which no union could have been formed ; " l and then went on , like the other debaters , considering the number that should be in the house of representatives that would be most likely to secure the liberties of the people . Mr. Treadwell , a member of the convention , who was opposed to the adoption of the Constitution , on the ground it took away State rights , and , as he said , would produce a consolidated government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , in a speech , published as a supplement to the proceedings of the convention , though not delivered , remarked , among other strong objections ,  --  " There is another clause in this Constitution , which , though there is no prospect of getting it amended , I think ought not to be passed over in silence , lest such a silence should be construed into a tacit approbation of it . I mean the clause which restricts the general government from putting a stop , for a number of years , to a commerce which is a stain to the commerce of any civilized nation , and has already blackened half of the plains of America with a race of wretches , made so by our cruel policy and avarice , and which appears to me to be repugnant to every principle of humanity , morality , religion , and good policy . " Further on he says ,  --  /z/ i ; If we act with coolness , firmness , and decision , on this occasion , I have the fullest confidence that the God who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lion and of the bear , will also deliver us from , this Goliath , this uncircumcised Philistine . This government is founded in sin , and reared up in iniquity ; the foundations are laid in the most singular breach of public trust , and the top stone is the most iniquitous breach of public faith ; and I fear , if it goes into operation , we shall be justly punished by the total extinction of our civil liberties . We are invited , in this instance , of becoming partakers in other men 's sins ; if we do , we must likewise be contentto take our share in the punishment . " On the whole , this letter , or speech , was one as firm and as good as any that appears among the whole that was made on the adoption of the Constitution . It would appear he left the Convention , as some , also , of the Massachusetts delegation did , because they would not even have it supposed they gave countenance for a moment to what they thought would injure their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Constitution was adopted with the " full confidence " that the amendments they had proposed would be incorporated in the instrument , these amendments being accompanied with a bill of rights . These were thirty-three in number , and had more or less reference to the liberty of the individual . The vote was , yeas 30 , nays 27 ,  --  a majority , it will be perceived , very smalj . If Mr. Tread well had voted , the Constitution would have been accepted but by two votes . The guaranty that /z/ New York gave was not very strong , at the best ; and , if Mr. Hamilton 's account of the matter is correct , the " capital articles for making treaties  - -  tobacco , rice , indigo , " &c.;  --  ( cotton , it appears , was not then a staple ) had the effect to stop all tongues , and . to make them acquiesce in a transaction which , as was observed by Mr. Smith , it would be admitted was founded on unjust principles ; which very admission , if true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nullity . For what business or right has any body of men to assemble , and make rules for the government of society , which they themselves acknowledge to be unjust ? The counterfeiter , the pirate , the robber , can do no more ; and the slimsy excuses made by Mr. Hamilton , to justify the transaction , do but show he could not well justify the case . He says New York , in her legislation , acknowledges that property , as well as individuals , should be represented ; and , as negroes at the South were considered such , therefore they should be represented . But he immediately says they were not wholly considered as property , but as individuals : " they were persons known to our municipal courts . ' ' We will ask , if such was the case , are they not responsible persons ? Can our courts of law take cognizance of things , and bring things to trial ? Mr. Hamilton could not but be aware of the false position in which he was placed , and in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the " capital " articles , and , as we may suppose , the obstinate perseverance of the delegates from /z/ Georgia and South Carolina , together with the prejudices and the known degradation and ignorance of the colored man , and Mr. H. 's want of sympathy with the lower classes of society , and his want of faith that they could by any possibility of circumstances take care of themselves , induced him to act the part he did . A man , in other respects so just , and whose character for honesty and uprightness was so preeminent , makes himself appear in a light not so enviable as could be wished , when he takes a step so opposed to natural justice . To make a man amenable to laws , and yet not give him the power over himself to enable him to obey , and even give another the sole control of his person , while it might be considered by some good theology , could not , by men of sound judgment , be considered good law . No ! the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise it should be considered no law . For why should a person attempt to do that which it is well known can not be done ? or , if unrestrained , and the person was left free to act , it could be done , yet , being restrained , and obliged to act according to the will and command of another , must not the responsibility of his acts rest on that other ? But it may be said the slave is not brought before our courts but for some heinous crime , of which the master may know nothing , or even it may be a crime against the master . But this can not be a valid objection , because , when a man is placed at the sole will of another , and is made a chattel personal , he at once takes the place /z/ of the brute , and can be no otherwise amenable than as the brute : he may commit a trespass like the ox , but the master must assume the responsibility of the trespass . And here let us remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders of those who claim the control of the acts of slaves ? and . when a man presumes to take this control , does he not in effect say , let the punishment of his crimes rest on me and my children ? We think so . But , whatever may be thought on this subject , we can not but suppose the men of that age perceived the inconsistency of thus blending the character of the man with the brute , and the slender thread that held slavery together ; and that , if justice once prevailed in the courts , it would bring an end to the whole system . We shall shortly see that it was expected such might take place ; and strong objections were made to the Constitution on this very ground ,  --  that our judiciary would be called on for a decision in the case . As a number of years has passed away , we hope the time is now fast approaching , when a better understanding on this subject will be more generally diffused , and a more correct idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this government was adopted instilled , not only in the minds of our Northern people , but in those of the South ; or perhaps we should rather say , when the mind of this people can be brought back to contemplate and carry out the doctrines on which the revolution of this country was brought about , and for which , as the preamble of /z/ our Constitution expressly declares , that instrument was given to the country to secure . We do trust there will be a different action on this subject , and oar colored brother may take courage . Let him remember no exception was made to him ,  --  not a word left on the records : but the doctrines of those days applied to him equally with the white man ; and , though he may have been looked upon with feelings of disrespect , of cupidity , and of avarice , and as a being over whom they could lord it unrestrained , yet , in the main , a better feeling bore sway : some felt , with deep commiseration , his unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper feeling as regarded his situation , and succeeded in establishing principles which , we trust , will not only work out his salvation from political and slavish bondage , but every individual , of whatever color or complexion he may be , who may happen to come within the borders of the United States , or step a foot on the shores of America . When it can be said of this land , as it is now said of Britain ,  --  " Slaves can not breathe in England ; if their lungs Receive our air , that moment they are free : They touch our country , and their shackles fall , "  --  when such shall be the case , then will the true idea , which apparently actuated the men who have spent their exertions in the cause of liberty and of freedom , be established ; then will that glorious day be ushered in , which has been looked forward to with such anxiety by those who have the we.lfare of mankind at heart , and who have , in /z/ all ages , distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us consider , if slavery should be abolished in this country , it undoubtedly would soon be in all parts of the world . Let but America use the same determination to put a stop to slavery that England is now doing , and the traffic in slaves and the using of slave labor would soon cease in every land . /z/ The proceedings in this State , as well as those in Massachusetts , are highly interesting . The members who composed these two conventions were among the most distinguished men of the land . It undoubtedly was through the influence of these men that the Constitution was brought forward , and finally adopted . They appear to have taken extensive and enlarged views on the science of government , and to have weighed , with as much exactness as appeared in their power , the various evils and advantages to be feared and to be derived from the adoption of that instrument . History was ransacked for examples and for similitudes ; objections to former governments were pointed out , and , if possible , were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanned with eagle eyes ; no point escaped their observation . The bearing of its different provisions was looked into , its implied powers were commented on with a great deal of ability , and no stone appeared to be left unturned that seemed , in any manner , to conceal a grant that would invest too /z/ much power in the hands of those who should be called upon to govern . They seemed to be conscious they were legislating , not for themselves alone , but for posterity ,  --  for millions yet unborn . In the convention of Virginia , the discussion extended over a wide field . Patrick Henry took a part in opposition to the Constitution : he exerted his utmost eloquence to prevent its adoption ; he thought it was fraught with evil ; he was fearful it would result in a monarchy ; he thought there was too much power given to the executive , the legislature , and the courts ; he thought the Confederation was good enough , that the States and the country were getting along well enough , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights ; he was anxious they should not relinquish those rights to a federal head ; but they should depend on themselves , rather than on external powers for government . In fact , he seemed to think all government was a necessary evil : he therefore was jealous , extremely so , of any authority , either expressed or implied ; and he kept that convention in a continued ferment and discussion upon the various principles involved in the instrument proposed for their adoption . Marshall . Madison , Randolph , Grayson , Nicholason , Mason , and others , put forth their utmost powers , either in support of , or in opposition to , the views entertained by Mr. Henry . Their discussions were consequently long and arduous ; they , however , were full of interest , as they show very distinctly the character and feel- /z/ ings of the men of that age . In these we find strength , firmness , uprightness , consistency , and inconsistency ; a desire to do right , and yet a fearful want of faith to do it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeterminateness whether they should perform their duty or not . Like Felix of old , they trembled ; and yet they wished to put off the day of repentance to a more distant period . On the subject of slavery , they seemed to be well aware of its utter inconsistency with their professions , and the laws they would make ; it was on this subject alone that the sincerity of their acts can be called in question . They thought themselves , or at least pretended they were , placed between two fires , and that it was dangerous to advance , or retreat . The same honest or dishonest , real or pretended , fears that exist at the present day were manifested ; consequently , many of the Southern as well as the Northern delegates wished things to remain as they were , and let time work out a cure . But , fearing the love of liberty was too strong , and that there was a power in embryo , that , if this instrument went into operation , would lay their fancied possessions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy by those who did not wish to have the relation of master and slave destroyed . The powers of the courts were scanned and commented on ; and , from what we can gather , the opposition made by Mr. Henry to this tribunal was because , in part , he feared what might be its decision , if the case of the slave was brought before /z/ it for adjudication . But , because a slave was taxed but as three fifths of a man , one thought congress viewed them as property , and not as persons , and consequently they might escape . But , as the convention would not allow the slave to be represented till his humanity was allowed , and as no legislature can turn a man into a brute , or a brute into a man , or can convert the soul of man into a chattel personal , into a thing without life or motion , so , whatever any body of men may say respecting him . he yet remains the same : he is ruled by the same spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally morally responsible to him for his conduct , and , as was remarked , equally so to human tribunals ; and , if he violated the laws of society in any of its moral aspects , he was liable to be brought before their courts for judgment . If this is so . does not the consequence follow , that , to all intents and purposes , he must be considered a man , and , before human tribunals , must be considered and treated as such ? Xo sophistry can blind the eyes to this fact ; and , if a man , he must be regarded as such both by our laws and our Constitution , possessing all the privileges man can possess , where no distinction is pointed out , and where none was meant to be pointed out . In presenting the reader the following extracts , we were in doubt whether it would not have been better to classify them , putting each under separate heads or chapters ; but , on the whole , as there were but four points to be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the i /z/ courts ,  --  2d . Those which explain the general powers of congress ,  --  3d . Those which immediately speak of slavery ,  --  4th . Those that have reference to the object for which the Constitution was formed , in regard to the liberty of the individual ; or rather the determination of the people that no Constitution should be formed that put the liberty of the individual in danger  --  the intelligent reader might perceive , at once , to which subject the extract belonged , and could apply it without being told ; and it might be as well to pursue the course adopted , of going through with each convention in its order , and afterwards draw up a summary of the whole , and lay it as distinctly before him as possible ; and then he might be able to judge of the conclusion as if a different course was pursued . We consider each and all of the above as great questions , and of vital importance to the community , and which should be decided . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon their decision his individual rights , under the Constitution , may , or may not , be invaded . For if the rights of one individual , no matter whether he be white or black , can be taken from him , and that for no crime the man can be restrained as a slave , then may the rights of all , on the same principle , be taken away : no man is safe , no man can be safe . So far as individuals are concerned , the Constitution is a dead letter ; its principles do not apply to them ; they are to be recognized as in communities , as States ; and the States , and indi- /z/ vidnals of the State , if the Constitutions of the States say nothing to the contrary , may enslave as few or many of their people as they may choose . Is this so ? We think not . These assertions might have applied , in some measure , to the Confederation : but they can not be applied under the present arrangement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the individual ; and , if the community , or the State , or individuals of the State , invade his rights , the Constitution steps in , or should step in , to restore them . What say the arguments of the gentlemen in Virginia who adopted it ? We shall see . In the convention of Virginia , Mr. Henry asked what right the national convention had to use the words " we the people . " l Governor Randolph answered him by saying , " It was for the people the government was formed ; " " in the Confederation they had no voice . " 2 Mr. Pendleton , in answer to Mr. Henry , among other observations , said ,  --  " What was it that brought us from a state of nature to society but to secure happiness ? and can society be formed without government ? personify government , apply to it as a friend to assist you , and it will grant your request . This is the only government founded in real compact . There is no quarrel between government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter . The war is between government and licentiousness , factions , turbulence , and other violations of the rules of society , to preserve liberty . Where is /z/ the cause of alarm ? .... In the same plan we point out an easy and quiet method to amend what may be found amiss . " ' Further on he says ,  --  " But objection is made to the form ; the expression , ' We the people , ' is thought improper . Permit me to ask the gentleman who made this objection , who but the people can delegate powers ? Who but the people have a right to form government ? The expression is a common one , and a favorite one with me ; the representatives of the people , by their authority , is a mode wholly inessential . If the objection be , that the union ought to be not of the people , but of the State governments , then I think the choice of the former very happy and proper . What have the State governments to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , in that case , be judges upon what terms it was adopted . " He then went on to show the imbecility of the Confederation , and the superiority of the Constitution over that in its effective character in forming peace , and in declaring war , and he concluded by saying , " For his part he was well satisfied with this part of the system , " including in his remarks the representatives of the States , meaning the senate . Mr. Lee , of Westmoreland , spoke in favor of using the expression , " we the people , " and he thought the house of representatives would be like the house of commons , in the year 1782 , who resisted the will of the crown , and be able to protect our liberties . 2 /z/ Mr. Henry made quite a speech in answer , portions of which will be found among the extracts taken from his life , so far as relates to this subject . His whole speech turned on securing the individual and State rights ; he was fearful of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the powers of the president . But he wished for the union . His first wish was for American liberty , and his second , for American union ; " and he concluded his remarks by saying , " May you be fully apprized of the dangers of the latter , not by fatal experience , but by some abler advocate than I. " Gov . Randolph , in answer to Mr. Henry , who thought the country was in peace , and there was no reason to alter the government , said ,  --  " There is no peace in this land ; can peace exist with injustice , licentiousness , insecurity , and oppression ? These considerations , independent of many others which I have not yet enumerated , would be a sufficient reason for the adoption of this Constitution , because it secures the liberty of the citizen , his person , and property , and will invigorate and restore commerce and industry . " He went on in a long speech , giving his reasons why Virginia should adopt the Constitution , on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , and the other States who had already adopted the Constitution , and from the slaves , which he said at that time " bore the immense proportion of 236,000 slaves to 352,000 whites/ ' He was very eloquent in urging his reasons for the adoption of the Constitution . Mr. Randolph , an- /z/ doubtedly , had some desire the Constitution should be adopted because a greater power would be- at command to suppress an insurrection of slaves , though we have no evidence but that he might have wished their individual freedom . Mr. Madison , in answer to the objections made by Mr. Henry , respecting the consolidation of the government proposed to be adopted , said ,  --  " Give me leave to say something of the nature of the government , and to show it is safe and just to vest it with the power of taxation . There are a number of opinions , - but the principal question is , whether it be a federal or a consolidated government . In order to judge properly of the question before us we must consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is of a mixed nature ; it is in a manner unprecedented ; we can not find one express example in the history of the world ; it stands by itself . In some respects it is a government of a federal nature ; in others , it is of a consolidated nature . Even if we attend to the manner in which the Constitution is investigated , ratified , and made the act of the people of America , I can say , notwithstanding what the honorable gentleman has alleged , that this government is not completely consolidated , nor is it entirely federal . Who are parties to it ? The people ; but not the people as composing one great body , but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties . Were it , as the gentleman asserts , a consolidated government , the assent of the majority of the people would be sufficient for its establishment ; and , as a majority have adopted it already , the remaining States would be bound by the act of the majority , even if they unanimously reprobated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be now binding on the people of this State , without having /z/ the privilege of debating upon it ; but , sir , no State is bound by it , as it is , without its own consent . Should all the States adopt it , it will then be a government established by the thirteen States of America , not through the intervention of the legislatures , but by the people at large . In this particular respect the distinction between the present and proposed government is very material . The existing system has been derived from the dependent derivative authority of the legislatures of the States ; whereas this is derived from the superior power of the people . If we look at the manner alterations are to be made in it , the same idea is in some degree attended to . By the new system , a majority of the States can not introduce amendments ; nor are all the Stales required for that purpose ; three fourths of them must concur in amendments : in this there is a departure from the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chosen by the people at large , in proportion to the numbers in the representative district . When we come to the senate its members are elected by the States in their equal and political capacity ; but had the government been completely consolidated , the senate would have been chosen by the people in their individual capacity , in the same manner as the members of the other house . Thus it is of a complicated nature ; and this complication , I trust , will be found to exclude the evils of absolute consolidation , as well as a mere confederacy . If Virginia was separated from all the States , her authority would extend to all cases : in like manner , were all power vested in the general government , it would be a consolidated government ; but the powers of the general government are enumerated ; it can only operate in certain cases ; it has legislative powers on defined and limited objects , beyond which it can not extend its jurisdiction . " ' /z/ Mr. Corbin , in answer to Mr. Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the expression " we the people , " and of its powers of direct taxation , and of its nature to secure the liberties of the country and of the people , says ,  --  ' - 'What power is given that will endanger liberty ? I consider all of the traits of this system as having a tendency- to the security of our liberty . " l He also spoke of the distracted state of the country , particularly in other States , and the ease with which Virginia herself might be convulsed . On . the request of Mr. Henry , Gov . Randolph concluded his remarks on the divided state of the country , and the necessity of adopting the Constitution . " The debts of the country must be paid . We were much in debt to Europe , and we were unable to pay . " Rhode Island , it appeared , had resisted many of the laws of the Confederation , and he thought the powers given were not too great . " Go through these powers , examine every one , and tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press is in danger . The trial by jury is supposed to be in danger also . It is secured in criminal cases , but supposed to be taken away in civil cases . It is not relinquished by the Constitution ; it is only not provided for . Look at the interest of congress to suppress it . Can it be in any manner advantageous for them to suppress it ? In equitable cases it ought not to prevail , nor with respect to admirality causes , because there will be an undue leaning against those characters of /z/ whose business courts of admiral ity will have cognizance . I will rest myself secure under this reflection , that it is impossible that the most suspicious or malignant mind to show that it is the interest of congress to infringe on this trial by jury . " l In continuing his remarks , in answer to Mr. Henry 's objections , which , by the way , he thought very unreasonable , he said ,  --  " He would take notice of what the honorable gentleman had said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The meaning of this clause has been perverted to alarm our apprehensions . The whole clause has not been read together . It enables " congi to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises ; to pay the debts , and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts , and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States . " The plain and obvious meaning of this is , that no more duties , taxes , imposts , and excises shall be laid than are sufficient to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the nited States . " This same opinion we have seen advanced by the Hon. John Q , . Adams . Here is a metaphysical distinction we have not yet been able to perceive . Whatever is for the general welfare , it would seem by the expression , it would be in the power of congress to adopt ; but this is denied . It is said ,  --  if we understand the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others that will in this work , respecting the trial by jury , partly because tlii subject has been considerably agitated in this community , and to huw how jealous the men of that age were on this subject . /z/ gentlemen ,  --  that the powers of congress is in laying the tax ; and , after getting the money in its possession , it must then be spent for the general welfare , &c.; Nothing is said about the purpose for which the tax is to be raised . This question of raising a tax is the one we should suppose would be the last to be answered . The first , what is for the general welfare ? This having been determined on , then comes the power of taxation to pay for it . Or shall it be said we must first raise the money , and after getting it in our possession , we may then look for objects for the general welfare on which to expend it . True , a great diversity of opinions might be entertained on the subject of the general welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general welfare ; it was put down on the same principle , not because it was unconstitutional , for the putting of it down was called an " experiment : " and we have been inclined to think it was an experiment well worth trying . Internal improvement is another instance , and the Cumberland road has been laid out , and yet neither of these powers are expressly granted , though it has been said the establishing either of them is unconstitutional . But they are objected to rather on the ground that the general welfare is better promoted by letting the currency be regulated by individuals , and internal improvements be carried forward by the same means , greater economy , safety , &c.; being secured ; or it is said the government , in carrying out the general welfare of the community , requires these several /z/ agents to perform with facility its operations ; and therefore these agents are introduced , not because they are any benefit to individuals , having no immediate connection with the government , but because the government , in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what is meant , and yet we see not how , in establishing a navy , a post-office , in making a road , in granting patents , &c.; &c.; the general welfare is not first consulted , and the tax laid to pay the expense incurred for carrying into operation these several objects . The power , to us , seems to be granted for the government , in the first place , to see what is for the general welfare ; and , having decided what may be for that welfare , then she has the power of laying a tax to carry the object into execution . The power of laying a tax was a secondary power , but a necessary one , to carry the former power into execution : the former power being of no avail without the latter , they certainly were not granted the power of taxing the people for no object ; but , if they had an object , that object must first be ascertained . It was , for instance , asserted it would be for the general welfare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government was established , it had the power of taxation to pay the officers who should administer it . There could have been no power to tax the people before the people had established a government , unless it had been an usurped power . The granting power to the general government to consult for the general /z/ welfare and the security of liberty , does not grant them the power , as has been asserted , of doing any thing and every thing they might wish , whether their actions resulted in evil or not ; but their consultations should be- confined to the general welfare , and in protecting individual liberty . But , in performing these acts , they should not interfere with the liberty of speech and of the press , with conscience in religious affairs , &c.; &c.; ; and no person should be seized in his person , papers , and effects , &c.; without due process of law . If we are here correct , we can not see how the general welfare and taxation can well be separated , or the distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Mr. Randolph , in his closing remarks , seems to catch at this idea . Mr. R. then went on and asked ,  --  " What would be the consequences , if the government had not this power ? Why , you would give it the power with one hand , and take it away with the other ; and , had not this power have been given , his affection for it would not have been so great . When it obliges us to tread in the path of virtue , when it takes from the most influential man the power of directing our passions for bis own emolument , and of trampling on justice , I hope to be excused when I say that , were it more objectionable than it is , I would vote for the Union . " " Mr. Munroe said he could not help expressing the anxiety which he felt on the occasion , not only from the importance of the subject , but from the profound respect he felt for this august and venerable assembly , meaning the Virginia convention ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remark of the similarity of the proposed // government to those republics that had gone before . There were none , he thought , resembled this , but the Achsean league ; and he read several passages from Polybius , tending to elucidate and prove the excellences of the structure of that league , and that it was not destroyed by any internal commotions , but by external foes , and at last by being swallowed up by the Roman empire . He did not think we at all resembled Holland , the Swiss , or the confederacy of Athens , Thebes , and Sparta ; and , consequently , our policy must be different . " ' He seemed to think , when the country became settled to the Mississippi , it would be too great for a republic . His expression was , " It is too extensive to be governed but by a despotic monarchy . n His opinion must have been changed when he was president , and realized he was presiding over this country , and found it not only settled as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ideas must have been much greater , had he have come to the conclusion that there was no necessity for any human government whatever ,  --  that mankind were so far willing to subject themselves to the laws of God , that they needed no human restraint . " We could sincerely hope and pray that such may be the case . But , after all , we can not perceive how society can get along without laws , rules , or regulations , for its government ; and , if it has them , they must have sanctions . God has a government and has sanctions : must man , or must he not , imitate him in this particular ? But to return : Mr. M. thought we stood in no /z/ danger of external foes : he thought they were too far distant , separated as we are from them by the Atlantic : and already different nations of Europe manifested a desire for peace , and were ready to make treaties with us ; and that they would not unreasonably call for their claims they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without danger , calmly adopt such a system of government as would be best adapted for the country . He then proceeded to take a comparative view of the Confederacy and of the Constitution , and divided his subject into two heads ,  --  1st , the form , 2d , the powers , of the government . He considered the present system  --  the Confederacy  --  defective in both these respects . He asked , . " Is the Confederacy a bond of union sufficiently strong to bring the States together ? Is it possessed of sufficient power to enable it to manage the affairs of the Union ? Is it well organized , safe , and proper ? I confess that in all these instances I consider it as defective : I consider it void of energy , and badly organized . " He then asked , " What are the powers which the federal government ought to have ? and said , to the former he would give control over the national affairs , and to the latter he would leave the care of local interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He would give the federal government one great power ,  - -  absolute control over commerce ,  --  and take away from it the power of direct taxation . He thought on this latter subject the general government /z/ would interfere with the States , and that revenue enough could be raised from lands and imposts , or loans , for all the purposes of government . He thought congress could not discriminate over so great a territory as to lay direct taxes , that would be satisfactory to the people . " He was also in favor of a bill of rights ,  --  " the polar star and great support of American liberty . " He thought that , by giving congress all powers to make laws to carry into operation the powers granted , they might take away the trial by jury : " there were no limits pointed out . " " They are not restrained or controlled from making any law , however oppressive in its operation , which they may think necessary to carry their laws into effect . By this general , unqualified power they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every right that is not expressly secured , or excepted from the general power . I conceive that such general powers are very dangerous . Our great , inalienable rights ought to be secured from being destroyed by such unlimited powers , either by a bill of rights , or by express provisions in the Constitution . It is immaterial in which of these two modes rights are secured . " He alluded to the divisions of power in the Roman republic and in Great Britain ; but he could see no real check in this Constitution . He thought the power of the president too great , and that he could secure his constant reelection ; and that the senate , combined with the ' president , would destroy the legislative influence of the States ; and concluded , under his present impres- /z/ sions , he thought it a dangerous government , and calculated neither to secure the interests nor the rights of our countrymen . And under such a government he should be adverse to embark the best hopes and prospects of a free people . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we enjoy our present security ' . Why , then , this haste , this wild precipitancy ? Mr. Madison , in answer , spoke of the " inefficiency of the federal government , " of its " inability to pay the debts " of the country , and " to fulfil its treaties , " and " of the contempt with which foreign nations were treating us ; " of the " refractory conduct of some of the States ; " of their not " paying " the quota of money which they ought ; and of the manner in which the country were borrowing money to pay even the interest of what she owed ; of the ruinous manner of conducting so ; of the necessity of their altering their form of government , and that Washington had acknowledged there was a necessity for so doing , and that the Confederacy had , from the first , proved defective . Mr. Henry , in reply to Mr. Madison , went on at great length , and said ,  --  " He saw not the evils that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well governed as any other ; he referred to the Swiss Cantons , to the United Netherlands , the height of power and riches to which these had attained . He explained , as a reason why we /z/ had not paid our debts , was because we had been loo extravagant , what would he have thought if he had lived in these days ! and that by industry and economy these debts could be paid ; he saw no danger of the States remaining out of the Union till amendments could be adopted ; he drought that Massachusetts , by adopting the Constitution , and then recommending amendments , had put the cart before the horse . He alluded to the observation that the civil power was defective ; he knew not that it was so ; that there were instances where men had been guilty of very great crimes , and , in consequence , put themselves out of the pale of civilized treatment , and referred to a person ' who had been punished by an tost facto law . He spoke of the Constitution as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , the power it possessed over the militia and the army , its several arsenals , of its uniting the sword and the purse , of the corruption that might take place among the representatives and senators , and the federal court , particularly when the freedom of the citizen should come in opposition to the laws of congress . He treated the lanation given by Mr. Madison of the mixed nature of the government ( as we shall give in another place ) with ridicule , and concluded by saying he should not give his sanction to that instrument ; he , however , desired a union of the States , but not of the kind proposed . It was not the kind of government for which the American people had effected a revolution ; it was not for making a. great government , but for individual freedom they had contended . He said gentlemen may retain their opinions , but I shall look on that paper ( meaning the Constitution ) as the most fatal plan that could possibly be Josiah Phillip was the man alluded to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " i Virginia in a very shun time after he committed the act for which he was attainted. /z/ conceived to enslave a free people ! If such be your rage for novelty , take it and welcome ; but you shall not have my consent . " Mr. Henry , in his opening remarks , observed , all governments were a necessary evil , and he alluded to the ten miles square as being an attractive object to some minds ; as if he thought that there were some in the country who were anxious to secure to themselves some high station in the government , and , for that reason , were anxious to change the form of government from a confederacy to such a government as was proposed , because it would open the door for a greater number of offices . Whether such ideas entered into the minds of those who formed the Constitution we can not say ; but offices in these days appear to be very attractive . In the increase of our army , and the alarming proposition to have the militia of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to spread slavery , and in the assertion that the Constitution guarantees slavery , or , which in effect is the same thing , that we have prevented the government from abolishing it , or provided no way by which it could be abolished , and at the same time have agreed to suppress insurrections ,  - -  should we not take alarm , and see that the liberties of this country are not lost ; and may we not see , in the servility with which many members of congress bow to the influence of slavery , cause to take warning ? We think we should , and should bear in mind those observations made by Mr. Henry . /z/ What could induce northern members of congress to gag the mouths of their own constituents but this desire for office , and this unholy influence , that slavery , the withholding the individual freedom of so large a portion of the inhabitants of our country , has so blinded the eyes of those that remain free they are beginning to lose sight , of those principles on which true liberty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak as Mr. Henry here does of individual rights ,  --  that the object of the revolution was not for making a " great government/ ' but to secure " individual freedom , " when he himself was a slaveholder , and opposed the Constitution in some of its parts , because in its effect it might destroy the power of the master , and which he feared would take away his supremacy ? It seems impossible to explain such a course of proceeding ; and it can not be explained , unless you admit the colored people , in his eyes , were no people ; and yet he did not think so . No ! it must be put down to man 's inconsistency , or , as he himself said , because he really feared true liberty would be endangered by letting the colored man enjoy the same advantages the white man did ; he thought they would take advantage of their liberty and become licentious . Mr. Lee , of Westmoreland , answered Mr. Henry : he defended the Constitution ; he referred to Shays 's rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of other circumstances , to show there ought to be a change in the government , and that those who desired it were as anxious /z/ for liberty as those who opposed its adoption . He thought the idea of corruption in congress , and in the courts , imaginary ; that the people had reserved to themselves all their important rights ; that the Constitution was so constructed that " the rulers of the people were vested with certain defined powers , and that what was not delegated to those rulers was retained by the people ; that the consequence of this was , that the limited powers were only an exception to those that were vested in the people ; that they knew what they had given up , and could be in no danger . " l What are these rights , of which Mr. Lee speaks , that are retained by the people ? certainly not the rights of the States , for he speaks of the rights of the people . We can form no idea of any other rights than those of which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of which every man is possessed , and which the people , in forming their government , retained : it was not the liberty of the States of which he spoke . Gov . Randolph also spoke in answer to Mr. Henry in defence of the Constitution . He alluded to what Mr. Henry had said in regard to Holland and Switzerland ; he thought his objections and comparisons were not correct ; and , though he had objections which he had given in a public letter , and which we have , in part , quoted in another place , yet he was anxious to have the Constitution /z/ adopted , because it would secure the liberties of the people . He said the coercive power of the Confederation was totally void , and that the people had long been convinced of it , and that this conviction was manifest to the world ; that the general government ought to be vested with powers competent to our safety , or else the necessary consequence must be that we shall be defenceless . " Wc are told , in strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless we adopt this Constitution . Among the rest , domestic safety is said to be in danger . This government does not attend to our domestic safety . It authorizes the importation of slaves for twenty-one years , and thus continues upon us that nefarious trade . Instead of securing and protecting us , the continuance of this detestable trade adds daily to our weakness . Though this evil is increasing , there is no clause in the Constitution that will prevent the Northern and Eastern States from meddling with our whole property of that kind . There is a clause to prohibit the importation of slaves after twenty years , but there is no provision made for securing to the Southern Stales those they now possess . It is far from being a desirable properly , but it will involve us in great difficulty and infelicity to be now deprived of them . There ought to be a clause in the Constitution to secure us that property which we have acquired under former laws , and the loss of which would bring ruin on a great many people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments . Mr. Randolph here says expressly there is " no clause in the Constitution " to prevent the /z/ Northern and Eastern States from meddling with " their whole property , " and " that there was no provision made for securing to the Southern States those they " then " possessed . " The subject was left open , and , no doubt , intentionally so by many . Mr. Lee even finds fault with Mr. Randolph for making these objections , and points out to him his inconsistency : he seemed to think it right and proper that this property should be interfered with . We hope and trust there are a good many Virginians who yet think the North has a right to meddle with slavery , and that they will not think it necessary much longer to hold their peace , but will join the North in their endeavors to scout the abomination from their State , and redeem it from the foul disgrace which the practices of the slaveholder and the slavebreeder are bringing upon it . It will be perceived the inconsistency of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is equally beyond our power to explain , unless it may be ascribed to what he calls the " infelicity " of doing without their slaves ; in other words , though they liked liberty themselves , they were too great lovers of their own ease to labor . Mr. Lee , of Westmoreland , speaking of Mr. Randolph 's speech , says ;  --  " The honorable gentleman abominates it , the Constitution , because it does not prohibit the importation of slaves , and because it does not secure the continuance of the existing slavery ! Is it not obviously inconsistent to criminate it for two contradictory reasons ? 1 submit it to the consideration of the gentleman whether , , if it be /z/ reprehensible in the one case , it can be censurable in the other ? " ' Mr. Grayson observed .  --  " They have the candor to acknowledge that taxes on slaves would not aiTect the Eastern States , and that taxes on fish and potash would not affect the Southern States . They are then reduced to this dilemma . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counteract the first maxim of representation . The best writers on this subject lay it down as a fundamental principle , that he who lays a tax shall bear his proportion of paying it . ' 1 ' Will not the logic here hold good , that he who makes a law shall help bear its burden ; and . consequently , any laws in which the slaves have no voice can not be binding on the slave : and , as a further consequence , that all such law r s must be a nullity , void from the moment ( if it will not be considered an Irishism ) of their enactment , and of no rightful force , no one who was not permitted to have a voice , either pro or con in their promulgation , being at all bound by them ? We take it so ; and consequently these writers , on whom Mr. Grayson relies for authority , would consider American slavery to be upheld alone by the right of the strongest , and not by any equitable laws ; and no laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless they relate to morals , and then not because they are the laws of man , but of God . Mr. Pendleton , in answer to some of Mr. Henry 's remarks , observed ,  --  /z/ " On the subject of government , the worthy member and I differ at the threshold . I think government necessary to protect liberty ; he supposes the American spirit all-sufficient for the purpose . What say the most respectable writers ,  --  Montesquieu , Locke , Sidney , Ha rrington , &c.; ? They have presented us with no such idea . They properly discard from their system all the severity of cruel punishments , such as tortures , inquisitions , and the like ,  --  shocking to human nature , and only calculated to coerce the dominion of tyrants over slaves . But they recommend making the ligaments of government firm , and a rigid execution of the laws as more necessary than in monarchy , to preserve that virtue which they all declare to be the pillar on which the government and liberty , its object , must stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever did , or ever will , exist a society , however large their aggregate fund of virtue may be , but hath among them persons of a turbulent nature , restless in themselves , and disturbing the peace of others ,  --  sons of rapine and violence , who , unwilling to labor themselves , are watching every opportunity to snatch from the industrious peasant the fruits of his honest labor . Was I not then correct in my inference that such a government and liberty were friends and allies , and that their common enemy was turbulence , faction , and violence ? They are those , therefore , who will be affected by good government ; and for those , I suppose , no gentleman will profess himself an advocate . The writers just mentioned point out licentiousness as the natural offspring of liberty , and that , therefore , all free governments should endeavor to suppress it , or else it will overthrow that liberty of which it is the result . Is this speculation only ? Alas , reason and experience too fatally prove its truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science . It turns the bent /z/ of it to eloquence , as a qualification for the representative character , which is , as it ought to he , the road to our public offices . I have already the pleasure of beholding these characters already produced in our councils , and a rising fund equal to a constant demand . May Heaven prosper their endeavors , and direct their eloquence to the real good of their country ! I am unfortunate enough to differ rather say fortunate from the worthy member in another circumstance . He professes himself an advocate for the middling and lower classes of men . I profess to be a friend to the equal liberty of all vicn , from the palace to the cottage , without any other distinction than between good and bad men . " ' After speaking much in favor of the Constitution , though he did not think it perfect , and was glad that amendments had been proposed , he observed , as it had been proposed to make these the sine qua non of the acceptance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution ,  --  those States would say ,  --  " No , gentlemen , we can not accept your conditions . You put yourself on the ground of opposition . Your amendments are dictated by local considerations . We , in our acceptance , have been influenced by general utility to the Union . We can not abandon principles like these to gratify you . Thus , sir , by previous amendments , we present a hostile countenance . If , on the contrary , we imitate the conduct of those States , our language will be conciliatory and friendly . Gentlemen , we put ourselves on the same ground you are on . We are not actuated by local considerations , but by such /z/ as affect the people of America in general . This conduct will give our amendments full weight . " ' He then alluded to a letter written by Mr. Jefferson to one of the delegates , in which he expressed a wish that nine of the States would accept of the Constitution , that the good that might be derived from it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it " until ; ' " amendments " should be secured . But , by having this division , he hoped there would be no " schism " in the Union ; and then concluded by saying ,  --  " The Constitution points out a plain and obvious method of reform , without any disturbance or convulsions whatever , I therefore think we ought to ratify it , in order to secure the union , and trust to this method for removing those inconsiste ? icies which experience shall point out . " These observations of Mr. Pendleton 's before a body of slaveholders , before men whose whole course of action was one of systematic " snatching from the industrious peasant the fruit of his honest labor , " must have been severe . If we can judge what would be the consequence if such observations were now made before a body of slaveholders , from the manner they have of late exhibited their character , any thing but pleasant results would follow . Plainness of speech in those clays was not considered as unbecoming men in good society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever may have been their other faults ; and we think Mr. Henry and Mr. Randolph must have felt the rebuke here given . It appears , /z/ also , he was glad amendments had been proposed ; but he thought Virginia should do as Massachusetts and the other States had done ,  --  adopt the Constitution as it was , and then prepare their amendments . He thought by telling the other States that , unless they adopted their amendments , they would not give their sanction to the Constitution , it would appeal  --  as undoubtedly it would have done  --  " like dictation ; " and perhaps also he did not altogether like the amendments which the convention proposed , being , as he said , " a friend to the liberty of all men , " " without any other distinction than between good and bad men ; " and the amendments prepared by the convention had inserted the word " freemen , " in speaking of rights to be enjoyed under the Constitution , by which a distinction would have been made between a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been desirous that distinction should not be made in the Constitution ; and we shall find it was not . Mr. Henry , speaking of the requisition to be made for troops by the United States , and that they would be apportioned according to the number of " blacks " as well as " whites , " asked , " how oppressive and dangerous must this be to the South , who alone have slaves ? This will render their proportion infinitely greater than that of the Northern States . It has been openly avowed this shall be the rule . I will appeal to the judgment of the committee , whether there be danger . " 1 /z/ It is mortifying to see and know how completely the North has been taken in , in all her attempts to secure herself from the effects of slavery . Patrick Htmry here thought this call for men to defend the country would require a much larger proportion of the white men of the South than of the North ; and , if men for our army and navy were raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found , by the burden it would have put on their shoulders , to have been too great for them . But the course pursued is , no requisitions are now made ; most , if not all , of our army and navy are composed of volunteers , and of northern men . The southerners , accustomed to be masters , are too lazy to " do the drudgery of an army ; even the defence of their own territory falls on northern men . And when , from the nature of the case , their presence is thought to be absolutely necessary , as in the case of the Florida war , they refuse to do the ordinary work of soldiers ; such , for instance , as carrying their own provisions . We are surprised any of our northern men will do it for them ,  - -  consent to be their lackeys , merely for the sake of laying their bones among the everglades of that Territory ; for there seems to be no other object : at least , none other has as yet been attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his late speech in congress , has said , this whole war was nothing but a negro hunt . We trust our northern people will not be seen as soldiers in company with such a banditti , whoever may be their captain-general. /z/ Mr. Henry , speaking of the power to call forth the militia , said ,  --  " The lOih section of the 1st article , to which . reference lias been made by the worthy member , ( Mr. Grayson , ) militates against himself . It says , ' No State shall engage in war , unless actually invaded . ' If the country be invaded , a Slate may go to war , but can not suppress insurrections . If there should happen lo be an insurrection of slaves , the country can not be said to be invaded . They can not therefore suppress it , without the interposition of congress . The 4th section of the 4th article expressly directs that , in case of domestic violence , congress should protect the State , on application of the legislature or executive ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call forth the militia to quiet insurrections . There can not , therefore , be a concurrent power . The State legislatures ought to have the power to call forth the efforts of the militia when necessary . Occasions for calling them out may be urgent , pressing , and instantaneous . The States can not now call them , let an insurrection be ever so perilous , without an application to congress : so long a delay may be fatal . " " There are three clauses which prove , beyond a possibility of a doubt , that congress , and congress only , can call forth the militia . The clause giving congress power to call them out to suppress insurrections , &c.; that which restrains a State from engaging in war , except when actually invaded , and that which requires congress to protect the States against domestic violence , render it impossible that a State can have power to intermeddle with them . " 1 It would appear Mr. Henry thought that con- /z/ congress had taken from the States all power to suppress an insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true as regards the power of a State to suppress an insurrection of its inhabitants , yet it is true that , when and consequently can it be said the subject of slavery is sectional , not national ? that the States have alone the right to legislate on the subject ? Such a supposition can not be true . Congress must have control over the subject , unless it be said , and with truth , that the States have a right to involve the country in a civil war , by their practices and laws , without any national interference . Will any statesman say that this may be the case ? We think not . So long as each and every part of the country alike are bound to suppress an insurrection of slaves , so long do we hold it that slavery is a national affair ; and the North may not now hide herself , under the idea that she has no concern with the subject . An acquaintance with our history would- make it apparent that such an attempt on her part would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued , and finds she can not escape , or being unwilling to be the witness of her own disgrace , thinks to evade her pursuers , or be shielded from mortification , by hiding her head under a leaf , or other small substance , while her whole body is left exposed to attacks . And , also , all of the new States have come into the Union through the consent of the old States ; and now , after giving their consent /z/ they should enter the Union , have they now no farther control , or are they not implicated in the system of slavery , if they will now tolerate it ? can they guarantee to the different States they will protect them from an internal insurrection of slaves , and yet put it out of their power to say aught against this system ? If it is so , it is in effect guaranteeing , as has been said , the system of slavery . But this they have not done . Mr. Madison , in answer to Mr. Henry , in his supposition congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a powerful check in that paper . The State governments are to govern the militia , when not called forth for general or national purposes , and congress is to govern such part only as may be in the actual service of the Union . Nothing can be more certain and positive than this . It expressly empowers congress to govern them when in the actual service of the United States . It . is then clear that Stales govern them when they are not . " With respect to suppressing insurrections , I say that these clauses , when they are mentioned by the honorable gentleman , arc compatible with a concurrence of the power . By the first , congress is to call them forth to suppress insurrections and repel invasions by foreign powers . A concurrence in the former case is necessary , because a whole State may be in an insurrection against the Union . What has passed icill perhaps justify this apprehension . " ' After speaking of the invasion of foreign states , and even of a neighboring State , and of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , he says ,  --  " On application of the legislature or executive , as the case may be , the militia of the other States are to be called to suppress domestic insurrections . Does this bar the States from calling forth their own militia ? No ! but it gives them a supplementary security to suppress insurrections and domestic violence . " Mr. George Nicholas , in answer to Mr. Henry 's assertion that there was no power in the States to quell an insurrection of slaves , asked , " Have they it now ? If they have , does the Constitution take it away ? If it does , it must be in one of those clauses which have been mentioned by the worthy member . The first part , gives the general government power to call them out when necessary . Does this take it away from the States ? No ; but it gives an additional security ; for , besides the power in the State government to use their own militia , it will be the duty of the general government to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . No part of this Constitution can show that this power is taken away . " ' Let us not be deceived by the idle declamation , that , although we at the North are liable to be called upon to keep the slave in subjection , the slave so loves his master , and is so attached to his household , he would not rise in rebellion ; that he had rather wear his bonds than have them loosened from his limbs . This is not so : they are constantly running away ; and their taking shelter among the Indians in Florida has been /z/ the occasion of the Florida war , in which many of the men and ofiicers of our army have been sacrificed , and forty millions of dollars have been spent by the country . l On the same account the Cherokees have been removed from the land of their fathers , though nearly , if not quite , as civilized as those who desired their removal .

Are these things to be continued forever , and we say nothing about them ? Are the hardworking yeomanry of this latitude to be taken from their fields , their families , and their friends , to stand auard over the negro ?  --  the nearo did we say ? no ! the slave , we should have said , whether white or black ; for it makes no difference , at the South , of what complexion the slave is : so long as 1 In the Natchez Courier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of three months , seventt-six advertisements the recovery of persons , in Adams county alone in that State , who had ran away , or who had been committed to prison for so doing . /z/ the mother was a slave , the child must be a slave also . Must , then , the yeomanry of the North be sent to the South to keep the slave in subjection , merely to support a few rich nabobs in idleness ? Is our northern mother to bend with anxious solicitude over the cradle of her infant , and rejoice that a man child is born into the world , for no other purpose than that he may be reared with knapsack on his back , and firelock in hand , with bayonet fixed , ready to thrust it into a fellow-mortal , simply because his fellow does not wish to render an involuntary service to another without compensation , without pay ? Is this the purpose for which mankind are sent into the world ? is this the purpose for which the Constitution of these United States was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will answer no ! ay , even the South will answer no ! If , then , the whole strength of the military power of this Union is at any and at all times liable to be called into requisition to put down insurrections that may happen in any one of these United States , it would seem vfty strange if its moral and political power may not be put in requisition to prevent such a catastrophe , by rendering that justice that can alone produce peace and harmony in the relations which different portions of the body politic sustain to one another . It is idle for the South to say , as we think , the United States as a body can not interfere with slavery as it exists there , when she has it in her power to call upon that body to render any assistance she may ask to /z/ keep her slaves in subjection , and worse than idle r for the North to say she has nothing to do with slavery , when she is thus liable to be called upon . No ! the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so long as it exists in any one of the States , when the others are thus liable to be called on to maintain it , unless , as we shall attempt to show , she has provided means for every person in his individual capacity to attain his freedom . But , if he in his individual capacity can not , then she is bound to eive it . Mr. CJeorge Mason , in speaking of section 9th , which prevents congress from prohibiting the slave-trade for twenty years , said ,  --  " This is a fatal section , which has created more dangers than any other . The first clause allows the importation of slaves for twenty years . Under the royal government , this evil was looked upon as a great oppression , and many attempts were made to prevent it ; but the interest of the African merchant prevented its prohibition . No sooner did the Revolution take place than it was thought of . It was one of the great causes of our separation from Great Britain . Its exclusion has been a principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union . The augmentation of slaves weakens the States ; and such a trade is diabolical in itself , and disgraceful to mankind . Yet , by this Constitution , it is continued for twenty years . As much as I value the union of all the States , I would not admit the Southern Stales into the Union unless they agreed to the discontinuance of this disgraceful trade , because it would bring weakness , and not strength , to the Union . And , though this infamous traffic be continued , we have no /z/ security for the property of that kind which we have already . There is no clause to secure it ; for they may lay such a tax as will amount to manumission . And should this government be amended , still this detestable kind of commerce can not be discontinued till after the expiration of twenty years ; for the fifth article , which provides for amendments , expressly excepts this clause . I have ever looked upon this as the most disgraceful thing to America . I can not express my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the property of the slaves we have already . So they have done what they ought not to have done , and left undone that which they ought to have done . " ' We find , according to Mr. Mason 's understanding of the Constitution , that slavery was far from being guaranteed to the South . A most singular inconsistency appears in this gentleman 's ideas . While he laments , and would have exerted his utmost to have prevented , the slave-trade , and considered it so disgraceful he could not even express his abhorrence of it , and would even have excluded the more southern States from coming into the Union under the Constitution , if this traffic must be continued , yet he is not prepared to , and does not see how he can , give up his own slaves , or see that the keeping of them involves as much guilt as the traffic . For ourselves , we can not perceive why , if a man may be owned with impunity , he may not be sold with impunity . May a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way we can account for such incon- /z/ sistency is , slavery , like alcohol , destroys the moral sensibilities of our natures ; our moral feelings are blunted : their influence destroys our moral faculties , and they leave a man in comparative moral darkness . We can not account for this on any other principle . Mr. Madison , speaking of this 9th section , said ,  --  " I should conceive this clause to be impolitic if it could be excluded without greater evils . The Southern Stales would not have entered into the Union of America without the temporary permission of that trade . And if they were excluded from the Union the consequences might be dreadful to them and us . We are not in a worse . situation than before . That traffic is prohibited by our laws , and we may continue the prohibition . The Union , in general , is not in a worse situation . Under the articles of Confederation it might be continued forever , but by this clause an end may be put to it after twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our circumstances . A tax may be laid in the mean time , but it is limited ; otherwise congress might lay such a tax as would amount to a prohibition . From the mode of representation and taxation , congress can not lay such a tax on slaves as would amount to manumission . Another clause secures us that property which we now possess . At present , if any slave elopes to those States where slaves are free , he becomes emancipated by their laws ; for the laws of the States are uncharitable to one another in this respect ; but in this Constitution ' No person held to service or labor in one State , under the laws thereof , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the parly to whom such service or labor may be due . ' This clause was expressly in. /z/ serted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them . This is a better security than any that now exists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to the property in slaves now held by the States . The taxation of this State being equal only to its representation , such a tax can not be laid as he supposes . They can not prevent the importation of slaves for twenty years ; but after that period they can . The gentlemen from Georgia and South Carolina argued in this manner : ' We have now liberty to import this species of property : and much of the property now possessed has been purchased , or otherwise acquired , in contemplation of improving it by the assistance of imported slaves . What would be the consequence of hindering us from it ? The slaves of Virginia would rise in value , and we be obliged to go to your market . ' / need not expatiate on this subject . Great as is the evil , a dismemberment of the Union would be worse ; if these States should disunite from other States for not indulging them in the temporary continuance of this traffic , they might solicit and obtain aid from foreign powers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considered uncharitable , and that no man-catcher had ever been permitted by the justices of our inferior courts to secure his victim and carry him back to a state of bondage . Mr. Madison seems here to say the convention did actually make a provision that , in the manner in which the representation and taxation went together , it would be impossible for congress to liberate the slaves by way of taxing them ; and he also cites the section which , it is said , concerns ' Elliot 's Reports , vol. ii . p. 335. /z/ runaway slaves ; and he thought this would secure the property they then possessed in slaves . He appears perfectly willing no more of the colored men should be stolen and brought to our shores ; but he does not seem to reflect that all slaves are stolen property , and consequently the rightful owners may take them whenever they think proper , and they can be secured within their own power . At least , this is the doctrine universally held with regard to all other stolen property ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine should not hold good here ; and , if so , who , it has well been asked , has a better claim over the bones and sinews of a man than he who carries them about ? If it is wicked to steal a man , it is as wicked to retain a stolen man in our possession against his consent . In the observations made by Mr. M. we have a striking example of the inconsistency of man ; and , so far as it was meant to keep the slave in continual bondage , we will not in the least extenuate the matter . But , in continuing his speech , and falling upon the consequences that would result , if the foreign slave-trade should be stopped , and they continued to hold them in Virginia , and the domestic trade should spring up , he began to sicken at the contemplation that Virginia , the Old Dominion , she who had produced her Washington , her Jefferson , and such a galaxy of the lovers of liberty , at least for themselves , should become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and in council should degenerate into pro- /z/ ducers of slaves for Carolina and Georgia ! Would it not be enough to sicken any rational being , and prevent him from expatiating upon a subject so full of disgrace ? Before he died , must he not have realized his forebodings , and must it not have weighed down his spirits ? To prevent such a catastrophe , and not to have it understood Virginia was then ready to become a slave-breeding State  --  though it has been said that , when the slavetrade was finally prohibited , she was willing to become one  --  they permitted this abominable traffic , from fear , as Mr. M. intimates , that the South would obtain her slaves from Virginia , rather than from Africa ; and from the fear that greater danger would result to the country , if a union of the States was not effected . We can only trust they were sincere in their expressions : nothing else could secure them from the most gross hypocrisy . They did not know which way to turn : to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they knew net how to go back to a general dissolution of the States : they dared not do either . To use the language , as we have understood , of Jefferson , " they had the wolf by the ears : to hold on was dangerous , and to let go more so . " They were not then , and mankind are not now , ready to admit the doctrine that it is far more safe to do right than continue in the path of wrong ; that it is better for all classes that individual rights should be every where respected ; and that he who sows and he who reaps should be alike rewarded ; and that , in fact , in /z/ proportion as the producing classes are intelligent and well provided , so is the whole community advanced in a state of civilization , manufactures , and the arts . It js the intelligent workman who can perceive when science can be applied , and who makes improvements in machinery , and not the man of letters : a man of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies these principles to his arts . 1  --  Mr. Tyler warmly enlarged on the impolicy , iniquity , and disgrace-fulness of this wicked traffic . He thought the reasons urged by gentlemen in defence of it were inconclusive and ill-founded . It was one cause of complaint against British tyranny that this trade was permitted . The Revolution put a period to it ; but now it u-us to be revived . He thought nothing could justify it . This temporary restriction on congress militated , in his opinion , against the arguments of gentlemen on the other side ,  --  that what was not given up was retained by the : for , if this restriction had not been inserted , con- sss could have prcrhibited the African slave-trade . The power of prohibiting it was not expressly delegated to them ; and yet they would have had it by implication , if this restraint had not been provided . This seemed to him to demonstrate most clearly the necessity of restrain- 1 We know i nstance where an intelligent mechanic , by the name of Wright , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , in applying machinery lo the making the simple article of bobbin-heads ; and of another , by the name of Pickering , who. by making n snow-plough , has saved the labor of hundreds of men , in clearing the tracks of railway  --  ; to say nothing of those who have made the improvements and discoveries in the application of steam and machinery , that are in constant use throughout this country and in Europe . /z/ ing them by a bill of rights from infringing our inalienable rights . It was immaterial whether the bill of rights was by itself , or included in the Constitution . But he contended for it , one way or the other . It would be justified by our own example , and that of England . His earnest desire was , it should be handed down to posterity that he had opposed this wicked clause .

From the combined operation of these unlimited powers he dreaded the most fatal consequences , " &c.; &c.; We trust , however , with these powers , the American citizen will yet be able to , and will , grant that justice to the colored race which is their due ; and that this Constitution , as supposed by Mr. Tyler , was adopted for the general welfare of the people of the United States , and will be found wholly incompatible with slavery , and totally opposed to it ; and that the best interest of this country will never be attained till that excrescence is cut from the body politic , and consigned to the tomb of the Capulets , never more to have a resur- /z/ rection ; that , if the courts do not decide against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , to be a stumbling-block in the way of all improvement , and a barrier to the best interest of our country ; and that the restoring man to himself will be the only way of securing peace and permanent prosperity to our land ; and that true liberty can not be established throughout this extensive continent but by giving up this institution ; and the sooner the better will it be for all concerned . Mr. Madison , however , said , in answer to the latobjections made by Mr. Tyler , that " the gentleman was mistaken ; that the powers of congress extended to those alone that were ' enumerated ; ' and , if congress attempted to exert powers not enumerated , it would not be warranted by the clause . "  --  . Mr. Henry insisted that the insertion of these rections on congress was a plain demonstration that conoress could exercise powers by implication . The gentleman had admitted it could have interdicted the African slave-trade , were it not for this restriction . If so , the power not expressly delegated must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was their doctrine of reserved rights ?

They in lay such heavy taxes on slaves as would amount to emancipation ; and then the Southern States would be the only sutlercrs . His opinion was confirmed by the mode of levying motic ; / . Congress , he observed , had /z/ power to lay and collect taxes , imposts , and excises . Imposts ( or duties ) and excises were to be uniform . But this uniformity did not extend to taxes . This might compel the Southern States to liberate their negroes . He wished , therefore , this property to be guarded . He considered the clause that had been adduced by gentlemen as security of this property as no security at all . It was no more than this ,  --  that a runaway negro might be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent congress from interfering with that property , by la5'ing a grievous and an enormous tax upon it , so as to compel owners to emancipate their slaves , rather than to pay the tax . He apprehended it would be the subject of much stock-jobbing , and that they would play into one another 's hands in such a manner as that this property would be lost to the country . " ' Mr. Henry 's entire speech on this occasion , while it shows his inconsistency as a man , shows also his opinions of the powers of congress . He fears they have designedly omitted some expressions , that , if used , would have established him in his slave possessions : bat , being omitted , and , as he said , he feared it was done designedly , we may suppose him correct in his fears . No one denied , so far as is reported , that Mr. Henry was incorrect in these insinuations . An explanation is given in another place by Mr. Madison , and Mr. Randolph , of which we shall leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man was to be lost to the country by being a freeman instead of a slave ! What an idea for one of the greatest /z/ advocates in the country for freedom , in its most extensive sense , when his own rights were concerned ! But who shall explain the inconsistency of man ? A person who had kept a whole State in suspense for three or four weeks because , in some remote degree , the Constitution that was proposed for adoption was thought to contain paragraphs that might have deleterious effects upon the liberty of certain individuals ; yet complaining it did not hold others with an iron grasp , and even because masters should be taxed for their slaves ! We all know how anxious the South were to relieve themselves from the imposition of this tax ; and , as we have observed before , they succeeded ; and , as Mr. H. supposed , there was a good deal of stock-jobbing ; but it all happened to ' be on the wrong side ; and , instead of the negroes being freed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his negro , and the slave has been made more secure in his bondage . " Mr. George Nicholas wondered , and well he might , that gentlemen who were against slavery would he opposed to this clause , as , after that period , the slave-trade would be done away . lie asked if gentlemen did not sec the inconsistency of their arguments ? they object , says he , to the Constitution , because the slave-trade is laid open for twenty odd years ; and yet tell you that , by some latent operation of it , the slaves , who arc so now , will be manumitted . At the same moment it is opposed for being promotive and destructive of slavery . He contended it would be advantageous to Virginia , that it would be in the power of congress to prevent the importation of /z/ slaves after twenty years , as it would then put a period to the evil complained of . " ' It would seem , from the arguments of all the gentlemen , both from the North and from the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to slavery . Perhaps it would have so done , had there not been a home market , and a home supply . But , instead of the destruction of the foreign slave-trade decreasing the number of the slaves in this country , they have gone on constantly increasing , till their numbers have become , if it is intended to keep them as slaves , alarmingly great . Mr. Nicholas then spoke of the difficulty of effecting the union without this clause ; that Virginia might continue the prohibition of the slave-trade ; the superior advantages they possessed in not having more than two fifths of their slaves taxed instead of the whole number , and that the taxes could not be laid so high as to amount to emancipation ; and , among other things , said , " I can tell the committee that the people of our country are reduced to beggary by the taxes on negroes " " Had this Constitution been adopted , it would not have been the case . The taxes were laid on all our negroes . By this system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had imagined gentlemen would not support here what they had opposed in another place . " Mr. Henry made a short answer , and said ,  --  i Elliot 's Reports , vol. ii . p. 337. /z/ he wished to take leave of ; they had nothing to do with the question , which was solely whether thai paper was wrong or not . " to_the Mr. Nicholas replied , that negroes must he considered as persons or property . If as property , the proportion of taxes to be laid on them was fixed in the Constitution . If he apprehended a full tax on negroes , the Constitution has prevented it . For , by the census , when a white man paid ten shillings , a negro paid but six ; for- the exemption of two fifths of them reduced it to that proportion . 11 ' Mr. Henry , it would seem , had opposed slavery in some other place ; but , for some reason or other ,  --  we know not what ,  --  he had taken different ground in the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Henry took offence , and did not seem desirous his inconsistency should be pointed out . The course he took in the convention on this subject will not , we think , add to his renown as a statesman or a philanthropist . Yith regard to the tax spoken of , the slaveholder does not now pay even the six shillings ; for not only is the burden of a direct tax thrown otf , but nearly all the articles the slave uses , as we have before remarked , are manufactured or produced in this country ; and consequently he pays no revenue . Here are nearly three millions of individuals , who are both willing and able to help support the government of our country , but who are not permitted ; while a great portion of the whole burden of its support falls upon the North , who are now not allowed to be heard upon the /z/ floor of congress ! and our politicians , if they can gain a place , are willing to have it so ; and our revieicers are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! In speaking of the powers of the Supreme Court , Mr. Grayson said ,  --  " The jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution and the laws of the Union is of stupendous magnitude . It is impossible for human nature to learn its extent . It is so vaguely and indefinitely expressed , that its latitude can not be ascertained . Citizens or sub- ' jects of foreign states may sue citizens of different States in the federal courts . It is extremely impolitic to place foreigners in a better situation than our own citizens . This never was the policy of other nations . It was the policy of England to put foreigners on a secure footing . " ' " This high court has not very extensive original jurisdiction . It is not material ; but its appellate jurisdiction is of immense magnitude ; and what has it in view , unless to subvert the State governments ? The honorable gentleman who presides has introduced the high court of appeals . I wish the federal appellate court was on the same foundation . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary . It is said that its object is to prevent subordinate tribunals from making unjust decisions to defraud creditors . I grant the suspicion is in some measure just . But would not an appeal to the State court of appeal , or superior tribunals , correct the decision of inferior courts ? Would not this put every thing right ? There then would be no interference of jurisdiction . " 2 Speaking of the State courts , and the courts of /z/ the United States , lie says , " Both courts are to act on the same persons and tilings , and can not possibly avoid interference . " 1 Mr. George Mason , in remarking on the second section , said ,  --  " On a former part of the investigation of this subject gentlemen were pleased to make some observations on - he security of property meaning slaves coming within this section . It was then said , and I now say , that there is no security , nor have gentlemen convinced me of this . " 2 Without further debate the third section was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's liberty of more consequence than money ? and , if he is defrauded of this liberty , has not the court jurisdiction ? and , if the inferior courts make a wrong decision on the subject , may not the Supreme Court have power to reverse it ? We should think so : and , if these courts order a man back to slavery without there has been proved before them that the person claimed is indebted by contract , of his own making , to the person who claims his service , may not an appeal be properly made , or judgment be given , and then an appeal be made to the Supreme Court for its jurisdiction and judgment ? And , agreeably to the 4th , 5th , 6th , 8th , and 10th articles of the amendments to the Constitution , if a person called a slave is " seized in his person , " or punished without a trial by jury before some public authori- /z/ ties , may not the so called master be brought before it for transgressing these express articles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made on purpose to suit his case ? We hope it will not be long before some humane people , either at the North or South , will be able to test the question , whether a master can whip or restrain a slave , on his own authority , and in pursuance of this Constitution . Here is also the candid acknowledgment of the Hon. George Mason , that the Constitution provided no security for property in slaves : he could see none in the Constitution , and no one in the Virginia convention could point out any to him . Massachusetts had already adopted the Constitution , recommending amendments , securing in a greater degree the individual rights of every person , " whether residing on the banks of the Savannah , " or " on the margin of the Kennebec , " because some of the members of that State thought these rights were not sufficiently secured in the instrument submitted for their adoption , and Mr. Mason undoubtedly knew of these amendments proposed by her . And , while no allusion is made to these amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as the reports show , could perceive where slave property was at all secured by that instrument ; saving that , as it was afterwards argued , because the so called slave could be taken up in another State , it could not be supposed that , after he was taken back , the master could be deprived of him . But , when we consider the 23S hm:ima CONVENTION . amendments made to this clause , we can not suppose it was intended , by those who made these amendments , to return the runaway slave : such can not be admitted ; unless we admit their duplicity ,  --  a charge for which , for ourself , we have not sufficient evidence . If we are correct , and as Mr. Madison said there must not be two principles in that instrument , where , then , we ask , is the evidence of the guaranty , or compact , that has been so often rung as a bugbear in the ears of the North ? there is none ; there was none . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the subject should or would not be disturbed by the North , it was done , if done at all  --  and we have no evidence it was done  --  without any authority given to do it , even if they had the inclination . But we do not believe the inclination to any extent existed : all seemed ready to give up the system but South Carolina and Georgia ; and they , as was said , only wanted to make up a deficiency of laborers ; and , as white people could not work in those States , their only alternative , as they affirmed , was to obtain them from Africa ; and , when the slave-trade ended , then ought to have ended slavery . We do not , then , improperly interfere in urging the South to fulfil her engagement to the world , to have this a free country , nor should we , by obtaining a decision of the court that no person can be held in bondage by the Constitution of our country , break any contract that we , as northerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have continued , and /z/ longer , on trust , than the civilized world will permit it to continue . We should both blush and be ashamed for our ingratitude to those men who assisted us in our distress , on the ground- that this country should be a land where the people of all nations should be secure in their individual rights , and every man be able to sit under his own vine and fig-tree , without any to molest or make afraid . Will there , then , be no lawyer who will undertake the task to maintain an action of the kind before the highest court of the country ? Can there be no case , either as original or appellate , that can be searched out , and made to be the pioneer of a succession of cases , till freedom to individuals is universally acknowledged ? We hope there will be , and the time will not be distant when a decision can be had , and the rights of the slave acknowledged . They can certainly appeal to the observations here made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject ; that slavery does come within their jurisdiction ; and that not only Mr. Mason , but the whole of the Virginia delegation , silently admitted the fact ; and , when the suggestion was made , the subject was dropped , as too delicate for further discussion . Can and need there be farther proof that such is the case ? Were the men of this assembly too insignificant to be authority in the case ? Was not Madison , Randolph , Munroe , Nicholas , Grayson , Henry , Mason , capable of discernment /z/ My colored friends , it is a pity none of you ever discovered this truth , and have not applied your- /z/ selves to urge upon the consideration of the courts the wrongs under which you have suffered , and caused them  --  as we think they must have clone  - -  to have rendered a judgment in your favor . We are aware it is said the consideration which was given the free States for the continuance of slavery , or , rather , that the three fifths representation should take place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they in general were small States , while the slave States were comparatively large ; consequently they admitted the small States to an equal representation on the floor of the senate . But this can not amount to much , for it is well known the States had an equal representation under the Confederacy ; that is , one State had as many representatives as another , and therefore they did surrender much when they allowed the larger States a greater representation in the house of representatives ; for we have seen Mr. Martin , of Maryland , says some of the small States expressly instructed their delegates not to give up an equal representation ; as , if they did , they would be swallowed up by the larger States ; but they finally consented to the present arrangement . There are now , however , as many large free as there are large slave States ; but this , in fact , was not the case : not passing the navigation act was alone a consideration for permitting the slave-trade to be continued till 1S08 . Xo other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was ever entered into : the size of the States had no relation to the subject . /z/ Mr. Henry , on the resolution for the ratification of the Constitution , with certain amendments , said ,  --  " The honorable member must forgive me for declaring my dissent from it ; because , if I understand it rightly , it admits the new system is defective , and most capitally ; for , immediately after the proposed ratification , there comes a declaration that the paper before you is not intended to violate any of these three great rights ,  --  the liberty of religion , the liberty of the press , and the trial by jury . What is the inference , when you enumerate the rights you are to enjoy ? That those not enumerated are to be relinquished . There are only three things to be retained ,  --  religion , freedom of the press , and jury trial . Will not the ratification carry every thing , without excepting these three things ? Will not all the world pronounce that we intended to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , is comprehended in these three things . Your subsequent amendments only go to these three amendments . " ' " Among the ten thousand implied powers which they may assume , they may , if we be engaged in war , liberate every one of your slaves if they please . And this must and will be done by men , a majority of whom have not a common interest with you . They will , therefore , have no feeling for your interest . It has been repeatedly said here that the great object of a national government was national defence . That power which is said to be intended for security and safety may be rendered detestable and oppressive . If you give power to the general government to provide for the general defence , the means must be commensurate to- the end . All the /z/ means in possession of the people must be given to the government which is intrusted with the public defence . " In this State there are 236,000 blacks , and there are many in several other States ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our numbers are numberless , they may call forth every national resource . May congress not say every black man must fight ? Did we not see a little of this in the last war ? We were not so hard pushed as to make emancipation general ; but acts of assembly passed , that every slave that would go to the army should be free . Another thing will bring this about . Slavery is detested ; ice feel its fatal effects ; we deplore it with all the pity of humanity . Let all these considerations at some future period press with full force on the minds of congress . Let that urbanity which I trust will distinguish America , and the necessity of national defence ,  --  let all these things operate on their minds , and they will search that paper , and see if they have power of manumission . And have they not . sir J Have they not power to provide for the general defence and welfare ? May they not think these call for the abolition of slavery ? May they not pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that power ? there is no ambiguous implication , or logical deduction . The paper speaks to the point . They have the power , in clear , unequivocal terms , and will clearly and certainly exercise it . As much as I deplore slavery . I see that freedom forbids its abolition . I deny the general government ought to set them free , because a decided majority of the States have not the ties of sympathy and fellow-feeling for those whose interest would be affected by their emancipation . The majority of congress is to the North , and the slaves to the South . In this situation I see a great deal of the property of the people of Virginia in jeopardy , and their peace and tran- s VIRGINIA CONVENTION . 243 quillity given away . I repeat it again , that it would rejoice my very soul that every one of my fellow- beings were emancipated . As we ought to acknowledge with gratitude that decree of Heaven which has numbered us among the free , we ought to lament and deplore the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by any human means , to liberate them without producing the most dreadful and ruinous consequences ? We ought to possess them in the manner we have inherited them from our ancestors , as their manumission is incompatible with the felicity of the country . But we ought to soften , as much as possible , the rigors of their unhappy fate . I know that , in a variety of particular instances , the legislature , listening to complaints , have admitted their emancipation . Let me not dwell on this subject . I will only add that this , as well as every other property of the people of Virginia , is in jeopardy , and put into the hands of those who have no similarity of situation with us . This is a local matter , and I can see no propriety in subjecting it to congress . ' ' ' ' ' These expressions of Mr. Henry probably explain the cause of his action , and his inconsistencies : it was that the sympathies of a people afar oft "  --  a people who were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns . This he did not want to have done : he saw the Constitution gave this power , and , if we believe him sincere in his deploring slavery , he wished to have the sole control over the subject . He labored under the false idea there was property in man , and that the State would be reduced to poverty if the slave should be emancipated . In 1 Elliot 's Reports , vol. ii . p. 431. ill IHGINIA CONVENTION . fact , there is no property in man ; so far from it , slave labor is not so valuable as free ; and consequently the master is a loser by keeping him . He is valuable only when he is let out , or is made an article of produce or of merchandise . In all cases of labor , the free man is the cheapest ; and the result would be , the planter would be a gainer by changing his system of labor . As a practical evidence that such would be the fact , we have only to look at the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair illustration . Therefore , if any gentlemen , who really entertain any honest fears in regard to immediate emancipation , and . like Mr. Henry , are fearful of pursuing the path that leads to universal liberty , they have now only to turn their eyes to us and to the isles of the ocean , or compare the condition of the North with that of the South , to allay their fears . But if . on the other hand , they mean to change the policy of the country , and to make this continent a dwellingplace for slaves , instead of a land for the free , then , we say , it is time for the lovers of liberty  --  for we can not say for the American people  --  to arouse themselves , and see that such shall not be the case . Gov . Randolph asked Mr. Henry , " Where , in the paper submitted by Mr. Withe , do you discover the people of Virginia are tenacious of their rights only ? It declares that all power comes from the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; that among other things remaining with them are liberty of the /z/ press , right of conscience , and some other essential rights . " x He then goes on to say ,  --  " The honorable gentleman and some others have insisted that the abolition of slavery will result from it , and at the same time have complained that it encourages its continuation . The inconsistency proves , in some degree , the futility of their arguments . But , if it be not conclusive to satisfy the committee that there is no danger of enfranchisement taking place , I beg leave to refer them to the paper itself . I hope there are none here , who , considering the subject in the calm light of philosophy , will advance an objection dishonorable to Virginia ,  - -  that at the moment they are securing the rights of her citizens , that an objection is started , there is a spark of hope that these unfortunate men , now held in bondage , may , by the operation of the general government , be made free . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him read the system . I ask , and I will ask again and again , till I be answered ,  --  not by declamation ,  --  where is the part that has a tendency to the abolition of slavery ? Is it in the clause which says that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing think proper to admit ' shall not be prohibited by congress prior to the year 1808 ? ' This is an exception from the power of regulating commerce , and the restriction is only to continue till 1808 . Here congress can , by the exercise , prevent future importations ; but does it affect the existing state of slavery ? Were it right here to mention what passed in the convention on the occasion , I might tell you that the Southern States , even South Carolina herself , conceived this property to be secure by these words . 1 believe that , /z/ whatever we may think here , there was not a member of the Virginia delegation who had the smallest suspicion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the clause where this formidable power of emancipation is inserted . But another clause proves the absurdity of the supposition . The words of the clause are , ' No person held to service or labor in one State , under the laws thereof , escaping into another State , can , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor ; but shall be delivered up , on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . ' Every one knows that slaves are held to service or labor . And , when authority is given to owners of . slaves to vindicate their property , can it be supposed they can be deprived of it ? If a citizen of this State , in consequence of this clause , can take his runaway slave in Maryland , can it be seriously thought that , after taking him and bringing him home , he could be made free ? " I observe the honorable gentleman 's proposition comes in a very questionable shape , and is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although we went article by article through the Constitution , and although we did not expect a general review of the subject ,  --  as a comprehensive viewhad been taken of it before it was regularly debated ,  - -  yet we are carried back to the clause giving that dreadful power for the general welfare . Pardon me , if I remind you of the true state of that business . I appeal to the candor of the honorable gentleman ; and , if he thinks it an improper appeal , I ask the gentlemen here , whether there be a general , indefinite power of providing for the general welfare . The power is , ' to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defence and general welfare . ' So they can only raise money by these means , in order /z/ to provide for the general welfare . No man who reads it can say it is general , as the honorable gentleman represents it . You must violate every rule of construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of raising money , and annex it to any thing else , in order to make it that formidable power which it is represented to be . " In reviewing these remarks made by Gov . Randolph , we will first make the inquiry , what was said in the convention ? Certainly , if any thing was said too improper to be repeated before the convention of Virginia , the ideas should be considered too improper to be acted out before the world . But here , we suppose , Mr. Randolph alludes to the vaunted compact ; but what does it all amount to ? Why , some of the members of the convention said something which Mr. R. was ashamed to repeat ,  --  that South Carolina was satisfied , because congress permitted the slave-trade to continue twenty years longer ; and the delegates of Virginia were satisfied , because congress permitted a man to be transferred from one State to another , if he owed service or labor to any one who might claim this ownership of labor , if it was proved to be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we shall see  --  said , there was no compact ; this paper was a straight-forward paper ; it meant what it said , and nothing more . Pennsylvania , thereby disclaiming any compact , and Massachusetts , fearing the slaveholder might take advantage of what might have been said , disclaimed having any thing to do with such a compact , and introduced an /z/ amendment to do away the authority of the master ; and congress afterwards refusing to admit the word " freeman " in some of the amendments Virginia recommended , ( which was probably put in for the very purpose of doing away the objections of Mr. Henry , ) which amendments were afterwards adopted as part of the Constitution , after having this word " freeman " stricken out , consequently leaving , and , as we must perceive , with design , the amendments devoid of any expression that would involve them in contradictions , and consequently left the word " person " in the Constitution to mean all persons , whether white or colored , bond or free ; so that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact , the people disannulled it . Is there not a dishonorable suggestion in that sentiment , that , while they were legislating for the freedom of the white citizen , " there might be a ray of hope the black man should be free ; " and yet , by artfully contrived wordings of certain portions of the Constitution , it is here given us to understand a sixth part of the population of the country was to be kept in bondage , and no power lodged any where to have their fetters broken ? O shame ! where is thy blush ? The question might here be asked , what are the debts of the Union , and how came they to be contracted ? Were they contracted , and are they only to be contracted , for having our guns scoured , and hiring men to butcher one another ? and do we contract , and must we not contract , debts for any /z/ other purpose ? and when the general welfare has been consulted in any other way , and money is spent for the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it always to be so ? Can not mankind learn a lesson ,  --  that it is equally as safe , as . pleasant , and as satisfactory , to treat one another as friends and brothers , as it is to be constantly fighting , and making it their boast they have been the cause of the death of thousands , and have made tens of thousands widows and orphans ? We are aware , if slavery is continued , there is no alternative . If one half of our countrymen mean to imbrute and enslave the other half , we must be kept in a constant state of bloody excitement . Fightings among ourselves can never cease : a good portion of our community , as has lately been proposed by our late secretary of war , Mr. Poinsett , must be kept constantly ready for service , and to shoulder their muskets to maintain a system of outrage against human nature . We can not but suppose this suggestion of his arose from the fear entertained by the holders of human beings as property . The slaveholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to a peaceful state of society , and that they can not maintain their position but by brute force , consequently are willing to forego all the blessings peace brings in its train , in order to enjoy a brief hour of tyranny and oppression . We stop not here to inquire how utterly at variance , in the manner of providing for the common defence and general welfare , these ideas are with those enter- /z/ tained by the people of the country who gave their sanction to the Constitution ; but we do say here , we hope the American people will never submit to such a departure from the State right principles of that day as to raise such a standing army , but be more jealous than they ever have been for the liberties they now enjoy . Mr. Madison coincided with Gov . Randolph respecting the reserved rights of the States , and observed ,  --  " I was struck with surprise when 1 heard him express himself alarmed with respect to the emancipation of slaves . Let me ask , if they should ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power ? There is no power to warrant it in that paper . If there be , I know it not . But why should it be done ? Says the honorable gentleman , for the general welfare ; it will infuse strength into our system . Can any member of this committee suppose that it will increase our strength ? Can any one believe that the American councils will come into a measure which will strip them of their property , discourage and alienate the affections of five thirteenths of the Union ? A hy was nothing of this sort aimed at before ? I believe such an idea never entered into an American breast , nor do I believe it ever will , unless it will enter into the heads of those - gentlemen who substitute unsupported suspicions for reasons . " ' Does Mr. Madison here deny that " the power given in the general welfare is not ample ? No ! it only never entered his mind that a general emancipation could , ever be for the general welfare . /z/ He could not conceive how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if it could he proved it would be for the general welfare , that strength would be infused into the system , that it would not strip them of property , but even make their real property more valuable , and would allay the heart-burnings which slavery has already engendered , and must continue so to do , what then would be his answer ? But he says he sees no power in that paper to warrant a general emancipation , and " if it was exercised it would be an usurpation : " and " that such an idea never entered an American breast , and that it never would enter into the head of any gentlemen but those who substituted unsupported suspicions for reasons . " But such an idea did enter the head of Patrick Henry ; it has entered into the heads of other gentlemen , and we trust it will enter into the heads of more than it has already . For what did the American people form a Constitution ? What was the object ? Was it simply that they might declare war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people to pay the debts , of a general government for performing these acts ? Has the general government , we repeat , nothing else to do but to keep a standing military force , to establish custom-houses along our coasts , keep a register of our vessels , and then pay the men for doing this business ? and that the doing any thing for the general welfare , the securing liberty to ourselves and our posterity were idle dreams , and that the person who could suppose /z/ such could have been the object of any one of that day , or in coming time , were only those " who substitute unsupported suspicions for reasons ? , ; We will admit the paying the debts of that day was pretty important ; and if it takes two thousand dollars to collect an hundred , as it is reported to have done for the past few years ill the State of Maine , and paying forty millions of dollars to hunt fugitive slaves in Florida during the same term , the necessity of paying the debts contracted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then . But we believe the American people had some other object in view ; they did mean the general government should have it in their power to promote the general welfare when that welfare could be clearly ascertained . True , there may be a great difference of opinion what may be for the general welfare ; but when any thing for it could be clearly pointed out , then it could be carried into effect , if the liberty of the individual was not infringed upon ; but the moment that was done their power ceased , because it was to secure this liberty they declare was one of the objects for forming this Constitution . This the people understood ; it was to this they gave their sanction . Mr. Zedekiah Johnston  --  and his name should be kept in remembrance for the ideas he entertained and expressed  --  understood it so ; and he , for one , was willing that slavery should be made to cease . We hope he has some descendants left in Virginia : and , if they entertain his opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ Southern States . We trust an army of such men will appear there before long . The people , if we are correct , consented to the Constitution , on the principle that individual rights were secured , and on no other ; and , when any thing could be done , consistently with those rights , for the general welfare , it was in the power of congress to do it .
