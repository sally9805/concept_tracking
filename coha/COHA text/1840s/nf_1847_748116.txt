txt /q/rs of society , or more apt to become stable and wealthy citizens , than such as are well married and well settled . A learned foreigner of Spanish descent , of high distinction in the politics of his own country , was once leaving the doors of a pleasant family , in New England , where he had been spending an evening . He had observed the Sabbath calm of the little circle its sequestered safety and inde- /z/ pendence ; he had marked the freedom of affectionate intercourse between parents , and children , and friends , the cordial hospitality , and the reference of every thing abroad to this central spot of home . As he retired from the lovely scene , he exclaimed , with a sort of transport , " Now I have the secret of your national virtue , and intelligence , and order ; it is in these domestic retreats ! " " Domestic happiness , thou only bliss Of Paradise that has survived the fall ! Though few now taste thee unimpair 'd and pure , Or , tasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve thy sweets Unmix 'd with drops of bitter , which neglect Or temper sheds into thy crystal cup ; Thou art the nurse of Virtue , in thine arms She smiles , appearing , as in truth she is , Heaven-bora , and destined to the skies again ! " * Cowper . /z/ " When we mean to build , We first survey the plat , then draw the model ; And when we see the figure of the house , Then must we vote the cost of the erection . " King Henry IV . part 2 . THERE is such a satisfaction in having a house ot one 's own , that most Americans begin to think of building as soon as they are rich enough . It is proverbial that this becomes a mania , even in the country , with men of wealth In quantity , therefore , we have no lack ; the defects are in the quality of our architecture . For want of observing the plain dictate of reason contained in my motto , many great houses are finished less splendidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk without seeing the dwelling of some mechanic going forward , I am anxious to make a few suggestions on this point . A good site is almost every thing : in such a land as ours , few are compelled to build in bad situations . Yet half the houses we see in the country are disadvantageously placed . How little advantage is taken of native groves ! I have in /z/ my eye a very costly edifice , just near enough to a beautiful copse to tempt the belief that the proprietor wished to avoid its shades , while he is making a strenuous effort to bring forward some starveling trees in a miserable clay before his door ! The general design is next in importance : this is what strikes the distant beholder . The eye is shocked when , in a clever building , the door has three windows on one side and five on the other . The proportions of length and height , the pitch of roof , the . number , and size , and arrangement of lights , are all matters which demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but in most cases they are left to chance or whim . Symmetry is as cheap as disproportion , and rich men should not monopolize all neatness and taste . A good plan gives beauty to the plainest materials , while no expense can render a false proportion elegant . A well-designed cottage , of the humblest dimensions and simplest fabric , fills the eye , and gives repose to the mind . But finery can not hide bad taste ; it oftener betrays it . We may here apply Crabbe 's couplet " Faults that in dusty pictures rest unknown , Are in an instant through the varnish shown . " Men who come suddenly to wealth are greatly in danger of falling into this trap . The showy iu architecture is usually coupled with the vulgar ; just as in dress the finest are not the truly well- /z/ bred . Pope has satirized this abuse of orna-ment : " Load some vain church with old theatric state Turn arcs of triumph to a garden gate ; Reverse your ornaments , and hang them all On some patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four slices of pilaster o n't , That laced with bits of rustic makes a front ; Shall call the winds through long arcades to roar , Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door . " Some of our builders , I hope , will read these essays : their influence is of great moment . If well instructed , they will tell such as apply to them , that the word Architecture is not confined to the massy piles of public edifices , but that the very same principles which draught the Birmingham Town Hall , or the Madelaine , can descend to plan the cottage , or the rustic bridge . These principles ought to be studied , not only in our colleges , but our lyceums and other institutions for the instruction of working-men . Books of architectural plans should be compiled and abstracted from the more costly European publications . I am sure any one who is familiar with the Tailor 's Magazine , will grant that there is no insuperable obstacle in the way of a builder 's periodical . And not architects alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemplation of good models . /z/ The day it is to be hoped will come , when even the day-labourer will not think it necessary to be slovenly because he is poor , and when the most incessant drudges shall begin to see that there are some good things besides coin and bank-notes . The practical man whose views are enlarged will not fail to see that pleasures of imagination and taste have also their price . Decoration naturally comes after use ; we build our houses before we deck them . But in the advancement of society , there is a stage at which men always set a value upon ornament ; and though these circumstances may breed luxury , they have fruits which are desirable , such as increased contentment , placid joy , refined taste , cheerful reflection , and the love of home . Along the bank of a half-finished canal I saw , the other day , a settlement , which , at a furlong 's distance , showed the origin of its tenants . Extemporaneous huts , barrel chimneys , floors without boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these afforded the symptoms of a hovel . Here was no decoration ; and I argue concerning this settlement , that there are no intellectual pleasures , no taste , no gentleness , no fireside happiness . Let me change the scene . I knew a family of English people , no richer than those just noticed , who lived in a dwelling no larger than one of these but how different ! I see it yet in memory , /z/ its whitened palings and beaten walk to the door , its tight sides and close roof , and especially its edge of summer flowers around a plot of the cleanest grass , and its roses and woodbine creeping over every window . They were poor , but they were tidy . More than this ; they were fond of natural beauty , and fond of home , and therefore always aiming to make home lovely . Every reader has many times seen the same thing , and some have already learned the connexion between simple decoration and domestic virtue and peace . Why does an English cottage strike an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a strange thing , upon the French peasantry taking their evening repast beneath their trees and vines ? Because we Americans are so particularly practical , and so possessed of the demon of trade , that nothing is valuable which can not be sold . Value is becoming equivalent to vendibility . Valuable means saleable : worth means money . If a flower , or a hedge-row , or a cascade , or a bust , or a prospect , add to the price under the hammer , these things are valuable , and are straightway inserted in the lithographic view of the auctioneer . They are useful . Usefulness is that quality of things whereby they bring money . /z/ " Tall thriving trees confess the fruitful mould , The reddening apple ripens here to gold ; Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows , With deeper red the full pomegranate glows , &c.; HOMER 'S Odyssey , book vii . IT was certainly an exaggeration of Mrs. Trollope to say , that no one could ever hear two Americans talk five minutes without the word dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation of shopkeepers . " Be it so . Caricatures often tell the truth . Even the hideous concave mirror , though it exaggerate ever so much , shows me some grand blemishes of my face . I have tried the experiment , in walking the crowded streets of our cities , to catch the predominant word of the passers-by . The catalogue is limited , and consists of such as these , " Ten per cent . " " doing a good business " " money market " " operations in property " " exchange " " stock " " thousand dollars " " credit " " profits " " fortune , " &c.; &c.; If a man is so practical that he will not wash his face without " value received , " I entertain no /z/ hopes of bringing him over . I have no purchase for my instrument . Now cleanliness is a sort of decoration ; negative , perhaps , but the condition of all the rest . Neatness follows very closely : a cleanly child is usually neat . The cleanly housewife fs sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gratifies the eye . This is neatness budding into beauty . This transition ought to be seized upon wherever it appears . The pleasant little children who are yonder playing in the dust may be taught to keep themselves clean , and then to be neat . This is the path towards decoration . Taste needs development . These creatures may be bred to enjoy ornament : and thus we may get a race of people , even among the poor , who will begin to beautify the land . I live in the hope of seeing cottages along our multiplied and dirty railways , each adorned not only with a white surface and a close fence , but with roses , pinks , tulips , and all the pretty vegetable gifts of a loving Providence ; gifts which our yeomanry have too much banished to green-houses and ballads . The ways of adorning a house by rural aids are various , and so well known as scarcely to need enumeration . They may be adapted to the lowliest habitation of civilized man , no less than to the villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ordinary tact are required to rear a thousand tasteful abodes along all our high- /z/ ways . And if but one provident householder will begin , we shall find that , humble as his habitation may be , he will soon be imitated by his neighbours . Fashion itself , the cause of so many follies , may be brought in aid of virtuous enjoyment . Let some working-man make the trial , by holding up before his mind rural decoration as a distinct object . Let him secure to himself a house and garden where he is willing to spend his life . Let him , as his means allow , have it tight and finished , and by all means duly enclosed . This is the frame-work ; after this ensue the details . Let him learn the economy of a little timely paint , and of a fence or hedge which will withstand the assaults of wind and beasts . From day to day , as he may be able to snatch a moment for breathing the fresh air , let him remove unsightly objects and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set out clumps or rows of trees , for shade and fruit , flowering shrubs or evergreen hedges ! How agreeable to the wife and the little ones , to be called out to join in dropping the cheap flower-seed or training the luxuriant vine ! To men whose life is spent in labour , the subject is peculiarly interesting . The confinement of their daily toils creates the want of just such relaxation and refreshment as have been indicated . And let it be remembered that in our country even the poor man should cultivate his taste , because every poor man may look forward to the time when he shall be rich . Let him educate his /z/ faculties , that his ignorance may not some day disgrace his wealth . It is common to sneer at the mechanic , and to consider the youth who becomes an apprentice as degraded . This is very short-sighted . I know no class of society whom success makes so truly independent , or who in the decline of life have so much leisure as mechanics . Compare them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician , howeter wealthy he may become , finds still increasing labours ; the more riches , the more toil . Unless he relinquishes his business altogether , he must do the work himself . He can not send his foreman to plead a cause , or to set a leg ; nor can he , like the rich mechanic , sit in his parlour or his arbour , and know that all his great concerns are well conducted by proxy . Working-men should look to this , and from the time when they first enter a habitation of their own , should cultivate the delights of domestic ornament . Among these ornaments , the highest rank is due to Gardening ; including in that term the rearing of valuable trees . Children should be early taught that when they set out a fine tree , or insert a graft , they are doing a favour to posterity , and beginning that which shall continue to make others happy when they are in their graves . It has always been pleasant to me to see the house of the industrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday evening , a season when so many forsake their work onlv /z/ for the porter-house or the tavern , the man who possesses such a retreat will have a strong inducement to seek his delightful home , and meet his little household among the smiles of natural scenery . There are many very precious maxims of life which need to be pointed out ; they are overlooked by the mass of people . Once indicated , they are believed and embraced . Among these is the following : Simple ornament hinders no good use . The watch runs as well in a comely case , as it would in a deal box . The draught is just as savoury out of a chased tankard . And every good of household life is unimpaired by nestling among green foliage , climbing honeysuckles , and parterres of flowers . I long to see this acted upon by our people . I long to see them snatching a few hours from the noisy throng of idlers , and the delirious mirth of the bar-room , and spending them on the little innocent decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifying a house and enclosure is really so little , that it scarcely admits of being brought into a calculation . A few minutes at daybreak , in the spring and autumn , will in the course of a year work wonders . A few snatches of time after labour is ended may be spared by the busiest man . If his work has lain within doors , or has been of the sedentary kind , a little exercise and air , enjoyed in pruning his hedge or trimming his vines , will be restorative to his health and /z/ spirits . This is better than mere repose . Nature abhors a vacuum of employment . Is not this positive gain ? Health is " the poor man 's riches : " that which conduces to it is worth more than money . Even those who are athletic , or who work at trades which give them constant motion , do not the less need something of this sort . It is not mere muscular exertion which preserves and restores health . There may be great bodily effort with no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is done , is gentle recreation , something between work and play , which shall break the train of moody thought , repair the waste of nervous elasticity , and put the jaded mind in good humour with itself and others . When the artizan , after his evening repast , goes out to water his flowers , every thing he touches is his own ; and nothing so much his own as the tree he planted or the shades he gathered . He is refreshed and tranquillized , and grows into the love of home . These pleasures are mightily increased , when he sees around him his little children partaking in his toils and joys , and cheering one another with the merry laugh to work or sport ; while the wife 's voice , heard within , as she sings contentedly over the cradle , adds a lovely music to the scene . This is a picture , of which the original may be found in many a poor but happy family ; would that it were so in all ! Un- /z/ der such shades as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a spot religion finds its sanctuary . Contrast with this a case which we are often called to witness . The mechanic or labourer has worked hard all day . At the close of his toils he turns his face homewards . But he has not provided or cherished at his dwelling any strong attraction . No refinement of taste has ever softened his spirit . It has been too much his practice to pass his leisure hours elsewhere . He feels the need of some relaxation . He is languid from fatigue , and sullen from the disgust of labour . In such a condition he is easily attracted to the barroom . There , amidst the odours of liquor and tobacco , he forgets his previous listlessness and anxiety , to become the victim of an unnatural and dangerous excitement . The glass , the jest , and the song make the evening fly swiftly . Late at night he wends his way home , if not drunk , yet humbled , discontented , and peevish . No children greet him with their joyous laugh ; the neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake only through anxious expectation of her husband . Am I extravagant in tracing much of the misery in such a case to the want of taste for those little things which make one 's home desirable ? As a general observation , I have never seen idle or profligate sons issuing from within the cottage paling which has been adorned by /z/ their own infant hands . And , on the other hand , it would require a stoical love of virtue for its own sake , to make any youth love the foul , smoky , fenceless cabin of a thriftless father . Sweeten home , and you close nine out of ten doors to temptation . /z/ " Sufficiency , content , Retirement , rural quiet , friendship , books , Ease and alternate labour , useful life , Progressive virtue , and approving Heaven ! These are the matchless joys of virtuous love . " /z/ IT is well known to all readers of fiction , that the novel commonly ends , as soon as the happy pair are united at the altar ; and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to turn mainly upon the pleasures of married life . But whatever it may be in fiction , wedlock is the source of the richest happiness in real life . Its joys indeed are not of the sort which the novelist loves to dwell on ; they are less like the lightning or the meteor than the sunset or the dawn . They are not the raptures of the lover , which are often founded in mere sense , and vanish when youth and beauty are gone ; but the steady glow of a true love that outlasts every external charm , and holds on its constant light even amidst wrinkles and old age . Trite as the subject is , I must be allowed to spend a little time upon it , as it is nearly connected /z/ with the happiness of the working-man 's home . What is life , especially to the artisan , without home ? and what is home , without gentle woman , the friend , the wife , the mother ? The English nobleman , and those who ape his manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like treading down the lily of the valley , the cowslip , and the violet . Husband and wife , in high life , may affect great coldness , live apart , maintain separate equipages , and flaunt at different watering-places ; they have debauched all taste for the joys of nature and of virtue : but husband and wife , in our happier sphere , are necessary to one another , and can not be severed without loss and anguish . In our favoured land there can scarcely be said to be any check to marriage . Our young people marry early , and are free from that sullen , brooding prudence which is inculcated by painful necessity on the peasantry of the old country . Matrimony is therefore more an affair of the heart ; and this , in spite of all sneers at lovemarriages , I shall ever hold to be a great advantage . What was said on this subject by Franklin , seventy years ago , is still true , that early marriages stand the best chance of happiness . The temper and habits are plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supplied by that of elder friends who still survive . " Late children , " says the Spanish proverb , " are early orphans . " " With us in America , " Dr. Franklin /z/ wrote in 1768 , " marriages are generally in the morning of life ; our children are therefore educated and settled in the world by noon ; and thus , our business being done , we have an afternoon and evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves . By these early marriages we are blessed with more children ; ****** hence the swift progress of population among us , unparalleled in Europe . " Profane jesters and rakes have succeeded in getting afloat in society too many idle and wicked sayings about the state of matrimony . It is a truth at once of Scripture and observation , that " he that findeth a wife , findeth a good thing , and obtaineth favour of the Lord . " I am so far from having any fears of infusing into rr , y readers unduly romantic notions in regard to marriage , that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new charm if the mutual regards of husband and wife could be hallowed with more of these tender , respectful , and sacred sentiments . Poor Sedley ! what I have just written brings him to my mind . Though what the world would call but a common man , he had a heart worthy of a knight-errant . He is now gone ; but I am sure there is many a woman living who remembers the chaste but tender respect , almost passionate , if it had not been almost courtly , with which he regarded the sex . And as for Isabel his wife , though at the time I mean she was neither beautiful nor young , she seemed in Sedley 's eyes to be the /z/ representative of all the virtues . I never heard from them a fondling expression , or observed the slightest indication of that conjugal mellowness which is a sort of perpetuated honey-moon . But then respect and love breathed from every action . Once I found him , when much enfeebled by disease , so much affected as to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , laying his hand on mine ; " I have hurt the feelings of my best friend of Isabel . No , " said he , " I recall the phrase it is often but another name for anger and anger never rested in her gentle bosom . Grief grief that is the word : I have grieved her . By my sullenness and petulance , the fruit of my diseases , but yet unpardonable , I have grieved her . And I must go , " he exclaimed , " and ask her forgiveness , for in fifteen years she has never given me a look of unkindness . " It was with difficulty that I persuaded him to lay aside this purpose . He could scarcely believe that a needless explanation is always a source of real pain . When I afterwards found that Isabel gently smiled at his caprices , which she understood better than himself , I was only the more convinced that " a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband , and that her price is above rubies . " Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zest he has in licentious pleasure ; let the monkish casuist declaim against wedlock as a lower condition in point of morals : I will still repeat the verses of the matchless bard /z/ verses which I would that every young American had engraven on his memory : " Far be it that I should write thee sin or blame , Or think thee unbefitting holiest place . Perpetual fountain of domestic sweets , Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced , Present or past , as saints and patriarchs used . Here love his constant shafts employs , here lights His constant lamp , and waves his purple wings , Reigns here and revels ; not in the bought smile Of harlots , loveless , joyless , unendear 'd , Casual fruition ; nor in court amours , Mix 'd dance , or wanton mask , or midnight ball , Or serenate , which the starved lover sings To his proud fair , best quitted with disdain . " /z/ " For nothing lovelier can be found In woman , than to study household good , And good works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of my most serious apprehensions , that in the multitude of our societies and public combinations , men and women might chance to forget that they have any thing to do individually . We have societies to take care of our health , and societies to take care of our kitchens . Almsgiving , so far as practised at all , is practised chiefly by wholesale . Perhaps we may see the day when we shall dine together like the Spartans , and when all cookery and education shall be done upon the large scale . These thoughts were suggested to my mind with greater force than common , a few days since , upon my making a visit to the house of Mrs. Nelson , the wife of a reputable farmer , a few miles from our village . If I were to attempt a portrait of this excellent lady , I should fill a volume ; I can only give an outline . Mrs. Nelson is , in the American as well as the English /z/ sense , a fine woman . Temperance , early rising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , have left on her cheek at forty those roses which fashion and excitement often blast before fifteen . But what I took my pen to notice was , that truly feminine and Christian trait of my good friend she is a " keeper at home . " * Though I have been a church-going man many years , I do not remember to have heard any one of our clergy enlarge upon this Scripture phrase ; and yet the older I grow , the more wisdom there seems to be in it . The best women in the world are those who stay at home ; such is the opinion of the best judges , to wit , their husbands . The worst women are those who have no home , or who love all other places better ; such is the verdict of those who meet them abroad . A wife at the hearth is as indispensable as a steersman at the wheel . There is scarcely any degree of prudence or firmness which will enable a man to have a wellordered family unless his partner have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is more dependent upon this than is commonly supposed : agreeably to a vulgar proverb , " He that would thrive , must ask his wife . " In a house where children or apprentices are to be cared for , this is plainly true . A little procrastination , sloth , or want of thrift in the woman will suffice to make every thing go wrong . Who can /z/ count up the cases where poor fellows have been ruined by their wives ? This is a hard saying , but if it were softened it would be less true . Surely it is no disrespect to the better sex to point out those rare exceptions , which , like the dim tarnish on the face of the moon , make the other tracts look all the brighter . After you shall have exaggerated to the utmost the number and the faults of idle , gadding , gossiping women , we shall still have a million of American housewives , brightening a million homes and hearts . Mrs. Nelson is one of them . Her husband is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hospitable , but she makes up for all , like the credit side of an account . In the exercise of the passive virtues , she finds her greatest happiness . She holds it to be one of the very first duties of life to render her home delightful , first to her husband , next to her children , and then to all who may enter her hospitable doors . Early in life , she observed that several of her husband 's intimate acquaintances were becoming irregular in their habits ; she talked it over with Nelson . He , being a rough man , declared it to be his intention to break off all connexion with Lang and Shepherd on the spot . " 0 , no , husband ! " said she ; " that would be cruel : remember the proverb , ' a soft word breaketh the bone . ' Let me alone to bring them to their bearings ; at any rate give me a month for an experiment . " " You ! " he exclaimed , in astonishment ; " Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the bar-room , as Jemima Murphy does her goodman ? " " Perhaps not , " said his wife , laughing ; " but we women have some secrets left still . Wait but a month . " The month rolled round . It was with difficulty that Nelson kept himself from falling upon the two men violently , but he waited to see the issue , and even kept out of their way , that the incantation might not be interrupted . At the close of three weeks , Lang and Shepherd were two of the most quiet , orderly , and domestic men in the neighbourhood . " Why , Mary , " said Nelson , " what have you been doing to them ? " " I ! husband ! I have not exchanged words with them for weeks . " " Then you have had some witchcraft at work . " " None in the world , " she replied ; " the story is soon related . I had observed for a long time that their homes were growing dismal : and I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , I had heard you tell of Lang 's repeating over his glass that abominable saying , ' the devil 's at home . ' After my talk with you I set to work , not on the husbands , but their wives . Simple creatures ! they scarcely knew what I meant . They wished indeed that the men would spend more time at home , and even wept about their late hours and beer-drinking . But they were not prepared for my telling them that they must redouble the attractions of their own fireside make the cheer better /z/ the fire brighter the children cleaner the house tidier the welcome heartier ; call in a pleasant neighbour to tea , or a friend 's daughter to sing an innocent song , and even invite to a comfortable supper two or three of their husband 's cronies . Before long they began to have pleasant evenings ; and by a choice of company , a little good fruit , lemonade , home-made cake , and music , fairly convinced the two men that they could go pleasantly to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing has taken admirably , and you see the result . " Now though it is likely Nelson did not just then suspect it , this was the very course which had proved successful in saving himself from ruinous habits . And most earnestly is it to be wished that all our towns and villages were filled with such wives as honour and love the family institution ! Every one has made the observation that there are many more women who are religious , than men ; but the final cause of this has not so often been remarked . Divine Providence , by this discriminating favour to the one sex , pours influence into the social fountain . As are the mothers of a nation , so will be the sons , and , in a measure , the husbands . But to exercise full influence , the wife must be a keeper at home . She will find enough to employ her longest days , in the endless circle of household cares . While she will welcome the evening visiter , and often enlarge her frugal board for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ party or the cheerful sleigh-ride , these things will be the exceptions , not the rule . So living , she will give happiness to the increasing circle . " Her children arise and call her blessed ; her husband also and he praiseth her . " /z/ " How bless 'd the maid whose heart , yet free From love 's uneasy sovereignty , Beats with a fancy running high , Her simple cares to magnify : Whom labour , never urged to toil , Hath cherish 'd on a healthful soil . " /z/ WHEN I look around me among my fair countrywomen , and see them equal in grace and loveliness to any upon earth ; and when I observe how many of the most beautiful are come out from the dwellings of industry , I am filled with a glow of satisfaction which I would not repress and can not put into words . But personal charms are the least of the graces of American women . It is , I hope , no part of our national conceit to think that the world can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is , in some degree , creeping into the country ; but still , in rural neighbourhoods , the virgin purity of the sex bears comparison with the choice of the whole earth . There are few things of which men are more proud than of their daughters . The young father /z/ follows the sportive girl with his eye , as he cherishes an emotion of complacency not so tender but quite as active as the mother 's . The aged father leans on his daughter as the crutch of his declining years . An old proverb says that the son is son till he is married , but the daughter is daughter forever . This is something like the truth . Though the daughter leaves the parental hearth , she is still followed by kindly regards . The gray-haired father drops in every day to greet the beloved face ; and when he pats the cheeks of the little grandchildren , it is chiefly because the bond which unites him to them passes through the heart of his darling Mary ; she is his daughter still . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pride . It is a blessing for which you may welt thank Heaven : it is a trust at which you may well tremble . Beware how you neglect or mismanage so delicate a plant . Slight storms will blast a texture so susceptible . While your eye is upon your cherished girl , and the gush of affection is strongest and warmest , open your mind to the importance of being a wise father . What has this frail but inestimable creature to ask at your hands ? She should be guarded . It is superfluous to say that our daughters walk among dangers . Eveu at school , nay , in the bosom of our family , they require cautious attention . " A child left to himself , " says Solomon , " bringeth his mother to /z/ shame : " it is doubly true of the daughter . This is not one of the things which may be abandoned to self-management . Principles must be implanted , and heavenly precepts inculcated . The rich soil , when left untilled , brings forth a horrid crop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I but even female companions may be snares , and it is not impossible for gay and fascinating girls to be bad associates . It has happened again and again that maidens have fallen when they merely " went out to see the daughters of the land . " Far be it from me to commend the old Spanish plan of seclusion : I have no such wish . Let the gay creatures move freely in the circle of friends , but still let the parental eye and the parental hand be ever ready to descry and avert the danger . The great point is gained when the father is convinced that the daughter needs his care . He is less anxious , and she is safe . She should be educated . The age is favourable to this . In heathen countries women have always been uneducated drudges . Among the most refined of the ancients , an educated woman was a sort of black swan , an object of curiosity and amazement . Among our own Christian ancestors , female education was made to consist almost entirely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , at present , the stream of opinion is wholly in favour of giving learning and accomplishment to the sex . As a general observation , it is true that daughters all /z/ over the country have a better training than that of their mothers . Perhaps there is some danger of going to the extreme of refinement , and undertaking to give grace , and polish , and embellishment beyond what the solid acquisition will bear . Give your daughter the best education you can afford : you can give her nothing better . And when I say the best education , I mean of course that which is most suited to her expectations in life , including in the term , not merely book-learning , but the household arts and the culture of the heart . There is tendency enough towards mere accomplishments , such as music , drawing , fancywork , and the like ; so that I plead more earnestly for the solids . And with respect to the latter , it is certainly safer to err on the side of too much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attainment will be easily forgotten and thrown off amidst the cares of a family . The wife and mother has far less time than the husband to make attainments in after life ; she must therefore get as much as is possible before marriage . In most of the schools with which I am acquainted , girls have too many branches offered to their attention . A girl 's education is usually considered as complete after a course of three or four years ; yet in this brief period she is expected in some seminaries to acquire the same amount of learning which it takes boys three times as long to acquire ; and this over and above a list of minor ornamental branches of which the value is commonly in the /z/ inverse proportion of the cost . This has weighed heavily upon my mind for some years past ; when I have seen the daughters of men who are frugal and practical in other matters , really cheated out of a good education by the quackery of a false system . The point of this rebuke is directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must furnish what the public taste demands , as against those parents who are so foolish as to bring up their children on a diet of froth , flowers , and syllabub . No discreet parent surely will allow himself to look upon his daughter 's education as a mere bait for suitors : he who does so is decking a victim for sacrifice . On the contrary , unless you can secure to your child a longer course of instruction than the average term , you will do well to limit her to a moderate number of branches , and these the most valuable , and to see that in these she is as thoroughly instructed as a boy would be in the same . Moreover , you will not allow yourself to be satisfied with the advertisements , circulars , or other professions of great schools , however fashionable , as to the choice of studies for your daughter , but will , after the best advice , select such a course as will promise discipline to her mind , and usefulness throughout life . There is one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter to your own care : She should be well married . True enough ! you will exclaim ; but how is this /z/ to be accomplished ? I will tell you : not by manoeuvring , or match-making , or any mercenary or trade compact , such as , according to a hackneyed pun , may make " matrimony a matter of money ; " not by any measure to procure this or that man as a son-in-law . Your cares are to have another direction . Make your daughter all that it is in your power to make her , by education in its widest sense , and be assured she will never lack suitors . The great difficulty will be to prevent her being snatched away from you by some unworthy man . How shall this be prevented ? Not , as I think , by laying a repressing hand of cold iron upon affections already formed . No ! no ! It is almost always too late when matters have reached this point . But a wise line of conduct will be preventive of a wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bring the girl up in right principles , with knowledge , modesty , and affectionate duty , she will be in little danger of suffering any passion to gain strength against the wishes of a parent . And , again , if a suitable guard be placed over her associations , she will be seldom in those companies where such alliances are most apt to be formed , and will thus be kept out of harm 's way . O mothers , mothers ! how greatly are ye concerned in this matter ! While you encourage these young creatures in superficial accomplishments , ind bold display , you are often preparing /z/ for them a lifetime of chagrin and misery . On the other hand , where you train them at your side , by precept and example , in retiring , industrious , studious , virtuous habits , you are preparing them to be " corner-stones , polished after the similitude of a palace . " /z/ " Much zeal in virtue 's cause all teachers boast , Though motives of mere lucre sway the most " /z/ IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more widely , that the instructers of our children are rising in public estimation . It has not been many years since the very name of schoolmaster was a temptation to a sneer . Perhaps the fault was sometimes in the pedagogues themselves : they were not always learned , they were not always discreet . It was not indeed more common then , than now , for young men raw from college to teach for a year or two , until they might become clergymen , lawyers , or doctors ; but while they did so they were not held in great veneration ; and the older sort , who made it a business for life , were often bachelors , humorists , and pedants . In the very State in which I am writing , there is a township , in which a majority of the schoolmasters were drunkards ; and that since the Revolution . Poor fellows ! I might wonder how they continued to buy their drink , out of the pittance which they received for /z/ leaching , if I did not reflect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They used to go about from house to house , like country tailors ; and were less regarded . In the hard winters , many of them travelled on foot more miles in a month than they received dollars in a year . The school-houses were wretched dens , with no earthly recommendation but their airiness in the summer ; and in these boys and girls , as full of mischief and prank as buxom health could make them , would vex the red-wigged master till his carbuncled nose emulated the red cloaks behind the door . Then came the smothered laugh , the furious reconnoitre of the offending bench , the cuff , the slap , the rejoinder , the surrejoinder ; the quip modest , the reply churlish , the reproof yaliant , the countercheck quarrelsome ; till down fell the birchen shower . A stranger might have taken the engagement for a fight , as the whole commonly issued in a mutual castigation , in which the master was reduced to a good humour , and making a virtue of necessity , passed it all off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cocker and Dilworth , there were some ripe scholars , even in the glens of the mountains ; and if learning was hardly come by , it was prized the more . Old men are living , who remember to have heard Latin talked in the upper forms of log school-houses ; nay , who have seen and heard the master , in a fine frenzy , spout Cicero , and even Demosthenes , in the ori /z/ ginal . There were some who had emigrated from " the old country , " and some were bred among ourselves , who taught for the love of it , and who would scarcely have been willing to exchange the ferula for the truncheon of a commander . Many young people are now-a-days receiving a finished education , whose fathers scarcely knew a letter in a book . A few months ago , in a somewhat secluded place , almost five hundred miles from here , I found the state of affairs so changed from what it once was , that the daughters of mechanics were learning French , Latin , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved for future discussion ; but one thing is certain , working-men are setting a higher value than formerly on education . If we may judge of the demand for an article by the price , teaching is a better business than it was . People are beginning to find out , that the man who gives good learning to their sons and daughters is doing them a favour . The schoolmaster is lifting his head , and is no longer ashamed of the title . It is right that this feeling should prevail , especially in the case of those who make teaching a business for life . Such men , if faithful and competent , are second to none in the good they do . The permanent teacher , especially when venerable for his years , ought to be honoured in every circle . While he looks benignandy round him on those whose fathers he has in former days led* , along the ways of knowledge , he should be made to /z/ feel that his services are not undervalued . When this shall be more generally the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocation . The instructer of youth will be regarded as constituting one of the learned professions ; and young men will look forward to this calling , just as they do to the pulpit or the bar . " If it were asked , " says a late English writer , " what class of men would receive , in the present or next generation , the rewards to which their labours , when rightly understood and assiduously performed , justly entitle them , it might be answered , with every appearance of probability those who improve the moral and intellectual characters of individuals , and fit them to perform the various duties of life with satisfaction to themselves and advantage to others . " A difficulty suggests itself in the case of many mechanics and other men of the industrious classes , which merits special attention . We have among us highly respectable persons of this description , who have never received a thorough education . Still they are improved by their own exertions , and by intercourse with society , and are consequently far above the contemptible prejudice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far are they from this , that they lament their own deficiencies , and hold nothing more resolutely before their minds than the purpose to have their children instructed . But in seeing this accomplished , there is this hinderance : they can- /z/ not themselves pretend to decide who is and who is not a fit teacher ; and in this age , when recommendations for pills , or dictionaries , or professors , are as easily obtained as bank-accommodation , no parent can rely on mere general testimonials . Habits of calculation naturally lead a man in such a case to make the price a criterion : and here is a common snare . Wo to the boy or girl whose parent has been beguiled by a schoolmaster with no great merit but his cheapness . Cheapen your watch or your chaise , but not your child 's instruction . I knew a teacher once I know him still whose like I would gladly see in every town and hamlet of my country . Though aiming to be no more than a common schoolmaster , he might have graced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his language precise , and his decisions positive : these things are wont so to be , in one that has ruled for fifty years . Yet he is bland , and ready to communicate . He will put on his huge round spectacles even now , to rule a girl 's copy-book . His gray hairs sometimes blow about in the wind , while he is fixing a dial in a pupil 's garden . He has been a great aid to surveyors and almanac-makers , and is suspected of helping the clergyman to scraps of Greek and Hebrew . For though he teaches English , he is not strange in the ancient lore ; and I am not sure that among all my good old mates , there is a single one who could better give the meaning of a hard quotation , than Robert Appletree. /z/ Continued .

" /z/ WE are apt to flatter one another that the world is growing wiser and better every day ; and if great public improvements are to be taken as a fair sign , we are doubtless a greater people than our forefathers . They , poor souls , had neither steamships nor railways ; the division of labour , which with us leads to such perfection in all the arts , had with them gone but a few steps . Books were rare among them ; exceedingly rare among the earlier American settlers ; so that the libraries of many able and learned men , before the Revolution , were smaller than collections which may now be found among mechanics . Schools are more numerous , and nearer together , and scarcely a day passes but we hear of discoveries in education , which are almost as numerous as patent /z/ medicines . Surely the age must be getting wiser . Laying together a number of signs , such as the magnetic pills , animal magnetism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the astonishing modes of teaching penmanship in six lessons , and French in twenty , and the ponderous volumes of speeches delivered at school conventions and the like , is it not fair to expect the day when the royal road to science , like the north-west passage , shall have been discovered , and when a complete organization of that thinking pulp which we call the brain , shall be produced by steam ? Such meditations as these are not uncommon , but they are often driven clean out of my mind when I hear uncle Benjamin discourse about the times when he was a boy . Perhaps it was because he had just been insulted in the street , by a couple of scape-graces , who , with the insubordinate spirit which marks our day , had scoffed at his lameness , that the old man ' appeared somewhat ruffled during our last interview . He had seated himself by an old-fashioned Franklin stove , for he can not endure coal , and with his feet upon the fender , was enjoying the soothing odours of his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye the period before the Revolution . Here was the remnant of a robust frame and a vigorous understanding . Here was one remaining link to bind us to the old colonial times . Like many of the aged , he loves to discourse ; and who has a better right ? /z/ " Ah , " said he , archly shaking a shrivelled finger at his grandsons , " if you had been schooled in my day , you would have had other jobs for your winter evenings than playing that idle game of backgammon which I see you at . " " How so , grandfather ? " said Joseph , as he emptied his box and cried " cinq-ace " " I 'll tell you , boys . Learning was something to be scrambled for in those days . The schoolmaster was second only to the minister , and used to wear his hair in a bag . He went the rounds among the farmer 's houses , in a large circuit , and some of the boys used to trudge their four and five miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set up a school , the business of teaching was worth something .

" " I suppose , grandfather , they used to whip , in those days ? " " You may well say so , Joseph ; you may well say so . The teacher was not ashamed to be named Master , and we were not ashamed to call him so . Master he was , and it took a sturdy fellow to handle a set of resolute young cubs , who sometimes turned upon him and shut him out of his castle . Hard blows used to fall thick ; and they made men of us .

No , no ! We had our full share of correction ; and though we used to vow that we would take ample reprisals when we should get big enough , yet we never fulfilled the obligation . But every thing is on a new plan . I do not see anybody that can write a fair , round , copy-hand , such as we used to practise , having our knuckles well rapped if there was a single pot-hook awry . The teachers ca n't do it themselves , and they therefore cry ' sour-grapes , ' and set copies in three-cornered letters like a girl 's verses in a Valentine . The good old cipheringbooks have gone out : they used to teach us figures , penmanship , and book-keeping , all at once . Then you seem to me to have some new-fangled school-book every month , and a new teacher almost every quarter . The cry is for cheap education low-priced teachers ; and your children fare accordingly . You have more wit than to do so with other things . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bullock . " Thus the old man ran on . With due allowance for the predilections of age , there was enough of truth and reason in his complaints to make me pause and consider . The stream of knowledge is daily more diffused : I wish I were as sure that it is deeper . Often , in talking with old men , I am impressed with this truth , that while they know less about many things than we of the pre-/z/ sent race , they know better what they had learned . If there was less compass in their knowledge , there was more weight . Confinement to a few books made them perfect in those few . You could not puzzle uncle Benjamin in the Spectator , or the Freeholder , or the poems of Pope ; but he never heard of Shelley , or Bulwer , or Willis , and my friend Appletree tells me it is much the same in the learned languages . He contends , through thick and thin , that we have no scholars to match the old-school fellows of silver-buckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has not been a teacher who could parse his boys in Latin . He even doubts whether our professors of language could all of them make a good off-hand Latin speech ; and as to Latin verses , which used to be so common , they are as obsolete as horn-books and thumb-papers . He further avers , though I would not be held responsible for the assertion , that the men of ' 76 wrote purer , stronger , racier English than the men of this day ; and that John Hancock , John Adams , Josiah Quincy , and George Washington , handled an easier , simpler , and manlier style , than Mr. Wise , Mr. John Quincy Adams , or Mr. Van Buren . But this , I dare say , was told me in confidence . /z/ " But she , who set on fire his infant heart , And all his dreams and all his wanderings shared , And bless 'd , the Muse " and her celestial art , Still claim th ' enthusiast 's fond and first regard . " /z/ IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all cases be very numerous , it is particularly desirable that those which fall in the way of the young people should be of the right sort ; and this is to be managed not so much by rules and restrictions , as by a care in the filling of the shelves . If the latter have seductive books , they will be sought after by the children , even though you should open before their eyes the most sacred homilies , or preach yourself hoarse in decrying naughty novels and song-books . This becomes more important , when we call to mind that the whole course of a man 's reading is often determined by the books which he happens to enjoy in his boyhood . Robinson Crusoe has made many a sailor ; Spenser 's Faery Queen made Pope a versifier ; Xenophon 's Memorabilia made Franklin a disputant ; and if I might be allowed to play /z/ the egotist in a harmless way , I would add that the liking of which I am conscious for the oldfashioned English literature is owing to the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boyhood . That shelf contained the essays commonly known as the British Classics . I perfectly remember the eagerness with which I used to clamber up the edge of the book-cases , to reach these tempting works . At first my object was to look at the pictures , of which there were two or three in each of the thirty-nine volumes . But soon I was allured to do more ; and while yet quite a little boy , was as familiar with the more light and humorous parts of Addison , Steele , Goldsmith , and Mackenzie , as I have since been with any other productions . And though books for children were fewer then than they are now , I am satisfied that the daily converse of a child with such works as the Spectator , the Guardian , and the Connoisseur , even if he finds many things above his apprehension , is more profitable and far more delightful than the perpetual dawdling over penny-volumes , written on the plan of making every thing level to the meanest capacity . These first tastes of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be clear to every parent , that he can not be too careful in the choice of books ; meaning not merely such as are given to his children as their own , but such also as form a part of the family stock . When I try to gather up the broken recollec- /z/ tions of early days , and ask what pieces of reading have left the most abiding impressions upon my mind , I discern at once that it has been that class which met my attention casually : not my schoolbooks , not the works spread before me by my sage advisers , but effusions , gay or grave , which I hastily devoured by forbidden snatches . At an early age I fell upon the Life of Benjamin Franklin , as written by himself : a book which I shall always cite as an illustration of one of my favourite maxims , that truth is more interesting than fiction . The essays appended to the volume engaged my attention ; and I was not content to read merely what I could understand , but dived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his philosophy . The Way to Wealth , Poor Richard , and The Whistle , are perhaps as familiar to the minds of the American people , as any human productions : I may therefore cite them as remarkable instances of lasting impression . I wish my admiration of Benjamin Franklin were not mingled with anxiety as to the probable influence which one or two of these pieces , and the general tone of his economical writings , have had upon the national way of thinking . The maxims of Poor Richard are undeniable ; and if the great end of man were to make money , they might be adopted as a sort of pecuniary gospel . But I fear that the boy who is bred upon such diet as " If you would be wealthy , think of saving as well as getting ; " or " Six pounds a year is but a groat a /z/ day ; " or " He that murders a crown destroys all it might have produced ; " or " A penny saved is twopence clear " or any the like adages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so little of a utilitarian , that I do not believe wealth to be the chief good , or frugality the cardinal virtue ; and most heartily do I regret that such an authority as Franklin should have erected for us such a tutelary saint as Poor Richard . Be this , however , as it may , my position holds true ; the whole colour of our life , both mental and moral , is frequently taken from what we read during childhood ; and I am here reminded that this very philosopher is an instance in point . A very little book , exceedingly prized in old-time families , seems to have had great effects on his mind . In a letter written from France , in 1784 , Franklin thus addresses Dr. Mather of Boston : " When I was a boy , I met with a book , entitled , Essays to do good , which I think was written by your father . It had been so little regarded by a former possessor , that several leaves of it were torn out ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to have an influence on my conduct through life ; for I have always set a greater value on the character of a doer of good , than on any other kind of reputation ; and if I have been , as you seem to think , a useful citizen , the public owes the advantage of it to that book . " * These are notable words . Let them have their From the American Museum , vol. vii . p. 100 /z/ due weight with the young . They were uttered by Dr. Franklin when he was in his seventyninth year : they were therefore not the fruit of sudden excitement . Their import is , that if he had been useful , it was owing to a torn book read in his boyhood . I hope the republication of this remark will not only have the effect of leading every one who reads it to procure this work of the famous Cotton Mather , but will induce some publisher to give it to us in a shape more elegant and better suited to the reigning taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such writings , " says Franklin , of a similar production , " though they may be lightly passed over by many readers , yet if they make a deep impression on one active mind in a hundred , the effects may be considerable . " When the artisan , or the farmer , or the trades man is making up a collection of books , he ought to bear in mind that a well-kept book will last a lifetime . Some of the soundest books I have were owned by my grandfather . It is great improvidence to fill our houses with trash . Ten dollars , wisely expended , will , at an auction or book-shop , furnish you with fine old copies , in sheep or even calf , of Milton , Young , Thomson , Pope , the Spectator , the Rambler , Boswell 's Johnson , Plutarch 's Lives , Josephus , with quite a sprinkling of later and lighter productions . And this will be a source of endless entertainment during the winter evenings. * /z/ " Only , good master , while we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's be no Stoics , nor no stocks , I pray . " f Taming of the Shrew . RULES are good things , but one may have too much of them ; and overmuch legislation is a snare and a burden . Some of my friends , knowing me to be a bookish man , acquainted with a number of the old English authors , have again and again begged me to lay down for them , in black and white , a course of reading , which they might use themselves , and give to their young folks . This I have always resisted , partly because I have a dread of running all minds through the same flatting-mill , and partly , perhaps , because whatever little attainments I have myself made , have come to me , not by regulations , but in spite of them . I am half , disposed to think this is nature 's own way .

Even in the fine arts , the pupil may be kept too long in the dull formalities of the drawing-school . The port-crayon need not be always in hand . As I was lately in a very interesting conversation , in a railroad car , with an eminent artist of Philadelphia , he related to me a pointed saying of our great Gilbert Stuart , dropped by the latter when he was painting in London ; " If young men are ever to learn , " said he , " it must be spontaneously . You must teach them to draw , as young puppies are taught to swim ; chuck them in , and let them take their chance . " It is somewhat so in letters ; at least it has been so with the most successful . Pray , what list of authors had Franklin , Murray , or Gifford ? When I remember my boyhood , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rules were my compulsory pursuits ! O how free as air my reading ! The dear old books in which I used to pore , without direction , nay , against direction how do they rise before my memory , like ghosts of beloved friends ! Their very looks are before me ; I see their very " form and pressure . " Nay , smile not , reader , the odours of ancient volumes , perused by me long , long ago , are in my mind 's nostril this blessed night . There is Sanford and Merton the very first " big book " I can call to mind ; it was given to me by my father ; I did not so much read it , as gloat over it . To this day /z/ I can not explain the charms of that volume ; but who ever read it uncharmed ? " Robinson Crusoe ! " I need not tell an experience which is that of all the world . " The Thousand and One Nights " It was somewhat a stolen enjoyment ; but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , into which , on the mere strength of boyish fancies recollected and embalmed , it would have taken little at certain times to transport me bodily , as those incomparable fictions did in spirit . " The Pilgrim 's Progress " There were two things about this immortal story which made it dearer to me than all the rest ; first , it carried with it a pleasing yet fearful shuddering as before high religious mystery ; and , secondly , it was a prolonged enigma , and he is no child who loves not a riddle . In later days , the same work has commended itself to my riper judgment , by its solid sense , its holy unction , its lordly imaginings , its epic conduct , and its " English pure and undefiled " my mother tongue the dialect , not of the college or of books , but of the market , the shop , and the hall . I hope earnestly , that while they are hammering out for us a new language , to be called American-English , and new-vamping the orthography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed on the two sides of the water may be as unlike as possible 1 hope they will leave a little of the racy idiomatic speech of the old counlry still incorrupt , in such books as the Pilgrim 's Progress . /z/ Set a boy to read a large book through , for a task , and you kill the book 's influence on him . But spread works before him , and let a little childish caprice govern his choice , and he will learn rapidly . It is not instruction merely that the young scholar wants ; here is a great mistake ; no , it is excitement . Excitement is that which drives his soul on , as really as steam does the engine . But then you must keep him on the track . And the same thing holds in self-culture . Somebody has said that every well-educated man is self-educated ; and he said not amiss .

There are , probably , not many books at your command , but no matter . Many wealthy young men , amidst thousands of volumes , pine away in listless ignorance .

Give me therefore my small shelf of books , in order that each one may be the centre of such remembrances . Let others throng the circulating libraries , and take the mingled alcohol and opium of the lecherous and envious Byron , the puling and blasphemous Shelley , the seducing Bulwer ; give me my Bible , my Milton , my Cowper , my Bunyan , my shelf of histories , my shelf of biography , and my shelf of travels , and I will have more " thick coming fancies " in an hour than they in a day .

" /z/ THE man whose days are spent in labour does not need so great a proportion of light reading , as the professional man or the student . Nor need this paradox startle any one . As it is true that the lawyer or the bank-clerk does not need , when evening comes , to rest his limbs , for the very plain reason , that he has not been exerting them , and that they are not weary ; so it is equally true , that the wheelwright or the turner does not need to relax his reasoning powers , because he has not been putting them to task . The jaded body of the workman claims its repose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the tired labourer may rest his limbs while he studies mathematics , just as the exhausted student may refresh his spirit while he saws wood . I have long thought that ignorance or oversight of this truth , has been a great stumblingblock in the way of the improvement of the industrious classes . The flood of cheap novels and other /z/ literary syllabubs is so exuberant , that , like the Nile in an overflow , it conies up to every man 's door . Those who least need relaxation of mind , because they have been engaged in no mental effort , are the principal patrons of this sort of literature . I have no doubt that most of the romances of our circulating libraries are worn out in the hands of working-men and women . If their taste had not been perverted , they would be quite as much entertained with a book of science , or an instructive history , as by the frivolous story ; but forgetting this , or having never known it , they go on year after year , until their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have lost tone , if for a like period they had been fed upon nothing but pastries , ices , and confections . The demand for this merely entertaining literature is evinced by the character of the large weekly newspapers , and low-priced magazines , which circulate most among operatives . I need not name these ; our cities abound in them . The newspapers to which I allude are commonly issued on Saturday , and their immense sheet gives occupation to many a poor reader for the whole of Sunday . Now you will observe , that a large part of the outer form of these publications is frequently taken up with just that kind of reading which is fitted to make a sound mind sick , and a feeble mind crazy . Tales upon tales of love , of horror , of madness , and these often the effusions /z/ of the most unpractised and contemptible scribblers , who rejoice in this channel for venting their inanities , succeed one another week after week , and are the chief reading of persons whpm I could name , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel-reading , in the name of common reason , let him go to what is worth reading let him sate his mind with Scott , and Edge worth , and Ferriar , and Ward ; but let him not expose so delicate a thing as an undisciplined mind to the everlasting wash and ooze of such slops as these . By such a course of reading the mind gets a surfeit : the appetite sickens , and so dies . Let this become general , let it become the taste of the country , and it will be here as it is in France . The palled interest must be awakened by more pungent condiments ; and as old snuff-takers sometimes mingle cayenne in their pinch , the jaded novel readers will have recourse to the doubledistilled horror and obscenity of the Parisian romance .

In taverns , and especially in steamboats , I found myself constantly in need of some reading which should be a relief from the prevalent listlessness . Like everybody else , I supplied myself with what is called light reading , namely , the latest tales , romances , annuals , magazines , and verses ; and , like everybody else , I found myself perpetually laying down the volume in a paroxysm of insufferable ennui . Why thus ? I could not but ask . Such reading has often relieved me after a day of hard study . Upon consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind is no more fit for a mind in active health , than water-gruel for a man-of-war ' s-man . If you set out with the purpose of being amused for several days together , the project will certainly fall through . When the edge is on the intellect unabated , it can not be safely used upon such small matters . I was induced therefore on one occasion , as a desperate experiment , to take with me on a long journey a book on a philosophical subject in which I was interested , and which , I was sure , would task my powers to the utmost ; and whether I am credited or not , I must declare the Cowper . /z/ truth , I never found such a resource against the listlessness and weariness of a voyage , as in that difficult volume . Long after my own discovery , I met with the advice of Johnson : " If you are to have but one book with you on a journey , let it be a book of science . When you have read through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can do no more for you ; but a book of science is inexhaustible . " The practical use I make of such truths is this : I would have all men who spend their principal hours in labour , to seek their mental relaxation in books of a higher order than those which promise mere amusement . At any rate , begin with the more solid , and make the trifling ones a last resort . Not that I would by any means debar the young reader from works of gayety and humour ; still less would I lock out pleasing narratives , whether histories or voyages and travels . These last afford perhaps the most healthful relaxation of which a wearied mind is capable . But let some useful knowledge always be the object of pursuit . Even if you seek the merest entertainment , you will find this the true policy . The nobler the game , the greater the enthusiasm of the hunter ; although every shot be the same , yet the sportsman will not waste powder upon wrens . Make therefore a fair experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from such reading as the following : First , Important History ; as that of Greece and Rome , of England and America . /z/ Secondly , Biography ; beginning with old Plutarch , the favourite of every age , and including the memoirs of the greatest men of our own land . Thirdly , Voyages and Travels , which give the best knowledge of geography , in all its extent , and are especially useful in enlarging the views of those persons , who , from their calling in life , can not see much of the world . Fourthly , Books about Natural Philosophy and Chemistry ; particularly those which suggest many easy experiments . Fifthly , Books of Natural History ; some branch of which you may so far pursue as to make collections . Sixthly , Poetry ; the choicest works of the great masters . And if in no one of these six chambers of knowledge you find entertainment , I must turn you over to the incurable ward of novel-reading spinsters and peevish newsmongers. /z/ " In dreams , in study , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to assist The growth of intellect , yet gaining more , And every moral feeling of his soul Strengthen 'd and braced , by breathing in content The keen , the wholesome air of poverty , And drinking from the well of homely life . " The Excursion . ALTHOUGH I have said so much in another place about the ways and means of gaining knowledge amidst the greatest difficulties , I can not refrain from touching once more upon this favourite topic. * For those who have at heart the mental improvement of working-men , ought constantly to keep before their minds the truth , that there is nothing in their situation which need debar them from the attainment of even eminence in literature and science . Most of our young men , however , sit down in a sort of stupor or despondency , as if they said to themselves , " Others may deal with books ; but we , who must /z/ work for a living , have no time for such entertainments . " There are a great many in whom the desire of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riddles , twinbrothers , working at the same trade ; I see those young men almost daily , and perceive in their countenances and discourse every sign of intelligence ; yet I dare say they no more think of making any advances in learning , than of becoming governors of states . Yet half an hour a day , properly bestowed , would make them men of valuable information in every common branch of science . If I should urge John Crispin to apply himself to books , he would perhaps drop his lapstone and hammer , and exclaim , " What ! a shoemaker get learning ! " Yes ; certainly . Why not ? Joseph Pendrell , William Gifford , and Robert Bloomfield were all shoemakers , and all men of learning . Roger Sherman was a shoemaker , and he became first a congress-man and then a judge . He had no education but that of the commonschool , and worked at his trade for some time after he was of age . He used to sit at his bench with a book open before him , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In later life , men of the most finished education were accustomed to look up to him with reverence . Mr. Macon once said , " Roger Sherman had more common sense than any man I ever knew . " Mr. Jefferson once exclaimed , as he pointed to him , " That is Mr. Sherman , of Connecticut , who never /z/ said a foolish thing in his life . " He was a true Christian , a defender of virtue , and a daily student of the Bible . In like manner , my friend Shem Blue , the carpenter , would stare if I should hint to him the possibility of mixing a little study with his work . But I could tell him of SAMUEL LEE , one of the greatest linguists now living , who once handled the plane and chisel . He began to learn the carpenter 's trade at the age of twelve , and was seventeen before he ever thought of foreign tongues . He began with the Latin , in order to understand the quotations in English books . By dint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after volume at book-stalls , and , reading at night , went on till he had gained some knowledge of Greek , Hebrew , Chaldee , and Syriac . His learning brought him into notice ; he became a schoolmaster , and at length a clergyman and professor . Now I do not advise our young carpenters to study the dead languages , unless they feel an irresistible bent towards them ; but I press on them this instance to show , that a little self-denial and perseverance will enable them to lay in a great stock of useful knowledge , such as may fit them for the most intelligent society ; and perhaps raise them to high office . A leading journal of New York informs us that but a few years ago JOSEPH RITNER , late governor of Pennsylvania , cracked his whip and whistled to his six horse team as briskly as any other wagoner who crossed the Alleghanies /z/ THOMAS EWING , a most distinguished senator , was once known chiefly as an athletic woodsman . But there is perhaps no instance of successful study , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the blacksmith whose history has been given to the public through his own letter to Governor Everett of Massachusetts . This sketch should not be confined to the newspapers . " I was the youngest , " says the writer , " of many brethren , and my parents were poor . My means of education were limited to the advantages of a district school , and those again were circumscribed by my father 's death , which deprived me , at the age of fifteen , of those scanty opportunities which I had previously enjoyed . A few months after his decease , I apprenticed myself to a blacksmith in my native village . Thither I carried an indomitable taste for reading , which I had previously acquired through the medium of the society library ; all the historical works in which I had at that time perused . At the expiration of a little more than half my apprenticeship , I suddenly conceived the idea of studying Latin . Through the assistance of my elder brother , who had himself obtained a collegiate education by his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one winter . After some time devoted to Cicero and a few other Latin authors , I commenced the Greek . At this time it was necessary that I should devote every hour of daylight and a part of the evening to the duties of my apprentice- /z/ ship . Still I carried my Greek grammar in my hat , and often found a moment , when I was heating some large iron , when I could place my book , open before me against the chimney of my forge , and go through with tupto , tupteis , tuptei , unperceived by my fellow-apprentices , and , to my confusion of face , with a detrimental effect to the charge in my fire . At evening , I sat down unassisted and alone to the Iliad of Homer , twenty books of which measured my progress in that language during the evenings of another winter . I next turned to the modern languages , and was much gratified to learn that my knowledge of the Latin furnished me with a key to the literature of most of the languages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire of acquainting myself with the philosophy , derivation , and affinity of the different European tongues . I could not be reconciled to limit myself in these investigations to a few hours after the arduous labours of the day . I therefore laid down my hammer and went to New Haven , where I recited to native teachers in French , Spanish , German , and Italian . I returned at the expiration of two years to the forge , bringing with me such books in those languages as I could procure . When I had read these books through , I commenced the Hebrew with an awakened desire of examining another field ; and by assiduous application I was enabled in a few weeks to read this language with such facility , that I allotted it to myself as a task , to read two chapters in the /z/ Hebrew Bible before breakfast each morning ; this and an hour at noon being all the time that I could devote to myself during the day . After becoming somewhat familiar with this language , I looked around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriental literature , and , to my deep regret and concern , I found my progress in this direction hedged up by the want of requisite books . I immediately began to devise means of obviating this obstacle ; and , after many plans , I concluded to seek a place as a sailor on board some ship bound to Europe , thinking in this way to have opportunities of collecting at different ports such works in the modern and oriental languages as I found necessary for this object . I left the forge and my native place to carry this plan into execution . I travelled on foot to Boston , a distance of more than a hundred miles , to find some vessel bound to Europe . In this I was disappointed , and while revolving in my mind what steps to take , accidentally heard of the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester . I immediately bent my steps towards this place . I visited the hall of the American Antiquarian Society , and found here , to my infinite gratification , such a collection of ancient , modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be collected in one place ; and , sir , you may imagine with what sentiments of gratitude I was affected , when , upon evincing a desire to examine some of these rich and rare works , I was kindly invited to an unlimited participation in all the benefits of this /z/ noble institution . Availing myself of the kindness of the directors , I spent about three hours daily at the hall , which , with an hour at noon , and about three in the evening , make up the portion of the day which I appropriate to my studies , the rest being occupied in arduous manual labour . Through the facilities afforded by this institution , I have been able to add so much to my previous acquaintance with the ancient , modern , and oriental languages , as to be able to read upwards of fifty of them with more or less facility . " This , it must be admitted , is an extreme case , and is to be regarded as a prodigy . We can not expect to see many such blacksmiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves , as Mr. Everett observed , when he introduced it to the friends of education in Bristol , that the mechanic , the engineer , the husbandman , the trader , have quite as much leisure as the average of men in the learned professions . Let me close this paper with a remark which may serve as an encouragement to many who late in life begin to regret their neglect of past opportunities . There is such a thing as acquiring wisdom even without many books , and without great learning . " Knowledge and wisdom , far from being one , Have ofttimes no connexion . Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other men ; Wisdom in minds attentive to their own . " * /z/ " Man 's life , sir , being So short , and then the way that leads unto The knowledge of ourselves , so long and tedious , Each minute should be precious . " /z/ THE busiest men have some moments which they do not spend upon their regular callings : these are the moments which I have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some may think it , these unemployed hours often hang heavily even upon those who have been tasked all day . This is the case with all artisans whose work has dead intermissions ; with many who only labour by daylight , and with the whole race of city clerks . Where dissipation does not come in , the mind will corrode itself , and become worn by melancholy broodings . This might be happily prevented by a little regular study . As a remarkable instance of the happy use of time borrowed from sleep , I will give the following account which I have received from a clergyman who was well acquainted with the subject of the narrative . " In the first settlement of New Virginia , as the great valley west of the Blue Ridge was then /z/ called , one of the greatest inconveniences experienced was the want of schools . In a certain neighbourhood there was a settler who had received an excellent English education , and had brought with him a collection of choice books . This farmer agreed , in the long nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young men of the neighbourhood as would resort to him . The offer was embraced by many , and among these was a modest , retiring youth who was learning the carpenter 's trade . The instructor having observed that this youth , whom 1 will designate by his initials S. L. , had a thirst for learning and was fond of reading , paid particular attention to him , and not only lent him good books , but gave him good advice as to the best method of redeeming time . S. L. profited by this advice , and being obliged to work hard all day , he adopted the practice of rising before day , and spending two hours in reading , before other people were out of bed . This practice grew into a settled habit , and was uniformly pursued through a long life , except when interrupted by bad health or some other unusual circumstance . By industry and economy the young man acquired not only competence but affluence . His house was distinguished for hospitality and good order . But what surprised all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge on almost all practical subjects . There were few valuable books in English , then common , with the contents of which /z/ he was not well acquainted . Theology was his favourite pursuit , with all branches of which he had an intimate knowledge . But his reading was extended to all useful subjects . He could converse with the divine upon all the nice points of theology ; with the lawyer and politician upon the great principles of natural law ; and with the physician on the structure of the human frame , and the nature and cure of the diseases to which it is liable . While his mind was thus richly stored with useful knowledge , he never made any parade of his learning , nor had a semblance of pedantry ; indeed , he did not assume any superiority on this account over his more ignorant neighbours . His judgment was as sound and discriminating as his knowledge was extensive ; and his truth and integrity were never called in question . As a magistrate , as an elder , as an arbitrator , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literary institutions . " In his latter years he took occasion to speak in the way of affectionate advice to a descendant of his early instructor , on which occasion he said , ' I feel it to be my duty to use this freedom towards the grandson of one to whom I owe all the little knowledge thai I possess . It was your grandfather 's counsel , and his lending me books that first put me in the way of reading and acquiring useful knowledge ; and therefore I can not but feel interested in the temporal and spiritual welfare of his offspring . ' " /z/ Dr. Johnson used to relate , that he was once applied to by a man who was clerk to a very eminent trader , and who was half-crazed with some scrupulosity of conscience . " I asked him , " said Johnson , " when he left the counting-house of an evening ? ' At seven o'clock , sir . ' ' And when do you go to bed , sir ? ' ' At twelve o'clock . ' ' Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned thus much by my new acquaintance that five hours of the four-and-twenty unemployed are enough for ' a man to go mad in : so I would advise you , sir , to study algebra , if you are not an adept already in it ; your head would get less muddy . ' " * In correspondence with this , the same great scholar used to advise young people never to be without a book in their pocket , to be read at times when they had nothing else to do . " It has been by that means , " said he one day to a boy at Mr. Thrale 's , " that all my knowledge has been gained , except what I have picked up by running about the world with my wits ready to observe , and my tongue ready to talk . " Learn to husband your odd moments . While a companion keeps you out of employment you may gain a new idea . I have been acquainted with a man who committed to memory much valuable matter while he was shaving ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseback ; one of these being the late learned and eloquent Dr. Speece of Virginia . Since the /z/ application of steam to spinning , those who attend the mules may read during the intervals . A mule spinner in England told Mr. Tutfnell , that in this manner he had perused several volumes . While dinner waits , one may study a minute , or even write . " I had heard , " says Madame de Genlis , " that M. d'Aguesseau had written in a few years four volumes quarto , by employing the fifteen minutes a day which Madame d'Aguesseau occupied in arranging her dress before coming down to dinner . I profited by the example . The hour of dinner at the Palais Royal was fixed at two , but the Duchesse de Chartres was never ready for a quarter of an hour later ; and when I came down at the appointed time , I was always desired to wait fifteen or twenty minutes . I spent that time in writing in a distinct and small hand a selection of poetry from various authors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not be confined to lords and ladies . In shops , and factories , and sitting-rooms , and nurseries , the same thing may be attempted . Make the most of reading aloud . Where there is a room full of people , one who has leisure may thus instruct a dozen , or a score ; provided the work is not noisy . In country places , or where operations are carried on at home , a little child may instruct the whole family . The wife and daughters may hear as well as sew . Indeed , it needs but little contrivance , in some large families , to have some instruction or entertainment going on all the while . /z/ There are few men who do not undervalue what may be attained drop by drop . But rocks are worn away thus , and fortunes are made thus . Through the little slit in the counter , pence and sixpences fall into the till , which in the end make the tradesman 's fortune . Why should not knowledge be gained in the same way ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought ; no plan is laid ; no effort begun . " It is astonishing , " says Sir Walter Scott , " how far even half an hour a day , regularly bestowed on one object , will carry a man in making himself master of it . The habit of dawdling away time is easily acquired , and so is that of putting every moment either to use or amusement . " In order to gain the most , the book must be chosen , to prevent all vacillation ; and in the very spot , to prevent all delay . It is well if it be in the pocket , or on the bench , or ready opened at the place in the window-seat . O ! who but those who have experienced it can tell the rapture with which knowledge is gathered in these hurried moments ! What is thus read can not but stick fast . The man who studies thus keeps his mind always on the alert . While the wealthy scholar often lounges away whole afternoons on the sofa of his library , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow who hangs over a book-stall , or snatches a moment from his work , is enjoying a paradise of intellectual satisfaction . These are the cheap pleasures which can be caught only under pressure : for there are /z/ joys peculiar to men in straits . I have cited Johnson : his greatest attainments were made during his greatest poverty . At one time , when he was called upon by a learned friend , he had but one chair in his apartment , and that stood on three legs : he probably enjoyed his books as much as when his library consisted of five thousand volumes . Every child knows the avidity with which he poaches among forbidden books . Little Walter Scott used to creep out of bed and read for several hours by fire-light : no man has done more to lay similar temptations in the way of others . In fine , where there is a will there will be a way ; and there is nothing so much to be deplored as the stupid indifference with which many who most need the awakening influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one in five hundred be helped up a single round of the ladder , I shall be of good cheer still . /z/ " From hence the rudiments of art began ; A coal , or chalk , first imitated man : Perhaps the shadow , taken on a wall , Gave outlines to the rude original . " /z/ MANY persons look upon drawing as a mere accomplishment ; something fitted for the misses of a boarding-school , or the parlour of a travelling dandy . This is a very partial and absurd view of the subject . However the art may be abused , as the sister art of writing also is , it is , in many respects , and to many persons , one of the useful rather than the fine arts . It has been properly said , by Mr. Rembrandt Peale , that writing is nothing else than drawing the forms of letters ; and drawing is little more than writing the forms of objects . If proper methods were employed , the art might be very advantageously introduced into the primary instruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculty of accurate observation , and there is no trade in which form is concerned , to which it may not contribute in a /z/ high degree . The architect and the painter must of course be draftsmen ; but we may add to these every trade which regards decoration . To have freedom and grace in sketching is of value to weavers , upholsterers , paper-hangers , coach-makers and trimmers , calico-printers , silver-platers , turners , and many other classes of artisans which need not now be named . Almost a century ago , in 1741 , the Bishop of St. Asaph published a sermon upon the then unpopular subject of general education , in which are found the following remarkable suggestions , which it seems to be reserved for our age to carry into execution- " Several gentlemen of great knowledge in business , true friends to these schools , and prudently desirous to establish a suitable plan of education in them , have yet been of opinion , that if the children were taught , as they might be at small expense , something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects . For this they urge the great perfection to which silk manufactures are now advanced in England , so as to equal if not exceed a rival nation in that commodity , except in the figure , and what is called the fancy of a pattern , which this instruction might supply : that in France the very poorest of the children are all taught to draw ; that the benefits of that branch of skill are very great , for it not only multiplies persons capable of drawing patterns , and thereby lessens the expense to the manufacturer , but likewise greatly assists in the /z/ performance of the work itself , as a workman who can himself draw a pattern will finish with greater truth and greater despatch , any given pattern , whether drawn by his own or by another hand . " The same remarks , with little alteration , might be applied to the work of cabinet-makers , moulders , founders , and especially the makers and decorators of porcelain and other fine ware . In 1835 , a report was printed by a Select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arts as applied to manufactures ; in this a number of statements occur , which confirm the view I am now presenting . As it regards the silk-manufacture , Mr. Skene testified that the English workmen copied their patterns almost entirely from the French . As to the uses of design , Mr. Harrington , an eminent silk-manufacturer , said to the committee : " We would willingly , at the present time , engage a man at a handsome salary , conversant with the principle of weaving , as a designer , and also to put the pattern upon paper . " The importance of cultivated taste in drawing , even with respect to iron-manufacture , will appear from the evidence of Mr. Smith , of Sheffield , a partner in a house which expends about six thousand dollars a year in models for stove grates and fenders ; this gentleman declaring that he would not hesitate to spend two or three hundred pounds in a model for a grate , if the pattern were protected . Lei the reader call to mind American stoves , in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messrs . Rundell and Bridge , the celebrated jewellers , employed a person to design for them , to whom they paid more than two thousand dollars a year , and supplied him with a house to live in . Charles Toplis , Esq. , a vice-president of the London Mechanics ' Institute , gave in evidence as his opinion that drawing was of high value to a large portion of inventive artisans . " All works of construction , " says he , " require to be preceded by a design on paper , or a proportionate delineation , which is often to be done by the workman himself . Workmen in these branches must therefore be necessarily trained to the accurate use of drawing-instruments , and their operations are frequently much assisted when they can express their designs by sketches made by the unguided hand . The workmen whose province it is to shape and give form to materials , are greatly aided in their operations when they can delineate the contours of the forms they wish to impart , or can model them in a yielding matter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms set before them for imitation during the course of their instruction in drawing or modelling . " Again : " In the porcelain manufacture , " says Mr. Toplis , " it is requisite that a painter there should be able to paint landscapes and other natural objects , perhaps to compose pictures ; but at all events he should be able to copy a landscape and other representation accurately . " The interior decoration of houses , whether by /z/ means of the builder and joiner , or the painter , paper-hanger , and upholsterer , presents a wide field for the display of taste and genius in the art of design . In the examination before the committee of the House of Commons , Mr. Cockerell , the distinguished architect , explained the opinions of the ancient Greeks on this subject . " We know , " said he , " that a stranger who established a new branch of manufacture in Athens obtained the rights of a citizen . Athens and . Egina were the greatest manufactories of Greece in all works connected with fine arts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greece than any other nation . The manufacture of bronzes , especially candelabra , is celebrated by Pliny . " Mr. C. H. Smith , a sculptor of architectural ornaments , stated to the committee , that he always found those workmen who could draw , if ever so little , were more useful to him than those who were totally unable to use a pencil . " I recently , " said he , " sent my foreman into Yorkshire with work ; on his arrival , he found difficulties arose which he had not ( nor had I ) anticipated ; but by letter to me , illustrated by his sketches , he explained all that I could wish for . " There are many cases in which an exact draft will enable an architect or workman to ascertain , without calculation , the extent and direction of lines which , but for this , would demand the most abstruse investigations of mathematics . I have also been informed by a gentleman much conversant with /z/ such matters , that in cases where there is doubt as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manufacturers find great advantage in making a draught of the size of nature , from the inspection of which they can form conjectures approaching to absolute accuracy . It is believed that our great Fulton , in his long train of experiments , received incalculable aid from his expertness in the art of design ; for he was not merely a draughtsman , but a master of painting and perspective . It is stated by Mr. Guillotte , a maker of the Jacquard looms , that art is much cheaper in France than in England ; of course far cheaper than in America . A French capitalist employs three or four artists , where in England one artist would supply eight or ten manufacturers . Thus , in England , the designer of the pattern and he who transfers it to the manufacture are distinct persons ; in France , the workman is himself the artist . " The French , " says Mr. Cockerell , " have long been celebrated for their attention to design in manufactures . Their zeal in this pursuit is nowhere more manifest than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of the material and pattern of the Cachemire shawl by M. Fernaux , and in the later investigations of M. Couder . M. Couder has established a school for shawl designs at Paris . " In Prussia , the national system includes instruction in the principles of art . There are four /z/ schools of design , at Breslau , Kcenigsberg , Dantzic , and Cologne . Professor Beuth , the director of the Trade Institution at Berlin , several years ago published a work at the expense of the government , with copperplate engravings of models from the ancients and the middle ages , for the use of the pupils . " It is stated , " says the committee above named , " that the influence of Prof. Beuth 's publication is already perceptible in the shops and dwelling-houses at Berlin . " Drawing is taught in every school in Bavaria . At Bruges , gratuitous instruction in drawing is given to six or seven hundred young men , and prizes are awarded annually ; something of the same kind is observed at Antwerp . Besides this encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected for three months . In France , when a boy draws well , and shows genius , he is in great demand among the leading houses , and is often fortunate enough to be taken as a partner . Many facts might be stated , which would show that far more attention is paid to this useful art in France and Switzerland than among ourselves . Among these a striking one is extracted from M. Simond 's Switzerland . " M. de Candolle , Professor of Botany at Geneva , but whose reputation is European , made use , in a course of lectures , of a very valuable collection of drawings of American plants , intnisted to him by a celebrated Spanish botanist , who having occasion for this collection sooner than was expected , sent for it back again . /z/ M. de Candolle , having communicated the circumstance to his audience , with the expression of his regrets , some ladies who attended the lectures offered to copy , with the aid of some of their friends , the whole collection in a week ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixty in number , and filling thirteen folio volumes , were executed by one hundred and fourteen female artists ; one of the ladies indeed did forty of them . In most cases , the principal parts only of each plant are coloured , the rest only traced with accuracy : the execution in general very good , and in some instances quite masterly . There is not , perhaps , another town of twenty-three thousand souls , where such a number of female artists , the greater part of course amateurs , could be found . " The instance is in point to show how easily and how widely a degree of skill in this art may be diffused . That which is learned by so many may be easily learned . I hope some readers of these hints will be led forthwith to furnish themselves with drawing materials . The extensive class of house-painters contains many who might rise to great eminence . Let me address them in the language of one of their own craft , Mr. D. R. Hay of Edinburgh . He was asked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of study for persons intended for a profession like your own , or best adapted to improve the taste of the working-class generally ? " He replied ; " It is in the first place to initiate /z/ them in the drawing of large symmetrical figures by the hand . " Symmetrical figures are such as squares , ovals , and circles . They should then practise undulations and volutes . Their attention should then be directed to the vegetable kingdom , and they should begin their practice by studying from large well-developed leaves . All the common woods , that grow in such profusion by our hedgerows and road-sides , as also in the wildest and most sterile parts of the country , are worthy of the study and attention of those who wish to improve their taste in regard to what is really elegant or beautiful in form . Both grace and elegance of form are to be found in the common dock , the thistle , the fern , or even in a stalk of corn or barley . The study of such objects is within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their taste , when they come to study the ornamental remains of Greece and Rome , will find themselves familiar with the source from which such designs are derived . /z/ " Wealth , gathered long and slowly ; thoughts divine Heap that full treasure-house ; and thou hast made The gems of many a spirit 's ocean thine ; Shall the dark waters to oblivion bear A pyramid so fair 1 " /z/ THIS paper may catch the eye of some young man whose earnest desire it is to improve his mind , and who is carrying on , to the best of his ability , the work of self-education . Such a one , I take for granted , will not despise any suggestions bearing on his main pursuit , from an unknown adviser who has long been making an endeavour of the very same kind . My remarks are intended to bear upon a single faculty ; that is to say , on the memory . Words would be wasted if I were to set about the task of showing the importance of the human memory . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of our intellectual powers which is more neglected and even abused , and this even in our courses of popular education ; and , if I err not , it is a fault which becomes every day more common . The error of former ages /z/ was one directly opposite ; and as extremes often concur , it still shows itself in some particular branches of study ; but the popular method leaves memory very much in the background . There is nothing in which there is more quackery than in our public schools ; and this is no longer wonderful , when we consider in how many cases the instruction of youth is the dernier resort of those who can make their bread in no other way . An active competition springs up between rival teachers , and every means is used to give eclat and notoriety . It is the vanity of our age to be philosophic ; the phrase is applied to every thing . We are all philosophers . We all babble concerning Bacon , and the Inductive Philosophy . Thousands who have never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this or that school or school-book as being on the principles of the inductive system . Our babes learn the A B C on the principles of the immortal Bacon . All this would be very innocent , if it were not made a stalking-horse for the introduction of noxious errors in education ; and you had better filch a purse from me , than set me awry in bringing up my children . It is a part of this rigmarole of smattering teachers , to declare that all the old ways of teaching were slavish and useless . I agree that , in some respects , some of them were so . As a general declaration , however , it is far from being true . Our new instructors teach phi losophically . They educe the mind . They are /z/ resolved to teach nothing but what the child can understand as it goes along . Therefore all the old rules and antiquated catechisms are thrust aside ; they are a mere load of undigested stuff upon the mind . The little infant prattlers are forsooth to analyze every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made gaudy and attractive ; all rules become illustrations ; and all journeying to science is on the royal road . Of other evils consequent upon this method it is not within my scope to speak , but I adduce its bad effects in the affair above mentioned . According to this plan the memory is an inferior power , to be used as little as possible ; and as a matter of fact it is immeasurably less tasked in all our public schools , than it was thirty years ago . Everywhere , among young men , I hear the most honest complaints about defect of memory ; and if things go on as they have begun , we shall do all within our power to reduce it to imbecility . I appeal to the experience and observation of parents : let us come to plain fact . Do your children commit to memory as much as you used to do ? I ask not whether it is for better or for worse , but do they bring home as many evening-tasks as you once did ? Do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dryden , and with " capping verses " ? Do the girls carry in their memory , as you used to do , scores of fine extracts from Pope and Thomson ? Your reply will attest the truth of ray remark , that this ' faculty is neglected /z/ in our schools : we may have some indemnity , but unquestionably the memory is not improved . This is a clear going backwards . Nor is it single ; it is part and parcel of a system . The plan of the age comprises , the spirit of the age almost insures , this very thing . Look about among your friends ; compare the young with the old . I venture to anticipate your conclusion ; you find the memory of the latter more rich in special deposits of knowledge than the former ; more fine old ingots of fact and poetry laid up in treasure . This is one of the evils attendant on a great blessing : it is the tax we pay for the multiplicity of our books . Where books are many , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way ; where they are few , we resort to them again and again , as men drink out of their own wells . The poor man with few books is observed , even in our day , to peruse and reperuse until he has mastered their whole contents . Before the invention of printing this was often the case ; as it now is in those Mohammedan countries where all books are in manuscript . The poems of Homer were repeated for generations by strolling rhapsodists , or minstrels , before they were committed to writing ; and long after they were transcribed , they were in whole or in large part treasured in the minds of the people . It was said in my hearing by Dr. Wolff , the celebrated missionary , that a European or American would be astonished at the number of persons in Persia /z/ who know by rote all the productions of their principal poets . Among the Mohammedans it is a common achievement to commit the Koran to memory . The following Egyptian anecdote is related in Mr. Lane 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man was employed in Cairo to be a schoolmaster . He could neither read nor write , but he could recite the Koran from beginning to end . His plan was , to hear the boys repeat their lessons , which are always in this book . As to the writing , he employed the head-boy in the school to attend to this , pretending that his eyes were weak . A few days after he had taken upon himself this office , a poor woman brought a letter for him to read to her from her son , who had gone on pilgrimage . He pretended to read it , but said nothing ; and the woman , inferring from his silence that the letter contained bad news , said to him , Shall I shriek ? " He answered , ' Yes . ' Shall I rend my clothes ? ' He answered , ' Yes . ' So the poor woman returned to her house , and with her assembled friends performed the lamentation and other ceremonies usual on the occasion of death . Not many days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he could mean by giving her such an alarm . The explanation was given , the letter was produced , and the teacher was called to account for his imposture . His ready apology was : God alone knows futurity ! How could I /z/ know that your son would arrive in safety t It was better that you should think him dead , than expect to see him and be disappointed . ' " As to the Jews , it is not only a common thing for them to have the whole Hebrew Bible in their memory , but also large portions of the Talmud , which is a collection of comments five or six times as extensive . One of their own chroniclers relates a fact which illustrates this observation . In the seventh century the copies of the Talmud became very scarce in Persia , in consequence of one of those hideous persecutions to which this unconquerable race has been so often subjected . A celebrated Rabbi , fearing lest the precious work should be irreparably lost , fell upon the happy expedient of consigning it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving to each a single treatise . At the appointed time the scholars were assembled , and the immense work was rehearsed without the error of a jot or tittle . Strange as this legend may seem , I think it right to say , that it is cited with credence by an eminent German author of our day , who adds this declaration : " Even now , I would wager , that the same experiment would have a like result . The most orthodox Jews , those most attached to the Talmud , among all who live in Europe , are to be found in Lithuania and Poland . Now let the prince who reigns over them send forth an edict through his extensive dominions , that at the end of three months every Talmud shall be delivered up and /z/ destroyed , except a single one with which to make the trial . Within four months the Jews will produce twelve rabbins who shall repeat the contents of the work word for word . " * Indeed , a Jew has exhibited himself in London within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proof of his having every word of this immense mass in his memory . It would be tedious to recite the instances of amazing memory given in ancient books . Themistocles learned to speak Persian in a year . Mithridates knew two - and - twenty languages . Crassus professed to be familiar with five dialects of the Greek tongue . Cyrus remembered the names of all his soldiers.t Theodectes could repeat any number of verses which were read to him . Erasmus knew all Terence and Horace by heart ; and Beza could repeat the Psalms in Hebrew , and St. Paul 's epistles in Greek . The great Pascal , in modern times , had a memory from which nothing seemed to escape . In our own country Dr. Nisbet , once president of Dickinson College , is reported to have known every line in Virgil . But I am becoming prolix , and must therefore take a fresh pen for the more practical part of my subject . * Professor Gfriirer , of Stuttgart , in his History of Primitive Christianity . f Quintilian , last . Orat lib. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory her ideal train preserves Entire ; or when they would elude her watch , Reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the waste Of dark oblivion . " AKENSIDE . ARISTOTLE held , as I am told by the schoolmaster , that all remembrance is owing to a physical impression made on the brain . Thus he is enabled to account for the quickness and shortness of memory in children ; because the brain of the little one is soft , and therefore easily takes a mark , and as easily loses it . On the other hand , the brain of old men is tough and rigid , so that it neither takes nor loses an impression with facility . This theory is exploded , but it still serves to illustrate the principle that it is in early life that the memory must be chiefly disciplined . This is a most important truth in education , but very much overlooked in the pretended philosophy of education . It is important as directing us to the proper studies for our children . There are some things which we must teach them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter : there are other things which we must teach them hereafter , because they can not learn them any better , if even so well , now . The things which children should learn now , are all those which exercise memory rather than reason : such is whatever concerns language , and whatever it is important to remember in certain terms . All rules and forms which will be perpetually coming into play in subsequent studies or in active life , should be deeply engraven upon the memory . Rules of grammar , religious catechisms , and the words of Holy Scripture are especially of this sort . And that parent is trifling with the future happiness and usefulness of his child , who allows himself to be decoyed into the absurd rule of inculcating nothing upon the memory until it can be comprehended by the understanding . But I must leave the children , and return to the young men . What are they to do ? And especially what are they to do , if they have heretofore been neglected ? Is there any chance of redeeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for despair ? One of my maxims about every thing is , Never despair : another maxim is , Never stand still ; that is , never , in youth or age , allow yourself to think you have reached the ne plus ultra . Resolve to reform every error , to cure every disorder , and to supply every defect , as long as you live . Instead therefore of indulging in pusillanimous complaints and indolent wishes about the defects of your memory , set about sup- /z/ plying them . The very thing I am writing for is to induce you to undertake this very work . Your whole success depends upon two quite simple principles : FIRST . The memory must be exercised . The law of all our powers , of mind and body , is the same . They grow in proportion to their healthful exercise . It is so with muscles . Compare the arm of the tailor with that of the blacksmith or the woodman . Compare the voice of the chimney-sweep with that of the silent houseservant . Compare your own hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse o ( your own . If your memory is weak , it is probably from want of exercise . Not but that there are great original diversities ; but still there is not more than one in five hundred whose memory might not be improved to a degree sufficient for every useful purpose . You have either been entirely neglected , or the discipline of your memory , having been attended to in your childhood , has since been intermitted . If the former , you have no recollection of any labours in this kind ; if the latter , you find it much harder to get any thing by rote than once you did . Whichever of these is the case , you are now to begin , and practise , by suitable degrees . Though it is a faculty which admits of being put upon immense exertions where it has been trained , it must be brought up from decay by degrees . You must commit to memory , as a task . The task must /z/ be frequently renewed , and the matters given in charge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friend , the schoolmaster , declares to me that he has seen the most astonishing cures wrought among his lads . He has a number of little rules respecting memory , which are worth being recorded . Here are some of them . Memory depends on three things . 1 . Attention . Attend and you will remember . The more you attend , the better will you remember . Great fixedness of attention will burn the thing into your mind . Perhaps the whole of your difficulty has this origin . If so , you must go back one step , and cultivate the habit of concentrating your thoughts . 2 . Repetition . Repeat and you will remember . Drop after drop wears away rocks . But a particular sort of repetition must be recommended : Repeat and examine yourself . This is the remark of Lord Bacon , and almost every child has tried the experiment : " You will not so easily learn a piece of writing by rote by reading it over twenty times , as by reading it over ten times and trying every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fail . " * 3 . Associations of pleasure or pain . Even a dog remembers where he has been whipped , and an ox where he has been watered . It was the /z/ custom , in old times , in England , to whip the boys of a neighbourhood at each of the marchstones , or division marks between parishes ; in order to fix it in their memories . The Choctaws are said to inculcate their traditions upon the young people , in a similar way . I would not , indeed , prescribe self-flagellation , great as its virtues are supposed to be in some orders of monks , but would strenuously recommend it to you , to call up as vivid associations of a pleasurable kind as you can around those things which you endeavour to remember . The schoolmaster declares that he is convinced the ancients were right in enjoining it on their scholars when they wished to learn any thing with remarkable ease , to sleep upon it ; that is to rehearse it just before going to rest , and just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This principle is not less important than the foregoing , though less obvious . Those have the most accurate , prompt , and faithful recollection , who confide most to their memory . It is a jealous faculty , and does not willingly see its functions assigned to another . Men who make it their habit to carry every thing in their heads , seldom blunder ; men who jot down every thing are lost without their tablets . The penny-post knows a list of more names and numbers than you or I could commit to memory in a week . A respectable merchant lately said to me , " I have scarcely any memory , /z/ and I attribute it to the habit of our business , in which we never trust any thing to our recollection , without an entry in some book . " Judge Y , of New York , used to declare that without his notes of evidence he could not aver that this or that witness had made any observation . This agrees with what is said by old Montaigne : " I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so great is my difficulty in remembering proper names , that I am forced to call my domestic servants by their offices . " On the other hand , the schoolmaster relates of Hortensius , the great rival of Cicero , that he could attend a protracted auction , and then at the end of the sale give as accurate a list of items and prices as the clerks who kept minutes . I can believe this the more readily from what I have myself known of an analogous feat in an eminent merchant of a southern city . Practise then upon the maxim , to intrust every thing to your memory which may be done so safely . What we sometimes hear about " overburdening the memory " is the mere cant of a false philosophy . Memory is not a beast of burden . No man ever realized the threatened evil . We may make our memory labour to weariness at one time ; so may we do with the judgment . But in neither case is it the multitude of particulars which distresses the mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injurious ; but this is clearly distinct from going beyond its /z/ capacity . We may further try to remember too much . But that any pain or other evil is consequent from the mere amount of things actually remembered , I resolutely deny . Trust your memory therefore . Beware of an inordinate use of common-place books . They have their use ; but you will often find that a great transcriber into such volumes leaves all his stores behind him when he shuts his study-door . And I have heard the schoolmaster read passages out of Bayle , going to show that all common-place books were condemned by several of the most learned men of former days ; as by Saumaise or Salmasius , by Menage , and by Govean ; the last of whom went so far that he would not admit pen and ink into his library , lest transcription should interrupt his thinking and impair his memory. * It must be confessed that this would be ruinous to a poor writer of scraps , such as myself . /z/ " Home-keeping youth have ever homely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which we go from one place to another makes us a travelling people , perhaps to as great an extent as is true of any equal number of persons in the world . Go when you will upon any of the great thoroughfares , as between Boston and Providence , between Baltimore and Philadelphia , or especially between Philadelphia and New York , and you find the steamers , cars , and coaches filled with wanderers . I never cease to wonder as to what may be the impelling motive with so great a number , for so long a period . I have nevertheless been led to the opinion that our artisans do not travel a great deal , or even as much as several other classes which might be named . It is true they , like their neighbours , must sometimes change their place . When work is dull in one town they go to another , and there are thus two streams of workmen perpetually setting between our two great cities ; while , in a smaller degree , a similar circulation of labour is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cur- /z/ *ent of emigrants to the west , and in this there is always a considerable infusion of mechanical labour . But still , whatever may be done from necessity , mechanics as a class do not jaunt about much for pleasure , or for the purpose of gaining those particular advantages which have been supposed to result from travelling . Yet the mechanic often needs recreation and change of air ; and where his business admits of it , it would be well if he could more frequently roam a little over the face of our wide land . In some countries , it is thought so important for young mechanics to travel for improvement in their craft , that it is enjoined by law . This is particularly the case in the German states , and deserves consideration from our enterprising mechanics . A German artisan is not thought to have completed his education until he has spent some months or years in working abroad . The custom is very ancient , and arose in a time when the modes of communicating knowledge which we now have were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Builder 's or Millwright 's Guides , no Manuals for Weavers , Watchmakers , or Dyers , no Tailor 's Magazines . Men of trades as well as men of letters were forced to go from place to place , in order to pick up the nicer operations of their craft . The stream of travel naturally tended from the ruder to the more civilized nations . In the middle ages , when Germany was rough and Italy refined , the young men who followed in the train /z/ of German princes and nobles on their expedition* to the south , brought back new trades and new methods from Tuscany or Venice . From being an accidental thing it grew to be imperative , and the Guilds or Trades ' Unions of that day made it a condition of entrance into their bodies , that the applicant should have spent a certain number of years away from the place of his apprenticeship . They regarded this as indispensably necessary to the dignity and improvement of their calling . This was very important when every art was a mystery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nostrum of a quack . It was often but little of a trade that the masterworkman could give his boys ; and even where he was skilled , he - too frequently kept his own secret , or set on it an exorbitant price . To acquire the higher polish of the art , a young man must go through other countries , and pick up as much as possible of their improvements . In this wcmderjahre , or year of wandering , the journeyman found many things to learn . He saw some or all the materials of his daily operations , in their place of origin , or in great factories ; he consulted with celebrated artisans , or worked in favoured establishments , and beheld the - highest achievements of his art . The manifest tendency of the system was to equalize information , to throw happy inventions into the common stock ; to awaken emulation and quicken genius ; to enlarge THE WORKING-MAN 'S JOUHNEYS . Ill the views and add to the stock of processes . Besides the acknowledged advantages of all travelling , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , it contributed to lessen the number of hands where there were too many , and to furnish labour abroad when it became scarce . The system continues to be thought useful , although it is known to labour under some great disadvantages . It tends in many instances to produce roving habits , and affords great facilities for idleness and dissipation . I am therefore very far from recommending any such regular plan for our own country . But to a certain extent our mechanics might take the hint , and avail themselves of some of the advantages of travelling . I have known one carpenter who made a voyage to Europe for the express purpose of gaining new ideas in his business ; and I see no reason whyit should not be more common with the better class of workmen . Particularly in all that relates to architecture or other decorative arts , it would seem to be highly desirable that the adept should have fully before his mind 's eye the greatest works in his own department . Sir John Soane , the son of a bricklayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of his taste and skill from a visit of some years to Rome . But without crossing the seas , our enterprising artisans might contrive to know a little more about one another . /z/ and to make short trips for health at the same time subservient to the progress of their arts . It has been very common for agriculturists to pursue this plan , as in the case of the noted Arthur Young : why should it not yield its fruits to the mechanic arts ? If the young traveller were to keep a few memoranda of his more valuable observations , it would be a useful exercise for his mind , and would be useful in subsequent years . And if no objection can be raised against this but an indisposition to expend a few dollars , I can only say that this frugality would be much more wisely applied to other and less profitable indulgences . Before leaving this subject , I ought to remind my young readers , that in their journeys for pleasure or business , they may gain a large increase of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Experience soon teaches the traveller , that there is no one from whom either amusement or information may not be extracted . " For ourselves , " says Sir Walter Scott , " we can assure the reader and perhaps if we have ever been able to afford him amusement , it is owing in a great degree to this cause that we never found ourselves in company with the stupidest of all possible companions in a postchaise , or with the most arrant cumber-corner that ever occupied a place in the mail-coach , without finding that , in the course of our conversation with him , we had some ideas suggested to us , /z/ either grave or gay , or some information communicated in the course of our journey , which we should have regretted not to have learned , and which we should be sorry to have immediately forgotten . " /z/ " Ye masters , then , Be mindful of the rough , laborious hand That sinks you soft in elegance and ease ; Be mindful of those limbs in russet clad Whose toil to yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tk ; jng is ever effectually done in this coumry , towaiJs elevating the industrious classes to their due place in society , the work must begin with those who are in youth . In regard to mind , manners , or morals , we can not expect very great improvement IB those who have passed middle life : our endearours should be directed to the apprentice . The relation of master and apprentice was a closer and a warmer one in former days . The lad was willing to allow that he had a master , for a certain time and a certain purpose , and in expectation of being one day a master himself . He thought this was no more disgraceful , than the subordination of the scholar to his teacher , or the soldier to his captain . And , in return , the employer felt a responsibility proportioned to his authority . Good men were accustomed to treat /z/ their apprentices as their sons ; they gave them many little instructions out of the line of the trade , and had an eye to their religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of things is very much altered . Insubordination , radicalism , and a false and impracticable theory of equal rights , have destroyed the gentle authority which used to exist . The whole affair of indentures , as my readers very well know , is in some places becoming a mere formality . It is less common than it used to be for boys to serve out their whole time . Many influences are at work to make lads impatient , and loth to continue in one place , however good . And when they abscond from their proper service , it is not every employer who now thinks it worth his while to take the legal measures for recovering their time . It is known to those who are conversant with mechanical establishments in our cities , that the old-fashioned system is found to be ineffectual ; so that masterworkmen have to try new methods of getting the requisite amount of work from their hands . In some cases , this is effected by small remunerations for task-work . There are many shops in which there are no regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they can get . I have even heard the opinion expressed that the day is not far off when the whole system of apprenticeship will be thrown aside . The spirit of our age and country is a spirit of restless hurry . We are for quick turns , short /z/ cuts , and sudden results . Amidst the increased risks of human life , seven years is a great portion of the human span . Another trait of our national character is a dislike to all rule , just or unjust . It is natural for a boy to prefer variety to sameness of occupation ; and when regular service is no longer compulsory , we must expect to see our youth flying from the severe work of shops to those chance jobs which give bread to so many thousands in our streets . The effects of this condition of things are manifestly bad . We are falling between two systems . We are slipping away from the old plan of former ages , and have not yet alighted upon a better one more suited to modern improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years at their own option , if they may run from one employer to another , upon every whim ; if they may even exchange their trade two or three times before they come of age , is it not as plain as day , that the proportion of really accomplished workmen must lessen from year to year ? And this being the case , several evils must necessarily ensue , which are too obvious to need recital . But the nature of things does not alter : skilled labour , like other commodities , will find a market , and will bring the highest price . This is beginning to show itself in certain kinds of manufacture , in which foreign artisans are coming in , to the exclusion of our own countrymen . It is as vain as it is unrighteous , for us to fold our arms and /z/ raise an outcry against foreign labour , and form associations of native Americans . If we do not secure the thorough trade-education of our own youth , we must expect to see all the finer and more difficult branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am glad to know that this is far from being the case : I speak only of tendencies , and I do not think it can be denied that the tendency of the change I have mentioned is to evil . But there are moral consequences of this relaxation of the old system , which are still more to be deplored . As the tie between the employer and the apprentice becomes slight , there is a lessening of authority on the one side and of duty on the other , as well as of affection on both . We often talk of the advantages of domestic influence , the bonds of the fireside , the charm of . home : and on this point it would be hard for us to speak too much , or too enthusiastically . But where is the apprentice 's home ? It is not in his father 's house : in the greater number of cases , this is not within reach . It is not his employer 's house ; at least under the prevailing system , and in our cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In great manufactories , where there are at least a dozen boys these of course can not be allowed to overrun the employer 's house : they are often put out to board elsewhere . In neither case have they a home . Even where there is only an ordinary number , as the master is no longer a parent , the apprentice feels no longer like a son /z/ Where can he spend his evenings ? Not in the garret or loft where he sleeps : in winter it is cold ; in summer it is suffocating . Not in the kitchen : he would be in the way . Not in the sitting-room : that would be too familiar . Where can he spend the long hours of his Sunday ? Let us look the truth in the face : The apprentice has no home . Is it any wonder that at night we hear the heavy tramp of their feet upon our pavements as they career along by scores ? Is it any wonder that they crowd our oyster-houses , porter-cellars , barrooms , shows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The moral consequences of this I need not dwell upon : they are open to the day . I am not so chimerical as to propose a return to old ways , or to hang on the wheels of modern improvement . I only urge , that the old system of master and apprentice , when carried out in practice , had certain advantages , which are not provided for in our present methods . If we do not wish our young mechanics to become an easy prey to vice , we must set about some preventive measures . The apprentice must have some agreeable place in which to spend his leisure moments . I am accustomed to see some of the best youth I know , passing their Sundays in the street or the fields . Vice opens many doors to the less scrupulous : surely virtue ought to do as much . For a number of years , it has been my deliberate and unchanged opinion , that no roan could bestow a greater benefit /z/ on our working-classes , than he who should devise and offer to apprentices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure hours , where they might not only feel at home , but be out of the reach of temptation , and in the way of mental improvement . It is worthy of consideration in our Lyceums and Mechanics ' Institutes . And if this volume should fall into the hands of any friends of the young mechanic , in such towns or villages as are without Lyceums or Mechanics ' Institutions , I would urge on them a new and strenuous effort to procure the establishment of such truly useful associations . The attempt will cost some pains ; it will be opposed by some , and sneered at by others , and some will stand aloof and recount the history of similar enterprises , and their failure . But , nevertheless , the thing has been done , and can be done again ; and there is no good reason why every town in America should not be adorned by a graceful edifice devoted to the mental improvement of the young artisan . /z/ " Heaven forming each on other to depend , A master , or a servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance call , Till one man 's weakness grows the strength of all . " /z/ UPON the question , What shall be the wages of labour ? the world of enterprise is naturally divided into two parties . For it is obvious , that the employer will desire to give as little as he can , and the workman to receive as much as he can . And in the great majority of instances , the advantage in this contest has been on the side of the master- workmen , as being able to combine more easily , and to subsist longer without new receipts . This state of things , however , has received a very important disturbance from the expansion of the credit system ; which , so far as this controversy is concerned , has brought the two parties more nearly upon a level . In order to place themselves upon terms of some equality in the contest , it was necessary that operatives should in some way or other combine for mutual support ; and in the case of those who are /z/ called " skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sudden and extensive . In attempting to raise and keep up wages above their natural rate , various methods have been used . The most obvious is that of refusing to work for less than a certain sum agreed upon ; and where the combination is universal or very extensive , this is likely to have its effect in the case of skilled labour . Another method not much unlike this in its principle , is that of combining to lessen the hours of labour , the price remaining the same . A third is that of limiting the number of skilled workmen in any district ; and this method has from time to time been imbodied in the municipal customs and statutory provisions of many countries . To this source we owe all the guilds or trade-corporations of England , the statutes of apprenticeship , the tours of journeymen ( wanderjahre ) in Germany , and similar expedients ; the object being in every case the same , namely , to make labour more costly , by making it more difficult to be procured . Upon the same principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been customary to destroy part of the pepper crop in order to raise the price of the commodity . The corporations of the middle ages were the basis of all our municipal privileges , as indeed they were the cradle of modern civic prosperity in general : they were , in those rude periods , a necessary safeguard for the peaceful burgher against the ruthless and iron-handed barons and /z/ their feudatories . But the state of things has greatly changed with the advancement of society . As the defences of established law have formed themselves around the mechanic and the labourer , those irregular and extraordinary provisions should have been abandoned ; as being no less antiquated and no less dangerous than the famous Secret Tribunals of the dark ages ; which nevertheless were almost demanded in a state of things where society was in a perpetual conflict : " For why 1 Because the good old rule Sufficed them ; the simple plan , That they should take who have the power , And they should keep who can . " * But we have lived to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . In the unexampled increase and mighty influence of Trades ' Unions there is every thing to awaken , the interest of the political and the moral philosopher . Viewing what has occurred within a few years , we can only say , with Talleyrand , It is the beginning of the end ! No man can examine the influence of this organization of the working classes , without perceiving that , unless arrested , it must give origin to a state of society totally different from any that the world has ever seen ; whether better or worse than that which has preceded , events will prove . /z/ The early dissensions of republican Rome gave occasion to Menenius Agrippa to rehearse the fable of the Belly and the Members ; an apologue which is no less instructive and appropriate now , than it was then . Nothing can fail to be disorganizing and ruinous , which tends to set the rich against the poor , or marshals these two classes into conflicting hosts . And such is the tendency of that fearful system which is beginning to spread itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , we hear with peril : Safety dwells Remote from multitude . The world 's a school Of wrong , and what proficients swarm around ! We must or imitate or disapprove ; Must list as their accomplices or foes . " /z/ THE true way to judge of Trades ' Unions is to see them at home ; to examine their working in the place of their origin , and where their influence is most extensive . In this country they are still in their infancy , and we can scarcely see their ultimate tendencies ; but in Great Britain and Ireland they have existed for a long period , and we may sit in fair judgment upon their results . Every year brings us nearer and nearer to the transatlantic pattern : we borrow their organization , their methods , their " slang-terms , " and their men . Here , as there , we have our weekly contributions , our forms of initiation , our committees of vigilance , our flags and mottoes and processions . Perhaps in due course of time we may have our burnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we allow things to get to this pass , it becomes us to sit down and count the cost . Let us look into some of the reasons pro and contra . If a contest were necessary between the rich and the poor , ( which we heartily believe it is not , but on the contrary that , in the long run , their interests are identical , ) if it were necessary that capital and labour should be placed in conflict we should be ready to concede that every facility and aid should be allowed to the working-man , because he is under all sorts of disadvantage . This is less true in America , where , for the most part , labour and capital go together ; but in Great Britain mechanics and other labourers need every species of lawful union to bear them up against the weight of capital and easy concert which is marshalled on the other side . No man who has a heart can become acquainted with the distresses which exist in the thronged manufactories of Britain , without being tempted to pray that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved country , where millions of untilled acres still invite the pallid and starving artisan . No wonder the working-classes desire to increase the rewards of labour ; no wonder they take pity on their own flesh and blood , and combine to relieve them . And if wages , by any such expedient , could be made to rise and stand at an elevated point , we should say that the benefit had almost indemnified society for the dreadful losses sustained in the process . If , as has been held by /z/ distinguished economical philosophers , the average rate of wages is an exponent of national prosperity , the Trades ' Unions which should effect this would be public benefactors . And it was in the expectation that the labourer by coping with his employers would in some degree effect this , that the British Parliament removed the restrictions from trade combinations . But to the astonishment of many , and the sorrow of all who know the facts , the chief effect of this repeal has been to increase the misery of the very class which it sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible in its power , and fruitless as to its grand intention . How far does combination tend to produce a permanent elevation of wages ? This is a proper question for seasons of tranquillity , such as the present . In the midst of a panic or a strike it would be vain to agitate it , because the present or proximate advantage the rise of wages , however temporary would dazzle the excited workman , and blind him to future evils . But in this time of contentment we ought to establish principles , which may stand us in stead when the struggle comes . Let us take a case in which the immediate effect of combination is that which was desired ; and this is very common , where the strike has been well-timed , at seasons when great bills are running against employers , and where credit is low , and especially if the establishment is in some degree separate and single-handed . /z/ Here the triumph of the working-man seems to common observers to be complete . But let us look a little deeper . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives , in Newark , to strike for higher wages , and to succeed . Journeymen tailors will be at once tempted to flow in from New York ; and this influx will be in proportion , first , to the general distress , and , secondly , to the amount of increasing remuneration . Of course it will be less than it would be in the case of unskilled labour , such as that of the piecers and pickers in cotton factories ; where the vacuum would be filled up almost immediately . The consequence of this transfer of labour is , that wages rise elsewhere , and by degrees fall here : after a short time the proportion is much what it had been , and the general rise of level is scarcely appreciable . But put the case that all the journeymen tailors , throughout all the country , combine to raise the rate of wages . Here the transfer of labour is more slow , but not less certain . It is now a transfer , not from city to city , but from trade to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trade whose wages are the highest : if the state of things continue , the current will change its bed , and find channels in new sorts of business . The case is extreme ; one so favourable never occurs ; as the struggle is commonly terminated long before any such result can be matured . /z/ But imagine the case , that all the Unions , of all the trades thus combined in all the country , agree to force up the wages of labour . Unless they can simultaneously augment the productive power of the country , there is of necessity a fall in profits , or , in other words , a decrease in the accumulation of capital . Let us hear Dr. Vethake upon this point . " Every retardation of the rate in which capital accumulates will be accompanied by the two effects of a less rapid increase of population , and of a diminished rate of wages . Moreover , but for the enjoyment/or a time by the labouring classes of a higher rate of wages , which will render them less disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the diminution of wages will proceed until they are reduced once more to their former rate . The tendency of them , however , to be for this reason at a somewhat higher rate than formerly , would in all probability be more than counteracted by the sum total of production , when compared with the augmented population , having , from the necessity of applying capital and labour lo the land under more disadvantageous circumstances than before , become diminished ; a condition of things , it will be recollected , implying a rise of rents , and a fall of profits and wages " The same learned man guards us against the selfish rejoinder that this effect may not take place until years shall have passed away ; by showing that from the very moment a rise of wages takes place , the rate of /z/ profits will be reduced , capital accumulate slowly , and wages will fall . Besides this , the real wages of the working-man will not increase by any means as his pecuniary wages . He will find it harder to get work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . The voice of political philosophy is therefore unequivocal . " Even setting aside wholly ( says Dr. Vethake ) the permanently injurious effects to result , I think that an unprejudiced person can scarcely avoid concluding against every system of the kind : not only in respect to the interests of the community regarded as a whole , but also in respect to those of the very parties to benefit whom is the object proposed . " /z/ " Mortals , that would follow me , Love Virtue , she alone is free . " /z/ IT would be much too trite to be welcome , if I were to say , that the tendency of things , in our free country , is towards licentiousness . But I shall account myself happy , if tumults , and revolts against equitable rule , do not drive some among us to ask for a strong government , as a resource against perpetual alarms . There is danger of this ; and the way to counteract a disposition so unlike that in which we were all bred , and so inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy of being searched for . In a knot of village politicians , whom I sometimes encounter of an evening , I listen with both ears to whatever may be said ; and though I am without a tongue in such matters , I can not help having an opinion . One thing is constantly showing itself , and I ask attention to my surmises . The red-hot Jacobins of our time are playing into the hands of the absolutists of Europe . While they try to set the poor against the rich forgetting that he who is /z/ poor to-day may be rich to-morrow ; while they dupe the unthinking with the old Agrarian song which befooled the Romans under the Gracchi , and the English mob under Jack Cade , and will never fail , till the world be wiser , to lift the demagogue another round of the ladder , and crush the poor fellows of whom he has made his steppingstone ; while they teach that all rule is tyranny , and all subordination degrading , they are preparing the happiest consummation for the enemies of republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulwarks . All the power of Europe would only , like pressure on an arch , compact us more closely . Open assault , though gigantic and reiterated , would put us on our strong national points of resistance ; nor do I believe there is the power on earth which could force a king upon America . The blood of the old free colonists runs proudly yet . All fourth of July harangues to the contrary notwithstanding we never were slaves ; we never can be unless we sell ourselves . I am alarmed to hear quiet men expressing themselves in new phrases ; as if our great experiment had almost failed . They have no reason to say so , except the rampant licentiousness and turbulent ferocity of certain agitators . But these occasional outbreaks tend to loosen our anchorage , to strain our holdfasts , and even when we wish to weigh and be off , the cables may part just when the anchors come a-peak . Principles are wearing /z/ away silently hut fast , in some very useful minds , which might be of great service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing entirely to the revulsion caused by licentious temerity . I am not one of those who dread so much from the direct influence of mobs and riots . There is , in the worst of them more show of teeth than bloodshed , more powder than ball ; thanks to Providence that it is so . More lives are lost in a dozen street-fights , or one steam-explosion , than in the riots of ten years . We are a strong people , and can resist a number of partial shocks , just as we resisted Shays ' insurrection , and the Whisky Boys . Our Anglo-Saxon reserve holds off the supreme , ultimate force of repression as long as possible ; but it comes out at last , like Neptune , to still the waves . " A disorderly multitude , " says Addison , in one of his works , which we have learned from British tories to neglect , * " a disorderly multitude contending with the body of the legislature , is like a man in a fit under the conduct of one in the fulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to be overruled in a little time , though he deals about his blows , and exerts himself in the most furious convulsions while the distemper is upon him . " But my apprehensions are of another sort . Our danger is from the disgust which is likely to arise in a large and influential portion of society , upon beholding the destructive efforts of ambitious or disaffected citizens . The The Freeholder , No. 28. /z/ frame of our government , as left us by the heroic men who planned and established it , is the masterpiece of political architecture ; it was often and justly compared to a Temple of Freedom . " But no , " we may say with an ancient poet , " they break down the carved work thereof with axes and hammers . " There is perhaps no man , of any trade , who does not think himself wise enough to tinker at a state constitution . With the aid of my friend Mr. Appletree , the schoolmaster , and my favourite Plutarch , I could easily multiply instances of the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient histories are full of this . So are the eventful stories of modern Italy . A volume might be filled with the turmoil of Florence alone . And all these examples go to show how important it is for our young men to set out in life with proper principles , and to maintain the golden mean betwixt Scylla and Chary bdis . For there are two extremes . On the one side is the scented , girlish , long-haired fopling , fresh from Paris or London , who tries to acquire distinction by disparaging American institutions . Though his grandfather , perhaps , wrought with his own hands , the stripling looks on all republicanism as ungenteel . And on the other side is the braggart and ruffian , who would resign every question to the mob as the source of power , and have the country convulsed by annual popular elections of every functionary from a judge to a constable . " A usurping popu /z/ lace , " said Swift , " is its own dupe , a mere underworker , and a purchaser in trust for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own ruin , with as blind an instinct as those worms that die with weaving magnificent habits for beings of a superior order . The people are more dexterous in pulling down and setting up , than at preserving what is fixed : and they are not fonder of seizing more than their own , than they are of delivering it up again to the worst bidder , with their own into the bargain . " The upshot of the matter is this : people should be taught from their cradles what true freedom is , and how it is to be maintained ; how it differs from lawlessness and misrule , and how closely it is connected with popular virtue . The boy at school and in the shop should be taught , that nothing can be done without order ; that there can be no order without law ; that all law demands obedience ; and that in such obedience to rightful authority , there is nothing which either injures or degrades . The apprentice and the journeyman should learn betimes , that to loosen a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a steam-engine ; and wherever the disorganization may begin , it will never stop till it ruins those who have begun it . When public disorders , and civil broils , and revolutionary violence once enter , the very class of persons who always bear the worst of the tempest , is that for whose benefit I am writing the honest , temperate , home-loving , industrious , frugal working-men. /z/ " But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shall love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt . " Lev . xix. 34 . ON a cold Saturday night , I stepped into a hatter 's shop , in New York , to supply the loss of a beaver , which had been hopelessly injured in a crush at a public meeting . The gas-light before the door threw its gleam directly in the face of a young woman who was sitting near the counter . I perceived in a moment that she was thin , pale , and sorrowful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had forgotten to fasten it ; her lips seemed to move ; and the folds of a scanty black woollen shawl could not so far hide her hands but that I perceived she was wringing them . I remained some minutes in the shop , and , during that time , saw at least seven or eight young women and girls come into the place with work which they had been doing , after delivering which they received their payment . But still this sad creature kept her seat . At length the young man of the establishment said , in a tone somewhat /z/ peevish , " Come , Jane it is nearly ten o'clock I am going to shut up and you know you have been paid . " She looked wildly up for a moment , and then dashed out of the house as if she had only then awaked from a stupor . " She is in a fair way to be crazy , " said the young man . " Ah ! " rejoined I , much interested , " what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely tell you the whole , " said he ; " she is one of those confounded Irish they all come to ruin . " " I hope the girl is virtuous , " said I. " Oh ! virtuous enough , I warrant ye , " cried he , with a vulgar addition , and a horse-laugh ; " otherwise she would not be sewing fifteen hours a day on hatlinings . But then her father is sick in bed , her mother is just dead , the only brother she has is in jail for stealing a piece of domestic cotton , and there are three little sisters that have to be supported by this one . I happen to know all this ; for her brother used to drive an omnibus in which I came down town every morning . " In reflecting on this case , as I walked to my lodgings , I was oppressed with a recollection of the vulgar saying , that " one half the world does not know how the other half lives . " How would it shock , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single glance , all the cases of this particular kind of misery , existing at this very moment in New York , or in Philadelphia . Alas ! the stranger and foreigner finds many of his golden dreams untrue ; and dies a thousand deaths , in /z/ beholding the less rugged members of his family perish before him . Beauty , health , and innocence are too often the sacrifice , when a piercing and unexpected season of cold and poverty comes suddenly on a young creature in a strange country . No man will have the hardihood to deny that we suffer serious inconveniences from the unlimited importation of foreigners . But every humane man will remember , that the day was when all the settlers of this country were emigrants ; that his own ancestors came from abroad ; that not all are ignorant , vicious , or uncivilized ; and that even where vice has been the source of misery , such misery is not to be abandoned to despair and ruin . It is the fashion to say much against the Irish as improvident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some such charge is no more than fair against a large number ; but it is a momentous question in moral how far we are exempted from the duty of relieving the widow , the fatherless , the sick , or the aged , of any nation , because some , or even most , of ' the same lineage are vicious people . Some of the best blood in America is from Ireland . Some of the best citizens are the sons of Irishmen . Before we condemn , or spurn from our doors , the poor son of Erin , we are to remember that he flies to us from untold wrongs , and that he has heard of ours as the land of the oppressed . We need not go so far in our proscription as to denounce every creature that has /z/ the brogue upon his tongue . I well remember having once stopped for a moment in Pine street , to look at a boy who had been thrown from a horse . Several men were around a pump at which they were washing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse ? " somebody inquired . " Oh , " cried a bystander , " nobody can tell ; but it was some Irishman , I 'll bet . " This was carrying out the native American policy , with a vengeance . The beauty of the thing was , that not ten rods off , in a door-way , stood the Rev. Mr. P. , a genuine Irishman , with whom I was going to breakfast . He heard the critical portion of the speech , and sadly smiled . By-the-by , it would require the laborious charities of several common Americans towards the Irish , to repay the beneficence of this good clergyman among the sick poor of our own country . In conclusion , let me say , that I am neither an Irishman , nor the son of %n Irishman . /z/ vDVANTAGES OF AMERICAN WORKING-MEN . " How small , of all that human hearts endure , Th &i; ait which laws or kings can cause or cure ! Still U i Ui'selves in every place consign 'd , Our GW . ) Jghaty we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not uncoainon to hear mechanics and other working-men repining at their lot in life , especially as compnfcd with that of such as are engaged in the learned professions . In hours of despondency , those an , imagined to be happy wlio are freed from the ic essity of manual labour , whether as men of wealta or of letters . Contentment is the best policy . All is not gold that glitters . Inaction is not ease . Money will not purchase happiness . Lords and ladies are often very wretched people ; and the instances are numerous n which even kings have thought men of humble stations the happiest . M. d'Alembert relates that Frederick , king of Prussia , once said to him , as they were walking together in the gardens of Sans Souci , " Do you see that old woman , a poor weeder , asleep on that sunny bank ? She is probably happier than either /z/ of us . " So also Henry IV . exclaims , in Shak-speare , " Canst thou , partial Sleep ! give thy repose To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calmest and most stillest night , With all appliances and aids to boot , Deny it to a king 1 " which may remind us of the saying of a greater and wiser king than either : " The sleep of a labouring-man is sweet , whether he eat little or much ; but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep . " * And before I dismiss my royal witnesses , let me cite King James the First , of England , who used to say , that the happiest lot in life was that which set a man below the office of a justice of the peace , and above that of a petty constable.t The truth is , labour is not an evil . " In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread , " sounds like a curse , but has been made a blessing by our benign Creator . Health , strength , and cheerfulness are promoted by the proper use of our bodily powers . Among the Jews , labour was accounted so honourable and so necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that so he might have a resource in case of misfortune . The same sentiment has prevailed in other eastern nations . One of the Hebrew Rabbies has the surname of /z/ the Shoemaker , and another of the Baker . Sir Paul Ricaut somewhere mentions , that the Grand Seignior , to whom he was ambassador , had been taught to make wooden spoons . There can not be a greater mistake than to suppose that mental exertion is less wearing than the labour of the hands . Head work is the hardest work in the world . The artisan feels this if at any time he has to spend a whole day in calculation . All men of learning testify to the same truth , and their meager frames and sallow complexions tell a plainer tale than their words . Sir Edward Goke , the great English lawyer , speaks thus concerning his great work : " Whilst we were in hand with these four parts of the Institutes , we often having occasion to go into the country , did in some sort envy the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was at his work , would merrily sing , and the ploughman whistle some self-pleasing tune , and yet their work both proceeded and succeeded ; but he that takes upon him to write , doth captivate all the faculties and powers , both of his mind and body , and must be only attentive to that which he collecteth , without any expression of joy or cheerfulness while he is at his work . " But if it is true of working-men everywhere that as such their lot is not to be deplored , it is eminently true of working-men in America , as compared with those of other countries . It is important that information on this subject should /z/ be diffused among the industrious classes , in order to show them how unreasonable are their murmurs . Take the case of the common labourer ; he is better clothed , better lodged , and better fed , in America , than in any country on earth . Two-thirds of the French people , says M. Dupin , are at this day wholly deprived of the nourishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian corn , or potatoes . In parts of Normandy , the lace-makers take refuge in the cow-houses , where the breath of the cattle diffuses some warmth : here they do the whole of their work during the cold season . Even in England , many of the hand-loom workers receive but seven shillings a week , and live in damp hovels , almost without furniture . I need not say how different is the case of the poorest labourer among ourselves ; while the condition of the thriving mechanic is , in comparison , almost princely . Mr. Grund , an intelligent foreigner , says , on this point , " On entering the house of a respectable mechanic in any of the large cities of the United States , one can not but be astonished at the apparent neatness and comfort of the apartments , the large airy parlours , the nice carpets and mahogany furniture , and the tolerably good library , showing the inmates ' acquaintance with the standard works of English literature . The labouring classes in America are really less removed from the wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . " The American mechanic has the prospect of /z/ wealth spread before him ; and as he advances towards it , his leisure increases with his means . He has an opportunity to lay in stores of knowledge . If he has attended somewhat to learning in his younger days , he finds no obstacle now in the way of his advancement either in science or literature . With a moderate income , and a favourable situation , he can give his sons and daughters a far better education than he received himself . And if he is so happy as to be a member of any Christian church , he finds that there is no privilege , trust , or office from which he is excluded by his having been a labouring-man . Thus he mingles with the choicest portions of society ; and if he live to old age , enjoys the grateful repose of that season as fully as the proudest descendant from nobles . Is there any country but our own , where all this can be said with truth ? Go into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find mechanics occupying some of the most elegant mansions ; you will see them filling the highest municipal stations . You will recognise them in large proportion among the officers of the militia , in the direction of moneyed corporations , and upon the most improved farms . You will find their names in every ecclesiastical record , and high in the list of benefactors in every charity . Such are the signs which should satisfy every American working-man , that by choosing a laborious calling , he has not excluded himself from comfort , usefulness , or honour . /z/ " Talkers are no good doers . " King Richard III . AFTER the lapse of twenty odd years , I have full in my mind 's eye the person of Sandy Thorp . He was a grown man , while I was still a child , yet a large , portion of his life passed within my knowledge ; which will be the more credible when I say that the better portion of his days was passed in the street . Not that he did not sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tavern ; for he knew everybody ; but this was only the brief exception , like the alighting of the swallow . It might be said that Sandy was always on the whig . Not even Socrates was less fond of the country than Sandy Thorp , who , like the same great sage , was almost perpetually engaged in discourse by the wayside . At whatever hour you might choose to go down town , you would be sure to see Sandy , whatever else you might miss . In the early summer morning he would be loitering around the stage-office to get a glimpse of the passengers who had lodged for the night ; perhaps to snatch up a grain of news . When the tavern boarders /z/ were picking their teeth on the porch after breakfast , Sandy picked his teeth under the same auspices . The opening of hotter and hotter , he would retreat from the open ways , to some shed or awning , or saunter from shop to shop , always on his feet , and evidently preferring the outside to the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Spaniard takes his siesta , when ladies are invisible , and when every thing seems to be dead , Sandy was as brisk as the bee that hummed over his head ; for wherever a listener could be found he was haranguing , with rapid puffs from the short pipe which he employed to keep down his nervous agitation . The night did not close his activity , and I have often heard his voice , long before I could discern his form , among the worthies who make this the favourite season of their promenade . Perhaps I am drawing a picture which will be recognised in more towns than one . Certain I am there can be no mistake in that in which I write . Though Sandy is long since dead , the race is not extinct . That which characterized him was his ubiquity and his news-mongering . It was his pride to be at the first of every rumour . You could not tell him any thing new , or make him wonder at any thing unheard of : as he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the knowledge of his facts . Only two /z/ explanations have ever been attempted ; one was that he never so much heard as overheard ; though not a willing listener , he was an eavesdropper : and while he hung upon the outskirts of a gathering of men , he would carry away more of the conversation than any one of the company . Another account was that many of the incidents which he related were of his own manufacture . No occurrence ever mortified him more , than when Gleig , the Scotch stone-cutter , his next door neighbour , absconded during the night , leaving Sandy in the vocative with regard to the rent of a little yard in which he worked at his tomb-stone . He could not pretend that it had been done with his privity , because he had been cozened : he would not confess ignorance , because he would thus lose the chief plume in his cap . For several days he was missing from the village , and always spoke of the event as very mysterious . It is remarkable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have no means of support , and who live along for years together , without suspicion of actual dishonesty , and without falling into the clutches of the law . If Sandy Thorp ever had a trade , nobody could tell what it was . He owned a little shop separate from his house , but no work was ever done in it , and when any one was allowed to peep into it there seemed to be nothing in it but old iron , scattered tools , and refuse furniture and harness . In earlier life Sandy picked up a dollar now and then , by going /z/ to the beach for a wagon load of fish , or by filling an ice-house , or in the spring of the year by bringing in choice forest trees for planting in pleasuregrounds . But his main employment was that of a veterinary surgeon , or , more vulgarly , a horse doctor . Whether this science comes by inspiration , or whether he was a seventh son , I know not , but he took it up , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loungers about taverndoors , he was much engaged in passing judgment on all the horses of the neighbourhood . You might see him , almost daily , feeling the legs , or prying into the mouths of the hacks in the stableyard : and , let me not fail to say , it is an employment in which he has not left us without successors . I distinctly remember the air with which he would handle a fleam , or perform the operation of mashing upon a choked cow . Such performances are sure to collect a little knot of men , and this was just what Sandy gloried in . Here he could repeat the freshest news , and give his decision upon affairs of state with an air of judicial complacency . Sandy was little versed in books . He always knew , however , what sign the sun was in , and whether the heavens were favourable for planting , or for killing porkers . He was weather-wise , keeping the breast-bone of a goose , by way of teraphim . No one ever saw him in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some sort a brevet undertaker ; he would point /z/ out the way for the bearers , and determined whether the grave was wide enough . At vendues , he was scarcely ever known to bid , but he advised in a knowing way . Of money he had little concern ; the instinct of beggars always led them to pass him by . By long continued street-walking , he had reduced his frame to a wiry fibre ; and as he was tall , erect , and always thinly clad , his appearance was striking . I ought to add that he was never shabby . His apparel though very old was always in repair , the patches and darns being done with a neatness which made some suspect he had been a tailor . It was observed that when he had worn a hat for several years , and exhausted the powers of brushing and ironing , he used to put crape upon it : in such cases , it always happened , that he had recently lost a cousin in the " Lake country . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he used to powder his bare crown , until this genteel appliance became obsolete . There was always , on the cuff of his left sleeve , a row of pins , inserted with geometrical parallelism . When he talked , he was in the habit of whittling a stick , so that his track was often marked by little piles of shavings . His likeness was never taken , nor could it have been ; for when he was not talking , he did not look like himself . /z/ " Alas ! how simple , to these cates compared , Was that crude apple that diverted Eve . " /z/ IT is the grand endeavour of all philosophy and all religion to elevate the immortal part of man ; to subdue and regulate that which he has in common with the brute , and thus to refine and expand his nature . But there is a latent sensuality in our race which is perpetually thwarting this pious effort ; and as there are no men without appetites , and few men without lusts , he who flatters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often beguiles us in spite of our reason . The fine arts , occupying a field intermediate between the region of sense and that of intellect , have on this very account been often prostituted . Painting , sculpture , and especially music , have pandered to the unworthy principle , and poetry and other kindred parts of literature have been made to do homage to sense . All this shows a sad inversion of human nature . It is not that we have senses , that we have appetites , that we have desires , that we have passions , but it is /z/ that we serve them , that we are betrayed by them , that they become our idols . Eden , the dwelling of pure heaven-like creatures , was a garden of sense ; its fruits were material , its sights and sounds addressed bodily organs ; its paths were trodden by creatures of flesh and blood . Let us not curse the harmless matter , or the indifferent sense ; but let us fear their abuse , in the present decrepit condition of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some of the most stirring effusions of the age have been written by men whose " fine frenzy " was a sort of Dutch courage : Byron declared the true Hippocrene to be gin and water . The festivities of the table have been accompanied with music and song , in all ages . Now I plead for the festivities , in every virtuous sense , and I plead for the song ; but in the name of injured human nature I cry out against the intoxication . Look back to early ages , and you see Bacchus presiding over the poets . Anacreon was the darling glee-maker for the old wine-bibbers . Horace was little behind him among the Romans . In oui day half the ballads remaining in our own language turn upon drinking and drunkenness ; and many a noble traditionary air is linked to the devil 's own litany , as in Cauld Kale in Aberdeen : " For I maun hae my cogie , sire , I canna want my cogie ; I wadna gie my thrce-girr 'd cog For a ' the queans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots ' old melodies , it was scarcely to be expected that Robert Burns would so far preach above his practice as to sing of cold water ; and some of Tom Moore 's most brilliant melodies have almost the scent of champagne . All seem to have thought with the Roman , that a water-drinker could not be a poet . In other branches of elegant letters , men who should have felt the high calling to be the ministers of moderation and virtue , have in certain instances , even when they have not inculcated indulgence , spread the sensual table with such seductive sweets and garlands , as to wake the tendencies which they should have lulled . It would be hard to throw a glory around the extreme of inebriety : the incongruity of Christopher Sly in the bed of silk would startle one into ridicule . The poet 's wreath can not be conveniently placed on him who is dead drunk .

Thus the wine-cup and the lyre have lain side by side for ages ; but an evil demon has maintained the connexion ; and I would to God that at once and forever American youth might dissever in their thoughts all that is ingenuous and joyful from the paroxysms of vinous inspiration . Drinking , as a mere bodily act , is not more dignified than eating : yet we have no eating- /z/ songs . Though great events , such as a successful election , are solemnized by a dinner or a supper , yet some veil is thrown over the deglutition . We drink sentiments ; we never eat them . In advertisements precedent , and narratives subsequent , the orators and singers at these banquets are never presented to the reader 's imagination as pouring out eloquence or song through the interstices of venison or oysters , but over bumpers of costly wine . Yet both go to the same place ; and the whole artifice is one of the tricks we put upon ourselves . Conscious that our souls are affronted by this prominency given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our power to array these gross delights in the vesture of tasteful spirituality . Disguise the matter as we may , ornament as we may the table or the cup , it is of the earth , earthy . The soul spurns it . We do but fill and feed that which is presently to be a corpse and putrefaction . Do I cry out against this ? Not by any means ; but I speak , for the soul , against the homage we are so busily paying to the body . God has graciously made our meat and our drink delightful ; but it is we , who , like the Egyptians with their goat and their onion , have made them gods . We must fight against this usurpation . We must from our infancy keep under the body . He who would be a man , must treat his lower nature as a gigantic slave , who is always watching his chance to rise and be uppermost . /z/ There are some who pride themselves upon withholding from their lips every thing which can intoxicate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad libitum . This is a great mockery . The soul may be crushed with a load , as well as drowned with a flood . We have the statistics of the disease and death caused by drinking , but who will furnish that caused by eating ? So far as the overt act is concerned , the latter is certainly the more brutal . As a conclusion to my outcry against animalism , I will state a case , which may serve to show that there is a nearer analogy than is usually suspected between the two sorts of excess ; and which may further afford an exercise for the pens of certain modern authors who are fond of describing with Apician gusto the progress of a feast . True , the sketch I shall offer relates to the Esquimaux ; but still it will , for that very reason , best serve my purpose of exhibiting , without a mask , the devotee of sense ; and I would not quote it , if it were less disgusting . " We found , " says Capt . Lyon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party which had been adrift had killed two large walruses , which they had carried home during the early part of the night . No one therefore came to the ships , ah remaining in the huts to gormandize . We found the men lying under their deer-skins , and clouds of steam rising from their naked bodies . From Kooilittuk I learned a new Esquimaux luxury ; he had eaten until he was drunk , and every mo- /z/ ment fell asleep with a flushed and burning face , and his mouth open . By his side sat Arnalooa , who was attending her cooking-pot , and at short intervals awakened her spouse , in order to cram as much as was possible of a large piece of halfboiled flesh into his mouth , with the assistance of her forefinger , and having filled it quite full , cut ofF the morsel close to his lips . This he slowly chewed , and as soon as a small vacancy became perceptible , this was filled by a lump of raw blubber . During this operation the happy man moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening his eyes ; but his extreme satisfaction was occasionally shown by a most expressive grunt , whenever he enjoyed sufficient room for the passage of sound . The drippings of the savoury repast had so plentifully covered his face and neck , that I had no hesitation in determining that a man may look more like a beast by over-eating than by drinking to excess . " * /z/ ' if /z/ " O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil . " Othello . IF an insane parent should be brought to the diabolical resolution of burning a child to death , it would not be necessary that he should violently thrust the infant into the flames . Only remove from the little creature all dread of the fire , give him free access within the fender to the blazing billets , and no long time would elapse before the ruin would be consummated . And precisely so , in regard to death and destruction by strong drink . The parent need not drench his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he need not force him to be even once drunk . All that is necessary is that he should bring him up to absolute carelessness as to the danger of strong drink , allow him license in tasting it , and set him the example of indulgence . Alas ! for one that is literally burned alive , there are a hundred destroyed by the liquid fire . I should not deem myself pardonable , if I were to omit this topic in addressing young men , especially those of the industrious class ; and although some of the crusades in favour of the virtue of /z/ temperance have been conducted with fanatical heats , and a contempt for all evidence and every rule of reasoning , I can not think that any friend of his race is thereby excused from the duty of employing every means to secure our rising population rom so intense a curse as that of drunkenness . And when I speak of drunkenness , my metaphysics will not help me to take a distinction between getting drunk on gin and getting drunk on cider . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between a brandy-sot and a wine-sot , is just this ; the one drinks brandy and water ; the other drinks brandy and wine . It is drunkenness , and its provocatives , against which I would raise the alarm . The direct and undeniable arguments against this vice are so numerous and overwhelming , that I feel no neces sity for rushing into the ludicrous paradoxes , exaggerated statistics , and profane wresting of holy writ , which have become a part of the regular agitation in this matter . Therefore I have never sought to prove that the wine of the Scriptures was not inebriating , or that alcohol , in its smallest portion , is concrete iniquity . But with the incontrovertible reasons occurring in every day 's walk , I would urge on my young countrymen to abhor the cup of temptation . The sight of one slavering drunkard is enough ; it contains an encyclopedia of arguments against any indulgence in strong liquors . I am amazed that , as one man , our youth do not arise in their strength , and swear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single young man , so long as there remains a drunkard in the land , should hesitate to save himself from the reach of the monster 's fang . And most of all am I amazed that there should be a single being , not confessedly a coward- and hypocrite , who can be deterred by the sneers of corrupt comrades from adopting a line of conduct which his reason and his conscience imperatively prescribe . If we can raise up a generation of sturdy fellows who have never tasted the evil spirit , we shall insure to the country , at a later day , a tribe of hale aged men , every one of whom may say with old Adam " Though I look old , yet I am strong and lusty : For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood ; Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility ; Therefore my age is as a lusty winter , Frosty but kindly .

The attraction which has brought me to this subject is certainly not its novelty , but its importance ; and I must even run the risk of repeating * As You Like It /z/ things which have been uttered at a hundred Temperance meetings ; these pages may , however , be read by some who do not frequent such assemblies . To the young man whose eye is upon , this page , I would therefore say , do for yourself what the Spartans used to do for their children : summon before you some beastly impersonation of the vice , in order that it may forever seize your imagination and your heart . Call before your mind 's eye a group of the worst drunkards within your knowledge . Fancy the whole dozen to be before you as , for instance , on the bench or settee of some gin or beer shop .

There is something so nauseous in the extreme symptoms of this disease , that it might be proper to cast a veil over them , if it were not that Providence has made them odious in order to alarm our fears . We ought therefore to take a fair look upon the stagnant pool of abominations in which those wallow who tamper with this indulgence .

Faugh ! " Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination ! " You may well exclaim thus ; but the more you are disgusted , the more just is your impression ; and the vile emblem is faint when placed by the viler reality . Seeing then that the cup of wine leads to such issues , and that the merely temporal results of drinking are thus loathsome , let me beg you to abjure all those sportive and therefore palliative expressions which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and degradation below nothing on this side of hell . We have many merry tropes by which to point out that a man has made himself a fool or a maniac . The Arabs are said to have near a hundred names for a lion . We have almost as many for a man in /z/ liquor . But in proportion as we laugh , we fail to abhor . The boy who jeers a street-drunkard , has his natural horror merged in a mere sense of the ludicrous . Let this be examined , and it will , if I err not , lead to a principle which has been too much neglected . Abandon at once and for life the use as a beverage , either habitually or occasionally , of every liquid which can intoxicate . With a soul filled with detestation of this chief of the Furies , free yourself from her solicitations. /z/ " Know , then , whatever cheerful and serene Supports the mind , supports the body too . Our greatest good , and what we least can spare , Is Hope : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN a late visit I had the pleasure of meeting ray two good friends , uncle Benjamin and the schoolmaster , quietly seated under the shade of a spreading buttonwood tree . Upon my making some little complaints about my ill health , uncle Benjamin interrupted me with " Pshaw ! man ! beware of becoming a grumbler . I have known a man whose everlasting reply was Dying , while he ate well , slept well , and looked as if he could have knocked down a beef . " " Some men , " said the schoolmaster , quoting Cowper , " Some men employ their health , an ugly trick , In making known how oft they have been sick , And give us , in recitals of disease , A doctor 's trouble , but without the fees ; Relate how many weeks they kept their bed , How an emetic or cathartic sped ; Nothing is slightly touch 'd , much less forgot , Nose , ears , and eyes seem present on the spot " /z/ " Just so , " rejoined uncle Benjamin : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate they should remember that other people are not so deeply interested in their disorders . In a long life I have always observed , that there is no greater difference between an ill-bred and a well-bred man , than that the latter keeps his little troubles to himself . It is a shame for active mechanics to become complainers ; even if they are amiss , brooding only makes matters worse . What says the proverb ? the three best doctors are Dr. Diet , Dr. Quiet , and Dr. Merryman . What says the Bible ? A merry heart doeth good like a medicine . " * " That reminds me , " said Appletree , " of what is said of the famous Dr. Nichols , that whatever a man 's distemper might be , he would not attend him , as a physician , if his mind was not at ease ; for he believed that no medicines would have any influence . And I dare say you have read the twenty-fifth number of the Spectator , where Addison says , ' the fear of death often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in a flight than in a battle , and that it is impossible that we should take delight in any thing that we are every moment afraid of losing . " " There is too much talk , " said uncle Benjamin , " about health as a separate concern . If men are temperate , regular , active , cheerful , and cleanly , they will generally be well . If not , let them bewail their mishaps , not before their friends , but /z/ their doctor . But what with bran-bread and vegetable diet , and what with lectures and tracts upon health , hundreds are put in the way of becoming symptom-hunters , then hypochondriacs , and then real invalids . None but a fool will go to fingering the nice works of a watch ; yet any one feels free to tinker with his constitution . First whims , then experiments , ruin the strength . " " Even learned men , " said the schoolmaster , " have fallen victims to this folly . Dr. Stark , an eminent physician of the last century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1770 . On the 24th of the preceding June he began with bread and water . On the 26th of July he changed this for bread , water , and sugar . Then came bread , water , and olive oil . On the 8th of September he was so weak that he almost fainted in walking across the room . The last mess but one was a diet of bread or flour with honey , and an infusion of tea or of rosemary . He died on the 23d of February . Bathing , which is one of the best things in the world , may be carried to excess . Men of one idea are fond of recommending their own notions to every one : but Dr. Currie closes the account of one of his experiments in cold bathing with the remark , that the chief thing he learned from it was , that it was not rashly to be repeated . " " Right , right , " exclaimed uncle Benjamin ; " ' God never made his work for man to mend . ' The really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been those who have had no whimsies . They have been temperate , and cleanly , and goodnatured , and brisk , but they have kept no lenten days , nor proscribed any of the ordinary articles of diet . Good roast beef , with tea , coffee , and garden stuffs , has not shortened their days. * And I believe after all it is quantity rather than quality which hurts us . Let a man be forever asking himself , Will this hurt ? or , Will that hurt ? and he will soon arrive at the point at which every thing will hurt . " " Exactly so , " said the schoolmaster . " When Dr. Johnson 's friend Taylor happened to say that he was afraid of emetics , for fear of breaking some small vessels , ' Poh ! ' said Johnson , ' if you have so many things that will break , you had better break your neck at once , and there 's an end o n't . You will break no small vessels !

He published an essay against tea-drinking , and left off during twelve years : then , ' at the close of a consumption , ' by Dr. Fothergill 's directions , he used it again , and probably learned how much he had been mistaken in attributing ill effects to so refreshing and innocent a beverage .

" * Some of our working-men of the active trades lose their health by over-eating and over-working : of course I leave out the drinking men , who can seldom have sound insides . Extreme exertion wears out multitudes in all trades where great bodily power is required . The coal-heavers of London , healthy as they look , are but a shortlived people . The heavy loads which they carry and the liquor which they drink carry them off rapidly . Before the introduction of the powerpress , a large proportion of the pressmen who Statistical Account of the British Empire ; Article by Dr. Farr . /z/ were accustomed to print large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , which is the result of an unequal action on the muscles . In the sedentary trades , the danger is from constrained position , bad air , want of exercise , and want of water . An hour every day ** in the garden or wood-yard , and a daily sponging of the whole body , together with temperance , cheerful evening visits , and good music , would put blood into the veins of many a limber tailor and swarthy shoemaker . /z/ " ' T is this adorns the rich ; The want of this is poverty 's worst wo ; With this external virtue , age maintains A decent grace ; without it , youth and charms Are loathsome . " AH.MSTUOSTG THERE is nothing in which the domestic economy of the moderns , more differs from that of the ancients , than in the article of Baths . The allusions of the Bible to this practice are familiar to us all . The Egyptians , the Greeks , and the Romans agreed in making it a part of their daily routine . The public baths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were adorned with two hundred pillars , and furnished with sixteen hundred seats of marble ; on which three thousand persons could be accommodated at once . Those of Dioclesian were still more sumptuous . Alexander Severus , to gratify the passion for bathing , ordered the warm baths to be opened by break of day , and also supplied the lamps with oil . Thus the bath became a universal luxury , until there were some so devoted to the enjoyment as to use it four , five , and even eight times a day . /z/ In modern Europe , though bathing is not so highly prized as it was among the ancients , it is regarded as far more necessary to health and comfort than among ourselves . Indeed the neglect of thorough ablution is not unlikely to become a national reproach . A British traveller says , and not without some appearance of truth , that " the practice of travellers ' washing at the door or in the porticoes , or at the wells of taverns and hotels , once a day , is most prejudicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought never to be neglected , at least twice a day , in a hot climate , being altogether inconsistent with it . In fact , " he adds , " I have found it more difficult , in travelling in the United States , to procure a liberal supply of water at all times of the day and night in my bedchamber than to obtain any other necessary . A supply for washing the hands and face once a day seems all that is thought requisite . " * Though the traveller 's censure applies with its full force to some parts of his own country , we may take a useful hint , and amend our ways . The two great considerations which recommend the bath are its influence , first , on cleanliness , and , next , on health ; and the latter is in a great degree dependent on the former . " Cleanliness , " as John Wesley is reported to have said , " is the next thing to godliness ; " and such is the connexion between outward and inward purity , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vol. ii . p. 440. /z/ religions , the one has been the symbol of the other . Of course , those who work hard and perspire copiously , have more need of care in this particular than others . To the artisan , therefore , the bath is a double advantage , a double luxury . All trades , however , are not alike . There are some in which the operative can not pretend to be clean , while he is actually employed ; to attempt it would be affectation ; but there is the more reason why he should enjoy the feeling of perfect cleanliness when work is over . The watchmaker* or the trimmer may be almost as neat as a lady ; but there are none who are entirely exempt from the need of water . Some there are who are scarcely aware of the extent to which their skin has become clogged by the successive perspirations and depositions of years . They might form some idea of the fact if they should scrape the surface with a dull knife , by which the accumulated outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is too common with certain persons , to wash only for the public , and to cleanse only what is visible . If we were brought up in proper notions on this subject , and knew when we were comfortable , we should feel as much necessity for water to our bodies as to our faces ; and a bathing-house , or at least a bathing-tub , would be as indispensable as a wash-basin . An eminent German physician , Hufeland , tells us , that " every Sunday evening people formerly went in procession through the /z/ streets , beating on basins , to remind the labourers of bathing ; and the tradesman , who laboured at dirty work , washed off , in the bath , that dirt , which now adheres to him during a long life . " Only he who has made the experiment can know how delicious is the feeling produced by a thorough warm ablution , after a day of heat and exertion . " To wash one 's self , " says one of our own eminent medical authorities , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally attach to the words . It should not consist merely in washing the hands , and rubbing a wet towel over the face , and sometimes the neck ; the ablution ought to extend over the entire surface , and it is particularly necessary where often least thought of , as at the bends of the limbs , &c.; In a tepid bath , with the aid of a little soap and a sponge , or brush , the process may be completely performed with a feeling of comfort at the moment , and of much pleasure afterwards . " * If bathing affords so much comfort , it conduces not less to health . No man can be in health whose skin is out of order . This is beginning to be acknowledged by all who think and write upon the human system . It is the skin which is the seat of perspiration , of which about thirtythree ounces pass through every twenty-four hours ; even when there is no visible moisture /z/ on the surface . The skin is the regulator of animal heat ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corrupt matter left in contact with it by want of cleanliness . It is in close connexion with almost every important function of the system . A glance at these facts will show that it requires daily attention . But some will be surprised to learn further , that this wonderful covering has other no less important offices . It not only lets out liquid , but it takes in airs , as well as watery vapour : so that it may almost be said to play the part of the lungs , by secreting and absorbing the same gases . In some animals , indeed , as in the leech , all the breathing is done by the skin , and you may kill a frog as effectually by varnishing him all over , as by tearing out his lungs . The filthy covering of an unwashed person is not unlike such a varnish , and he who never bathes labours under a sort of half-suffocation . The outer scurf which we may scrape away is a deposition from the true or inner skin . A good washing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rub off the dead parts with a brush or hard towel . In this respect , all baths , of whatever temperature , are useful . The surface is cleansed and freed from obstructions , and a way is cleared for the passage of the proper fluids and gases . On a subject so important , I trust these little details will not be thought either dry or unnecessary . The cold bath is the most natural , and the most /z/ easily taken , but it is not always proper or safe . There are some I know who recommend it indiscriminately to all persons , at all seasons ; but such is not the counsel of wise physicians . " In proportion , " says Dr. Combe , " as cold bathing is influential in the restoration of health when judiciously used , it is hurtful when resorted to without discrimination . " " Many persons , " says Dr. Bell , " in even vigorous health , can not tolerate Jhe cold bath for the shortest period , still less can they habitually use it with benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger from the practice , if it be continued after any sudden diminution of vital energy , by whatever cause produced . " The same learned author rejects the vulgar notion that cold bathing is either a tonic or a stimulant , and teaches us , that what some- are pleased to consider a reaction after the application of cold , is no such thing , and that the skin is not actually warmer at this time than before . He therefore comes to the same conclusion with the great ancient Galen , that the cold bath is proper for persons in perfect health , and for fleshy ones , for the temperate and those who use due exercise ; that the proper season for it is summer , and that one must be gradually accustomed to it . But neither he nor the most timid adviser would debar the manly swimmer from plunging into the stream , or still better from indulging in that exquisite refreshment , the dash of the surf upon the sea-shore. /z/ Both the eminent physicians whom I have quoted recommend for habitual use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 98 is named by Dr. Combe . The best rule is to avoid the positive impressions , either of heat or cold . The effect is at once tranquillizing and invigorating , in a high degree . Nothing can savour more of ignorance , or be less agreeable to experience , than the notion of some , that the warm bath is enfeebling . From the earliest ages it has been the restorative of the exhausted traveller , and the writer of these lines can never forget its magical effect after a wearisome journey of some hundreds of miles . Darwin reminds us , that the words relaxing and bracing , which are generally used in relation to warm and cold baths , are mechanical terms , properly applied to drums or strings ; but are only metaphors , when applied to this subject . After a long day 's work the warm bath is a thousand-fold better than strong liquors . Bruce , in his travels in Abyssinia , tells us , that when he felt an intolerable inward heat , and was so exhausted as to be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a warm bath , as on his rising in the morning . " Some persons may tell me , " says he , " that the heat of the bath must weaken and enervate , but I can assure them that the reverse is the case . " Our celebrated countryman , Count Rumford , once repaired to Harrowgate , in a feeble state of health . Such was his fear of taking cold from the warm bath , that he used it only once in /z/ three days , for less than fifteen minutes , and always went from it to a warm bed . Finding this unprofitable , he reversed his method , and bathed every day , at two o'clock , for half an hour , at 96 and 97 of Fahrenheit , for thirty-five days to'gether . " The salutary effects of this experiment , " he adds , " were perfectly evident to all those who were present , and saw the progress of it ; and the advantages I received from it have been permanent . The good state of health which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same philosopher exposes the mistake of those who avoid the warm bath for fear of catching cold ; as , indeed , one has no more occasion to dread catching cold after having been in a warm bath , than from going out of doors into the air of a frosty morning . " There are few , " says Dr. Combe , " who do not derive evident advantage from the regular use of the tepid bath , and still fewer who are hurt by it . " It is one of the great advantages of a residence in the city of Philadelphia , that there is not only an abundant supply of water , but that all the better class of houses are provided with bathingrooms , in which either cold or warm baths may be taken . And even those who are without these conveniences , may have easy access to public baths . Or , in the worst imaginable case , a tub of warm water , a piece of soap , a sponge , and a hard towel may be found in the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Were it a draught for Juno when she banquets , I would not taste thy treasonous offer ; none But such as are good men can give good things , And that which is not good , is not delicious To a well-governed and wise appetite . " /z/ IN looking over a book upon the effects of different trades upon health and long life , * I was struck with the repeated statement that such and such occupations would be less unhealthy , if it were not for the liquor drunk by the workmen . This , thought I , is very unfair : why blame the trade , when the fault all lies in the drink ? We may lay it down as a principle , that of honest employments , there is not one in fifty which is hurtful to the health of a temperate and prudent man ; but if men will still be mad enough to guzzle beer or whisky , they may destroy them- /z/ selves amidst the most wholesome circumstances in the world . The book I spoke of , though small in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me advert to some instances of the kind mentioned above . Of coachmen and other drivers , Mr. Thackrah says that their exposure to the weather is thought to produce rheumatism and inflammation of the lungs . " I conceive , however , " he adds , " that these diseases would rarely occur to abstemious men . It is intemperance which gives the susceptibility to such maladies ; and it is intemperance which produces much greater . " And here he speaks of morning-sickness ; disease of the stomach and head ; apoplexy and palsy . In regard to another trade , he says : " Though temperate millwrights are healthy , and continue their employ to a great age , often even to that of sixty , there is another class , who fit up the shafts and wheels , to convey the power from the steamengine to the machinery , and who suffer from their debauched habit of life . These men earn high wages ; take much of that pernicious compound called ale , and sometimes even drams in addition , and are moreover off work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such men , of course , are unhealthy and short-lived . " These remarks may be applied to many classes of operatives in America , who receive high wages , and are not required to keep hours . For there in nothing more conducive to health and good habits /z/ than for a man to have such employment and such pay as shall make it necessary for him to be moderately engaged every day . A master pocketbook-maker informed our author that several of his people had died from consumption . " This , however , " says he , " I should attribute not to the employ , but to intemperance . " When blacksmiths are ill , " the cause is most frequently intemperance . " Of hatters , he tells us , " they are often intemperate and shortlived . " And of brewers , who are commonly regarded as patterns of portly strength , Mr. Thackrah observes : " As a body , they are far from healthy . Under a robust and often florid appearance , they conceal chronic disorders of the abdomen , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When these men are accidentally hurt or wounded , they are more liable than other individuals to severe and dangerous effects . The ill-health of brewers is , however , evidently attributable to their habitual and unnecessary potation of beer . " After such statements as these , we need not be surprised when this judicious medical man comes to the conclusion , that intemperance is the grand bane of civilized life . These observations were made nearly twenty years ago in the populous town of Leeds , and are therefore introduced here in preference to still stronger statements more near to us in time and place ; as it is common to suspect the latter as coloured by zeal for a popular /z/ enterprise . In regard to mere health , then , it appears , that intoxicating- drinks are unnecessary and noxious . To him who uses them , no circumstances can ensure health : to him who abstains , even great exposure is usually harmless . The first rule of health to be inculcated on our children , apprentices , and families , is to live without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely they have an accountability in this matter to God and to man . The apprentice and even the journeyman are , and ever ought to be under some control ; and the more fully the master sustains to them the part of a father , the greater will this control be . It will be an evil day for our land when either party shall feel that this bond is loosed . Let the household links be broken , and the political chain will have no binding force . If we wish such a reformation as shall make and keep our rising race virtuous and happy , we must begin at home , and masters must take some steps which are now unpopular . The vices of journeymen fall , with part of their burden , on master - workmen . As Mr. Thackrah very justly says , the latter may do much to lessen this great evil of intemperance . Does any one ask what can the master do ? I reply , he can bring up his boys in good principles . He can press upon them the precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can set them an example of rigid temperance . He can see that they spend /z/ their evenings and their Sundays at home , in reading , or in some useful amusements . He can open facilities for them to enjoy the advantages of night-schools , libraries , Sunday-schools , Bibleclasses , and lyceums . Is it asked what can he do for journeymen ? I reply , some of these same things ; for a man 's being a journeyman does not put him beyond the reach of good advice or good example . But , over and above this , I adopt our author 's language : " Let the master discharge from his employ every man who ' breaks work ; ' nay , let him admonish , and afterwards discharge every man who spends his evenings at the alehouse , or calls at the dram-shop . This is , in fact , the great point : for the evil is curable at the beginning . " I anticipate what will be said about the difference between the state of things here and in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcity of skilled labour . Nevertheless every employer , who has patronage , is responsible to society and to God for the manner in which he employs it . He may not lord it over his men , but he has a right to know how and where they spend their evenings ; for the plain reason that his own interests are involved in it . The inquiry is not always agreeable ; nay , it will often give great offence ; but what then ? Is the truly benevolent man to do nothing which is disagreeable ? Of a truth , we are not so delicate in the collection of a debt , or the prosecution of a claim . These lions are chiefly in the way of our /z/ benevolent efforts . Until the law of the land shall render us more effectual aid , by erecting dykes against this flood of evil , every good man will do what he can to keep it out of his own doors . The place where health , fortune , character , and happiness are lost , is the tavern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment of the weary traveller ; no object could be more benevolent . But they have become , by the change of times , chiefly remarkable as dens of drunkenness . Take away the bar , and in most cases you take away the publican 's livelihood . But even now , if taverns were frequented chiefly by wayfaring-men , it were well . But , far from this , they are sources of temptation and ruin to the neigh bourhood . Where must you go to find the black leg , the drunkard , and the bully ? To the tavern Where is the young man who is never in his own shop , and whose shabby coat and anxious eye betoken debt and danger ? In the tavern . Where were the journeymen and apprentices last night , who are this morning haggard and sallow , yawning and hiccuping over their work ? At the tavern . I must in justice say , that I know innkeepers who are temperate , orderly men , and good citizens , and who deplore this state of things ; and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the greater number of cases , the bar-room is the way to destruction ; and to say that a man is often seen hanging about the tavern porch , under whatever pretence of business , is to /z/ say that his work is neglected , his habits declining , and his company detestable . In these and similar observations , I purposely avoid all mention of Temperance societies and their pledges , not because I am indifferent to the success of their endeavours , but because I wish to reach even those who do not admit the principle of these associations in its full extent . The sentiments which are here expressed , have been entertained by thoughtful men for scores of years ; nor do I see how they can be rejected by any one who loves his country . Some of the happiest changes I have ever known have been wrought in men who have escaped the snare of strong drink . Such a one is PHELPS the coach-painter . Time was when he thought his paint would kill him outright , but for his brandy ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of friends , except over a bottle . He sang a good song , and , being a musician , used to be the life of the tavern suppers . Some of his bacchanal staves may still be heard at midnight by those who pass by the Bull 's Head . Phelps had been well schooled , and sometimes wrote verses . But his eyes became weak , and his nose red , and the palette began to shake on his thumb . This did not arouse him , until his only son Ned was brought home drunk . He had fondly imagined that the boy had never seen him drink : it is the folly of many a parent , who rears a household of drunkards . That night Phelps broke every bottle /z/ in his cellar . Last week I dined with him , and he sang me the following verses of his own making , over a goblet of excellent lemonade . When the glass sparkles , and the group Of wassail gathers there ; Though friends invite , though spirits droop , T is Wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain Which foaming tankards bear , Or distillation of sweet-cane , ' T is perilous BEWARE ! Or should ripe clusters pour a flood Whose varying hues compare With gems , or Tyrian dye , or blood , ' T is wine that mocks BEWAHE ! But doubly fly that fiery stream , Forced by perverted care , Through tortuous pipe , in pungent steam ; Those drops are death BEWAKE ! Howe'er the Tempter drug his bowl , Or mix his potions fair , Why shouldst thou jeopard thus thy soul 1 Madness is near BEWARE ! /z/ " Yet to be just to these poor men of pelf , Each does but hate his neighbour as himself : Damn 'd to the mines , an equal fate betides The slave that digs it , and the slave that hides . " /z/ THE good and the evil of money are the subject of our daily conversation , and neither can well be represented as greater than it is . The same book of wisdom which declares to us that " money answereth all things , " warns us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil . " We love what costs us pains ; our own work , or the fruit of it ; our own little garden rather than our neighbour 's hot-house . It is , therefore , constantly observed that it is hard to wring money out of the hands of one who has earned it by little and little . Look at the farmer ; even if he owns thousands of acres , he is sometimes startled at a call for the disbursement of twenty dollars : while the merchant , who gains and loses by fifties and hundreds , will transfer ten thousand dollars ' worth of stock in five minutes . Women , who seldom dear creatures have the handling of large sums , are more frugal in the disposition of their means , than their more hard- /z/ hearted husbands . Hence the great moralist avers that mendicants seldom beg of women . However this may be , it is undeniable that where money is hardly got , it is sure to be prized sufficiently . Let a man work hard for his dollar and he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and thus , by imperceptible degrees , frugality grows into avarice and thrift into meanness . It is not the mere coin , the material gold , silver , copper , and alloy that we love ; at least in the outset . The miser , who is a possessed man , may transfer his regards to the sign from the thing signified , and gloat over dollars and doubloons ; but what the most love is what the money will bring . To use a large word , it is the potentiality of happiness . We turn every thing into money . We measure every thing by money . It is money which marks the injury done by a slander or a blow . As we measure the force of an engine by horse-power , so we measure an honourable office by dollars . Men value their lives at certain sums , and persons could be found who would be bribed to run the risk of being bit by a mad dog . In consequence of this universal applicability of money as the measure of value , it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look with complacency on the key which unlocks our treasures ; and gaze on a dirty bank-note , which is only a rag . In Pitcairn 's island , at the latest accounts , there was no money , nor any need of it . Hut does it /z/ follow that there can be no avarice there ? I think not . The passion may look beyond the medium to the end in view , but it is still the same . The dislike to part with our cash , when reduced to its principles , is a mode of selfishness . It is only one aspect of our love of the things which money will buy . If any man would guaranty to us all these things for life , we would freely give him the money . Hence the moral evils of avarice . But for this the love of gold would be as innocent as the love of roses and lilies . Bat even on the selfish principle , I have sometimes thought that a more refined and profound view of the matter would loosen our hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . Every one sees that if a man spends none of his money , he is wretched ; hence the name miser , which is only the Latin for a wretch . But many make it the business of their lives to come as near this as they can . They sail as near the wind as is possible . Sound economy will teach a man that a liberal outlay of money is in some cases no more a loss , than a liberal sowing of wheat . STOLIDO has adopted the saving maxim never to cut the packthread of a parcel , but always to untie it : he therefore fumbles at a hard knot for ten minutes , in which he could have earned the worth of ten such packthreads . BASSO grudges sixpence for a dose of physic , and in the end loses six weeks . We all agree that time is money . Why so ? Because time will procure /z/ us money , or , what is the same , money 's worth . But we are not so ready to admit , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance is money that good habits are money that character is money . Nay , I go further than this : if we must value every thing by this mercenary standard , then I say , ease is money , because it is worth money , and we labour all our life to earn it . Comfort is money , and happiness is money . These remarks are certainly not intended to foster the disposition to estimate every thing by pounds , shillings , and pence . God forbid ! Our money-making nation needs no spur in their race : we are already pointed at by the finger of nations . But as the world 's ready reckoners insist on gauging human bliss by this rule , I wish to show that on their own principles a man may be too saving . Even the rule of the usurer in the old play , * which was short enough to be engraven on his ring , and which is engraven on many a heart , Tu tibi cura , " Take care of number one , " is often violated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are better things than money . O that I could ring it through every shop , factory , and counting-house of my country ! There is good which gold can not buy , and which to barter for gold were ruin . It can not buy the kindly affections of the fireside . It can not buy The " Groat 's Worth of Wit , " by Robert Green . /z/ the blessings of friendship . It can not buy the serene comforts of virtue , the quiet of conscience , the joys of religion . This lesson should be inculcated on the young . It is idle to fear that such a lesson will make them careless or profuse . It is a lesson opposed , not to frugality , but to parsimony . Those who learn it will not hoard , but neither will they squander . They will look on money , not as an ultimate good , but as the representative of purchasable advantages ; and they will count it as nothing when put in the opposite scale to moral and eternal things , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor a lender be ; For loan oft loses both itself and friend , And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry . " Hamlet . OF all the ways of making money , that which belongs to a man 's proper ' trade or business is the safest , easiest , and most honest . He who would , even in a worldly sense , prosper , must let many gay chances of wealth flit before him , without drawing him from his daily work . This , however , is very much against the spirit of the age . To become rich by sudden leaps is more attractive than to plod on for years with scarcely perceptible gains . Yet the truly solid men are those who have pursued the latter course . It is not too much to say , that at the time of this present writing , there are a thousand mechanics , manufacturers , and small tradesmen , who are trying to become rich by what they call speculation . Some , in a low sphere , deal in horses . Though this is not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making some match , or showing off the paces of some famous roadster . It becomes /z/ a passion , business is neglected ; and , so far as my observation goes , horse-dealers do not always maintain the purest character for straightforward conduct . Some are , or were , very full of buying and selling lots about our growing towns and cities . Others are all for granite-quarries . While many behold visions of untold wealth in the silk business , and forsake their own calling , to plant acres of the Chinese mulberry . One in fifty of these draws a prize ; the rest , after some months of suspense , sit down with blanks , and find their proper business near to ruin . These hopes commonly lead to expensive habits , unknown to the artisans of former days . Hence , my friend Mrs. BATES used often to remind her son Arthur of his father 's frugality . " Dear mother , " cried Arthur , on one of these occasions , with a face of great vexation , " pray , pray , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing will be to rig me out in his white neckcloth and small-clothes . " " Arthur , " said the old lady , with tears in her eyes , " the image which has been before my mind for forty years , will sometimes be in your way ; but bear with me , and I will not say any more about your father . " " Say what you please , " said the relenting son . " All I have to say is this : you know that your father was a thriving mechanic he had no ambition to be more he became wealthy , as you might now have been , but for the rash adventure /z/ of your two uncles , in 1815 , which swept away our property . When your father began life , however , as you are now doing , he was frugal and domestic ; he stuck to his trade ; and after his great reverse , he returned to the habits of his youth . His maxim was , Waste nothing risk nothing borrow nothing . " " Exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt , as I feel , the change of times , and would think as little of owing five hundred dollars , as he did of borrowing a pinch of snuff . " " Arthur , " said the good old woman , smiling with the consciousness of experience , " the maxims of economy do not change with the fashions . They go by the nature of things . " " Surely , madam , money is not now what money was before the Revolution ! " " Perhaps not , in a certain sense ; but , as the shopkeepers say , money is money . Bread , and clothes , and fuel , are not got for nothing . You talk of credit : credit implies borrowing ; and borrowing implies paying . Creditors are made of no milder stuff than when I was a girl ; and , for all that I can see , a cistern that is always running and never receiving is as like to run dry as any cistern of the olden time . To be plain what was the occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , to answer plainly , in my turn , though I am sure you are going to misunderstand it , it /z/ was to see several of my friends in William street . " " Ah ! and why so anxious to see them at this , the busiest season of your trade ? " " You press me but I will be frank it was to get a lift in the pecuniary way common thingto meet an arrangement a mere trifle a name or two was all I wanted a-hem a little matter in " " In bank , you would say , my son . Speak it out . I understand you . Now consider ; what change has come over the plain old-fashioned business of coach-making , that you should need to be a borrower ? Let an old woman tell your fortune your intimacy with banks will end in your being a bankrupt . " With a blush and a sneer , Arthur went to his drying-room , then to his trimming-room , then to his counting-room , and then to the open air ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a borrower . He kept his horses and his dogs , and gave dinners , and went to the springs . To meet this expense , he had several little speculations , added to his regular trade . Instead of straitening his expenses to suit his means , he plunged into new indulgences ; and to meet their cost , he drew upon future and unreal gains . In America , perhaps , more than elsewhere , it is very common to find mechanics , and even professional and salaried men , falling into embarrassments , to which formerly only mercantile adventurers were /z/ thought liable . How can a young man sit down at his desk , or examine his books , when every paper and almost every knock remind him that he is in debt ? Arthur Bates was oftener in the street than in his shop ; and every part of his proper business became distasteful to him . He was often seen in the humbling situation of a vexatious supplicant at the doors of men who were far below him in every scale but that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not foretell at what point of the descent he will stop . From a custom it grows into a habit . The first plunge is the most revolting ; after that , the smooth lapse becomes smoother with each successive yielding . Borrowing became so easy with Arthur , that he began to scribble on his waste papers the goodly proverbs , " Nothing venture , nothing lose , " and " In for a penny , in for a pound . " To one so diseased , no stimulant can be worse than a morning paper : it offers schemes of wealth on every page . These have a great charm for the man who feels that nothing but a grand " operation " can get him out of the slough , and who , at the same time , reads of thousands realized on lots at Brooklyn , Brighton , and Chicago , or by sales of granite or mulberries . True , these things have had their day ; but so will other things . In process of time , Arthur Bates removed from a thriving country town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will be surprised at /z/ the change . It is not long since I could have named a round dozen of young men , attorneys , mechanics , and even doctors , who had closed their shops and offices , and gone into speculation . Arthur had entered the Alsatia of borrowing . After many fruitless attempts , he despaired of making his simple mother comprehend how a man may live and do well , without any regular business ; or how these rapid turns of the wheel differed from gambling . He descanted to her upon the credit system , the rise of property , the diversities of script , and the fortunes made by happy investments . He unrolled before her without effect , lithographic maps of unbuilt cities in the West , or of Venices to be conjured up , in the North River ; he turned her into stone , with calculations about the sugar beet and the morus multicaulis . Poor Mrs. Bates was too old to mend , and read out of her old book , that the borrower is servant to the lender. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of his , Peleg Peck , Esq . Mr. Peck was a son of the house of Peck , Pigeon , and Fitch , in Pearl street . After the usual time spent in billiards and dramatic criticism , and after being bowed out of his father 's counting-house by the elder partner , Mr. George W. Pigeon of Providence , he opened a livery stable at Brooklyn . Thence , by some unexplained change , he became booking-clerk in a stage-office in Market street , Philadelphia , and his *Prov. xxii. 7. /z/ last ostensible calling was that of clerk in a Mississippi steamboat . But he had seen wonders in the great West , and had come back to engage other adventurers . It was after a dialogue between Mr. Peck and Arthur , that the latter hastily entered his mother 's parlour . " Why so flurried , my son ? " said Mrs. Bates , as her son threw himself into an elbow chair . " Dearest mother ! nothing uncommon , I assure you . But one who belongs to the world can not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sea reach even our little creeks . " " Pray , come down from your stilts , Arthur : you used wiser as well as plainer talk when you were a well-doing carriage-maker . Surely your connexions with the moneyed world are slight . " " Ah ! there it is , again . Your notions are out of date . Indeed , mother , I do not know that you have got the least insight into the great modern system of debt and credit . " " Be it so , my dear . Take a glass of water , and give me such lessons as suit my simplicity . But observe , before you begin , that I am not in my dotage yet , and that I have long observed that there is no subject on which men can talk longer without ideas , than on this same matter of credit , stocks , banks , and speculation . But perhaps you can trade in the same way without capital . " " No jests , I entreat . In sober earnestness there is a great pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of a bee-hive in June /z/ Three houses shut up this morning in Pearl street and I have every reason to believe that the fall of cotton has ruined Cromwell and Zebulons of Mobile , which will drag down Grubbs , Ishmael , and Grubbs . " " Hold ! hold ! my son , what has come over you ! Panic Wall street Ishmael ! And what concern can you have with these affairs ? You are not a bank-director , a broker , or a Jew . " " True , my dear mother true but let me explain . The modern system is so bound that is , such is the concatenation just to think , that bills on London are no longer in a word , money is so scarce . But your old notions are so queer , that I shall seem ridiculous . " " Indeed you do , " said Mrs. Bates , drawing herself up with some sternness . " Indeed you do . This rigmarole is a mere screen for ignorance yes , pardon a mother 's plainness for your ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , you have neglected your proper business ; you have tried to retrieve matters , by unwarrantable means ; and now , in your embarrassments , you are trying to lay all the blame on public measures , banks , and brokers . A plain mechanical business , as thrifty as yours was , needs no such connexions . What did your poor father know of banks ? Yet he was worth his forty thousand dollars , just before his two younger brothers decoyed him into a share in their liabilities . Arthur , I see your des- /z/ perate game . I have seen it long . You have failed to grow rich by slow earnings . You have borrowed to support your needless expenses . You have filled one vessel from another , neither of them being your own . You are now staking all your credit on these paltry speculations . You have become a mere borrower ; a borrower of what you can never pay . " I am not writing a biography , and therefore it will be enough to say , that Arthur Bates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment owned by his father ; a poor but honest man , and deeply penitent for his follies. /z/ " He that is down needs fear no fall . " BUWYAW . THERE is not , perhaps , a country in the world where the extremes of human condition are less frequent than in our own : we are unacquainted alike with princely wealth and abject wretchedness . Yet even here it is not always sunshine , even with the honest , temperate , and industrious . As a general rule , indeed , any man of ordinary health , strength , and capacity , can make his living , if he chooses : but there are exceptions to the rule . It would be as absurd as it is inhuman to consider all poverty as the result of vice . The contrary is manifest every day . All men are fallible in judgment , and may fall into wrong projects . The best plans may fail from uncontrollable circumstances . The incapacity of a partner or an agent , or the fraud of a neighbour , or some sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for a particular fabric , or even in the most trifling fashion , is often sufficient to bring to penury such as have never laid up any thing . But the case is so plain in the eyes of all observing /z/ and benevolent men , that I shall not dwell on this point , but confine myself to a few suggestions for those who , by whatever path , have got to the bottom of the hill . My friend , let me take you by the hand : I like the pressure of a poor man 's hand , and I am not one of those Pharisaical helpers who can see nothing to pity where there is any thing to blame . It is enough for me that you are in straits : I ask not how you came there . But , let me whisper it might be well if you would ask it yourself . Perhaps you have been lavish , when you had abundance . Perhaps you have been idle , or improvident ; or your children have been too fine , or your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too fond of a horse or a gun ; or the coin has found its way from your till into the barroom or the eating-house ; or you have been a customer of the brewer , or the tobacconist . No matter whatever the wrong step may have been , the course of wisdom is for you to learn by experience . Dread the fire which has scorched you ; perhaps it is the best and the cheapest lesson you ever had . Now , when you are cool and collected , in the shades of the valley , take a survey of the path which you ought to have trodden , and make np your mind to choose and to pursue it . Be sure not to listen to the voice of pride . This is what barbs the arrow of poverty . True , if you are in absolute want , and near starvation , there will be wo enough even without pride . But /z/ in the great majority of reverses , the feeling of mortification is the worst part . If you have enough to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your power , banish the consideration of other people 's thoughts , which can not make your case either better or worse . With a good conscience , you may safely leave your case to the care of Providence . You are , it is true , at the foot of the ladder ; but what then ? The way up is just the same as before . Never despond ; this is the grand rule , and I repeat it , never despond . The most successful men have had their reverses . " Try again , " is a good motto , and your condition must be bad indeed , if this does not set you right . At any rate , brooding over losses can not repair them . Your melancholy feelings can do you no good , and will do you much harm . Despondency strikes a palsy into your arm , and cuts off all the chances of your recovery . It is , perhaps , as great an evil in poverty as in sickness . After all , it is not a leading trait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like boats which easily right themselves , our merchants and mechanics rise out of troubles with an alacrity which is surprising . Encourage this hopeful temper , but let it be natural . As you value your happiness shun all artificial comforters . The man who , in embarrassment , resorts to the bottle , or the tavern , may be said to be half lost . However bad your condition may be , it is not so wretched as this will /z/ make you . If intoxicating liquors are always dangerous , they are a thousand-fold so to the man who is in straits . You are embarrassed , but not undone . Now let me warn you against suddenly abandoning your present business . In nine cases out of ten , those who leave the trade to which they have been bred , find the change disastrous . You can not be as much at home in any other employment , and your having failed in one effort is no sign that you will fail in the next . On the same principle I would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always involves loss of time , loss of money , and loss of credit . Whatever may have brought you down , resolve to retrieve your former standing in the very place where you have lost it . That which needs alteration is not your circumstances , but yourself . Unless you can change this by a removal , you had better remain . There is , of course , an exception in those cases where a man 's business is overstocked , where there is no demand for his labour , or where there exist other insuperable obstacles to his progress . Supposing you , then , to have come to the wise resolve to build on the old foundation , let me give you another hint : Do not relax your exertions for a moment . It is strange , but common , to see men making poverty an excuse for idleness . Their business has failed , and accordingly they walk about the streets for a month with their hands in /z/ their pockets . When the waterman finds that his boat has been carried by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rowing , and yield himself to the adverse waves , but braces every muscle , and pulls hard against the stream . Redouble your exertions , and you may soon be extricated . Particularly when one is in debt , this is the best encouragement which he can give his creditors to allow him every favour . And if it has been your misfortune to be involved in debt , let me beseech you to avoid plunging any deeper into this slough . Necessity has no law , but so long as you can procure an honest mouthful of food , avoid this embarrassment . There are occasions on which , if ever , men are open to temptation . When want pinches , when wife and family cry for food , those whose honour has never wavered will sometimes think of dishonest resources . Stifle the viper in your bosom ! Last of all , I say , do not repine . Discontent will only imbitter the distress which it can not relieve ; and it is as wrong as it is useless and injurious . Be humble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will not fail to see better days . // /z/ " I still had hopes , for pride attends us still , Amidst the swains to show my book-learn 'd skill , Around my fire an evening group to draw , And tell of all I felt , and all I saw . And as a hare , whom hounds and horns pursue , Pants to the place from whence at first she flew , I still had hopes , my long vexations past , Home to return and die at home at last . " /z/ AFTER an absence of many years I lately revisited the village of Ashford . This is a small inland place , in the midst of farmers , and undistinguished by manufactures or extensive trade . Its inhabitants are chiefly mechanics and store-keepers . On my entrance , I perceived that the place had undergone fewer changes than is common in America . There was the same long , straggling street , widening at one place into a green or common , upon which stood an unsightly market-place , of that red brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . There were the same inns , and before one of them the same creaking sign of an Indian Queen , at which I used to throw stones when I was a boy . The /z/ principal tavern had been enlarged , and I was told that the present incumbent was the last of six who had practised at that bar within twenty years . Besides those who had been burned out , one had been hanged , and one had become a reformed character . I was sorry to see that the other tavern-keeper was a person who had in former days been a pro raising saddler . My attention was drawn forcibly to the places of the old mechanics . I looked for old JAMES SORREL , the chair-maker ; there was no trace of him or his . None of his sons were bred to his trade , and those who survive are in the West . I also looked for MARK BELVILLE , the hatter the only one of his trade in those days . He ran away from his creditors fifteen years ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always a rendezvous for the idlers of the whole street . The little English tailor , who was next in the row , had become too old to work ; I was told he had become rich and miserly ; he had no children , and , as I remember , could not read . ROBERTS , the shoemaker , was still visible , a grayhaired old man , pacing about the street with an unsteady step , his hands behind him . After many years ' hard work , he has retired to live with a married niece ; his sons are in Ohio , except one who keeps up the trade in a neighbouring town . The old man has one serious calamity : he has no solace for his old age , either of mind or heart . In his young days he had but one rule , Be honest /z/ and industrious . How many think this allsufficient ! He observed it ; he worked early and late , till his back was bowed down , and his eyesight gone . He succeeded that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saved both time and money . He had no books but an almanac , and always voted at town-meeting for the lowest possible sum to common schools . His charity began at home ; and he took care to let it end there ; and resolving to be just before he should be generous , he was all his life practising this first lesson . Now , in his old age , he is wealthy , but wretched . The domestic charm which keeps some families together , was unknown to him , and he is a solitary widower ; though , if you number his children , the family is large . I have written down in my pocket-book , that it will not do for a man to make a god of his trade ; and that , in spite of Ben Franklin , there are other goods in life than popularity and thrift . The very next house is occupied by two young brokers , partners , who are playing the very same game . A new race of loungers appeared in the streets , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having the same airs , and very much the same haunts . It is a class which propagates itself with remarkable ease , and there are few country towns in which there may not be found abundant specimens . The spots once occupied by the shops of two bakers , I was pleased to see covered with beautiful pleasure-grounds , and embellished with /z/ two mansions a good deal superior to any thing in Ashford . I knew their occupants well . They were dutiful boys , and public-spirited men . The time and money , which at intervals they bestowed upon objects of common interest , have been amply made up to them by increase of credit and respectability . Benevolence is good policy . By doing good they are more known , and more revered . The chief difficulty is for them to decline offices of trust ; and they are already concerned in the administration and settlement of more estates than any of their fellow-townsmen . Though not related , they have always been good friends ; and I am told they are about to join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or building for public lectures and philosophical experiments . They furnish a happy example of that healthful popularity which may be attained without an undue meddling with party politics . By this I am reminded of OLIVER CRABBE , the tallow-chandler . One would have supposed that Oliver 's business might have occupied all his hours , but he found time to spend upon the affairs of the public . He was oftener in his front shop than in his dipping-room , because his front shop was a sort of news-room . There , upon bench and counter , at almost any hour , might be seen the sage quidnuncs of the town . It was the village exchange . In spite of odours " not of amber , " that door seemed to attract to itself perpetual groups , which might be likened to the clusters at /z/ the aperture of a bee-hive . Here the newspapers were read , and the public business settled . As you might expect , Oliver was chief speaker ; he loved to hear himself talk , which I have observed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no meeting of the party to which he belonged , at which he did not find it easy to attend , whatever might be the state of his business . At town meetings , his voice was lifted up , and when he passed between the tellers , he was usually followed by a retinue of humble political admirers . I am not sure that he did not sometimes dream of higher honours , for I have heard him rallied about a sheet of paper , on which he had practised , in a fine flourishing hand , the mysterious words , Pub . Doc . Free OLIVER CRABBE . Oliver has been in the poor-house for five years . The grave-yard of the little village gave evident tokens that almost a generation had passed away . In walking among the green mounds , and marble memorials , I could not but observe that a large proportion of those who lay there had by no means arrived at extreme age . Another reflection which forced itself on me was , that the epitaphs never told the whole truth . The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would , for instance , read aloud from a headstone the pretty verses commemorative of some spotless youth , and my guide would say , " He died of drink . " Of another , equally celebrated over his grave , he would observe : " This man was a /z/ drunkard . " Indeed , I shudder to think how many whom I once knew among the working classes of this place , have been brought to their grave , either directly or indirectly , by strong drink . As I sauntered about the streets and neighbouring lanes , I would occasionally stumble on one and another of the few surviving topers , who seem to be left as warnings by Providence , like the blackened pine-trunks after a forest-burning . It is remarkable that when you find an aged drunkard , you commonly find that he did not begin very early , and also that he has murdered several children by his example , and sent them before him into eternity . But my reflections must draw to a close . Looking at the town as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , in the midst of this , too great a disposition to be still and do nothing . /q/ will do for the present , is a ruinous motto . It has led DICK HARLOW to leave an old post-and-rail fence in front of his house and shop , until he has grown to be an old man . It has allowed an old ruinous well-curb to disgrace the garden of JONES , the wheelwright , ever since he was a boy . It has kept half a dozen little door-yards without a single improvement , when they might , every one of them , have been , this fine April morning , full of hyacinths , crocuses , violets , and moss-pinks . And , to speak of more public concerns , this same motto might be inscribed over the shabby town-house , /z/ shadeless streets , and filthy horse-pond , which continue to be nuisances of the village of Ashford . After all , there are a score or two of honest , healthy , happy artisans , who are thriving in their business , and bringing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , and a new church ; a debating society , and a musical club ; a reading-room and a lyceum ; and at any moment at which the body of the people shall agree to abandon their sleepy motto , there will be a hundred more good things to recount. /z/ " I love to hear of those , who , not contending Nor summon 'd to contend for virtue 's prize , Miss not the humbler good at which they aim ; Blest with a kindly faculty to blunt The edge of adverse circumstance , and turn Into their contraries the petty plagues And hinderances with which they stand beset . " /z/ IN our earliest story-books , and in the copies set for us by our writing-masters , we all learned the value of contentment . But in real life , it is remarkable how little this excellent means of happiness is cultivated . The other evening , as I sat under my willow with UNCLE BENJAMIN and Mr. APPLETREE , the question arose whether men were made unhappy more by their own fault , or the fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , that in our country most men might be happy if they would . " I except , " said he , " - eases of signal calamity ; but as Virgil says of the farmers , I say of most of my neighbours , ' O too happy men ! if ye only knew your own advantages /z/ Here I ventured to put in my oar , by saying , /z/ what , perhaps , may not be new to the reader , that there are few men who do not wish for something which they have not . " Yes , " said uncle Benjamin , " according to the old saying , ' Enough means a little more . ' Every man wants to reach a higher peak of the mountain before he sits down , when he might as well sit down where he is . " " You remind me of Plutarch , uncle Benjamin , " said the schoolmaster . " In his life of Pyrrhus , he relates that this monarch was once talking with Cineas , a favourite orator and counsellor , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to conquer the Romans . Then he would extend his power over all Italy . Then he would pass to Sicily , to Lybia , to Carthage . ' But when we have conquered all , ' asked Cineas , ' what are we to do then ? ' ' Why , then , my friend , ' said Pyrrhus , laughing , ' we will take our ease , and drink and be merry . ' ' But why , ' said Cineas , can we not sit down and do that just as well now ? ' The same may be applied to smaller men than Pyrrhus . " " Ay , ay , you say truly , " said the old man , shaking out the ashes , and preparing for a fresh pipe ; " you say truly . Few men are wise in time . They chase their game so hotly that when they have nm it down they ca n't enjoy it . There was our neighbour Gripe : Mr. Quill knew him well . He and I began life together . Gripe started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a rich man . He had no children , /z/ and few expenses , yet he always pressed on as if the constable was at his heels . There was no repose there was no relaxation . Round and round he went , like a horse in a mill . I often urged him to stop . ' You have enough , ' I would say , ' begin to enjoy it ; why make yourself the prey of these vexing cares ? ' But no he could not be content . At length his wife died ; he was left alone , rich but friendless . He gave up business , but it was too late . His fireside had no charms , and he fell into a melancholy which was soon followed by a mortal complaint . So he died without having ever known what it was to sit down and enjoy a moment of quiet . The whole of his property was scattered to the winds , by a pair of grand-nephews , his heirs-at-law . " " Nature requires but a little , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants . I have accustomed myself to say , in looking at many a piece of luxury , ' I can do without it . ' Even the ancient heathen had learned as much as this . Their philosophers endeavoured to persuade men to seek happiness by narrowing their desires , rather than by increasing their gratifications . ' He who wants least , ' says one of them , ' is most like the gods , who want nothing . ' " " Those old fellows were mighty wise , I dare say , " said uncle Benjamin ; " but I warrant you they found it hard to practise as they preached . At the same time no one can deny the truth of what they affirmed . And I have often told my /z/ son Sammy , that nothing would be a greater curse to him than to have all his desires gratified ; according to the old story of the Three Wishes . On the other hand , if a man would but buckle his desires within the belt of his circumstances , he would be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncle Benjamin , that men usually gain this sort of wisdom in proportion as they rise in the world ? " " No , no far from it . Pampering does not produce patience . He who grows rich is only feeding a fever . Indulgence begets peevishness . Those tailors and shoemakers , along our street , who are just shutting up for the night , are happier than the wealthy sportsmen and idlers over the river ; nay , they are happier than they will be themselves , when , like so many American mechanics , they become wealthy , and live in their own great houses . I have often heard Thrale , the rich brewer , say that he did not feel at home in his own parlour , and that he looked back with regret to the days when he had but three rooms in his house . " This led me to relate the story of my cousin Barnaby Cox . He was a book-binder , in a small way , and took a sweet little woman to wife , and lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy a fellow as worldly things can make any one ; he earned his pleasures , and he enjoyed them . He needed no balls , taverns , gaming , or theatre to enliven his evenings . This was while he lived , as you may say , from hand /z/ to mouth . By some turn in the wheel , he became prosperous ; he formed new connexions , and got into new lines of business ; in short , he became a wealthy man . But riches did not make him a better man . He lives in splendour in Chestnut street ; but he has gone down in health and cheerfulness . He is restless , and listless , and seems never to know what to do next . His great house is seldom visited except by a few relations , and if the truth could be told , he sighs for the evenings he used to enjoy when work was done . " The case is not rare , " said Mr. Appletree ; " but I have one to relate , which , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken as a fair offset to Mr. Quill 's . In the neighbourhood where I was bred , there is a man whom I shall call ARATOR . He was the son of a wealthy and somewhat proud family , and fell heir to a large and well-kept estate . There was not a nobler farm or mansion in the whole country-side . Being a man of studious habits , and indolent and melancholy , he allowed his affairs to run on rather negligently , and partly from this cause , and partly from the treachery of his principal legal agent , he became what the world calls a ruined man . " Ruined , however , he was not . After the first shock of misfortune , he seemed to be awakened to new energies . His indolence and his gloom took leave of him . He set about the retrieving of his fortune , with an energy which astonished those who knew him best . True , he is likely to be /z/ a poor man as long as he lives , but he is in a faiy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contented . Not long since I called upon him at his humble dwelling , in the midst of a little piece of land which he tills . He was in his working dress , and moist with the labours of the hay-field ; but he received me with a radiant smile , and ushering me into his sitting-room , cried out , ' Here , Lucy , is our old friend Appletree ; he has not forgotten the champagne and venison of Strawberry hill , nor have we : we can not treat him to any ; but we can teach him , when our children come in , that there is some truth still in the old stories about cottages and contentment . ' And the blended blush and tear of his wife , with the whoop and halloo of the boys that just then bounded into the room , told me that , by coming down in the world , they had risen in the scale of true enjoyment . " /z/ " Cade . Dost thou use to write thy name 1 or hast thou a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir , I thank God , I have been so well brought up that I can write my name . All . He hath confessed ; away with him : he 's a villain , and a traitor . Cade . Away with him , I say ; hang him with his pen and inkhorn about his neck . " Second Part of King Henry VI . IN using the title working-man , I have merely availed myself of a phrase which is commonly understood . As usually employed , it designates the artisan , the mechanic , the operative , or the labourer ; all , in a word , who work with their hands . But I trust no reader of these pages will so far misunderstand me , as to suppose that I mean to deny that there are multitudes of other classes , who work , and work hard , and whose honest industry is as useful to society as that of the smith or the carpenter . There are many varieties of industry , and the common distinction is a just one between headwork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is almost impossible to draw /z/ the line between them . The mathematical instm ment maker is as industrious and indispensable a character as the puddler in an iron foundry ; but the work of the former is chiefly head-work : and then what a difference between the bodily labour of the two ! Yet no reasonable person could exclude the instrument maker from the number of working-men . The nice operations , however , of this workman , as also those of the watchmaker , jeweller , lapidary , and engraver , do not , in a strict sense , deserve the name of labour any more than that of the man who writes his six hours daily in a clerk 's office . Yet how many are there who would deny the honours of industry to the jaded clerk , even though his toils are a thousandfold more wasting and disheartening than those of the mason or wheelwright ! In every great establishment both kinds of service are required , and neither party should look upon the other with jealousy or disdain . There must , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the presses , and boys to see to the rollers ; and there must be the setting up of the type ; but , again , there must be correcting of the proofs , which is purely head-work . There must be keeping of accounts , which is of the same nature , and equally indispensable . And , if I may be allowed to say a word in behalf of my own calling , there is the poor author , but for whom the press would stand still ; and whose labour is not the least exhausting of the whole . /z/ Yet he is the very one who , according to some of the popular doctrines of the day , should be denied the name and credit of a working-man ! In every extensive manufactory , the carter , drayman , or porter , is not more necessary than the clerk or book-keeper . The conductor of a railroad train , though he does little or nothing with his hands , is as needful as the brake-man or engineer . The skilful director of a cotton-mill , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives . No great building can be erected without previous drawings ; the man who plans and executes these , has no more labour than he who keeps the books ; and both these are no less working-men than the stone-sawyer in the marbleyard , or the hod-carrier upon the scaffold . The pilot does no hard labour on board ship , yet he is as important a working-man as the hardiest tar . So , likewise , in the manufacture of complicated machines , such as steam-engines , not a blow can be effectually struck until the chief engineer has gone about his head-work , and made his calculations : and the sturdy fellow who toils at the anvil , or the grindstone , should not forget that his employer is tasked as severely and as needfully as himself . There is really such a thing as headwork , and it is hard work . This is proved by the appearance of those who are devoted to it . Clerks , book-keepers , accountants , and all writers , are liable to suffer exceedingly in point of health , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often as much distressed by rest as labouring men by motion ; the maintenance of one posture injures them in various ways . Their digestive organs soon give way , they grow lean and sallow , and low-spirited , and are ready to envy every wood-sawyer they meet . Surely it is unjust to sneer at such men , as drones in the hive . The concerns of life can not be carried on without a mixture of both head-work and hand-work . Strike out either sort from any extensive establishment , and the work must come to an end . A hasty observer , on going into a ship-yard , and seeing the bustle , and hearing the hum of business , would be ready to think that every thing was done by main force , by the saw , hammer , and adze . But on looking a little deeper , he would find that quite as important a part of the work is done out of sight , in the noiseless office , or model-loft . He would see one man writing letters , or copying them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third drawing plans , a fourth making tedious computations , and a fifth overseeing the whole , and acting as head to a hundred pair of hands . How soon would our famous steam-engines , which have attracted admiration even in England , cease to be produced , if it were not for the contriving heads of our Stevenses , Baldwins , Norrises , and Merricks ! Can any man deny that James Watt or Sir Richard Arkwright were working as really and as hard for the common good , when they /z/ were studying out their great inventions , as if they had been filing brass , or casting iron , or turning a lathe ? And was not Sir Humphry Davy , in his laboratory , when contriving his safety-lamp , as truly working in a useful vocation as the humblest miner with his pick-axe and shovel ? But the principle admits of much wider application , to those , namely , who have no immediate connexion with manual labour . I maintain , that every man who honestly supports himself by industrious application to useful business is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not make so great a difference . If it did , we might find it hard to show that there is not a wider step between the coal-heaver and the tailor , than between the tailor and the accountant . Roger Sherman was first a shoemaker , and then a Congressman : but he worked harder and did more good in the latter than in the former capacity . John Newton was first a sailor and then a preacher ; but no one who knows his history will deny that he was vastly more useful to society in his second calling . The salesman and travelling agent are working-men , no less than the manufacturer . The affairs of commerce require clerks , bankers , merchants , calculators , editors of journals . Not less necessary are physicians , teachers , lawyers , clergymen , and judges . No man can be said to lead an easy life who faithfully discharges the duties of any one of these professions ; and this would be soon found to be true , by any /z/ doubter who should undertake to assume their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then those who make great ' acquirements in science are contributing in the highest degree to the productions of human art . Many a man can do ten times as much in this way as in any other . The late lamented Judge Buel , of Albany , whose death has been announced since this work was going through the press , may be named as an instance in point . Though he well knew what it was to labour with his own hands as a practical farmer , yet no one who has looked at the pages of the " Cultivator , " will doubt for an instant that by conducting this work he did more for the agriculture , and consequently for the wealth of his country , than any hundred farmers , as good as he , could have accomplished by following the plough . Let us hear no more of this cant about working men and idle men : all industrious citizens are working-men . There are drones , indeed , but they exist as largely in the ranks of nominal labour as elsewhere . Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious and impartial attention is requested . I mean the opposition which some have attempted to set on foot , between the poor and the rich . It is natural for the opposition to exist in some degree ; but they are traitors to society who make it their business to foster it . It is natural for the hard working-man , sorely pressed to support his family , to look with envy upon the /z/ glittering equipage or marble house of his wealthy neighbour . But to seek the regulation of this matter by tumult and spoliation would be the extreme of madness . There never has been , and there never will be a country without this same division into rich and poor . Attempts have , indeed , been made for a season , to have every thing in common ; somewhat after the visions of Robert Owen ; but they have always failed . This was tried two hundred years ago among the romantic settlers of Virginia ; but the bubble soon burst , for none were gainers but the drones , and it was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work shall not eat . " The sure and direct way to competency and even wealth , is the quiet pursuit of a good trade or calling . In no country is this more true than in our own , where there are no legal barriers against the rising of the honest poor ; where there are no titles of nobility , no law of primogeniture , no entail of estates . A few glaring exceptions there may be , but , generally speaking , the wealth of this country has been acquired by indefatigable industry : our rich men have been working-men . Or , suppose it to have been their fathers who were the working-men ; is my reader the man who would cut off his own sons from all the advantages of what he has earned ? It is idle , it is ruinous , in such a country as ours , to set the poor against the rich . For who are the poor ? If you mean the drunken , the profligate , the idle . /z/ // our gamblers , sharpers , and sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would make a division of property . Who are the poor ? If you mean the hard-working tradesman or ope rative he does not need your help , and if he is wise he will not ask it ; because he is rapidly passing out of the ranks of the poor into those of the rich . Nor would it be possible to draw a line separating the one class , from the other , without placing on each hand those who were rising or falling from either side . Whose interest , then , is it to excite prejudices between rich and poor ? Not that of the industrious ; not that of the poor man who has sons , who may rise to the utmost elevation known among us ; not that of the quiet man who desires security of property for himself and his neighbour ; but only of the grasping and designing rogue , who , like a thief at a fire , wishes to profit by the general confusion . All these suspicions and heart-burnings between one class and another are evil and disastrous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the ocean ; and there is no great class of men which is not necessary to the good of all the rest . The reader of history will remember the famous story of Menenius Agrippa , a Roman consul and general , as related by Livy . The populace were up in arms against the nobles , and had intrenched themselves on one of the hills of the city . Agrippa appeased them by the following fable : " Once on a time , when each member /z/ of the human body could speak for itself , the members became dissatisfied with the belly ; which , said they , does nothing but lie in state , and enjoy the fruit of our labours . They resolved , therefore , upon a strike , and determined to stop the supplies of this luxurious organ . The hands stopped work , and would bring no food to keep him from starving ; the mouth would receive no provision ; the feet came to a perfect stand-still ; in a word , all business was stagnant . There was great perseverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place , and it was seen that there was no such thing as living without the kind offices of this indolent and aristocratic consumer of victual. " /z/ " I crown thee king of intimate delights , Fireside enjoyments , home-born happiness , And all the comforts that the lowly roof Of undisturb 'd retirement , and the hours Of long uninterrupted evening know . " /z/ THE family relation implies community of interest ; as there is a common stock , so there are common sorrows and common joys . Put a dozen people together in a house , and let each lead the life of a hermit : this would be no family , even though they might be blood relations . There is more of domestic life even in the steerage of a packet-ship , where like seeks its like , and little congenial groups are formed before the voyage is over . The true glory of home is in the middle region of civilization : it is absent alike from the highest and the lowest . What can be more cheerless than the sullen selfishness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in indolent dignity , while the squaw and the children are spurned , as unworthy of a look unless it be the elegant and fashionable household of the prince or noble , where each is independent /z/ of the other , and has his separate equipage and peculiar friends . Compare with this the cottage of the poor labourer , who returns at twilight to be welcomed by every human being , and every domestic animal ; who tells over , or hears , all the occurrences of the day , and who feels that there is no interest which he does not share with every one around him . There is more value than all believe , in the simple maxim , Let family enjoyments be common to all . If there are few who deny this , there are still fewer who act upon it in its full extent . Something of it , as I have said , there must be , to make a family at all . We occupy the same house , sit around the same fire , and eat at the same table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do otherwise . But I am for carrying the matter much farther , and for knitting more closely together those who cluster around the same hearth ; believing that every influence is evil which severs father from child , and brother from brother . The morsel that is eaten alone becomes sooner or later a bitter morsel . Members of the same household should feel that they are dependent on one another , and should be as free to ask , as ready to give , assistance . Each should rise in the morning with the impression , that no duty of the day is more urgent than to make every individual happy , with whom he is brought into contact . And this contact should be sought , not shunned . It is a bad sign , when /z/ members of the same household are shy of one another . I do not , of course , allude here to those horrid instances of unnatural , brutal temper , where persons of the same blood , daily gathered around the same board , refuse to speak to one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case . I refer to a more common fault , which sometimes exists where there is a degree of real affection , but where the members of a family have separate pursuits and separate pleasures . The hasty morning meal is swallowed with little intercourse . When it is done , each hurries to his or her peculiar line of employment . The mother is busy in the kitchen , the father in the shop , the sons go their several ways . This might do well enough , if it were confined to business , but it becomes the habit of the hours of leisure . The father has his evenings abroad ; the sons are seldom within doors till a late hour , and too often , she who most needs the cheering influences of the family circle , the mother , is left to patch or darn by a dim candle , with the cradle moving at her feet , during those hours in which her daughters are laughing or singing among their young company . All this is highly undesirable . The evenings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful seasons of joint satisfactions . If we must have evening parties of friends , let there be a proper mingling of sexes and ages . The presence of the old may to a degree moderate the mirth of the /z/ young , but in the same proportion the aged will be enlivened . This parcelling and assorting of society , like labelled packages in a shop , is becoming too common , and in my judgment injurious . The young folks must be all together ; and the children must be all together ; and if matters go on thus , we may live to see parties of graybeards and parties of sucklings . No ! wherever it is possible , let the family chain be kept bright and whole . In the houses of the industrious , it is surely broken often enough by separation at work during the day . Instead of thus living apart , which engenders selfishness and moroseness , I love to see the members of families flowing together , like congenial drops . There are some houses in which no one makes a confidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother , he must go abroad for it . This is unnatural , and wholly evil ; incompatible with the frankness of simple love . Show me the father often walking with his sons , and these sons often with one another , not in business merely , but in sports ; and I shall think I see a virtuous and happy household . There is one particular in which the principle I have laid down may have a very important application . I mean the case of mental improvement . The rule should here be , so far as possible , let the pursuit of knowledge in every family be a joint pursuit . For many reasons this is desirable in every house , but it is almost indispen- /z/ sable in the house of the working-man . It wakes up the spirit of improvement ; it saves time and expense , and it gives tenfold zest to the refreshments of leisure . To take one of the simplest instances , I would , in two words , say to every working-man , Read aloud . If the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every one can get his share . If the family is very busy , and the female members of all industrious families are as much so in the evening as in the day the reading of one will be as good as the reading of all , and while one reads , a dozen may knit or sew . There are many persons who enjoy much more and retain much better what is read to them than what they read themselves : to the reader himself , there is a great difference in favour of reading aloud , as it regards the impression on his own mind . The members of the circle may take turns , and thus each will have a chance of learning , what so few really attain , the art of correct and agreeable reading . Occasion is thus offered for questions , remarks , and general discourse ; and it is almost impossible for conversation to flag , where this practice is pursued . With this method , the younger members of a family may be saved in a good degree from the perusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little foresight be used , a regular course of solid or elegant instruction might thus be constantly going forward , even in the humblest family . But the moral and social effects of such a prac- /z/ tice are not less to be regarded . Evenings thus spent will never be forgotten . Their influence will be daily felt in making every member of the circle more necessary to all the rest . There will be an attractive charm in these little fireside associations which will hold the sons and daughters back from much of the wandering which is common . It will be a cheap , wholesome , safe eajoyment , and it will be all this , at home . The gains of an affectionate family ought to be shared and equalized ; the remark is true of all degrees and kinds of learning . Study has a tendency to drive men to solitude , and solitude begets selfishness , whim , and moroseness . There are some households in which only one person is learned ; this one , however amiable , has , perhaps , never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How seldom do men communicate what they have learned to their female relations : or , as a man once said in my hearing , " Who tells news to his wife ? " And yet how easy would it be , by dropping a word here , and a word there , for even a philosopher to convey the chief results of his inquiries to those whom he meets at every meal . I have been sometimes surprised to see fathers , who had made great attainments , and who , therefore , knew the value of knowledge , abstaining from all intercourse with their sons , upon the points which were nearest their own hearts . In families where the reverse of this is true , that is , where the pursuits of the /z/ house have been a joint business , it is common to see a succession of persons eminent in the same line . Thus , among linguists , the Buxtorfs ; among painters the Vernets and the Peales ; among musicians , the Garcias ; in literature , the Edgeworths , the Taylors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their verynature , are social ; these may be used to give a charm to the working-man 's home . This is more true of nothing than of music . Harmony implies a concurrence of parts , and I have seen families so trained , that every individual had his allotted part or instrument . Let the thing , however , be conducted by some rule . If proper pains be taken with children , while they are yet young , they may all be taught to sing . Where circumstances favour it , instrumental music may be added . It is somewhat unfortunate that American women practise almost entirely upon the more expensive instruments ; and it is not every man who can or ought to give two hundred and fifty dollars for a piano-forte . In countries where the guitar is a common accompaniment , it is within the reach of the poorest . There may be lovely music , however without any instrument . The most exquisite music in the world , I mean that of the pope 's Sistine Chapel , is known to be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both as to music and words . It is the height of folly to buy every new thing which comes from the music-sellers . So far as words are concerned , a /z/ full half of what they publish is nonsense , or worse ; and I have blushed to see a young lady turning over what she very properly called her " loose music . " Those persons , therefore , deserve our thanks , who from time to time are publishing in a cheap form such secular music as is proper for families . I here refer chiefly to such works as Kingsley 's Social Choir , Mason 's Odeon , and the Boston Glee Book . But , after all , and without any reference to religion , the best music is sacred music . It is on this that the greatest masters have laid out their strength ; it is this which most suits the chorus of many voices . Secular pieces , as commonly published , are intended to be sung by few , or by a single voice ; but sacred compositions admit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful to drop into one of those families where the evenings are sometimes spent in this way . There is the eldest daughter at the piano-forte , accompanied by the eldest son upon the violin . Another son and two daughters lead off vocally , with the principal melody , while a neighbouring youth plays the tenor , and sings the same part . The old gentleman in spectacles labours at his violoncello , and two or three flutes come in modestly to complete the orchestra ; while nieces , nephews , cousins , friends , and , perhaps , suitors , fill up the sounding chorus with right good will . This is , indeed , something more than a mere family meeting , but it is what grows out of it ; /z/ and when the evening ends , and some little refreshments have gone around , the transition is not abrupt from this to the social worship , when all voices join once more in a happy evening hymn . /z/ " 0 , evenings worthy of the gods ! exclaimed The Sabine bard . O evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , As more illumined , and with nobler truths , That I , and mine , and those we love , enjoy . " /z/ THERE are no portions of the working-man 's life in which a more constant series of innocent satisfactions is offered to him , than his evenings . This is true of those at least whose trades do not encroach upon the night . When labour is over , there is an opening for domestic pleasures which no wise man will ever neglect . My neighbour BOSWELL has a high sense of these enjoyments , and makes the most of them . Except when some public meeting calls him abroad , you are as sure to find him at home in the evening , as at work in the day . Sometimes , indeed , he accompanies his wife or eldest daughter in a visit , but he never appears at clubs or taverns . " I work hard , " he is accustomed to say , " for my little comforts , and I like to enjoy them unbroken . " The picture would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have it clearly in my mind 's eye . The snug and well-closed room is all gay with the blaze of a high wood-fire ; which casts upon the smiling circle a ruddy glow . There is Bos well , in his arm-chair , one hand between the * leaves of a book which he has just closed , the other among the auburn locks of a little prattling girl . He gazes into the coals with that air of happy revery , which is so sure a token of a mind at rest . The wife , nearer to the light , is plying the ceaseless needle , and distributing kind words , and kinder glances among the little group . Mary , the eldest daughter , is leaning over a sheet of paper , upon which she has just executed a drawing . George , the eldest son , is most laboriously engaged in the construction of a powder-horn . Two little ones are playing the royal game of Goose ; while one , the least of all , is asleep before the fire , by the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same spot every evening . Such humble scenes , I am happy to beliete , are still presented to view , in thousands of families among the working classes . Need it be added , that they are immeasurably above the sickly heats of those who make pleasure the great object of their pursuit in life ? It is among such influences that religion spreads its balm , and that knowledge sheds its fruits . Rest after toil is always agreeable ; but it is doubly so when enjoyed in such circumstances , in the bosom of a loving family , healthful , instructed , and harmonious . Such uni- /z/ formity is never tedious , nor such quiet ever dull . Every such evening may be remembered in after life with pleasing regrets . My friend tells me , that it is a refreshment to his mind , during the greatest labours or chagrin of the day , to look forward to his tranquil evening . When work is done , he hastens to wash away the traces of his ruder business , and to make himself as smart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , " he says , " has a right to be clean at night . " This is the rule of his house ; and when his sons grow large enough to be out at trades , they will , no doubt , come in every evening as trim and as tidy as they went out . It is no interruption of such a group for a neighbour to drop in . The circle opens , a seat is drawn up , the sleepers are merrily pushed aside from the rug , the conversation grows lively , news circulates , and joy sparkles in every face . The salves of cakes , or the fruit-basket , or some healthful beverage prepared by " neat-handed " Mary , adds to the substantial of the entertainment . The newspaper , or some pleasant book is read aloud ; and when the hour for separation comes , they part with a vastly better state of feeling than that of the greasy creature who has nodded in his moping corner , or the peevish tavern-haunter who comes home late to scold his solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the effect upon the state of society in any village /z/ or town , if every working-man in it could be induced to spend his evenings at home , and in this manner . A reform in this single particular would work wonders . Every one who is admitted to such a scene , feels at once that there is a charm in it . Why , then , are there so many families , where nothing of this kind is known ? To give all the reasons might be tedious ; but I must mention one or two . First , there must be punctuality , neatness , and thrift in the affairs of housekeeping , to make such a state of things practicable . No man loves to take his seat between two washingtubs , or beside a fire where lard is simmering , or to stretch his legs over a hearth where almost every spot is occupied by some domestic utensil . Then , there must be a feeling of mutual respect and love , to afford inducement to come together in this way . Further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some little sprinkling of knowledge . The house where there are no books is a dull house ; the talk is amazingly dull talk . Reading makes pleasant conversation . George always has some good thing to read to Mary ; or Mary some useful fact to repeat to George . A little learning in the family is like a little salt in the barrel , it keeps all sound and savoury . And , finally , I feel it incumbent on me to repeat what has been said more than once already , that he who overtasks his days , has no evenings . In our country , thank God , labour need not be immoderate to keep one alive . There /z/ is such a thing as working too much , and thus becoming a mere beast of burden . I could name some men , and more women , who seem to me to be guilty of this error . Consequently , when work is past they are fit for nothing but solid sleep . Such are the men and the women who have no domestic pleasures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *t honw. /z/ " As one who long in populous city pent Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air , Forth issuing on a summer 's morn to breathe Among the pleasant villages and farms Adjoin 'd , from each thing met conceives delight , The smell of grain , or tedded grass , or kine , Or dairy , each rural sight , each rural sound " /z/ EVERY man , until his taste is completely vitiated , and habit , a second nature , has inverted his native propensities , will experience a satisfaction upon going into the country ; and there is a particular zest in the little excursions of the townbred artisan , who leaves the brick , and mortar , and confined air within , to enjoy the gaiety and freshness of rural environs . These visits have pleasant associations . We connect them with fine weather , clean clothes , holidays , and good company ; and it is not unlikely that much of the beauty of the country is merely an emanation from our own cheerfulness . Yet after every deduction on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God made the country , but man made the town ' . " /z/ It is not wonderful , therefore , that many of our working-men , as soon as they are able , take their families into the country , either for the summer , or as a permanent residence . A large proportion of the snug little farms around our great towns , are tilled by mechanics , some of whom have retired from trade , while others still continue in business , and use these as their places of retreat . This tendency to the country seems to be on the increase , and I am persuaded it augurs well for the future respectability of the whole class . There are few mechanics in our land who may not look forward to the possession and occupancy of a few acres ; and the expectation is a very cheering one to those who have to ply their sedentary tasks , year after year , in the same unventilated shops or lofts . There is a feeling of independence in surveying one 's own grounds , however small in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sights , sounds , and odours of the country ; but there are more substantial benefits . No device for the prevention of disease or the restoration of health , is comparable to that of moderate agricultural labour . The fresh air , the exhalation of newly opened furrows , the morning ride , the succession of vegetables and fruits , the continual variety of employments , the intervals of absolute rest , and the placid ease of mind , concur to keep the animal powers in their most healthful play . I scarcely know which season most to covet : spring is balmy and full of /z/ promise ; summer affords gorgeous flowers and sunny harvest ; autumn comes laden with fruits ; and even winter brings days of healthful labour and evenings of cheerfulness and improvement by the ample fire-place . There is no situation in which children may be brought up in greater security from the temptations of a wicked world . They must , indeed , become somewhat restive ; they may , perhaps , be bashful , and will fail of having that precocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many city lads . But from how many moral defilements are they protected ! Having had some trial of both situations in my earlier days , I do not hesitate a moment to say , that the temptations of boyhood are far less in a farm than in any other condition in life . Then we should take into the reckoning the strength , and agility , and manliness which are fostered in a country life . The youthful limbs are developed , and the constitution made robust by labour , sport , and exposure . Sometimes the little farmer strains the young horse across the meadow , or with his faithful dogs traverses the wood , and climbs high to dislodge the squirrel or the raccoon from the slender hickory . Or he dashes into the rapid stream , or rows his boat , or drives his herd into distant pastures , regardless of rains and snows , which would put in jeopardy the lives of more effeminate boys Certainly the solids of physical education are best secured in the country . /z/ My old neighbour , HENRY HOPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely retreat into the country . After working many years at the hatter 's trade , he began to show signs of primitive decay . He had contracted a stoop in the shoulders , and his complexion was of a dirty yellow . Without entirely giving up his business , he invested some of his savings in a little property four miles out of town . Every year found him more and more of a farmer , until last spring he sold out his whole mechanical establishment , and betook himself to the green fields . I lately visited him , and was entertained with the complacency of his air , as he took me over his grounds . " There , " said he , " are my stacks of wheat ; not more , perhaps , than six hundred bushels ; but then my own , in every sense . There , on the right , you see I am putting up a new barn , and cover for my cattle . That spring-house of white stone is as cool as winter ; the clear water trickles over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may see my meadow , with the brook running through the midst of it . The double row of willows is to protect a causeway I have been making through that newly-drained swamp . But , come , I must not let you go till I have showed you my orchard , and explained my plans of grafting . " So he ran on , descanting now on his stock , now on his poultry , exhibiting improved ploughs , and young hedges , until t was almost persuaded to turn farmer myself . /z/ It is more than eighteen centuries since a Latin poet described , with enthusiasm , the lot of the husbandman : " O happy , if he knew his happy state , The swain who , free from business and debate , Receives the easy food from nature 's hand , And just returns of cultivated land . Unvex 'd with quarrels , undisturb 'd with noise , The country king his peaceful realm enjoys Cool grots , and living lakes , the flowing pride Of meads , and streams that through the valley glide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after toilsome days , a soft repose at night " * A country where agriculture is the great pursuit , is always a country advancing in civilization . Our own land still spreads out before the enterprising young man so many millions of untilled acres , that it would seem to be a plain indication of Providence , that for some time to come we should be an agricultural people . There can be no serious comparison between the health , physical and moral , of men in a thriving , rural district , and any equal number pent up in manufacturing towns . In order to succeed in husbandry , great farms are by no means necessary . It has grown into a proverb , that men grow poor on large farms , and rich on small ones . But if a man wishes to do these things upon the widest scale , the West is all open before him , and he may sit down among thousands of acres . Virgil . /z/ " Come , evening , once again , season of peace ; Return , sweet evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streaky west , With matron step slow moving , while the night Treads on thy sweeping train ! one hand employ 'd In letting fall the curtain of repose On bird and beast , the other charged for man With sweet oblivion of the cares of day . " CoWPEH . No one familiar with the aspect of towns inhabited by artisans , needs to be informed that the close of the week is marked by very striking peculiarities . As the ponderous engine of human labour slackens its revolutions , and at length stands still , and gentle rest begins to spread her wing over the haunts of toil , there is at once an addition made to the happiness of man , which no enthusiasm can well overvalue . In a few moments we may apply to the great capital or manufacturing town , the expressive verse from Wordsworth 's famous sonnet on London Bridge . " And all that mighty heart is lying still ! " /z/ The forge and the smithy are ceasing to smoke . The mighty arms and shafts moved by steam , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual utensils has terminated . Jaded animals , bowing their necks , are set free from the yoke ; while innumerable sons and daughters of toil , released from the necessity of further work , are ready for rest or pleasure , for improvement or vice . The thought is pleasing . As I survey the crowded city , and allow my imagination to picture the details of the scene , I behold a thousand delightful images of domestic comfort . Now , according to an extensively prevalent usage , the well-earned reward of labour is received . Now the anxieties of the tedious week are suspended . Families , separated during the preceding days , come together , better prepared than at other tims to aid one another , and to enjoy one another 's company . One unbroken day between two nights of unaccustomed repose , is a golden prize in expectation . The meeting of parents , brothers , sisters , children , sometimes of husband and wife , who have been kept apart by the stress of labour , is not without some points which deserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , with the virtuous , a season of hallowed affections . Happy is that working-man who , when , at the week 's end , he throws off , in the bath , the soils /z/ of labour , can with equal ease lay aside the wrong emotions or evil habits of the same period , and with a clear conscience prepare for the day of rest ! Happy is the youth who , when he comes home to greet his aged parents , and the sister of whom he is proud , feels that no tarnish has come over his heart ! Happy the blooming girl , however lowly her calling , who enters the humble dwelling with the elastic tread of conscious innocence ! Blessed family , where the call to rest is but the signal for the renewal of every kindly affection /z/ I know that with some , even in early life , the end of the week is the beginning of a frolic . The time when wages are received is apt to be a season of merriment if not of vice . In summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream forth out of the various avenues of our cities and towns . In winter the streets resound till a late hour with the tread of idlers and debauchees . And in every season , Saturday night fills the taverns , oyster-houses , porter-cellars , and other resorts , with a double allowance of hale fellows . There is a triple consumption of tobacco and strong drink on these occasions . So that there is a dark side to the picture , as there is , indeed , to most pictures of human life . But even here , I find an illustration of some of my favourite positions about the conservative influence of the domestic institution . The worst men , I will con- /z/ tinue to affirm , are those who , either from choice or from necessity , have no home . Perhaps , out of a thousand families gathered after a week 's work , there is not one gathered for vicious indulgence . Where youth are vicious , they commonly hate the hearthstone . Saturday evening is a good criterion of the attachment which a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guardian angel of the fireside , woman has here a great and hopeful work . I wish I could impress on the wife , the mother , and the sister , the value of their influence in this particular . Make home delightful , and you will work wonders . That wayward youth may , perhaps , be won by sisterly invitation . Spare nothing that is fairly within your power to make it worth his while to spend his Saturday evening with the family . So long as you have this hold upon him , you may almost bid defiance to the attempts of evil companions . Let it never be forgotten , that we owe all these good influences to religion . There would be no Saturday evening , if there were no Christian Sabbath . In countries where man and beast work seven days in the week , there is nothing which resembles the pleasant scenes to which I have alluded . In such countries there is little of what we mean by home . Who would undertake to explain to a French labourer the Cotter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name that exqui- /z/ site production , I can not leave it without commending it to the attention of every working-man who sets a value on family quiet and contentment . This single effusion would not be bought too dearly at the price of all the other productions of Robert Burns . Though written with special reference to an agricultural population , it presents a scene which might be realized in the household of any good man of whatever calling . The return of the cottager , after his labours , is described with the feeling of one who knew what it was to come home weary from the plough . The return of the sons , and of the daughter , is described in the very dialect of nature ; and the entrance of the lover is as arch as it is accurate . The chat , the joke , the supper , are all admirably told ; the crowning grace of the poem is the account of the family worship : " The cheerfu ' supper done , wi ' serious face , They , round the ingle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wi ' patriarchal grace , The big Aa ' Bible , ance his father 's pride : His bonnet reverently is laid aside , His lyart haflets* wearing thin an ' bare ; Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide , He wales a portion with judicious care ; And , Let us worship God ! he says , with solemn air . " The psalm is sung , the chapter is read ; the family , led by " the priest-like father , " bows in /z/ prayer ; they separate with affectionate salutations . Well says Burns , whom none will suspect of being a fanatic : " From scenes like these old Scotia 's grandeur springs , That makes her loved at home , revered abroad : Princes and lords are but the breath of kings , ' An honest man 's the noblest work of God : ' And , certes , in fair virtue 's heavenly road , The cottage leaves the palace far behind , " /z/ " A man so various that he seem 'd to be Not one , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong , Was every thing by turns , and nothing long . But in the course of one revolving moon Was chymist , fidler , statesman , and buffoon. " /z/ THE character which Dryden gives of the witty and wicked Duke of Buckingham , may , with some little change , be applied to many of us who have no titles of nobility . There is no more common character among our young men , than that of Reuben : Unstable as water , thou shall not excel. * Nor do I know any class of persons in whom it is more unfortunate than in those who earn their living by industry ; because it is the very nature of their employment to require patient continuance in one course . No trade can be either learned or practised without regularity and constancy . As I write with a principal reference to the young , I think it right to say here , that if the disease of instability is ever Gen. xlii. 4. /z/ cured , it must be in youth ; and the effort is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man of my neighbour hood . He has good talents and good prospects , and has begun life with a pretty little sum of money from his father 's estate . But though he is not yet twenty-three , he has already lived in three houses , and set up two trades . He has very decided opinions to-day , but no one can insure their lasting till to-morrow . When he hears arguments on one side , he leans one way ; when on the other side , he leans the other way . Hence , he is quite at the mercy of his companions ; and being somewhat sensible of this , he tries to make up for strength of belief , by energy of asseveration . Nevertheless , he betrays himself at every step ; for this is one of those things which can not be hidden . Vane takes up his opinions on trade , politics , and religion , at second-hand . The task of reasoning , he resigns to BRIGGS , the postmaster , and BRAG , the apothecary , who are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and , therefore , he is never long of one mind . For when opinions come lightly , they will go lightly . They are trees without roots , easily transplanted or blown down ; reeds shaken with the wind ; weathercocks turning with every breath . There is scarcely one of Vane 's opinions which his neighbours could not alter . His mind takes hold of truth with a paralytic grasp . True , this is sometimes amiable ; but for the purpose of life , /z/ it is even worse than obstinacy : just as granite , however hard , is more useful than friable sandstone . So much for his opinions . It is just the same with his feelings . Never have I seen an April sky so changeable as his temper . His tears and his laughter , his frowns and his caresses , maybe , at any moment , exchanged for one another . He shows this in his attachments . He rushes into new associations , to rush as quickly out of them . I have observed him for a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new faces . I own it is the same as to his malignant feelings ; he can not hold spite ; but still , with such fickleness , he never can be a man of strength , either for good or evil . It is the same with his habits . Vane never walks long enough in any one direction to wear a track . He breaks down in his journey , for want of patience . He is driven out of the road , for want of courage . I should as little expect to find him two successive days in the same state , as to see the moon rise for two nights at the same hour . I have more serious things to say . Vane is unstable in his principles . By a man of principle , I mean one who acts for reasons , which he can show and defend . What he does , he has before resolved to do . He has made up his mind as to the right and wrong of actions before he is brought to trial . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing which distinguishes the man of principle , namely , perseverance in a de- /z/ termined course . On one day he seems quite correct , the next almost dissolute . To-night he plays cards : to-morrov , he will join the temperance society . And this because he has no governing principle . It was good advice which a father once gave to his boy : " My son , learn to say NO . " There is as much energy in this short word , as in any expression in human language . But what object is more pitiable , than the poor , pliant young man , who can not stand out against the gentlest wind of temptation , or resist the sneer or the entreaty of bad companions ! I have often thought , therefore , that there is as much greatness as safety , in complying with the caution : " My son , when sinners entice thee , consent thou not . " Better far would it be for our youth , if they would barter away a good portion of pompous swagger and braggart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not yield an inch to the importunity of vice . Let me return to my subject . I have spoken of the opinions , the feelings , and the habits of Harry Vane . Answerable to these is his universal conduct . He is in every circumstance of his life a poor fickle young man . In labour , in amusement , in friendship , he is still the same . He forgets that what he is becoming now , he will be for life . He is quick , amiable , and generous , but he is unstable , and this gives a sickly hue to his whole constitution . He begins a thousand things ; he /z/ begins them with zeal , with enthusiasm , with expectation , perhaps with rapture but he ends none of them . Vane 's life , so far as I can see , is likely to be a series of abandoned enterprises . He may talk big , and play the man ; but , like the bells on a fool 's cap , his actions betray him at every motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment lay aside the book , and ask himself how nearly he resembles Harry Vane . There is great room for self-deception here . The evil in question is often allied with some of the gentler traits of character . Arising from a certain softness , it easily couples itself with pity , mildness , benevolence , and even generosity . But do not err ; unless you can end your day as you begin it ; unless you can begin the same thing a hundred times over ; unless you can bid defiance to weariness and sloth ; unless you can be for a thousand days what you are the first of them ; unless you can bear and forbear , and resist beseechings , and example , and raillery , and neglect , you may , indeed , be an agreeable lady 's companion ; you may be esteemed in the little circle of your friends ; you may be popular among those who bend your flexible will to their own purposes ; but you must forever forsake the expectation of being manly , influential , or truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two on this . Fickleness is usually accompanied by other bad traits . Certain vices grow in clusters . If yoa /z/ are fickle , I shall expect to find you a superficial reasoner . The unsteady man is frequently though not always timid . A measure of irresolution is certainly implied . Resolved purpose can not be expected in him who is perpetually changing . In the same bed of noxious weeds , springs up indolence in all its forms . As there is a want of self-reliance , there will be a disposition to lean upon others . As there is lack of principle , there will be many violations of duty . All great works are accomplished by constancy . Perseverance in labour wears away rocks , channels our plains , tunnels our mountains ; and this perseverance is produced and insured by uniformity of judgment and of passion . The unstable have no unity of plan . A thousand threads are spun for a little distance , only to be snapped and exchanged for others . Great men of every age whether scholars , statesmen , soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of con stancy , of single purpose . Such men were New ton , Washington , Watt , and Fulton . Where fickleness predominates , there will always be a general debility of character . Say that a youtli is changeable , and by that word you fix on him a stigma of weakness and meanness . It matters little what is his trade or employment . There are no employments which do not demand uniformity and constancy of effort . Moreover , it is a blemish which can not be concealed : the world will know it ; and this is a matter on which /z/ the world judges aright . Whatever may be the reigning enterprise , the fickle man is thought unfit for it . Are important plans on foot ? he is sure to be left out . No one will embark on a vessel without rudder , without anchor , without ballast , without pilot , which can do nothing but go before the wind . But such is the fickle man . He is unsafe in every emergency , because he may change his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prone to be the slave of other men 's opinions . And , by the rebound of public opinion , the unstable man sometimes gains a view of his own weaknesses , and is filled with self-contempt . For , as I have hinted above , he is not necessarily a fool ; nay , he may be clever and ingenious ; he may have candour and generosity , and every thing except the manly virtues . But , wanting these , and sensible of the great defect , and shocked by the contrast of nobler minds , he shrinks from the view , and often retires from attempting any thing worthy of notice . There is nothing in which the unstable man meets with more losses than in the affairs of morals and religion . There are many who have begun very well , have entered the Christian course with great alacrity , but have fallen out during the race . If it were as easy to complete as to begin , most of us would do well . Some will , perhaps , read these lines , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds , and who are likely to be the victims of instability . /z/ As was said before , if this great error is ever amended , it must be in youth ; and to be amended it must be detected . Some will tell us it is all in natural temperament , or in the organs of the brain ; and it can not be denied that there are great differences in the constitutions of men : all are not moulded of the same clay . Yet here , as in a thousand similar instances , the pains of education , and especially of self-control , are not in vain . Even a bad constitution may be kept alive and strengthened , which , if let alone , would soon go to ruin . It is the ruinous mistake of many to suppose that mere talent can insure success without constancy and perseverance . One of the most ingenious men I have ever known , is at the same time the most useless member of society . With abilities which might have made his fortune long ago , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early age he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker , with whom he served about half his time , and learned the simpler operations . During this time , however , he invented a machine for making sausages , for which he received a handsome sum from a neighbouring butcher . It is hard to say what trade he is of , for he plies almost every sort of handicraft . I lately consulted him about a crazy bathing-tub , but found that he had ceased to be a cooper , and was manufacturing shoemakers ' lasts . He has made reeds for weavers , bird-cages , and wire-safes ; he has taken out several patents /z/ for churns , and has even tinkered a little about clocks and watches . But , then , his patents do him no good , for he has not resolution to fulfil his orders , and his occupations are so various that no one knows where to find him . Yet I never met with any who did not grant that this same fellow was one of the greatest mechanical geniuses in our neighbourhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never make a man respectable , useful , or happy . /z/ " Let humble Allen , with an awkward shame , Do good by stealth , and blush to find it fame . " /z/ IT is an unwilling tribute to moral principle , that even the most hardened of our race dislike to be called selfish . It needs little instruction and little philosophy to show a man that he does not live entirely for his own interest ; and the slightest experience is sufficient to prove that he who tries to do so offends against his own happiness . The person who cares for nobody but himself , is in every sense a wretch , and so glaring is this wretchedness in the case of the moneyslave , that we have borrowed a word of this import from Latin , and call him a miser . From their earliest years , our children should be taught this simple but invaluable lesson , that benevolence is bliss . Do good and be happy . We are most like God , the happiest of all beings , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring up my child to feel that his cake , or his penny , or his orange was to be shared ; that for this purpose it is given ; and that he fails /z/ of his pleasure if this end is not attained . I would make it one of his chief rewards to carry aid to the poor , and would give him an early chance of being my almoner . And when fit opportunities occurred , I would take him with me to see for himself the happiness effected by his own little gifts . For it is apt to slip from our thoughts that in moral as well as in intellectual principles and habits , the mind is made by education . Conscience and the affections are almost latent in the savage , or the London thief , or the young slavetrader ; and a child bred in the forest would be only above the ourang-outang , in morals as in reason . A difference not so great , yet by no means unimportant , is to be observed in the children of different families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us aim to bring up our little ones to deeds of mercy . Do we , however , who are parents , teach them by example ? Have we any plans for doing good ? Are we not quite content to let days roll by , in which we have not conferred a real benefit on any fellow-creature ? Is the impression deep in our own minds , that there is a luxury in doing good , and that it is its own reward ? Benevolence should be cherished by contemplating the characters of such as have acquired the blessed reputation of philanthropists : though there are thousands who never have the name , because they have modestly shunned the publicity . /z/ Travellers in Herefordshire are still shown the arm-chair of John Kyrle , the original of Pope 's " Man of Ross .

O say , what sums that generous hand supply ? What mines , to swell that boundless charity ? Of debt and taxes , wife and children clear , That man possess 'd five hundred pounds a year . ' /z/ In his own particular sphere , and with due allowance made for circumstances , every man who has a little substance and a little leisure , may be a Man of Ross . " The most worthless , " it has been said , " have at times , moments in which they wish to rise out of the slough of their passions , and be beneficially employed ; and many of the best lose opportunities of effecting much , by neglecting the common materials within their reach and aspiring to what is beyond them . " I have known weakly benevolent persons to sigh for occasions of usefulness , when widows and orphans were suffering the extremities of want within a few hundred yards of their dwellings . I have often . stood in amazement at the number of beneficent acts which my friend Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his daily labours . He succeeds in this by husbanding his moments , watching for opportunities , and seizing upon them the instant they appear . But it is genuine benevolence which gives him this alacrity . Among a thousand objects presented to his attention , Joseph 's eye singles out at a glance that to which he can be useful ; if the comparison is not out of place , just as the bird of prey pounces upon its quarry . When , not long since , I spent one or two days together with him in settling the affairs of a deceased friend 's estate , I was often called to wonder at the multiplicity of his acts of kindness . On one day in particular , he was perpetually fly- /z/ ing from business to charity , and yet not apparently to the disadvantage of either . When breakfast was over , he had two plates and as many bowls of coffee despatched to the sick father of one of his apprentices . Shortly after , he stole ten minutes to run across the way , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to drop three tracts into as many country market-carts . A woman called him out to ask advice about a drunken son , who had been arrested in a riot . Then he had notices to sign as chairman of a committee respecting the improvement of schools . These did not altogether take up more of his time than the filling and smoking of three or four pipes would of my old friend Stith 's . While I was at my dinner , Joseph had walked half a mile to see about the indentures of widow Jones 's boy , and had his meal into the bargain . In the afternoon he made his wife accomplish almost as much more , and I sat down with him at tea in company with three or four religious friends from a distance , who were sharing his hospitality , and who were to be present at the meeting after dark . I wish what I am saying might induce the reader of these pages to lay down the book for a moment , and to ask himself these questions : Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gains do I allot to acts of charity ? Am I active in giving personally to the relief of those whom I hear to be in distress ? Do I take any /z/ pains to seek out such cases ? What poor , or otherwise suffering persons , are there in my immediate neighbourhood , to whom I have never extended any relief ? A little self-catechising of this sort would not be thrown away , now and then , upon the best of us . The saying of the wise man is remarkable : " There is that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet , but it tendeth to poverty . " Tithe , and be rich , is the Jewish proverb . " I am verily persuaded , " says Gouge , a writer of the seventeenth century , " that there is scarcely any man who gives to the poor proportionably to what God has bestowed on him ; but , if he observe the dealings of God 's providence toward him , will find the same doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge all the world to produce one instance ( or at least any considerable number of instances ) of a merciful man , whose charity has undone him . On the contrary , as the more the living wells are exhausted , the more freely they spring and flow , so the substance of charitable men frequently multiplies in the very distribution : even as the five loaves and few fishes multiplied , while being broken and distributed , and as the widow 's oil increased by being poured nut " /z/ " O , day most calm , most bright ! The fruit of this , the next world 's bud ; Th ' endorsement of supreme delight , Writ by a friend , and with his blood ; The couch of time ; care 's balm and bay : The week were dark , but for thy light ; Thy torch doth show the way . " /z/ THERE is no engine which can work forever . There must be intermissions to oil the joints and wheels , and supply the losses by wear and tear . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all machines , can do its work without some remission . It is so constituted as to require the supplies of food and sleep , at least once every twenty-four hours . But something more than this is needed . After several days of toil , both the body and the mind ask for respite . It is too much to have all our powers and all our thoughts day after day and month after month bent intensely upon the same object . Either body or mind , or both together , must infallibly break down under such a strain . /z/ Our beneficent Creator has kindly provided for this necessity of nature , by the institution of the Sabbath , which is older than Christianity , and older than the Mosaic law ; having been ordained immediately after the creation . It is set apart as a day of rest , which the name imports ; a day of devotion , of instruction , and of mercy . If it is a mercy to the world at large , it is a seven-fold mercy to the working-man , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The beast of burden sinks under perpetual loads , and the law of the human constitution is just as binding , which enjoins periodical and sufficient rest . Men may try to brave the authority of heaven ; but they do it to their own great loss , even in a worldly point of view . Take one week with another , and the man who works seven days accomplishes no more than he who works six . Careful observers tell us , that they never knew any one to grow rich by Sunday labour . It is strange that any arguments should be needed in behalf of the Sabbath . Every thing that accompanies it is delightful . The hum , and whirl , and crash of business come to an end . Serene repose broods over the face of nature . Families separated during the week , now come together ; and parents greet their sons and daughters . The very cleanliness which the Sabbath brings with it has a charm . Even the poorest who observe the day , are now in their best ap-/z/ parel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be neat and tidy has a decided moral influence . As the tradesman or the mechanic , who has been confined for some days , walks abroad , leading his little ones to the Sunday-school or the church , he feels a complacency which nothing else could produce . If his turn is serious , he will be led to contemplate the Creator in his works ; and , especially in the fairer seasons of the year , to rejoice with rejoicing nature . But it is at church that we discern the greatest advantages of the Sabbath . There is a little community met in their best suit , in their best humour , for the most important business of the week . If it is in the country , the scene is often enchanting . The old church stands on some eminence , surrounded by ancient trees , beneath which are scattered the grassy mounds that mark the restingplace of the dead . Friends are now exchanging kind looks and salutations , who meet at no other time during the week . There is scarcely a dull eye or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wide enclosure . So that , long before public worship begins , there is a benign , moral influence at work . How much more pure and genial is the social spirit thus awakened than that which is engendered at wakes , auctions , and town-meetings : and how little real community of feeling would there be in a neighbourhood where there was no such weekly gathering ! /z/ But enter the house of God , and catch the impression of the sacred scene . The vision of the poet is realized : " Fast the church-yard fills ; anon Look again , and they are gone ; The cluster round the porch , and the folk Who sat in the shade of the prior 's oak ! And scarcely have they disappear 'd Ere the prelusive hymn is heard : With one consent the people rejoice , Filling the church with a lofty voice , A moment ends the fervent din , And all is hush 'd without and within . " * Who can calculate the softening , elevating , hallowing influences of such a service once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this custom spreading its blessed fruits of peace and good order . Consider next the instructions of this sacred season . " Here , " says a popular writer , " on a day devoted to no employment but the gaining of this knowledge , and the performance of those religious duties which unite with it in perfect harmony ; in a place convenient and sacred ; on an occasion infinitely important ; and with the strong power of sympathy to aid and impress ; a thousand persons are taught the best of all knowledge ; the most useful to themselves and the most beneficial to mankind ; for a less sum than must be expended by a twentieth part Wordsworth . /z/ of their number in order to obtain the same instruction in any other science . No device of the heathen philosophers , or of modern infidels , greatly as they have boasted of their wisdom , can be compared , as to its usefulness , with this . The Sabbath , particularly , is the only means ever devised of communicating important instruction to the great mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of , great value to every man , and above all price to such as have not received a thorough education . I like to see the head of a family bringing all his household to public worship : children can not begin too soon to enjoy so great a blessing . The afternoon and evening of Sunday afford a favourable opportunity for the religious instruction of children and dependants . In the stricter sort of old families this was as regular a thing as the return of the day . There are good occasions also for the reading of the Scriptures and of other good books . Happy is that domestic circle where this has been the habit of every member from his childhood . What time can be more favourable than this for acts of mercy ! From the smallest gains something may be laid by , on the first day of the week , for the poor , or for benevolent institutions . It is really surprising to observe how much more men will give in the course of a year in this way , than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all into the spirit of what I have written , will not need to be warned against /z/ Sunday dinners , visits to public gardens , rides or drives into the country , or any of the varieties of profane dissipation . Sir Matthew Hale is reported to have said , that during a long life he had observed the success of his weeks to turn out well or ill , according as he had observed or neglected the Lord's-day. /z/ " O bless 'd retirement , friend to life 's decline , Retreats from care , that never must be mine , How happy he who crowns , in shades like these , A yputh of labour with an age of ease . " /z/ AN elderly man once expressed to me his sense of declining life , by saying , " My birth-days begin to come very fast . " The years seem to run round faster as they approach their close ; so that it is a common saying among the aged , that time flies much more rapidly than when they were young . Every gray hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay of eyesight , ought to serve as a gentle hint , that we are going down the hill ; and yet I believe there is no one whom old age does not take by surprise . There is a fine moral in the little poem of the Three Warnings ; those of us who begin to be shy of telling our age would do well to read it . At this period of life , particularly where a man has had some prosperity , it is natural to think of retiring from business . What can be more reasonable than to desist from labour when the ne- /z/ cessity for it is at an end , or to close the journey when the end has been attained ? This would be unanswerable , if the only end of labour and occupation was to make money : and though avarice would cling to the last possibility of turning a penny , every man of liberal feeling would be ready to cease when he has got enough , and to leave the field open for younger competitors . But there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this inquiry : I invite to it the serious attention of all elderly mechanics . After fifteen or twenty years of labour , occupation becomes necessary to one 's comfort . This arises from a law of our constitution . Few men can break off a habit of long standing with impunity , unless it be a habit which is injurious in itself . There is an illusion in most cases of sudden retirement from business of any kind . The veteran , when he lays down his arms , dreams of perfect peace : he finds ennui and satiety . When from ill-health or great infirmity there is no fitness for employment , nothing can be said ; but I would warn all working-men against retiring unadvisedly . Charles Lamb 's admirable sketch of the " Superannuated Man , " is a case in point . At first there will be a feeling of release and exemption , as if a great burden had been thrown off ; but afterwards , unless where there are great mental resources , the mind will turn upon itself . Instances will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become miserable from this very cause . A highly respectable man of my acquaintance , who united the pursuits of agriculture and trade , found himself rich enough at threescore to give up both employments . He retired to a snug little retreat to spend the remainder of his days in repose . But he soon began to . miss the excitement of regular business . His hours were now empty alike of work and pleasure , and as dull as a boy 's solitary holiday . He longed for the counter and the plough . At length he fell into a most deplorable melancholy , which lasted for some years . If there is the slightest tendency to drink , it is apt to manifest itself at this critical season . Where the consequences are not so serious , how often do we see the retired mechanic gloomily revisiting his old haunts , pacing about the street with a disconsolate air , and envying every whistling apprentice that he meets . The following instance is given by Dr. Johnson : " An eminent tallow-chandler in London , who had acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his foreman , and went to live at a country-house near town . He soon grew weary , and paid frequent visits to his old shop , where he desired they might let him know their melting-days , and he would come and assist them ; which he accordingly did . Here was a man to whom the most disgusting circumstances in the business to which he had been used was a relief from idleness . " This change should be made , if possible , by /z/ slow degrees , and the reins of business should not be altogether abandoned until several experiments shall have been made . Even aged and infirm men may find great pleasure in some of the lighter employments of their trade , or in a general superintendence . It is in such cases as this that a little learning , and a taste for books , come admirably into play . To have nothing to do is the worst part of solitary confinement in jails : give the convict books , and he would soon become interested and comfortable . Give the old working-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his declining years . But there is another greater and more certain preventive of stupor and listlessness . Where there is a truly religious temper , old age is delightful . It is natural and seemly that old age should " Walk thoughtful on the silent , solemn shore Of that vast ocean it must sail so soon . " The consolations of the gospel will cast broad sunshine over the whole prospect . The glow of Christian love will soften every asperity , and mellow those dispositions which old age is apt to sour . And if the hoary man can take his staff , and , with benignant affection , walk about among children , grand-children , old friends , and neigh- /z/ hours , rousing them by his advice , instructing them by his example , and aiding them by his charities , he may do more good , and consequently enjoy more happiness in the close of his life than in all the vigour of his youth and manhood . /z/ " My morning walks I now could bear to lose , And bless 'd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt a languor stealing on ; The active arm , the agile hand were gone ; Small daily actions into habits grew , And new dislikes to forms and fashions new : I loved my trees in order to dispose , I number 'd peaches , look 'd how stocks arose , Told the same story oft in short , began to prose . " /z/ IN a long sitting by our fireside , the other evening , I had the whole subject of old age discussed between UNCLE BENJAMIN and Mr. APPLETREE ; and some of the results I am disposed to set down , without trying , however , to keep up the form of dialogue , or to trace every remark to the respective speakers . Nevertheless , the reader may rest assured , that whatever is matter of daily observation , is from uncle Benjamin , and whatever smacks of ancient times , from the schoolmaster . Old age takes men by surprise : this has been long observed . " No one , " says Pliny , " ever says , ' the storks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' but always , ' they have come , ' or , ' they have /z/ gone ; ' for they both come and go secretly , and by night . " So it is with old age : we do not perceive its approach . At length , however , the head becomes cold from its baldness ; the last stump forsakes the gums ; it is a labour to bend the joints , to mount a horse , or to go up stairs ; there is a drumming in the ears , and the eyes almost refuse the aid of useless glasses . And then comes the sense of decline ; it is well called the winter of the year . " When men wish for old age , " says St. Augustin , " what do they desire but a long disease ? " A life of moderate labour , if the habits are good in other respects , is one of the best securities for a mild old age . But , in point of fact , workingmen very seldom think it necessary to observe caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the penalty at the close of life , in stiff joints , a crooked back , and many pains and infirmities which need not be mentioned . Disease and sorrow sometimes sour the temper , and the old man becomes complaining , peevish , and moody . The grasshopper becomes a burden , and fears increase ; he carries caution to the extreme of timidity , and has a distressing irresolution about the smallest concerns . These evils are of course greatly aggravated if he is poor , widowed , and childless . In such a case , unless the blessings of religion come in to cheer the prospect , one might almost see the saying of Diogenes made true , that a poor old man is the most wretched /z/ of mortals . And though I would not say a word to inculcate a miserly temper , it is certainly right to remind our young men , that a youth of prodigality will have an old age of want . After a life even of laborious pursuits , we sometimes see old people in this melancholy condition . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest comforts , due respect and ease ; For yonder see that hoary swain , whose age Can with no cares except its own engage ; Who , propp 'd on that rude staff , looks up to see The bare arms broken from the withering tree , On which , a boy , he climb 'd the loftiest bough , Then his first joy , but his sad emblem now . " This is far from being true of every old man . Indeed , where there have been habits of frugality , foresight , temperance , and religion , old age is often like a summer 's evening after a day of toil . Especially may it be so to one who has not desisted prematurely from active labours , and who looks back upon a long life filled with industrious perseverance and useful deeds . In one of the most pleasing chapters of Paley 's Natural Theology , that benevolent philosopher cites the case of comfortable old age as remarkably illustrating the goodness of the Deity . " It is not for youth alone , that the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purring cat , no less than with the playful kitten ; in the armchair of dozing age , as well as in either the /z/ sprightliness of the dance , or the animation of the chase . To novelty , to acuteness of sensation , to hope , to ardour of pursuit , succeeds what is , in no inconsiderable degree , an equivalent for them all , ' perception of ease . ' Herein is the exact difference between the young and the old . The young are not happy , but when enjoying pleasure ; the old are happy when free from pain . And this constitution suits with the degree of animal power which they respectively possess . The vigour of youth was to be stimulated to action by impatience of rest ; whilst , to the imbecility of age , quietness and repose become positive gratifications . In one important respect the advantage is with the old . A state of ease is , generally speaking , more attainable than a state of pleasure . I am far , even as an observer of human life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less the only happy one : as a Christian , I am willing to believe that there is a great deal of truth in the following representation , given by a very pious writer , as well as excellent man : * ' To the intelligent and virtuous , old age presents a scene of tranquil enjoyments , of obedient appetites , of well-regulated affections , of maturity in knowledge , and of calm preparation for immortality . ' ' Among the humbler circles of society , in dwellings seldom entered by the rich or gay , I have seen beautiful examples of this . What sight is Father 's Instructions , by Dr. Percival . /z/ more lovely , than that of a gray-haired father , seated by the glowing hearth , surrounded by children and grand-children , who hang upon his instructions , and fly to anticipate his every want ! " Children 's children , " says Solomon , " are the crown of old men . " Where the fifth commandment has been inculcated and obeyed , old age derives many indescribable comforts from the affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known that filial reverence is carried to a degree little short of religious worship . To speak carelessly to parents , is with them a heinous crime ; to raise the hand against them , a capital one . Providence sometimes repays men in their own coin . Those who have been undutiful sons , are often made to smart as neglected parents . There are few spectacles more disgraceful than that of aged parents surrounded by idle sons , living upon their little remaining substance , and clinging to them , not to support them , but , like parasitical plants , to suck the last juices from their wasted trunks . It should be the pride and glory of youth , so far as practicable , to remove every annoyance from the old age of those who watched over their helpless childhood . Let parents see to it , that they are bringing up their children in such habits as are likely to make them a stay and prop to their declining years . Next to the affection of his own children , the old man will rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the /z/ sight of any old man , even if he is a sober beggar , which awakes ray respect . In some parts of the country it is , or was , the custom to give a respectful salutation to every aged person , whether rich or poor , known or unknown . It is a good custom , and speaks well for the social state of the land . I have been told of a gentleman who never allowed himself to speak to an aged person without being uncovered . Such was the Mosaic law : " Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honour the face of the old man , and fear thy God : I am the Lord . " * The principles of the ancient Lacedemonians were very strict in this particular , and such as may put some Christians to the blush . Their youth were daily taught to reverence old age , and to give the proofs of it on every suitable occasion , by making way for them , yielding the best places , saluting them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were commanded to receive the instructions and reproofs of the aged with the utmost submission . In consequence of this , a Spartan was known wherever he went , and was considered as disgracing his country if he behaved otherwise . Cicero tells us of Lysander , that he used to say that Sparta was the place for a man to grow old in . The story is well known , as related by Plutarch , of the old man of Athens , at the theatre . Coming in late , he found all the seats occupied His Lev , xix. 32. /z/ young countrymen , by whom he passed , kept their seats , but when he came near the place where the Spartan ambassadors and their suite were sitting , they all instantly rose , and seated him in the midst of them ; upon which the house resounded with the applause of the Athenians . The old man quietly said , " The Athenians know what is right , but the Spartans practise it . " If there is any form of self-complacency which is pardonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes his circuit among the places of business , where he was once among the busiest , and receives with a satisfied smile the regard of all around him . He seats himself in the shops , cracks his old jokes , repeats his old stories , lectures the boys , and sometimes breaks forth into a half-comic scolding of every thing pertaining to modern times . I look upon it as one of the great advantages of age , that it can freely give advice . This is what the rest of us can not do so well . But who will be offended with the counsels , or even the rebukes of a venerable father , leaning on his staff , and shaking with that infirmity which is but the beginning of death ? The words and the example of old men are so effective , that I have sometimes thought the responsibility of this season of life was not sufficiently felt . A man may do more good in this way after he is sixty , than in all his foregoing life . But it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or morosely , but with that /z/ gentleness which may show that it arises from true benevolence . It was observed by the ancients , that the besetting sin of old age is avarice . Strange , that the less one needs , the more he should desire ! Yet thus it is : and thus it will ever be , unless some better principles be infused in earlier life ; the ruling passion will be strong even in death . In the following celebrated verses of Pope , it is now well known that the poet merely repeated the very words used on his death-bed by Sir William Bateman : " ' I give , and I devise ' ( old Euclio said , And sigh 'd ) ' my lands and tenements to Ned . ' Your money , sir ? ' My money , sir what , all 1 Why , if I must ( then wept ) I give it Paul . ' The manor , sir 7 The manor ! hold , ' he cried , ' Not that , I can not part with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old age will be liable to the madness of avarice , unless religious principle prevent ; and even if religion has been neglected in former years , it should demand attention now , " When a ship is leaking , " says Seneca , " we may stop a single leak , or even two or three ; but when all the timbers are going to pieces , our efforts are of no avail . " So in the human body , when old age shows that the fabric is breaking down , the soul ought to be looking out for a better habitation . Alas ! few grow wise late in life . The most pleasing instances of old age are those /z/ of persons who have attended to the best things in youth . Such there are , and they are among the greatest ornaments of religion . " The hoary head is a crown of glory , if it be found in the way of righteousness . " The Christian old man shows fruit even in winter . Instead of being querulous , he is contented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been ripened into a delightful mellowness of temper , by the graces of religion . May such be the old age of the reader ! /z/ " ' T is the only discipline we are born for ; All studies else are but as circular lines , And death the centre where they must all meet . " /z/ IN the foregoing essays I have touched upon a great variety of subjects , and have passed " from grave to gay , " from entertainment to instruction . There are many matters quite as important which must be left unattempted . But I can not bring myself to close the volume without a word of counsel upon what is still more momentous than any to which I have alluded . Whatever our calling in life may be , it must come to an end ; and however our paths may differ , they will all meet in the same termination . At death we shall be stripped of all our petty distinctions , and despoiled of all our worldly gains . He must be a very stupid or a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probabilities of his condition after death . A prosperous life here does not secure a prosperous life hereafter . The very heathen may rebuke us for our carelessness . Even the deist , if he believes /z/ in the immortality of the soul , must have some solicitude about the nature of that immortality . Some persuade themselves that all men will certainly be happy after death . This is a convenient doctrine for all who wish to enjoy vicious pleasures ; but there is too much at stake for any man to adopt it without great consideration , and such arguments as defy all contradiction . It is against our rational feelings of justice , the common judgment of all ages , and the plain meaning of the Bible . If there is , then , a risk of losing one 's soul , can a reasonable man leave the matter unsettled ? It has often filled me with astonishment to see men of the greatest foresight and discretion in worldly affairs , so ruinously careless in these . They would not consent to pay a small sum of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house without insurance ; or to lend money without security ; knowing that even where neighbours are honest , life is uncertain . But they will hazard their everlasting interests upon the merest chance . No one can predict what a day may bring forth . Death takes most of its victims by surprise . Yet the multitude live from year to year without any attempt at preparation . The undue value set upon wealth and temporal prosperity , is one great cause of this recklessness . All through life men are in chase of that which perishes as they grasp it . Give them all that their most eager wishes could demand , and you /z/ do not secure them for eternity . But there is a good part which can not be taken away from them . No considerate man can reflect on his life , or examine his heart without acknowledging that he is a sinner against God . The whole tenor of the Scriptures speaks the same truth . How am I to escape the punishment due to my sin ? This is the great question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is not a wise man , who lies down at night without some satisfactory hope that sudden death would not ruin his happiness . The great truths of the Christian religion lie within a small compass . There is an agreement among all the conflicting sects of evangelical Christians as to a few cardinal points . They are such as these : that by nature men are children of wrath ; that God will punish the impenitent ; that we must be born again ; that without faith it is impossible to please God ; that he who believeth shall be saved , and he who believes not will be condemned . Further , the faith which saves us , regards chiefly the Lord Jesus Christ ; that he is the Son of God ; that he became man for our salvation ; that he bore our sins in his own body on the tree ; that he rose again from the dead , and ascended into heaven ; and that we are justified by faith in him . He who believes thus , and manifests this belief by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to think that infidelity is on /z/ the wane in our country . About the time of the French revolution , the impious falsehoods of Voltaire were making havoc among our youth . This arch-infidel once predicted that in twenty years ihe Christian religion would be no more ! Those who were deceived by him found nothing but disappointment and wretchedness . Learned , witty , and applauded as he was , he had less real wisdom than the poorest and most ignorant Christian widow . " She , for her humble sphere by nature fit , Has little understanding , and no wit ; Receives no praise ; but though her lot be such , Toilsome and indigent , she renders much ; Just knows , and knows no more , her Bible true , A truth the brilliant Frenchman never knew ; And in that charter reads with sparkling eyes Her title to a treasure in the skies . O happy peasant ! O unhappy bard ! His the mere tinsel , hers the rich reward ; He praised , perhaps , for ages yet to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , lost in errors , his vain heart prefers , She , safe in the simplicity of hers .

" Demagogues know this ; and the same agitators who would spurn the " unwashed artificer , " if met in some old despotic realm , find it to be their true policy to flatter and cajole him here . This is no part of my business . I respect honest labour , though it be in the black man who saws my wood ; and , so far as I can learn , my ancestors have been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the contrary . " Though the motto of William of Wickham is no longer good English , it is good sense still MANNERS MAKETH MAN . Wherever the demeanour and life of a man are good , let me get as near to him as he will allow , that I may /z/ take his hand , though it be as black and hardened as his anvil . I am ready to maintain that the American mechanic has no reason to envy any man on earth . " Happy , happy men ! " as an old poet says , " if they could appreciate their own felicity ! " Has the mechanic no pleasures ? Let us see : and in order to see better , let me use some illustrations . There is a shop near my lodgings ; and I never yet saw the shop in which there was not something to be learned . In this one there is evidence enough that working men may have cheap and abundant pleasures . Without going so far as to state , what I believe firmly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eave to introduce ARTHUR KIP . This young man is a plain cooper , and lives on the extremity of a street which I pass daily . He is in his shop as early as his earliest neighbour , yet I sometimes see him busy a good half hour before he is in his shop . What is Arthur about in the grey of the morning ? I will tell you . He has been Betting out rows of elms around the whole border of his little lot . For you must know that he is content to live in a very uncomfortable house , in order to forward his business and prepare his grounds , so as to " make a fair start , " as he calls it . He has told me that he was induced to do /z/ this by a maxim of an ancient king : " Prepare thy work without , and make it fit for thyself in the field , and afterwards build thy house . " It does one good to see Arthur among his trees ; he sings cheerily over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These saplings , " says he , " will be noble branching trees over the heads of my children ; and if little Tom should be a rich man thirty years hence , he will have a grove which all the money of the aristocrats in England could not cause to spring up . " Tn this he agreed well with the laird of Dumbiedikes , who is known to have said on his death-bed to his son and heir : " Jock , when ye hae naething else to do , ye may be aye sticking in a tree ; it will be growing , Jock , when ye 're sleeping " Arthur has a garden also . His rule is , " first for use ; next for show . " So he has most of his ground in substantial vegetables for the table ; but a very goodly portion , I assure you , in choice flowers . Why should he not ? God has given the poor man these gems of the earth with a bounteous profusion ; and Ellen Kip and little Tom will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the lustre and fragrance of tulips and violets . In these bright spring evenings , I take a walk about the time that this little household comes /z/ together after work . No tavern has yet become Ellen 's rival ; her husband spends not only his nights , but his evenings , at home . Or , if he goes abroad , it is in the old-fashioned way : I mean he takes his wife and his boy along . At this hour I am always sure of witnessing another of the mechanic 's pleasures . Arthur and Ellen are natives of a state where young folks are taught to sing : they have already begun to bring up little Tom in the same way . They carry a tune in several parts ; for Arthur is no mean performer on the violin , and Ellen sings a soprano part to her husband 's base . The neighbours are beginning to find their way out , since the spring weather has unclosed doors and windows , and there are some signs of a little musical association . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is sad that they are so slow to discover the exquisite satisfaction which they might derive from this innocent recreation . It soothes the troubled mind ; it breaks the thread of vexing thoughts ; it prepares the affections for every good impression ; it affords a healthful excitement ; it knits families together by gentlest bands ; and it makes a paradise of home . What mechanic is there who may not command these pleasures ? What pleasures of the THE MECHANIC 'S PLEASURES . li bar-room , the circus , the gaming-table , the theatre , are equal to these in purity and genuine content ? I am sure I shall have the right answer if not from mechanics , at least from their wives . But for fear of being prolix , I reserve some other pleasures for a future paper . /z/ AFTER a day 's work of calculation and copying , I was under the mortifying necessity of waiting an hour in the tap-room of a low tavern , to secure the services of a mail-guard , who was to carry a parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the clatter of a crowd of inn-haunters , I could not but find some subjects for reflection . The presiding genius of the bar was a bloated , carbuncled , whiskered young man , whom I had long known as the abandoned son of a deceased friend . I sighed and was silent . Ever and anon as one after another , or squads of two , three or more , approached his shrine , to receive and empty their glasses , and deposit their sixpences , I heard the short , peremptory formula of the Bacchanal minister " Wliat will yon have ? brandy ? gin ? punch ? What will you have ? " And the victims severally made their bids , for a smaller , a cocktail , a sling , or a julep , as the case might be . The constant repetition of " the form /z/ in that case made and provided , " set me upon a drowsy meditation on the pregnant question What will you have ? " Methinks I can answer the question , " said I to myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And first to the young shoemaker , Avho , with a pair of newly finished boots , is asking for " grog . " What will you have ? Young man , you will soon have an empty pocked There is a trembling , ragged man , with livid spots under the eyes . He is a machine-maker , and has lodgings in the house . What will you have ? Ah ! the bar-keeper knows without an answer : he takes gin and water . Poor man ! I also know what you will have . Already you have been twice at death 's door ; and the gin will not drive off that chill . You will have typhus fever . There comes my neighbour the bookbinder . tfis hand shakes as he raises his full glass . Ah , Shannon ! I dread to say it but you will have the palsy . The glasses are washed out , not cleansed , in the slop-tub under the bar-shelf . Now a fresh bevy comes up , cigar in hand . Gentlemen , what will you have ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baker there will have an apoplexy or a sudden fall in his shop . That tailor /z/ in green glasses will have , or rather has already , a consumption . And I fear the three idlers in their train will have the next epidemic that shall sweep off our refuse drunkards . But what will that man have who leans over the table , seeming to pore over the last " Herald " ? He is scarcely resolved what he shall drink , or whether he shall drink at all . I understand the language of his motions ; he is a renegade from the Temperance ranks . He has borrowed money this week . John , you will have lodgings in a jail . Sorry indeed am I to see in this den Mr. Scantling , the cooper . Not to speak of himself , I have reason to believe that both his grown sons are beginning to drink . He looks about him suspiciously . Now he has plucked up courage . He takes whisky . You will have a pair of drunken sons . That young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a musician , a man of reading , and the husband of a lovely English woman . He takes his glass with the air of a Greek drinking hemlock . You will have a heart-broken wife . What ! is that lad of fifteen going to the bar ! He is : and he tosses off his Cognac with an air . You will have an early death . The old mun that totters out of the door has /z/ doubtless come hither to drown his grief . His last son has died in prison , from the effects of a brawl in the theatre . The father has looked unutterable anguish every sober moment for two years . Wretched old man ! You will have the halter of a suicide . I must take the rest in mass , for it is Saturday night , and the throng increases . The bar-keeper has an assistant , in the person of a pale , sorrowful girl . Two voices now reiterate the challenge : What will you have ? What will you have ? Misguided friends , I am greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My man has arrived . I must go ; glad to escape to purer air : and still the parrot-note resounds in my ears , What will you have ? You will have to sum up all you will have a terrible judgment and an eternity of such retribution as befits your life . As I walked home across the common , I thought thus : " And what will he have , who , day after day , and month after month , and year after year , doles out the devil 's bounty to his recruits ; and receives his sixpences , as it were , over the coffin of his victims ? You , to say the least , hardened tempter , ( if memory live hereafter ) will have the recollection of your triumphs , and the vision of their eternal results . " /z/ REVERSES of fortune befall all men , and a sudden one befell JOSEPH LEWIS . He had entered on a lucrative handicraft business with more capital than often comes to the hand of a cabinetmaker , such as he was ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let anybody get above him as long as he is able to rise , he shone out in a style of equipage , dress , and living , which was almost aristocratical . His chaise and horse , his marble mantel , his greyhound , his Joe Manton , his pointer , his dinner-service all savoured of Bond street or St. Mark 's place Was he happy ? He ought to have been so . A quiet , beautiful wife ; a child such as Titania might have stolen ; a full warehouse and a full pocket ; are just the things to make a young man happy . So flushed was Joseph with success and hope , that he could not find vent for his exuberant satisfaction alone , or on cold water ; he invited frequent groups to late dinners ; he opened bottles /z/ of Hock and Sauterne ; he imported his own Parmesan . I met Joseph in Broadway . He had come to town to make preparations for a ball . Was he happy ? Ah ! you must answer that yourself . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as smart as a barber on Sunday evening , or a wedding journeyman . His hat was a St. John ; his mosaic pin was Baldwin 's richest Tuscany ; his whole manner was that of high fashion , save that it was all too full of a certain consciousness . And then he did so blush when a brother chip passed us ; and his eye sparkled with the glimmer , not of serene joy , but of unac customed wine . That day fortnight Joseph Lewis became insolvent . What a reverse ! But stay was he ruined ? By no means . Let me bring forward another personage , thus far a mute in the scene . His wife threw her arms more passionately around his neck , on that evening , than ever before . Was Joseph now unhappy ? His great house and useless stables were soon cleared . Finding himself a poor man , he began life at a new corner . He began , did I say ? No , she began ; Mary Lewis began , not to assume the husband 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeter sorg after his frugal evening meal , than /z/ had ever echoed over his sumptuous dinner from New York parasites , or stage-struck clerks . Is he unhappy ? Let us see : he has neither carriage nor wines , but he has his hands full of work , and his two yellow-haired girls sit on his knee in the hour which he used to spend at the theatre . He has no cards ; he gives no concerts ; but he rests more sweetly at night ; and he and Mary make good music on the guitar and flute , accom ' panying very passable voices . Last week I met him again . He was carrying home a picture which he had been framing . One blush arid then a hearty shake of my hand , and " O Charles ! come and see us we are rich enough to give you a good cup of tea and my wife and children will be too much rejoiced to meet you . " I went , and found him quiet , healthful , selfpossessed , temperate , domestic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few philosophical instruments ; living within his means : in a great reverse , but never so happy before . The ancient philosophers spent a good part of their time in studying out rules by which men might sustain themselves under the changes of fortune . I have read many of these in my younger days . In none of them do I find any allusion to two things which I now regard as the /z/ most indispensable in every such discussion : I mean domestic life and religion the hearth and the altar . For when both sources of comfort are united in a gently pious wife , the working man who has this treasure , has that which in a reverse is mo/q/
