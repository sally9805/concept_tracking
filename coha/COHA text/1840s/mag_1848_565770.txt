txt BAYONETS and cannon-balls have disclosed a new and distinct era in our history . Fifteen years ago , Mexico afforded no prospect of game to a far-sighted and a strong falcon , except some covetous vision of that sort may have flitted across the mind of some of the chivalry of the South . Within that time poor Mexico 's history has been unravelled from the web of destiny in galloping haste , and she now finds herself a helpless quarry , with the falcon upon her , and barely saving her life by the most humiliating concessions- Her armies , although nerved with desperation , have fled before the Saxons ; her best leaders have furnished no charm to dispel the fatal spell ruining her , and even the strong holds nature gave her for defense , have played her false . At every point defeated , the sacred city of her kings penetrated by the enemy , and her government reduced by desperation from driveling imbecility to a " bedizened nothing , " these constitute briefly the elements of a " conquered peace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predictions were made concerning the intentions of our government , of such an incredible nature , that most minds revolted from them . Some predicted that Mexico woiAd be forced at the point of the bayonet to yield up all claim to Texas , not only to the Nueces river , but to the Rio del Norte , and they regarded this consummation of annexation in a legal title , written though it might be in blood , as the extreme of intention on the part of our government ! But the idea of making , by the same laudable means , the Rio del Norte a boundary between the two coun // tries , then boldly leaving that to swallow up New Mexico , and then rushing westwardly to the Pacific to do the same office for California , never entered many minds , except the privileged behind the curtain ! And yet it has been done . Palo Alto , Resaca de Ia Palma , Buena Vista , Monterey , Vera Cruz , Cerro Gordo , Cherubusco , and Mexico , have all become words to us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of a victorious but bloody march to complete conquest . For our part , we must confess , when we looked back over some modern scenes in American history , as connected with the barbarous extermination or removal of Indians from their own lands , we felt the greatest confidence possible in the elasticity and capacity of the *overn mental conscience . Long before Scott took the field and consummated what Taylor had begun , we had written concerning our greediness for conquest . " These facts are palpable , and they are written in blood . Our government is possessed by a mania for more territory , and does not scruple to seize it at the cost of war . The conquest of New Mexico and California has become common talk . No one questions the toughness of the governmental conscience . That conscience hitherto has proved itself as elastic as the stomach of a boaconstrictor . It can swallow whole territories to which it has no more right than to London or to Paris , without a grimace of pain . How absurd to talk of tenderness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalled by that of England 1 " Without referring to some ridiculous facts , which quarrels among the principal actors have brought to light , it is sufficient to state that a treaty was signed by Nicholas P. Trist on the part of the United States , and three commissioners on the part of Mexico , and this treaty has been sanctioned by the two governments . Our flag was floating over the " Halls of the Montezuinns , " and had been flung to the breeze from the loftiest peaks of the Cord illeras . Mexico was at our feet , and we of course dictated our own terms . By these terms , Texas , as far west as the Rio del Norte , becomes ours ; the entire Province of New Mexico , and the territory north of the river Gila , and a line which divides Upper and Lower California , is also ceded to us , making an area of " seven hundred miles north and south , and nine hundred miles east and west . " Our late conquests , absolved from crime by treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And adjurations of the God in Heaven , amount to the comfortable surface of six hundred and thirty thousand square miles , which will sound more significantly when we say it is an area almost equal to that occupied by Great Britain and Ireland , France , Spain , Portugal , and Prussia . With Texas , it is more than half of the original territory of Mexico . Or , to make it still more familiar and formidable , its area is sufficient for sixteen states as large as Ohio ! With this general indication of the extent of our conquests , it becomes a matter of importance to ascertain , as far as possible , the character of this immense territory . What are its resources and its present condition ? What is the value , now and prospectively , of a territory for which all acknowledge we have paid a great price ? If this country contains sixteen states like Ohio , with her amazing fertility , and resources , which are likely to be developed at some future time , then we may be accredited before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or if there are hordes of ignorant barbarians , lorded over by nabobs of uncounted wealth , from whom the thumb screws of avarice may extort such compensation as // England has wrung from the East Indies , we may be applauded by that morality which savors as little as possible of God , and much as possible of Mammon . An accurate examination of all the reliable authorities will satisfactorily prove , that our good lands are not limited by the present advances of civilization . The United States territory west of civilization and east of the Rocky Mountains , is about eight hundred miles long by five hundred broad , and is intersected by vast rivers , which , with their tributaries , make an aggregate length of twenty thousand miles . Those rivers are bordered with productive lands , nor are all the uplands barren wastes . When we remember that in this very territory are sustained those herds of buffalo , so vast as literally to be computed by the square mile , we must be convinced that it is not a vast sand barren . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of buffaloes killed between the years 1833 and 1843 , at near three millions . And yet in spite of the wonderful slaughter which is constantly going on , Fremont , Emory , and others , can not repress their astonishment at the limitless herds which still are sustained in full-fed plenty on these plains . We have no doubt there is a large quantity of good land on the territory west of us along the Arkansas , Kansas , Platte , and Yellow Stone rivers and their tributaries . But as we bend our course in a southeast direction along the course of the Santa Fe traders , we shall find the country rougher , and the resources for sustaining population less than farther north . Bent 's Fort , on the Arkansas River , is the point where travelers commence the real difficulties of their journey . In common seasons they have no great difficulty in procuring food for their caravan . Lieut . Emory , in his journal , under date of August 7th , six days ' marches from Bent 's Fort , has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now in what may be called the paradise of that part of the country between Bent 's Fort and San Miguel ; and yet he who leaves the edge of the Canadian , or its tributaries , must make a good day 's march to find food , water , or grass . " And such was the straitness of their situation in this " paradise , " that Emory tells us , under the same date , that they were compelled to stint the men in their rations of bread . While here , he is not enraptured with a sight of buffaloes as he was farther north ; and the inference is , that the natural instinct of this animal leads him away from a country unproductive of sustenance for him . By this we do not assert the entire country to be thus , but that in general such is its character . The attempt to rear up a second buckeye state there would be as hopeless a task  --  to use Kirwan 's expression-as to " bleed a tombstone . " Some investigation leads us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Mexico , which is half as large again as Ohio . The value of this conquest may be ascertained with some degree of accuracy , and in doing this , we shall rely principally on the authority of persons in some way attached to the government . It would be expected of them to give as favorable an account of this country as would be consistent with facts . Lieut . Emory , and Dr. Wislizenus , have prepared narrations of their researches in New Mexico . The Senate have caused these to be printed , and from these and Humboldt 's researches into New Spain , we derive our principal facts . Concerning the apparent honesty and ability of these witnesses , we can speak without hesitation . They seem to speak not as packed jurors , but as honest men . I-lu mboldt gives the following unpromising account of New Mexico : Its latitude the same with that of // Syria and Central Persia ; its climate is so cold that it freezes there in the middle of May . He asserts one desert of considerable width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area given up to sterility , which would immensely diminish the capacities of the buckeye state , were it there . And , moreover , he declares the whole country , in general , to be seldom visited by rains , and of course very barren . For this reason , nature forbids the possibility of a large population ever being sustained in this province . On the Rio del Norte there are some productive lands , and yet such perpetual aridity prevails , that even these are useless without artificial irrigation . From some singular facts which this enterprising traveler has given , we infer the country to be subject , occasionally at least , to earthquakes which , in two instances at least , for a considerable time , interrupted the natural course of the Del Norte . His account of the population is equally unpromising , as may be inferred from this glance at their commerce in 1802 . When the natives wish to trade with the Spanish colonists , they plant , as a sign of good faith , a cross by the road side , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stag flesh , while at the foot of the cross they stretch out a buffalo hide . This truly primitive procedure is understood by the colonist , who takes away the hide and leaves in its place such articles as he knows the Indian wants ! He speaks also of the distrust which exists between the colonists and natives , resulting in frequent murders , and , as we learn from another source , in one instance , the massacre of all the whites in the province . This was in 1680 , and yet the same author declares that the " deep rancor of the Indian race has continued to the present time , and in all the frequent and bloody revolutions of later years in New Mexico , the pueblos have generally acted a conspicuous and cruel part. *** Humboldt notices a fact , which has not changed since he wrote , that this hatred between the two races has caused the population to concentrate in towns , instead of spreading over the country . In his day the principal towns , Santa F* , Albuquerque , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humboldt , Santa F* had near four thousand , but modern travelers put it at three thousand.t The general accounts of Emory and Wislizenus , published during the present year by order of the Senate , do not differ materially from that condensed from Humboldt . They give the country around Santa a little more credit that Humboldt , who declares the soil to be very dry and sandy , and yet we receive far more unfavorable accounts of New Mexico from these works . There are many incidental expressions , such as drop from honest witnesses , which are as satisfactory as labored description . Emory traversed New Mexico from northeast to southwest , in a line acknowledged to be the best in the province . In one place , speaking of the country as a whole , he begins a sentence thus , " New Mexico , although its soil is barren and its resources limited , etc. " * On the next page he speaks of striking across " a dry , arid plain . " From where he crossed the Galisteo creek to its mouth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scarcely a sign of vegetation . " Even in the valley of the Del Norte between San Felippe and the Angosturas , the valley is so narrow as to forbid much agriculture , whilst the plains above are rolling sand-hills rising gradually to the base of the mountain . " From this wide sweep of sterility , he excepts the " poverty-stricken little * Report of Dr. Wislizen us , published by the Senate of the United States in 184S . Humboldt 's New Spain , vol. 2 . Emory 's New Mexico , p. 35 . Ibid. p. 39. // town of Algodones , which has some ground around it in cultivation . " Still following the course of the Del Norte , he says , " the valley suddenly contracts below Perdilla , between Isollatta and Peralta . On the east side of the river there is deep sand , and the country is perfectly barren . " Under date of September 7th , on the same page as the last quotation , he says , " nearly the whole distance traveled in the last three days has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm soil . " * On pages 47 , 49 and 51 , containing his journal for some six days , he speaks of the " rolling sand-hills " and plains over which he passed . He makes some exceptions in favor of the country around Santa F* , Passo Del Norte , and other places , which are to the country at large as mere garden patches . Dr. Wislizenus asserts New Mexico to be a " very mountainous country , " intersected by the valley of the Del Norte , which contains almost all the good land in the province ; and even the soil of this valley is " generally sandy and looks poor , " and produces crops on no condition without irrigation . We might verify our estimate of this province by the same method which we have already taken with Emory 's report . Incidental allusions all tend to the same point , that New Mexico has the most meager capacities to sustain population . A single county in Ohio or Wisconsin will sustain bountifully more people than all the 60,000 square miles of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts are confused and uncertain , and it is not very probable that in this respect the United States have entered into a very profitable speculation . Its only importance is in a military point of view , to keep open a passage to California , which may at least become the connecting link * Emory 's New Mexico , p. 41. of the immense trade between East* em Asia and our country . The present population is estimated at from 80,000 to 100,000 , hut such a population as it is ! Should any one wish to know who are our new fellow citizens , we beg them forthwith to procure the journals of Emory and Wislizenus , and to reread Humboldt 's New Spain . Spaniards , half-breeds and natives , some Catholics and some heathen , and the most of them depraved , treacherous and beastly . Such are the acquisitions we have made by conquest . Agriculture is yet confined to men scratching the soil with a hoe . Commerce , as we have seen , is truly primitive ; their mankind abominably lazy , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as they make , would have shocked the taste of an ancient Helot . Their most perfected machinery consists in a rude grist-mill propelled by mules , and their greatest mental acumen consists in practically knowing that " the galled jade will wince , " since they think themselves highly favored in a riding horse or pack mule , which may happen to have a galled shoulder or back , on which to apply the goad ! We wait in calm expectancy of the time when the newly admitted State of New Mexico shall furnish her representative and two Senators . Perhaps one of the last shall be the Alcalde of Vegas , whom Emory so jocosely describes , and to whom Gen. Kearney said so cleverly- " Mr. Alcalde , and people of New Mexico : I have come amongst you by the orders of my government , to take possession of your country , and extend over it the laws of the United States ! We consider it , and have done so . for some time , a part of the territory of the United States ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as protectors , not as conquerors I " Then came the absolution which General Kearney administered , equal to ex // treme unction from the hands of Bishop Hughes ; but Mr. Alcalde was not willing to be absolved from his sworn allegiance to Mexico , and he made horrible grimaces while the General was administering on him , and cast down his eyes , and sought escape . But there was no escape , and the General made Mr. Alcalde look up into his eyes , ( as we were wont in our younger days to chuckle sulky boys under the chin , ) and repeat after him , the oath of eternal allegiance to the United States ! What an admirable shade will this portrait of the former " Mr. Alcalde " of Vegas , butnow -- in prospect-.Sen. ator elect from New Mexico , make in some grand picture of the United States Senate . We can almost imagine how his bronzed visage will look , sitting-as he ought in all conscience-between Senator Calhoun of South Carolina , and Senator Houston of Texas ! We feel great exhilaration as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , certainly our far-sighted statesmen , consummating this business , deserve a monument to eternize the country 's gratitude to them for their chivalrous deeds in annexing New Mexico to the United States . We did intend to pen a paragraph on the singular and summary annexation of New Mexico to our territory by Gen. Kearney , but our limits forbid it , and we must content ourselves with referring our reader to the fifth chapter of Mansfield 's History of the Mexican War , where the unparalleled assumption of this military chieftain is well set forth and rebuked . But when our highest officer can deliberately pen such words as these in a message to Congress , the Mexican government has " at last inraded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil , " as baseless an assertion as ever was uttered , what may we not forgive in a subordinate of his in New Mexico ? VOL VL 67 We wish now to examine the character of the remaining conquest , which for brevity we call California , meaning by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty not included in New Mexico . The treaty defines the boundary line as leaving that of New Mexico on the west , where it intersects the first branch of the river Gila , which is about at the 330 of north latitude . Thence it follows the Gila to its junction with the Colorado , and thence it crosses the Colorado , following the common division line between Upper and Lower California to the Pacific Ocean . The average width of this belt of land is not far from ten degrees , extending of course up to the 42* of latitude , the old boundary between the two countries . At an average distance ofabout 150 miles from the shore of the Pacific is the Sierra Nevada , the Snowy Mountain , dividing California proper , from a vast tract of country lying east of that mountain . It will convey more distinct impressions concerning this recent fruit of " conquered peace , " to consider these two sections of country separately , and that section lying east of the Sierra Nevada will properly come first . At the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure a copy of Fremont 's map , now in course of publication , giving no doubt the most accurate position to some marked features in that district . We are obliged to make our deductions from the incomplete map of Emory , and some maps in common use . From the reports of Emery and Fremont , we shall derive our principal description of this country . It may be reckoned at about twelve degrees east and west , that is more than seven hundred miles . There are many allusions in these journals , as well as in some others , which will convey a very vivid impression to the mind . Lieut . Emory , after leaving New Mexico , followed the Gila // to its junction with the Colorado , and then bore in a northwest direction to California . That there is but little difference between this country and that we have already described , is evident from following him in his weary march over so many leagues of mountain and desert , at the expense of many of his animals . About two degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country is much as before represented . " Some sixty miles more the plaia furnished them " dust knee deep , a good looking soil , but for whole acres not a sign of vegetation . " Irrigation might redeem this plain , and this must he done if it is ever cultivated . The country as he proceeded became more and more mountainous , and at last the valley of the Gila became so narrow and rough that he was obliged to leave that and strike boldly across the highlands . Occasionally he comes to a fertile valley , like that of the San Pedro , and particular parts of the Gila ; but for the rest its breast is rough and fissured , or if not so , covered with barren sands , precluding the hope of reward to the agriculturalist . They finally leave the mountains , but the plains were more inhospitable , and the horses seemed about to starve for want of grass , which was found in very small quantities . At one place the party were regaled with the pleasant prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their animals , and anticipation became reality , since Emory speaks of the sterile country as being " dreary beyond description , " and " the table lands formed of sand . " There were some patches of amble land found during these marches , but when at last they reached the Colorado , they had a desert of ninety miles before them , without water or grass except in the smallest quantity . They suffered greatly in crossing this , and lost many of their animals . Emory describes this desert as a triangle bounded by the Colorado on one side , the Snowy Mountains on another , and on a third , by still another chain of mountains . " It is covered chiefly with floating sand . " During the marches over this desert , containing some three thousand five hundred square miles , they found only two patches of grass . That desert , forming a part of our prize , is about three times as large as Rhode Island , and is half as large as New Jersey ! which comparison is significant of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general remarks concerning the territory we are now describing , so pertinent , that we will transfer them to our pages , that " the chivalry , " panting for ways and means to get clear of slaves to the best advantage , may see clearly their prospects in New Mexico , and California east of the Sierra Nevada . " The country from the Arkansas to this point , " he writes at the mouth of the Gila , " more than twelve hundred miles , in its adaptation to agriculture , has peculiarities , which must forever stamp itself upon the population which inhabits it . All of North Mexico , embracing New Mexico , Chihuahua , Sonora and THE CALIFoRNIAS , as far north as the Sacramento , are , as far as the best information goes , the same in the physical character of its surface , and differ but little in climate or prod ucts . " In no part of this vast tract can the rains from heaven be relied on , to any extent , for the cultivation of the soil . The earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any vegetation whatever . " A few feeble streams flow in different directions from the great mountains , which in many places traverse this region . These streams are separated , sometimes by plains , and sometimes by mountains , without water and without vegetation , and may be called deserts , so far as // they perform any useful part in the sustenance of animal life . " The cultivation of the earth , therefore , is confined to those narrow strips of land which are within the level of the waters of the streams , and wherever practiced in a community with any success , or to any extent , involves a degree of subordination and absolute obedience to a chief , repugnant to the habits of our people . The chief who directs the time and quantity of the precious irrigating water , must he obeyed implicitly by the whole community . A departure from his orders , by a waste of water , or unjust distribution of it , or neglect to make proper embankments , may endanger the means of subsistence of many people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately . " The profits of labor are too inadequate for the existence of negro slavery . Slavery as practiced by the Mexicans , under the form of peonage , which enables the master to get the services of the adult while in the prime of life , without the obligation of rearing him in infancy , supporting him in old age , or maintaining his family , affords no data for estimating the profits of slave labor , as it exists in the United States . No one who has ever visited this country , and who is acquainted with the character and value of slave labor in the United States , would ever think of bringing his own slaves here with any view to profit ; much less would he purchase slaves for such a purpose . Their labor here , if they could be retained as slaves , among peons , nearly of their own color , would never pay the cost of transportation , much less the additional purchase money. *7* Our readers will remember that we have thus passed along the southern border of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are content to allow these facts to speak for themselves , while we examine briefly another feature of the same district , without which our view would be very imperfect . By examining any map of ordinary accuracy , we find in this district of country , what Fremont calls the Great Basin . With the map of this enterprising traveler we could define more accurately the boundaries of this singular and isolated region ; and in the want of that , must content ourselves with such authorities as are within our reach . On most maps for want of better knowledge , it is put down as the Great Sandy Desert , and until Fremont 's partial exploration its real character was unknown . This traveler has twice visited it , and yet in his last report addressed to the Senate , he speaks of it as " deserving the full examination of a thorough exploration . " Fremont says explicitly that it is " a basin of some five hundred miles in diameter every way , between four and five thousand feet above the level of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own system of lakes and rivers , and having no connexion whatever with the sea . " f Here then we have in this basin and its broad rim of mountains between two and three hundred thousand square miles , which is about one third of the entire conquest . Fremont proves that it is not given up entirely to sterility . " Mountain is the predominating structure of the interior of the basin , " and " its general character , with exceptions , is that of deser . The plains are sandy and barren . The bases of the mountain have a " belt of alluvial soil , " and that with considerable uniformity . The basin has two large lakes , the one salt , and the other fresh ; and " on the east of these , along the base of the mountains , is the usual bench of alluvion , which extends to a distance of three hundred // miles , with wood , water , and abundant grass. *** The salt lake is about seventy miles long , and the Utah about half that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement , and made such headway , that " on the 1st of April of the present year they had three thousand acres of wheat , seven saw and grist mills , seven hundred houses in a fortified enclosure of sixty acres , stock and other accompaniments of a flourishing settlement- " The climate of the Basin is said to be excellent , and the rains generally sufficient for the purposes of agriculture . And yet these documents , published by the Senate of the United States , declare the greater portion of this third part of their conquest to be a useless desert , having the smallest capacities for furnishing necessary subsistence for population . Probably a dozen counties in the buckeye state actually have more acres of arable land than this immense acquisition east of the Sierra Nevada . We have mountains and plains of rolling sand-hills , interspersed with here and there a patch of ground which has a soil sufficient for agriculture ; and even here , in the majority of cases , the streams must be dammed for irrigation , as an indispensable condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquitous war has cost the United States , the territory-aside from Upper California properbought with their blood , would hardly furnish a sufficieri*y of productive land to give each of them a quarter of a section ! We have not done so well as old England in her Asiatic iniquities , drinking up " demure as at a grace , Pollutions from the brimming cup of wealth ; Contemptuous of all honorable rule , Yet bartering freedom and the poor man 's li*f* For gold as at a market ! " Here is the prize we gain in a war originating in the greed for new terFrernont 's Geog Memoir , p. * . ritory on which to plant and extend slavery ; a war costing the poor man 's life with a multiplication truly frightful . Our pollutions are not drank from the brimming cup of wealth to constitute their apology . And as we glance over the bulk of our acquisitions already described , we are almost maliciously reminded by some scoundrel-whisperer at our ear , of a scene in Milton , " a grove hard by , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange Their earnest eyes they fixed " - " Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce , " " greedily they plucked Ihe fruitage fair to sight , like that which grew Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed ; This more delusive , not the touch , but taste Deceived ; they fortdty thiitking to allay Tlteir appetite with gtist , instead of fruit Chewed bitter ashes , which the offended taste With spattering noise rejected The hand of Providence has held the balance here , and while she held has flung such a mist before the eyes of the rapacious barterers in this bargain , that they fancied this immense territory of desert to be an Eden of such unrivalled fertility , that all the south might see herself more than reproduced in new slave states . A few more words and we have done . The only redeeming feature of this hard bargain , is found in that part of Upper California which lies between the Sierra Nevada and the Pacific coast , and as this part of the territory is better understood than the rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In round numbers , this district contains between seventy-five thousand and ohe hundred thousand square miles ; that is , it includes territory equal to nearly twice that of Ohio or New York . Humboldt says it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world . The valleys of the American , the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers , are very fertile . Frernont , in order to reach the Arkansas , was compelled to follow the San Joaquin // some distance , and keep the rocky rampart of Sierra Nevada on his left , some five hundred miles , in order to find a pass over them . This made the journey to the Arkansas two thousand miles , which , in due east course , was about nine hundred miles . During that journey , even in California , he found many sandy and barren plains , proving the country not to be altogether so many square miles of fertility . Facts will prove that many leagues of worthless land mar the excellence of this country . For instance , Fremont says that the extensive valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry and unproductive to well watered and luxuriantly fertile . " Besides these sterile tracts in the level country , we must also substract the broad and rocky slopes of the mountains which hem it in its whole length . The climate is remarkably fine , if we except the single drawback on the highest capabilities for agriculture , its tendency to aridity . It is not so faulty in this respect as Lower California , and the country east of the mountains already described . Yet the agriculturalist can not rely with any degree of certainty on the rains of heaven . To be above the fear of drought , he must irrigate , for which there are facilities in many parts of the territory . Our government , no doubt , attaches the highest importance to the bays and harbors , which are said to be very capacious and safe . Of these the public are sufficiently informed already , and of their prospective importance in the trade wish Eastern Asia . The day when this shall be the case is too remote to call for remark here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these harbors will not be of much service in that trade , and such obstacles exist to a project of this kind , that it may reasonably be doubted whether even American enterprise will dare to grapple with them for a long time to come . Nature has lifted ramparts of rock heaven-high between us and California , which we do not say may not yet be hewn down , but which we do believe will long remain untouched . And before any such scheme can be available or permanent , the savages must be civilized , or removed , or exterminated ; but judging from the his-. tory of the savages , as seen in our slave states , this last would be the smallest of obstacles , and easily shoved aside . And now , glancing at the country over which we have passed so rapidly , searching twelve hundred miles from the head-waters of the Arkansas before we found a country which at all deserves the name of being productive and valuable , who of us believes that California on the Pacific , cut off from our remotest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , can be bound long to Washington as a center ? Let it grow and become important , in a section of the world where its habits and interests will he peculiar to itself , separated by a journey of three thousand miles from the center of power , who believes such a prize will long stay in our grasp ? Indeed , as we have looked at the subject of American conquests , we have thought of a fear which was once expressed by sea-faring men concerning that huge iron steamei- , the Great Britain , that her length was so great that she was liable to break in two on the back of some high wave , or with her stern on one wave and stem on another , with her center unsupported , she might goto pieces by her own weight . Is there no danger of the same sort to our country , reaching now from Maine to California , a huge , weary length ? Should there come some such a storm as the rabid nullificationists of the South are threatening , we confess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave we should break in two . Or should the ill-fated yessel rest on two mountain waves , // one stirred by freedom , the other by slavery , we should tremble lest she should fall to pieces by her own unwieldy weight ! Such are our prospects in California , and such the fears to which this base war has made us heirs  --  a war conceived in sin , and brought forth in iniquily  --  a war commenced for the extension of slavery , and costing us , who abhor such a result as we do death , TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND MEN , AND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTYSIX MILLIONS OF DOLLARS , BESIDES THE IMMENSE BURDENS SADDLED ON US BY THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS . But if our deductions prove not false concerning the utter unfitness of these conquests for the purposes they were intended to subserve , we thank Him , whose power has been displayed sublimely in heaving up these mountains into such a rugged and unproductive confusion , as shall forever banish from this territory a system which traffics in the image of God , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
