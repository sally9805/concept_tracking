SCENE I.  --  The Wine-shop of Hannibal Grimaud , at the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRIMAUD , LIZETTE , and SUSANNE , R. Grim . Grimaud Do n't talk , woman , but hear me ! I 'm Commander-in-Chief ; as the great Louis said , " I 'm France "  --  which means , I 'm everything and everybody . Liz . Lizetta But now , husband , consider  --  Grim . Grimaud Do n't waste your breath by husbanding me ! I 'm firm , inflexible ! a solid square ! there 's no breaking through me . Susan . Susanne But , dear father  --  Grim . Grimaud Do n't father me , you jade ; or rather , do n't get anybody else to father me . I tell you , when you do marry , it shall be to a man of my choosing . Do you imagine that I , Hannibal Grimaud , who have served seventeen campaigns , will condescend to marry my daughter to a common barber ? Liz . Lizetta Pierre Briquet is n't a common barber ; he keeps as good a shop as any in the town , and is well to do in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! look at my chin ; how dare you contradict me ? did n't he shave me yesterday with his own hand ? Susan . Susanne That was out of friendship ; for , you know , your own hand shook so with  --  Grim . Grimaud Silence , you impudent baggage , or I 'll shake you . Once for all , I tell you I 'm not to be shaved into any such connections ; and as for that other suitor of yours  --  that threadpaper fellow , Jacques Fils , why , he 's a fool . Liz . Lizetta He 's as good a young man as any in town . Grim . Grimaud Good ! good for nothing . Liz . Lizetta Sober , steady , and industrious . Susan . Susanne And an excellent workman . Liz . Lizetta Two such suitors are not to be despised . Susan . Susanne And I 'm sure men are scarce enough in the colony , unless you 'd have me marry a blackamoor . Grim . Grimaud You shall marry whom I please , you jade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you Pierre Briquet and Jacques Fils are very well in their way ; but be prudent , girl ; give your best smiles to the best customers . Remember you 're a soldier 's daughter ; and though your post may be a wine-shop , let your heart be surrounded with a chevaux de frize of pride , which shall render it impervious to the puffs of a barber , or all the fine-drawn compliments of a tailor . Liz . Lizetta I 'm sure Susanne has all the proper pride of her mother 's family . Grim . Grimaud Lather and soapsuds , what do you mean ? why , you were only a laundress when I raised you to the honourable distinction of a soldier 's wife ! Her mother 's family indeed  --  she has little to boast of on that score . Liz . Lizetta Score , indeed ! your washing-score was long enough when I married you , and you were only a  --  Grim . Grimaud Silence , woman ! ( Looking round . ) Here come some neighbours ; order , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter PIERRE BRIQUET and JACQUES FILS , L. Welcome , neighbours , welcome . Bri . Briquet Good morning , friend Grimaud ; I 've some news for you ; so just step in , though I 'm in a terrible hurry . Grim . Grimaud Ay ; good , I hope ? Bri . Briquet For me , at any rate ; but first , some wine ; my throat 's as dry as the high road . Jac . Jacques And so is mine . Grim . Grimaud Susanne , some wine . Ah , this is a fine country . Bri . Briquet Do you say so ? Grim . Grimaud Ay , for wine 's cheap , and one 's always thirsty  --  ha , ha ! All . Ha , ha ! very good . ( Susanne brings wine . ) Grim . Grimaud Well , Master Briquet , now for your news . Bri . Briquet Well , first and foremost , my shop 's to let . Susan . Susanne Your shop ? Bri . Briquet Yes , my shop , pretty one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as his valet and confidential attendant . Susan . Susanne What ! Mademoiselle de la , Reynerie 's cousin , and who they say is to be her husband ? Bri . Briquet So they say ; and now she 's her own mistress , the death of her mother having removed all restraint . Grim . Grimaud But is the death of the Marchioness authenticated ? Bri . Briquet Why , seeing the vessel she was to have sailed to France in was wrecked , and every soul has perished , there 's very little doubt of the matter . Ah , poor Mademoiselle de la Reynerie ! she has had two narrow escapes , for grief and anxiety had nearly killed her . Grim . Grimaud Ay , but the Black Doctor saved her both times . Liz . Lizetta Only to think , now , that a mulatto , and a slave , should have become the most eminent physician in all the island ! Grim . Grimaud The Black Doctor is n't a slave . Liz . Lizetta Well , but he was before he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , wife of mine . Remember what you were before I married you . Bri . Briquet But the strangest thing of all is , that after the Black Doctor had saved the life of Mademoiselle de la Reynerie , and become domiciled in the family , he should suddenly disappear , and now nearly six months have elapsed since he was seen here in St. Louis , though some of the negroes say he has been observed wandering on the cliffs , but always avoiding anyone who appeared to seek him . Grim . Grimaud Well , everybody likes the Black Doctor , and so they should , if it were only for the services he has rendered Mademoiselle de la Reynerie ; she 'll be a treasure to the man that wins her . Bri . Briquet And she 's so rich , too ; plenty of gold and jewels ; plantations here , and estates in Fraace . Grim . Grimaud Unexceptionable and desirable plunder , friend Briquet , and worth leading a forlorn hope for . Susan . Susanne I suppose we may look soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't exactly say , though the Chevalier will shortly honour me with his entire confidence , and I 'll let you know as soon as we arrange affairs . Grim . Grimaud ( Goes up the stage , Lizette follows . ) We , indeed . Bri . Briquet I say , Susanne , what pleasure I should have in curling you up for a certain day . Susan . Susanne Curling me up , indeed ! what do you mean ? Bri . Briquet Though art could n't improve you , Susanne . Macassar oil , bergamot , and eau de Cologne would be only adding perfumery to the violet . Susan . Susanne La ! Briquet , how you do talk ? Jac . Jacques ( Aside , very melancholy . ) I see my suit cut on the cross ; soft soap carries it . Susan . Susanne What 's the matter , Jacques ? you seem dull to-day . Jac . Jacques ( Very spoony . ) Not particular . Bri . Briquet It 's only the thoughts of losing my company , Susanne ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pole  --  but I must be off . Jac . Jacques ( Joyfully . ) What ! are you going ? Bri . Briquet Yes , and I 'm going to take you with me ; you do n't think I 'd leave you here with Susanne ? Jac . Jacques ( Going up . ) Heigho ! Bri . Briquet Besides , I must attend the Chevalier ; he will be expecting me . Good bye , Susanne , I shall see you again soon ; good day , Grimaud ; good day , Madame Grimaud . Grim . Grimaud If you hear any news of the Black Doctor , mind you let us now . Bri . Briquet It 's likely I shall ; for little Lia , the foster sister of Mademoiselle de la Reynerie , is very ill ; and as he ca n't have left the island , no doubt he 'll be found to attend upon her ; but I must say good bye once more , Susanne . ( Aside . ) I shall see you again this evening . Come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good bye all . ( Looking at Susanne . ) Heigho ! Exit at the door . Grim . Grimaud That Briquet 's a greater puppy than ever ; and as for the other , why , he 's a perfect idiot . Come , bustle about , it 's near dinner-time . Susan . Susanne Puppy , indeed ! I 'm sure Briquet 's not at all a puppy . Liz . Lizetta Nor poor Jacques half such a fool as he looks to be ; but nobody is good enough for you . Grim . Grimaud Yes , you 're good enough for me , but do n't dare dispute with me ; I 'll teach you to mutiny ; to the right about , march ! They go off , he follows , R. SCENE II .  --  Fabian 's Hut , constructed of bamboo an opening R. , facing the audience , and leading to a garden . In the garden is seen a green bank , another opening at the back , which is the entrance to the hut , from which wild rocky scenery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interior of the hut ; at the back , R. of the entrance , a small trunk  --  a hatchet hanging on a nail just over it . Rude couch , covered with tiger skin  --  a few wooden chairs L. , and facing the audience . As scene opens . CHRISTIAN , an old Negro , is seen watching at the entrance , as if looking for some one . Chris . Christian How long he stays ! well , I must prepare his meal , though I fear he will not taste it . ( Looking out . ) Ah ! he comes at last ; how unhappy he looks ; when he 's that way , my presence here seems to oppress him ; so I 'll retire , and wait till he calls me . Exit , L. Enter FABIAN slowly , R. , holding in his hand a little cross of gold , hanging from his neck ; places his hat on the little trunk , and his gun near the entrance . Fab . Fabian Sacred relic worn by my mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took from her cold breast  --  when evil thoughts cross me , I press you to my lips , and all my anger is absorbed in tears . Can this little relic , so powerful against evil , avail nothing to my sufferings ? in vain I place it on my burning heart ; it can not quench the passion that consumes it . To it alone I breathe my fearful secret ; that I , a mulatto , and late a slave , dare to love the daughter of a white man  --  the daughter of him who was my master ! it is madness  --  madness ! ( Falls on his knees , his hand on the foot of the couch . ) Pray , for me , my mother ! CHRISTIAN appears at the entrance , looks in , and signs to PAULINE to enter . She enters with LIA , who is leaning on her arm , and appears ill ; places her on a seat near the entrance , and comes down alone . Paul . Pauline ( After an effort to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sound of her voice . ) Heavens ! ( Rises . ) Paul . Pauline ( Advancing . ) Monsieur Fabian ! Fab . Fabian Is it indeed you , mademoiselle ; and here ? Paul . Pauline ( With great gentleness . ) When death threatened , you came to my assistance ; when life and health returned , you left me ; but you did not impose on me forgetfulness nor ingratitude . ( Offers a purse . ) Fab . Fabian ( With emotion . ) And it is for this you are here ? Oh , mademoiselle , I thought you good  --  generous  --  Paul . Pauline The gold I have brought you , I wish you to distribute amongst your poor patients  --  Fab . Fabian ( Taking the purse . ) You are an angel . ( Looking at Lia with happiness . ) I bless heaven for seconding my endeavours ; again I see you , whom death has twice so nearly snatched away  --  I am happy , I am proud ! Paul . Pauline Good Fabian ! but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Paul . Pauline Yes , which perhaps you can help me to unravel . Since you have ceased to come to the Reynerie , a man has been seen at night wandering about the dwelling , near my window ; he has eluded all search  --  all pursuit ; one night the negro on duty fired at him quite at random , and next morning , at the foot of a large tree , traces of blood were found . Fabian , I can not tell you my feelings at the sight of that blood . ( Looking earnestly at him . ) You had not always that scar on your forehead . Fab . Fabian That scar ? a fall I had on the rock . Paul . Pauline ( Aside , agonized . ) ' T was his blood ! Fab . Fabian Mademoiselle , what is the matter ? Paul . Pauline Fabian , the desire to thank you was not the only motive that brought me here ; I have come to claim your assistance for my poor foster-sister , Lia . Fab . Fabian Lia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pauline But now so ill , so spirit-broken ! Yes , Fabian , poor Lia is sinking beneath sorrows I am ignorant of ; she will die if you do not save her . ( Brings Lia forward . ) Look at her . Courage , dear Lia ; he restored me , and will give you health and strength . Fab . Fabian ( Gives her a seat , takes her hand , and looks at her . ) What is the matter , Lia ? Lia . ( Without raising her head . ) Nothing . Paul . Pauline Dear Lia , tell Fabian the cause of your suffering . Lia . I do not suffer . Paul . Pauline ( To Fabian . ) Always the same answer ; you can not assist , if she persist in the silence ; she will die , and none will ever know the grief that killed her . Fab . Fabian Yes , I know it . Lia . ( Alarmed . ) Heavens ! Fab . Fabian I know her malady , but can not save her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? Fab . Fabian The sickness that oppresses her is of the heart . Lia . ( Rising in terror . ) Fabian , Fabian ! Oh , be silent . ( Falls back in her seat . ) Paul . Pauline ( Aside . ) This mystery ! Fab . Fabian You love . Lia . Oh , no , no , no , no . Fab . Fabian Do not try to deceive me ; the budding passion which brightened to your eyes during your mistress 's convalescence , since then I see has grown , and consumed the heart in which you strived to stifle it . Lia . ( Hiding her face in her hands . ) Have pity , Fabian , have pity ! Fab . Fabian And this love , pure and chaste , you would hide from all , as if it were a shame for you to love one whom you have no right to love , and who despises you . Paul . Pauline Oh , no ! ' t is impossible . Fab . Fabian Because he is not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . Pauline What do I hear ? Fab . Fabian And yet is Monsieur Bertrand a good and worthy young man . Lia . Do not mention that name . Paul . Pauline Bertrand , the young Frenchman ? Mr. Barbantine 's clerk ? Fab . Fabian Yes , mademoiselle , yes ! he is a good and worthy young man ; but his skin is white ( To Lia. ) , and yours is dark as mine ; therefore you have not the right to love him . Suffer , poor sister , suffer , and despair , for yours is a malady for which there is no remedy . Paul . Pauline Oh , heavens ! ought I to understand ? Lia . ( Weeping . ) I wish to die ; ' t is all I desire . Paul . Pauline Unhappy girl , but you must not , shall not ; I will save you . ( Looking at Fabian . ) You say he is not of her race ; what is that to me , since she loves him  --  would die for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall live , she shall be his wife . Lia . ( Joyfully . ) His wife ! Fab . Fabian ( Astonished . ) ' T is impossible . Paul . Pauline It shall be my work , my secret care , known only to us three ; he loves you ? Lia . But if he marries me , he is lost . Fab . Fabian Yes , he will be proscribed , driven out by the man who has fostered him . Paul . Pauline No matter , I am rich ; I know it now , and for the first time feel proud of it . He shall be free , and you shall be happy . ( Looking at Fabian . ) I know not what gives me strength and resolution , before unknown to me ; by-and-by we will go to Barbantine 's residence ; I will see Bertrand , he shall hear me , he will understand ; but you , Lia , weak and suffering , must not go with me , and I will not confide our secret to another ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabian ( Sorrowfully . ) Alone ! Paul . Pauline ( With gentleness . ) No , Fabian , you shall go with me ; when it strikes three at St. Louis , be at the end of the avenue of palms . Come , Lia , my sister , look cheerfully , all will be well . Look , Fabian , she is better already ; her eyes are brighter ; thanks to you , she feels the blessing of hope , and hope is life . Come , Lia , come . Exit hurriedlp ; Lia kisses his hand , and exit after her . Fab . Fabian He is of another race  --  what is that to me ? she loves him  --  would die for him ! She said so , here but now , and to me , who would die for her . Oh , mother , mother , bless you ; I asked you , you prayed for me , and in an instant heaven has sent me a moment of joy  --  of bliss . ( The report of a gun heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luce ( Without . ) Help ! help ! CHRISTIAN appears at the entrance , and points , L. Chris . Christian Master ! master ! yonder a hunter ! a serpent ! ( Takes down hatchet , is going . ) Fab . Fabian You are not strong enough ; give me the weapon . ( Takes hatchet from him , and rushes out . ) Chris . Christian ( Following to entrance . ) No , master , no , let me go ; my life is worthless , but your  --  ( As he is going . ) Enter ST . LUCE , conducted by FABIAN . Ha , he was in time . Fab . Fabian ( To St. Luce . ) Lean on me , sir . St. L. St. Luce ( A gun in his hand . ) No , thank you , Doctor ; I am not much hurt . ( Christian takes St. Luce 's hat and gun , and places them in a corner . ) Fab . Fabian ( Gives the hatchet to Christian , who replaces it . ) Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . St. L. St. Luce I have many times seen death as near , but have never been on such intimate terms with a serpent before ; ' t is an indigenous produce which does little honour to your country . ( Christian returns with cocoanut-shell full of water , and gives it to Fabian , who hands it to St. Luce . ) St. L. St. Luce ( Returns it to Fabian , after drinking . ) Thank you . Fab . Fabian ( Looking at his left hand . ) You are wounded . St. L. St. Luce O , ' t is nothing . Fab . Fabian Allow me . ( Taking from the little trunk the necessaries to dress the wound . ) What could bring you to this isolated spot ? Exit Christian , who returns immediately with more water ; Fabian washes and dresses St. Luce 's wounded hand . ) St. L. St. Luce Only curiosity ! you must know I was stretched under a banana tree , enjoying that dreamy repose , which , while it transports us to an ideal world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I dreamt I was hunting at Marly , when suddenly the foliage near me became agitated , and , thinking it was a rabbit , I seized my gun , and fired , as near as I could judge , upon the spot of his hiding-place , when all of a sudden I saw the grey head of an enormous serpent rise up before me ; so I called out lustily for help , and my kind stars sent you to my assistance , when there was no more space between me and my enemy than just enough for your hatchet . By my faith , Doctor , you are a wonderful man , and your exact manner of amputation is complete . Fab . Fabian Sir , if you seek rest , this miserable dwelling is at your service ; but if you desire to return to St. Louis , allow me to offer a guide . St. L. St. Luce ( Rising . ) A thousand thanks for your proffered hospitality ; but I must not give my sister time to be uneasy at my absence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fab . Fabian ( To Christian . ) Prepare to conduct the Chevalier by the road through St. Hane . St. L. St. Luce Doctor , you are decidedly the good genius of our family ; without your assistance , lovely eyes might this night have been drowned in tears ; yes , my cousin would again have hid her sweet face in the grief of mourning , which is so soon to smile on her affianced husband . Fab . Fabian ( At the back of stage , turns suddenly round . ) Affianced husband ! of whom do you speak ? St. L. St. Luce Of my cousin , who is to  --  Fab . Fabian Of Mademoiselle de la Reynerie ? St. L. St. Luce Certainly . Fab . Fabian No , it is impossible . St. L. St. Luce Impossible ! and why ? Fab . Fabian ( Embarrassed . ) Because I known no one in Bourbon worthy to possess such a treasure . St. L. St. Luce True ; but then I do not belong to the Isle . Fab . Fabian You ! St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear sir  --  seriously in love ; you are astonished to hear it , they would not believe it at Versailles ; but , I repeat it , I 'm in love , and intend to marry ; our union was first projected by Madame de la Reynerie , and Pauline but waited the end of her mourning , in order to obey her mother 's wish . Fab . Fabian ( Overpowered . ) She ! St. L. St. Luce And though the aristocracy of Bourbon should blame me ever so , I shall insist on your presence at my marriage , which , but for you , death had twice prevented . Farewell , Doctor , or rather , good-bye for the present . ( To Christian , who is standing at the entrance , and presents Chevalier with hat and gun . ) Go on before me , friend , and heaven protect us from sun and serpents ! Good-bye , Fabian . Exit St. Luce and Christian . Fab . Fabian ( With a sudden burst . ) She loves that man , he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have allowed him to go from me with life . ( Seizes his gun , is about to rush out , and suddenly stops . ) Kill him ! assassinate him ! no , no , ' t is not he who should die ! it is , ah  --  I ; water ! air ! I shall suffocate ! ( Falls at the end of the couch , his hand falls on his chest , he seizes the little cross suspended round his neck . ) Again that dreadful idea crossed my brain , and my hand unintentionally falls on this little relic  --  O , my mother , ' t is your voice I hear , ' t is heaven commands I should avoid a crime , and still drag on this wretched life of suffering ! ( Three o'clock strikes . ) Three o'clock ; she is waiting for me  --  she , St. Luce 's bride ! ( Rises with a sudden burst . ) No , no , it shall not be ! I will not die alone . ( Throws away cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not save her  --  together , together , we will die together ! Rushes out . SCENE III .  --  The High Road near Reynerie . Enter BRIQUET and JACQUES , R. ; they are both a little elevated . Bri . Briquet Capital stuff that , was n't it , Jacques ? that 's the house to live in ! Long life to the Chevalier and his intended bride ! I say , Jacques , my boy , why do n't you laugh ? Jac . Jacques I ca n't laugh , Briquet ; I 'm melancholy . Bri . Briquet It 's a professional failing ; tailors are naturally melancholy ; sedentary employment naturally produces thoughts , therefore it 's natural . Jac . Jacques You 've called me a natural three times . Bri . Briquet Do n't interrupt me , Jacques , but listen ,  --  what was I saying ? O , I remember : long life to the Chevalier and his intended bride ! Talking of brides , I intend to be married myself shortly . Jac . Jacques You be married ! and pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's to be the bride ? why , whom do you think but Susanne , the lovely charming little Susanne ? Jac . Jacques Have you got her consent ? Bri . Briquet Not yet . Jac . Jacques Have you got her father 's consent ? Bri . Briquet Not exactly , but I 've got the consent of one party . Jac . Jacques What , her mother ? Bri . Briquet No ( Hiccup ) , myself . Jac . Jacques Well , that 's something towards it , but I should like to see you propose it to old Grimaud , he 'd  --  Bri . Briquet What do I care about old Grimaud ? do you think I 'm afraid of old Grimaud ? I 'm afraid of nobody , when my blood 's up , I fear neither man nor  --  ( Turning round. ) the devil ! Enter CHRISTIAN , the old negro , R. Chris . Christian Your master waits for you at the Reynerie . Bri . Briquet What do you know about my master ? Chris . Christian But little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with a slight accident in the woods . Bri . Briquet An accident ! Chris . Christian Yes , which delayed him beyond the time appointed for his return . But all danger is past , thanks to the timely assistance of my master . Bri . Briquet And who is your master ? Chris . Christian The Black Doctor . Exit , R. Bri . Briquet ( Turns from him as he speaks . ) I say , Jacques . ( Looks round , finds Christian gone . ) Why , he 's gone ; so the Black Doctor 's come to hand at last . I was going down to Grimaud 's , but as my new master wants me I ca n't , so do you tell him . Do you hear that the Black Doctor 's still in the land of the living ? none of your nonsense now with Susanne . I feel rather queer , but the Chevalier will attribute that to my anxiety on his account . Good-bye , Jacques ; keep steady , my boy ; I shall see you to-morrow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an example . Exeunt differently . SCENE IV .  --  Enormous rocks , L. A rock , R. , forming a grotto ; near which , on one side , is a stone bench , a rock in which steps are rudely cut , descending to the sea , in the centre of the stage ; with a rock in which a seat appears rudely cut out . A pathway L. , a little elevated , and overhanging the steep cliffs . The whole scene is wild and gloomy in the extreme ; the sea at back . As the scene opens PAULINE and FABIAN appear at the very top of the the rock , R. Paul . Pauline This path seems unfrequented ; why have we come this way ? Fab . Fabian Because it shortens the distance of your dwelling . Paul . Pauline ' T is well . ( Looking round . ) I have never seen this part of the island before  --  where are we ? Fab . Fabian The inhabitants rarely visit this bay , which they have called the mulatto 's grotto ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pauline Shall we reach the Reynerie before Bertrand ? I wish to be first , to tell Lia of the success of our enterprise . Fab . Fabian He is going round in the boat ; the wind and tide will be against him , so we have the advantage . Rest yourself here a moment , to recruit your strength . Paul . Pauline ( Sits on rock , C. of stage . ) This is a wild and gloomy spot . Fab . Fabian Did you not desire me to take the most retired route ? Mademoiselle de la Reynerie wished to avoid any one whilst walking beside the mulatto Fabian . ' T was otherwise in your childhood ; then you did not disdain to lean on my arm . Paul . Pauline ( After a moment 's silence , as if to change the conversation . ) Fabian , I think you have my fan . Fab . Fabian ( Takes it from his bosom , and presents it to her respectfully . ) ' T is here , mademoiselle . Pau . But , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembles so as it did just now ; are you ill ? Fab . Fabian No , lady . Paul . Pauline Ah , I shall be so happy to tell Lia the obstacles that separated her from Bertrand no longer exist ; in a month she shall leave the colony with her affianced husband ; they shall live in a country where prejudice will not condemn their union  --  will not crush their mutual affection ; Lia , my sister , you at least shall be happy . ( Sighing . ) Fab . Fabian Happy ! Yes , in the love of her husband ! for without his love of what avail would have been my penetration or your generous friendship ? Paul . Pauline Bertrand has a noble heart . Fab . Fabian He loves her . Paul . Pauline He was not born under your sky ; had he been a creole , he would have hid his passion in the inmost depths of his heart . Fab . Fabian And Lia would have perished ; and had Bertrand been a creole he dared not have shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Paul . Pauline ( Rising with calm dignity . ) Fabian , we will continue our walk ; the Countess and her brother will be waiting for me . Fab . Fabian ( Endeavouring to contain himself . ) He loves you , lady . Paul . Pauline ( Embarrassed . ) He has told me so . Fab . Fabian He is to be your husband . Paul . Pauline ' T was my mother 's dearest wish . ( Fabian staggers against the rock , R. ; Pauline is going , turns round and looks at him . ) Fabian , I am waiting for you . ( He passes his hand across his forehead , appears to be looking attentively at two crosses carved in one of the rocks . ) Fab . Fabian Those two crosses carved in the rock , and which appertain to the legend I told you of just now . Paul . Pauline What legend ? Fab . Fabian Shall I tell it you ? Paul . Pauline Yes , tell me the history of this legend . Fab . Fabian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen gradually to rise , then returns to Pauline . ) Listen , then . There lived in St. Louis , a poor mulatto  --  a slave , who ( I have forgotten for what good service rendered to his master ) received his freedom ! the generous gift should have made him happy , but it was otherwise ; for once free he was compelled to leave his master 's dwelling , and under that roof dwelt his better angel . At length he went forth , more wretched in his freedom than in his slavery ! for he loved  --  yes , madly loved  --  adored that master 's daughter . ( Wind heard . ) Paul . Pauline ( Alarmed . ) How dreadfully the wind howls . Fab . Fabian ( Not heeding her . ) He would have buried his love in his heart , though it had crushed it ; but the young and noble lady , who used to converse with him , in few kind words completed the delusion . He thought himself beloved  --  and though respect to the pride of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least she would never be another 's . The fool was dreaming ; one word awoke him , she was about to marry  --  to marry ! she had deceived him , had sported with his agony ; she should not have done so  --  it was imprudent , for then the wretched man took an oath to unite himself to her by the solemn , dreadful , awful tie of death . Paul . Pauline ( Rising agitated , looks at the sea , which is gradually surrounding them . ) Fabian ! Fabian ! not now ; the sea rises . ( Going . ) Let as go . Come , come , Fabian ! Fab . Fabian ( Detains her . ) Go !

Pauline ( In much terror . ) Fabian , for pity 's sake , save me ! Fab . Fabian Save you ! and is it not possible you guess I love you ? Paul . Pauline You ! Fab . Fabian Did I not say death was less terrible than his love ? Paul . Pauline ( Struggling with her feelings . ) No , no ! you are deceiving me ; you would not  --  could not see me die here before your eyes ! Fab .

Fabian ( Pointing to sea . ) No earthly power can save us ! Paul . Pauline ( Rushing to pathway , which the sea has not yet reached . ) Then let me beg my mother 's forgiveness , and pray to heaven for you . ( Falls on her knees against the rock . ) Fab .

Briquet ( Offers snuff . ) Yes , we are pleasantly situated . Do you still operate ? ( Makes sign of cutting with shears . ) Jac . Jacques Yes , I cut out . Bri . Briquet Ah , you rogue , you have cut me out ; and how does Madame Fils ? Jac . Jacques Oh , she 's quite well . Bri . Briquet Delighted to hear it  --  shall be still more delighted to see her . I bear no ill-will ; but how the deuce you managed it , I never could guess . Jac . Jacques Why , you see , I did n't talk of marrying until I got more than my own consent in the business . Bri . Briquet Ha , ha , I recollect ; but really , in Paris , a wife is rather an incumbrance , and you see my situation brings me so much in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little comforts , as they are termed , of matrimony ; strange things have happened since we rusticated in St. Louis . Jac . Jacques Strange , indeed , to think that the Marchioness , whom we all supposed drowned , should be alive after all ! Bri . Briquet Yes , and she is gone to Versailles , to present her daughter , Madame Pauline , to her Majesty the Queen , upon her return from the colonies ; she 'll be back in an hour . Jac . Jacques And the Black Doctor ? Bri . Briquet Oh , he 's with us  --  could n't do without him ; though , by-the-bye , the Marchioness does n't much relish his being here ; but the circumstance of his having twice saved her daughter 's life , and her still delicate health , in some way reconcile her to his presence . Jac . Jacques That was a fearful business , too , when Monsieur Bertrand saved them both ; there was a sort of mystery in that affair ! Bri . Briquet No doubt , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom in this world ; it was , as you say , a close shave . Jac . Jacques Rather too fine-drawn an affair for me , I own ; and the marriage with the Chevalier ! Bri . Briquet Why , there seems some reluctance on her part , but the Marchioness is positive . I suppose , eventually , she must marry ; but come into my room , and we will take a glass to old times , and our future acquaintance . ( As they are going , enter ANDRE at the door in back , which is open . ) And what do you want , friend ? And . Andre The Doctor , if you please . Bri . Briquet This is not a doctor 's shop , friend ; you are in the house of the Marchioness de la Reynerie . And . Andre Yes , I know ; but he I seek lives here . Bri . Briquet Who is it you mean ? And .

Oh , now I know whom you mean . He means Fabian . And . Andre Is that his name ? Bri . Briquet Yes , he 's a mulatto , an enfranchised slave , whom Mademoiselle de la Reynerie brought over from Bourbon , a curiosity . FABIAN appears at door , dressed in court suit , sword , &c.; And . Andre A curiosity , indeed ! Goodness and charity are , no doubt , a curiosity to you ; take care how you speak about him before me ! Fab . Fabian ( Comes down . ) Noble heart ! And .

Andre Well , quite well ; she sent me , though strong enough to come herself , but she was afraid  --  Fab . Fabian Afraid ! And . Andre This is how it is , Doctor ; we took it into our heads that , as everybody must live by their trade , a doctor ca n't give away his time to everybody for nothing ; so I worked double tides , and have brought you a fortnight 's wages ; it is n't much , but such as it is there it is . Fab . Fabian I accept your offer , good friend , but you must be my banker , and when you meet with a fellow-creature who needs it more than yourself , give it him . And . Andre From you ? Fab .

Pauline ( Calmly . ) Yes , Fabian , you can show it to my mother ; you can say to her , your daughter has changed her proud name of La Reynerie for that of Fabian ; your daughter has given herself to me . You can do all this , and I should forgive you ; but my mother would curse the memory of her child ! Fab .

Fabian , you do not thank my brother . St. L. St. Luce ( Smiles contemptuously . ) No , I remember ; ' t is , very natural ; he does not like to own himself so bad a prophet . Fabian has declared all marriage impossible for Mademoiselle de la Reynerie . Reyn . Marchioness de la Reynerie He ! St. L. St. Luce Yes , my dear aunt ; doubtless he was afraid of losing so profitable and unexpected a source of patronage and favour . ( Looks at Pauline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid our cousin 's protection has been thoughtless , and perhaps may be fatal to our Doctor . Reyn . Marchioness de la Reynerie How ? St. L. St. Luce No doubt , in Bourbon ' twill be necessary to doff these trappings of the gentleman , which appear rather strange ; here ' t is only laughed at , but in Bourbon ' t would be otherwise ; there this insolence would be chastised , particularly the sword , which sits but ill on a mulatto , who could not dare to raise it even to ward off the planter 's whip ! Paul . Pauline ( Without taking her eyes from Fabian , ) Ah ! Aur . Aurelia Brother , you are cruel ! St. L. St. Luce ( Haughtily . ) No , sister ; ' t is not I , but reason that says , every man in his station . Look !

Aurelia ( Coming between them . ) Brother , you are very cruel ; you have wounded his feelings . Paul . Pauline ( Rushing forward . ) I can endure this no longer ; ' t is cowardly  --  infamous !

Takes her hand ; as he is leading her off gives a look of scorn at Fabian , who is following him . Paul . Pauline No , no  --  stay , Fabian ! Reyn . Marchioness de la Reynerie Why do you detain him ? Paul . Pauline Because if you drive him forth , you must also drive me forth ; because if he goes , ' t is my duty to follow him . Reyn .

Fabian ( Coming between them . ) Be not in such haste to curse , lady ! your malediction would be impious , and could not reach to heaven . She , who now humbles herself , who weeps , is pure as the angels . True , she loved me , a poor slave  --  because I had risked my life to save her mother 's ; but I tell you , your blood runs in her veins .

Reyn . Marchioness de la Reynerie I will invoke the judge , the magistrate , the King himself ! Fab .

Briquet Sir , do n't talk in that way , or I shall be capable of setting fire to the Bastille . St. L. St. Luce Well , I wo n't prevent you ; but first see after the dinner . Bri . Briquet Yes , sir , I 'll get the table ready . Poor Runnette , how tired she must be . Exit , R. D. St. L. St. Luce Poor fellow ! he also is jealous . My suspicion is right . Pauline loved Fabian , and must have owned it to her mother ; for when I presented myself at the house I was informed he had departed for the Isle of Bourbon , and would never return to France . The Marchioness had left Paris , taking Pauline with her ; she was to become a nun ! By my faith , to be trifled with , deceived , and sacrificed , for a mulatto ! I know not where to hide my shame ; fortunately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my blushes in the Bastille ( Drums heard . ) What the devil 's the matter to-day ? Briquet ! Bri . Briquet ( Entering . ) Here I am , sir . St. L. St. Luce Why , they are beating to arms in the Bastille . Bri . Briquet Perhaps it is some fte-day . ( Heavy bell heard . ) Hark to the great bell of Notre Dame ! ( Both , look out of window . ) Enter JAILOR , L. D. , followed by Cook with the dinner . They place it on the table . Cook exits , L. D. , and Jailor locks it . St. L. St. Luce ( At window . ) Oh , here 's my dinner . ( To Jailor . ) What have you brought me ? Jai . Jailer ( Giving Briquet a basket . ) Everything we could get of the best , Chevalier , and , as usual , wine from the governor 's cellar . St. L. St. Luce You are a capital fellow , and full of little delicate attentions . ( Looks into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some ice , or I shall send a complaint to the King . Bri . Briquet Dine without ice ! impossible ! Jai . Jailer It is n't our fault , sir ; an express was sent off this morning to procure some , but it is n't come yet . The parks and public places are crowded with people , and every place is very difficult of access . St. L. St. Luce What 's their difficulty of movement to me ? Bri . Briquet Certainly not , we see not so mach room to move about . Exit R. , with basket . Jailer goes to the window . ) St. L. St. Luce They ought to have an ice-house in the place , but they have no consideration for state prisoners . By-the-bye , I sent a request to the ministers ; I have asked for a room where I can have better air . Can anything be more scandalous than to lodge a gentleman even with the moat , in the very celler , for I suppose there can be nothing underneath us ? Jai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing underneath . St. L. St. Luce What are you staring at , eh ? Jai . Jailer ( Leaving window quickly . ) Me , sir ! St. L. St. Luce ( At window . ) I am not mistaken  --  they are arranging cannon on the ramparts to the left . Jai . Jailer Possibly . St. L. St. Luce Can these plebeians have begun their system ? ( Drum . ) Yes , that 's the call to arms ! By heaven , if I were but free , I could wish for nothing better than the command of a company of musqueteers to sweep the path clean of these rascals ! Bri . Briquet ( At door . ) Dinner ready , sir . St. L. St. Luce Bravo ! let but the King give these gentlemen of Paris a good lesson , and the minister send them a few leaden sugar plums , I 'll forgive them both for making me dine like a beggar , without ice !

( The straw behind the pillar in dungeon , compartment R. , is seen to move , and Fabian , pale and haggard , raises himself , passes his hand over his forehead , and rises with difficulty ; takes the lamp , approaches window , looks out , listens , then retires discouraged ; puts lamp on stone . ) Fab . Fabian ( Shaking his head . ) Nothing ! still nothing ! ( Shivering . ) The damp has penetrated my very limbs ! I asked them for a little fresh straw , and they said it would cost too much ! Straw ! Your hatred and revenge are well obeyed here , proud Marchioness ! it would have been more merciful to let me die than bury me alive ! While I thought to purchase Pauline 's pardon by my exile , they threw me into this tomb ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Pauline , what has become of her ?

Kind heaven , preserve my reason till Andre 's return ! but why should I expect him ? may not what I fancy to be recollection , be but a dream ? for now I doubt everything ! my memory , my thoughts , my existence ; and yet , no , I remember well , yesterday I was sitting there  --  there , when a voice struck upon my ear , and that voice was Andre 's ; yes , Andre , who was at work in that gloomy gallery . I called , whispered my name , but he could not understand that the voice of a man proceeded from the bowels of the earth ! ( Listens again . ) Nothing ! nothing ! ( Falls overwhelmed . ) Andre will not come ! ( A stone falls at this moment through window , a letter attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . ) A letter from him ; yes , yes , it is ; thanks Andre ! thank heaven ! ( Weeps , at last he opens letter . ) ( At this moment , Jailor is seen descending staircase ; he opens trap , carries a loaf and jug of water . Fabian reads letter by lamp , while Jailor descends into L. division , below . ) Fab . Fabian ( Reads letter . ) " My dear benefactor , I know not if I shall be fortunate enough to see you ; all Paris is in arms , and they are firing on all who approach the Bastille ; but you shall have the letter , though they take my life . " My good Andre ! " I have been to the Marchioness 's house , and it was filled with mourning ; the hall was hung with black . ( He is almost choked with emotion . ) A priest was in prayer beside an escutcheoned coffin , covered with velvet . I asked who was dead in the house , and they answered  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter . Jai . Jailer ( Puts bread and water on stone . ) Here ! Fab . Fabian Thank you . Jai . Jailer Yesterday , while a man was at work in that gallery ( Pointing to window. ) , you approached that opening ; the sentinel saw the light from your lamp , and also your signs . ( Seizes lamp . ) You wo n't do it again ! Fab . Fabian What are you going to do ? Jai . Jailer Takes away the lamp ; ' t is the governor 's order . Fab . Fabian ( On his knees . ) O , no , no , not now , for mercy 's sake ! Jai . Jailer We know nothing here but obedience . Puts out lamp , exits , and locks door . Fab .

SCENE I.  --  An immense Gothic Apartment in the old Castle of Resadeuc , in Bretagne ; at the back a high and vast fire-place ; L. of fire-place , a large window , opening on a balcony ; R. of fire-place , a gallery , which is lighted by two painted windows ; doors R. and L. 2 E. , by side of which hang portraits of the Marquis and Marchioness de la Reynerie , that of the Marchioness R. ; L. , a small table with writing materials , beside it an arm-chair ; R. , a sofa ; at back , by fire  --  place , a Gothic stool . BRIQUET watching at window , ST . LUCE standing by fire-place ; AURELIA and PAULINE seated , warming themselves . St. L.

( Through open window snow is seen falling . ) If you will allow me , sir , I 'll close the window . ( Shuts it . ) Oh , dear ! what a precious year is the year 1793 ! St. L. St. Luce Go , hasten to the fisherman who promised to let me have his boat to cross to Normonliere . Once at sea , either by his own will or by force , he shall take us to England . My sister and my cousin Pauline will not be safe until then . Quick ! quick ! Bri . Briquet I 'm gone , sir . Exit . Aur . Aurelia ( Rising . ) Why take us from this asylum , which the devotion of our tenantry has hitherto rendered so secure . Paul . Pauline ( Rising . ) My dear friends , why did you expose yourselves for me ? why did you not leave me to die ? Aur . Aurelia Pauline , we may await death in a cell or at the foot of the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult from an enraged mob  --  to die by the hand of the executioner  --  O , ' t is too dreadful to think of ! Paul . Pauline Those tortures would be but momentary aud my life is one continued agony  --  you know that my dying mother never forgave poor Fabian , who suddenly disappeared , since when we could never learn if he still lived or had ceased to suffer . St. L. St. Luce When my sister confided your secret to me , I did all in my power to discover him ; I wrote to Bourbon , but none had seen or heard of him ; the enraged people disbelieve your marriage , and consider Fabian was sacrificed through your connivance . Aur . Aurelia O , could the late Marchioness see death thus hovering around you , she would call on Fabian to preserve her child ; for the proof of the marriage , which is in his possession would now save her life ! St. L. St. Luce Yes , that certificate , signed by the Abb L'Audrey , who performed the ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briquet I could not find the fisherman , sir ; but I have brought his brother , who knew all about it . St. L. St. Luce ( To Aurelia . ) Till I have tested this man 's fidelity , it would be imprudent to let him see our cousin . Aur . Aurelia ( Pointing to door . ) We will wait in the library . Come , Pauline . St L. Bring the man in . Exit Briquet . Paul . Pauline ( Looking at portrait . ) Mother , mother ! why should we separate again ? Here , at the feet of this dear but dreadful image , I would be content to die . Exit with Aurelia , R. D. Enter BRIQUET with ANDRE ; he points to ST . LUCE . Bri . Briquet There is the gentleman .

St. Luce Discret , and silent . And . Andre Poor fellow , he never speaks to anyone never remembers anyone ! His complaint is all in his brain , and in his heart  --  so , at least , the doctor says ; but his arms are stiff and strong , and the sea breeze does him good . He often spends whole days in the boat , and loves to be rocked by the waves in the clear sunshine ; it brings his own country to his recollection . He is very wretched , and I have often heard him mention the names of those who have caused all his sorrows . Then at times he weeps over , and hides again in his bosom , a time-worn discoloured paper , which he treasures as a precious relic . St. L. St. Luce ( Busy with papers , and scarce hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be answerable for this man ? And . Andre As for myself , sir . St. L. St. Luce ( Putting papers in pocket . ) ' T is well : have you brought him with you ? And . Andre Yes , sir ; he was delighted when he saw me prepare the boat , and I told him we were going for a sail as soon as the tide served . St. L. St. Luce Where is he ? And . Andre Sitting yonder , under the chestnut tree . St. L. St. Luce Now I 'll give you the sum agreed for by your brother . And . Andre I am at your service , sir . St. L. St. Luce Follow me , then .

Andre Yes , and prove my accusation ; I had the jailor 's book in my hand , from which I tore a leaf , and there read these words following after my friend 's name : " At the request of the family of De Reynerie this man is to be forgotten .

Andre Yes , look at him ; see what the Bastille has done for him . All . The Bastille . Paul . Pauline ( Looking at portrait . ) O , mother , mother . And .

When I brought him away they wanted to put him in the madhouse ; but then he would but have exchanged his prison ; so I took him , and I have shared my crust with him ever since . Paul . Pauline Did you do this ? ( Takes his hand . ) O , may heaven bless you for it . If riches are still left to us , all shall be yours .

Fabian , do you hear those shouts ; to-day , as in Bourbon , the tempest surrounds us , but much more terrible than the ocean . It is a dreadful mob , thirsting for human blood .
