txt THE government of these United States has been called an experiment . There wai* certainly some novelty , and much boldness in the enterprise . Ancient republics had been overturned , and systems of a widely different character had been built upon theiy ruins . Little encou*ragement was found for the attempt in previous examples or existing models . The particular effort has been denounced for its rashness , scorned for its anticipated failure , and applauded , pitied , or condemned according to the temper of the foreign inquirer , for having thrown discredit upon a series of attempts to maintain free institutions , of which it is supposed that this xviii be the last . Should these predictions be verified , and these reproaches be confirmed , the result will perhaps be owing , not so much to a want of merit in the thing itself , as to a deficiency in the means supplied for fair experiment .

They may want some subordinate but indispensable requisites for prosperous self-government , while they are in possession of all the rest , and thus may practically fail in accomplishing ends which their main design and general arrangements are calculated to fulfil . They who expect that nations may be made happy , in an Utopian sense , either by a particular form of government , or by the mode in which it is administered-in other words , that human nature becomes perfect by a prudent modification or faithful execution of a body of laws , or by both combined-will surely be disappointed . Not less so will be those who believe that any plan of national polity can be wise or just that would exclude from its composition ingredients , which universal experience has proved to be necessary .

Now , it may well be that this superadded something is occasionally , and for a season dispensed with ; or , at least , that the actual use of it is deferred , without positive suffering on the one hand , and without proving it to be immaterial on the other . Analogy here , too , is not wanting to our bodily condition . An infant 's wants may be entirely satisfied by sleep and food . Maturity and manhood can not be nourished with the milk of babes .

A ring at the nose of an Indian warrior presents to our sophisticated views , no substantial purpose , and it is probably in his rude judgment decorative merely .

The uses of a National Institute , if a distinction may be drawn , are far more important and striking than its ornamental qualities , numerous as the latter may be . It is calculated to fill the vacuum , otherwise incident to a confederated republic , which wants the usual facilities in its frame of government , which other national sovereignties possess , for the encouragement and promotion of science and the arts . It was a happy thought *f the framers of the Constitution to provide for setting apart for exclusive Federal Legislation , a portion however small , of the vast territory embraced within the limits of the Union . While responsibility was withdrawn from each particular State to a certain extent , and jealousy among the States would be confined to generous emulation , if applied to objects belonging to them as such , the general government would assume the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignties equally supreme . Most of the objects of Federal supremacy are compatible with the domestic supremacy of each individual commonwealth . Each may exercise its allotted powers in harmony with the other . They are of a character so definite as to be in little danger of clashing . But exclusive jurisdiction exists in the general government in one small spot : and the States which everywhere else have cautiously reserved to themselves , by omitting to concede a long catalogue of attributes , with all the developments which time and subsequent events might unfold , have , in that one spot conceded all that could be taken without enumeration or reserve . Unless Federal authority can supply the wants and necessities of an intelligent people thus confided to its especial care , it is obvious that their condition must be in all respects deplorable , and the selected position of a nation 's happiest and proudest exertions becomes a barren and a blighted waste . If it can , the effect is not limited to the narrow space allotted as a seat of government . The good seed planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every corner of the land . Exercising jurisdiction only in the district of Columbia ; looking to an establishment whose roots are planted immovably there , the general government will not infringe a hair 's breadth upon reserved rights , which will be sacredly and literally respected and observed . We close this preliminary matter with a reference to one or two not inappropriate illustrations of the advantage of government protection towards objects of the nature we are contemplating , and of the beneficent ends which they are competent to accomplish . In the year 1529 , when Florence was taken , and the infuriated soldiers entered the monastery of the Salvi , they were so struck with the picture of the Last Supper , by Andrea del Sarto , that they felt an indescribable awe , and retired without committing any violence . An inaugural address of Professor Lieber , delivered at the college of South Carolina , contains a relation of the following circumstance , which he styles a precious gem to the student of history " When the city of Leyden , in common with all the Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblest struggle for liberty on record , the great and good William of Orange offered her immunity from taxes a s e might recover from her bitter sufferings , and be rewarded for the important services which she had rendered to the sacred cause . Leyden , however , declined the offer , and asked for nothing but the privilege of erecting a University within her walls , as the best reward for more than human endurance and perseverance . " An Institution of a national character for the promotion of education , science and the arts , was a favorite object of the patriotism of Gen. Washington . His sentiments , and the frequent and recorded expression of them , were founded not merely in a regret at seeing the youth of these United States sent to foreign countries for education , whereby they contract " too frequently , not only habits of dissipation and extravagance , but principles unfriendly to republican government and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind . " It was his " ardent wish to see a plan devised on a liberal scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parts of this rising empire , thereby to do away local attachments and State prejudices . " His view extended to education in a central position in all the branches of polite literature , in the arts and sciences , to the formation of friendships in juvenile years , to a freedom from local prejudices and habitual jealon // s*es , which , when carried to excess , he regarded as never-failing sources of disquietude to the public mind , and pregnant with mischievous consequences to the country . " The National Institution , " as appears by the introductory remarks of the first " Bulletin , " " was organized at the seat of Government on the 15th May , 184t1L " Its objects , according to the same paper , " are to promote science and the useful arts , and to establish a National Museum of Natural History , " &amp;c. &amp;c . With such declared designs its importance can readily be perceived . We shall perform no unacceptable service in tracing briefly its course from this beginning-in pointing out some of the individuals who have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessionsand in accounting , if we can , for the strange and startling fact that with every promise and prospect of utility , more than five years have elapsed without the attainment of an existence sufficiently firm to defy apprehensions of a want of permanency , and without a fair fulfilment of all the reasonable expectations of its friends . It was an auspicious opening that found associated with itself indivi uals of abilities , activity , public spirit and liberality . While the effort was purely private-that is , sustained by no government assistance , promise or preliminary movement of any kind-it contemplated from an early moment countenance from the national councils , and furtherance from the national funds . The birthplace was one created by the government . lts inhabitants , one and all , were either engaged in public duties , or attracted to a residence on the spot by objects and motives connected with public persons or public affairs . The first director was the Secretary of War ; a gentleman who derived the least important share of his qualifications from his connection with the cabinet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in liberal education , cultivated taste and extensive foreign travel . Other members of the Administration brought to the design large contributions of official influence and personal merit , while officers of the army and navy , and others , of scientific habits and general accomplishments gave cheerful and efficient support to the undertaking . Departments were soon organized . These were so subdivided as to embrace the various branches of science and the arts , in their most recent developments , and they were filled with a view to the utmost energy in each . They consisted of departmentsof geology and mineralogy- of chemistry - of the application of science to the arts-of literature and the fine arts-of natural history of agriculture-of astronomy-of American history and antiquities-and of geography and natural philosophy . To these was afterwards added , at the suggestion of Mr. Pickering , of Boston* a " department of natural and political sciences . " These departments are susceptible of an expansiveness that may embrace the whole world of science , that , according to the antithesis of an Irish orator , may discover the cause of blight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the nine Muses , which have continued , with occasional local assistance , to exercise dominion over knowledge in all its diversity and details , though they have long since ceased to dwell upon Parnassus , or to quaff the limpid waters of Helicon , the nine departments of the " National Institution " will probably meet all the wants of this portion of the scientific world for at least a century . At an early meeting they were officially requested to collect , without delay , " all reports made by committees of Congress , and by Executive officers of the government , illustrating the geography , history , geology , manufactures , commerce , &amp;c. , of the United States . " This was a measure of obvious propriety . It was one of no less importance . Stores of information are contained in these reports , not derived essentially , or even chiefly , from the persons by whom they are immediately made , but from the authentic materials which compose the subjects , and the statistical , political and even financial investigations by which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination was made by Professor Walter R. Johnson and Dr. King , under the direction of the Navy Department , of the various coals which abound in the country . The analysis was pushed probably to the utmost limits which labor and abilities , directed by profound and accurate science , could attain . Mere individual researches could not easily have been carried so far . A voluminous report embodies the result , and it has been printed by order of Congress . If this valuable document partake of the fate of many of a similar charac 1845.1 237 // qwq his distress , and having learned the alarm of the judges she gave such advice as was calculated to relieve them from their embarrassment , and which they did not hesitate to adopt as soon as they were informed of it by the happy husband . At the appointed time the Emperor appeared at the audience . Lie remarked with surprise that the Members of the Council were not dressed in red , black and blue gowns , according to their respective callings as judges , clergymen and men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared , and the whole council was dressed in black . The surprise of the Emperor was great . He was struck with what was a violation of every usage , and perhaps an insult to his greatness . " What is the meaning of this costume ? " exclaimed he , in anger . " Sire , " answered the President , " your parliament has gone into mourning , because the law , which is stronger than their sovereign himself , obliges them this day to condemn him . " The reply satisfied the monarch . He perceived at once the equity of his judges , and their respect for him . He desired to know who had suggested the idea to the Council , engaging beforehand to confer honors upon the person . When he was informed that it was a woman , he did not retract his promise . f-fe ordered that she should thenceforth have a seat in the " Grand Conseil , " and that her opinion should always be first called for . From that time , says the tradition , this custom has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fifth . A female has at all times been among the number of the Counselors , and it is often remarked that the more ingenious decisions are pronounced by the ju ( lge in petticoats . We are somewhat surprised as gallant critics at not finding the names of ladies in the list of honorary members of the National fastitute . In the beginning of the year 1841 , a public discourse was pronounced before the association by Mr. Poinsett . He chose for his theme " the objects and importance of the National Institution for the promotion of science . " Much credit is due to the speaker for his wellconceived arguments and happy illustrations . They could not fail to give impulse and energy to exertions yet in their infancy ; to demonstrate the natural harmony between literature and the fine arts , and the tendency of them not only to improve and refine mankind , but espe daily to flourish where free institutions prevail , and where liberty loves to dwell , and effectually to tranquilize any apprehensions that a doubtful power would be exercised by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of the United States . " There can be no doubt , " says he , towards the close of his discourse , " that a National Institution , such as we contemplate , having at its command an observatory , a museum , containing collections of all the productions of nature , a botanic and zoological garden , and the necessary apparatus for illustrating every branch of physical science , would attract together men of learning and students from every part of our country ; would open new avenues of intelligence throughout the whole of its vast extent ; and would contribute largely to disseminate among the people the truths of nature and the lights of science . " It is to be regretted that the retirement of Mr. Poinsett from public life should have dissolved his personal as well as official connection with the association . It was happily begun , and an equal degree of cordiality could scarcely be expected in his successors in office who did not like himself feel the pride and attachment of a founder . At the head of the list of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the name of Mr. Adams , Lhe venerable Ex-President ; and it is agreeable to perceive that with his untiring zeal for the public service , and his active engagement in the councils of the country , he continues by every practical exertion to manifest his love for science . Mr. Adams is still an efficient officer of the National Institute . Among those who exhibited an useful interest in the scheme , was the late venerable Peter S. Dupon9eau , for many years President of the American Philosophical Society . With an unsurpassed zest for study , a ready pen , and a prompt spirit , Mr. Dupon9eau possessed extensive learning , and had pursued especially a course of philological inquiry , of great variety and extent . His residence being at Philadelphia , he could not immediately share in the personal deliberations of the founders ; but his friendly advice was always communicated . He strongly recommended the occasional publicatioa of a printed Bulletin , to be disseminated through all the learned world , well observing that " fame , next to the con1845.1 239 // sciousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , and they love to see their names and their productions made known to the public . " Old age had at this time , and long before , made visible impressions upon the bodily frame of this learned octogenarian , but he did not cease to shed vivid flashes of intellectual light upon this and other objects of a kindred character , until the close of his long and valuable life . Of these " Biilletins of the Proceedings , " the first was issued in March , 1841 . If we may judge by the intelligence and zeal of individual exertions , or the cordial cooperation of those who , either at home or abroad , might be expected to contribute personal efforts to the design , seldom did a more auspicious dawn appear . A second Bulletin was issued , which embraced the proceedings from March , 1841 , to February , 1842 . They are full of interest . Some changes were announced in the plan of organization , without any departure from the original well-conceived and patriotic design . A promotion of science was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great paths of philosophical inquiry which had been marked out , and were to be , with no hesitating step , thoroughly explored . At a stated meeting , March 8th , 1841 , certain officers required by the " amended constitution " were elected , and Mr. Poinsett was chosen President . A few sentences pronounced by him in accepting the place , contain sentiments of much general value , and develop and confirm one great leading characteristic of the Institution . In pledging his efforts to promote its objects and interests , he lays down the golden maxim , " that the distinction attached to office is in proportion to the means it affords to serve our country . " lie proceeds to declare the peculiar and unprecedentedly diffusive nature of the Institution , prononuclag it to be the first exl ) eriment of a popular institution of science , one intended for the benefit of the people , in the administration of which it is right that they should take part . This circumstance is entitled to the deepest consideration . Establishments more or less analogous to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government which sustains them . Here everything is connected directly with the people . They framed the constitution . They appoint directly , or through the medium of their immediate agents , every officer of the government . They reserve checks and balances in their own hands , which not only control the operations of things as they are , but provide and perpetuate means of changing the fundamental law itself , with all the extirpating and vivifying energy of a revolution , and with none of its ' violence . A scientific institution , established and sustained in such an atmosphere , would naturally partake of the nature of the elements that surround it . It opens wide its doors to universal membership . No especial title is derived from position , wealth , or even mental attainments . All who appreciate the value of science , and desire to enrol their names in a long catalogue of its votaries , enjoy an opportunity to contribute to its diffusive usefulness , with no other preliminary than a respectable character in whatever may be their station . Scientific details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , correspondence , are duties confided to the care of scientific men . Happily such men are found willing and able to discharge them . The fruits of their exertions are forbidden to none . A just degree of dependence upon the government , or more properly of official connection with it , is provided for in the ex-officio condition as directors of the different members of the Cabinet , while an equal numbcr of directors elected by the lnstitution , secures an active devotion of appropriate experience and abilities and permanent attention , without accumulating labor upon those already burdened with public occupations , and without exposure to the changes which are incident to mere official residence . As the government is substantially the owner of the various objects which are to form the treasures of the association , it matters little whether its collections are in terms granted to the directors , or merely placed in permanent deposit , with all the incidents of such an arrangement in their care . If access , control , disposition and use , be made to depend on responsible and definite judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in absolute proprietary right . At a meeting on the 14th June , 1841 , a vote of thanks to the then Secretary of War , was passed for the valuable and interesting deposit of Indian portraits and curiosities , and a copy was requested , and the request promptly acceded to , of the lithographic plates and historical sketches connected with the 240 Sept. , // 1845 . National Institute . portraits . The " effects , books and papers , " of " the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences , " an association some years before formed at Washington , the charter of which expired on the 20th of May , 1838 , were transferred to the cabinet of this new and more comprehensive society . By an arrangement with the Secretary of State , the collections of the National Jnstitution were transferred to the hall of the new Patent-Office , together with objects of science sent home by the United States Exploring Expedition . Mr. F. Castleneau , recently appointed Consul for Lima , placed in the hands of the directors a complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , He accompanied his liberal offer with the remark that " the Garden of Plants of Paris , the greatest known collection of specimens of natural history , began with means in all regards far belo wthosepossessed by our Institution . " In the beginning of the year 1842 , an intercourse was opened which has been already productive of rich results , and may in the future confer immense advantages . Dr. Linn , of the United States Senate , sent to the School of Mines , of Paris , a specimen of oxide of iron taken from the iron mountain of Missouri . It was done at the request of Mr. Alexandre Vattemare , of that city , who had not a great while before visited Washington , and communicated to Dr. Linn , and through him to the " National Institution , " the letter of Mons. Dufresnoy , " Chief Engineer and Director of the Royal School of Mines . " It is declared to be the ornament of their collections . In the name of the Council of the School he returns thanks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-. withstanding its almost gigantic dimensions , ( sixty-six millimetres in diameter , ) complete in all its parts . Besides its interest in a mineralogical point of view , he adds that the present of Mr. Linn is highly esteemed by them , because it commences the system of exchange which Mr. Vattemare had sought to establish between all the nations of the new and the old continents , and which he says alone can secure the completion of their collections . From the period when this correspondence took place , Mr. Yattemare seems to have devoted his intelligent and active mind to this object . Lie has been the means of procuring and forwarding to Washington a perpetual supply of splendid and valuable productions . His countrymen are always on the march of improvement in the various departments of the elegant arts . Every description of magnificent engraving has been communicated . Box after box of books has come from him in unmeasured profusion . it would be endless to recapitulate the objects of his friendly contribution . They are referred to emphatically because they have especially served to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing can be completely deserving of the name of a collection . That Mr. Yattemare does not weary in his efforts needed no new proof . As lately as the 9th of June , 1845 , he announces that he has received for the National institute , from M. Le Brun , Peer of France , Director of the Royal Printing-office , &amp;c. , the complete collection of the Journal des Savans , from 1816 to 1845 , twentynine quarto volumes , bound . " This most interesting and valuable collection , " he says , " was last year granted to the National Institute at the request of M. Le Brun , by the Minister of Justice , &amp;c . M. Le Brun has also sent to me a copy of his works , to be presented to the Institute as a token of his friendship and good wishes . From the War Department of France a complete collection of all the documents and works , illustrated with a great number of maps , &amp;c. , of the French possessions in North Africa , including the neighboring States , viz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published by order and under the superintendence of the Minister of War-sixteen volumes , folio , quarto , and octavo . From the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce , twenty-five works on Agriculture and Commerce . From the Minister of the Interior , a beautiful collection of bronze medals , commemorative of national events , from 1830 to 1844 inclusive . From M. Flouzens , Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of Sciences , Member of the Acadeinie Fran*aise , &amp;c. , his last two works . From M. M. Barre and Danton , sculptors , two beautiful little statues , one of the late Duc d'Orleans , the other of Miss Adelaide Kemble as Norma . From M. Picot , Member of the Academy of Fine Arts , &amp;c. , two fine engravings , taken from two of his pictures . From the Soci6t6 Seri*icole , ( founded in 1838 , for the encouragement and promotion of silk manufacturing in France , ) the complete collection of its annals from its foundation to the present year-nine volumes , octavo . " " All the above works , with many others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my office , that I can scarcely move about in it , and this number is daily increasing . " One is impressed with mingled feelings of pleasure and mortification at reading this letter , for while it thus exhibits a prolific interest in the Institute , it unfolds in the following paragraph how little is the encouragement or gratitude for his substantial friendship and zeal : " It is a matter of great distress to me not to have it in my power to defray all the expenses of packing , of custom-house dues , commissions , and transportation from Paris to Washington , but I really can not do it . Recollect that since 1839 to the present time , I have devoted all my time , industry and fortune , to the exclusive object of establishing an intellectual union between Europe and America ; that Ihave never receit'ed the slightest pecuniary assistance from my own country ; and that the first and only encoura , ement of that character ever vouchsafed to me was the amount of two hundred dollars , so generously subscribed last year by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty dollars ( out of three hundred ) voted by the State of Maine . For the maintenance of an agency in Paris for national literary interchanges , the State of Massachusetts , stimulated by an enlightened and patriotic spirit , voted , during the last session of its Legislature , a like most generous allocation . Were all her sister States to follow so noble an example , by voting a small stun , according to their population and their intellectual wants , a fund might easily be established , amply sufficient to cover all the expenses incurred in maintaining an United States scientific and literary agency in Paris , the benefits of which would be incalculable . " On this vital point ( of exchanges ) a report was made in February , 1842 , by Mr. Markoe , the accomplished and indefatigable Corresponding Secretary . It exhibits the verygreat importance of them , as entering essentially into the plan of every society constituted like this and having like objects in view , and it shows that no occasion has been omitted to acquaint societies and individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of general exchanges would be entered upon as soon as a plan should be matured . Under that assurance , and independently of it also , ( it is added ) valuable collections of various kinds have already been received , which render it incumbent on the directors to redeem the pledge that has been given . For this object the members are informed that they have already in hands the most abundant maSept. , terials , which were increasing , and would continue to increase every day . On the 27th of July , 1842 , an act of Congress was passed , whereby the association was incorporated by the name of " The National Institute for the Promotion of Science . " This charter is a meager one . It enables the corporation to hold property , with a proviso that money , goods , &amp;c. , he laid out and disposed of for its use and benefit , according to the intention of the dQnors or devisees . It denies power to deal or trade in the manner of a bank ; it inflicts full liability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and makes all its property at the time of dissolution or expiration the property of the united States . Were this a mere money-making establishment , which by way of equivalent for twenty years ' gains , surrendered itself , body ( and soul , too , if it were not " crowner's-quest " law that it has no soul , ) and goods , into the hands of the government , the evens handed justice of the ac* of Congress might be discernible to a microscopic eye . As the case really is , there is no justice about it . Public-spirited individuals , without reward , assume the labor and responsibility of active service to the Republic , in a department where nothing but voluntary service of a valuable kind is likely to be had , and they are permitted not only , in homely phrase , to have their labor for their pains , but in greater liberality are vouchsafed the privilege of yielding up their all to the tender mercies of a government , which , for fifty years , has done nothing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these remarks to suggest that a residuary proprietorship in the great corporation which makes laws is an unwise arrangement in itself . On the contrary , there are good reasons for making the nation the owner in prospect , and even in present right , of what so peculiarly becomes it to possess . All that can be done to give security and permanence to the invaluable productions of a world of genius , may thus be done usefully and even creditably to all concerned . individual zeal may wear out or tire . Care and vigilance may cease with the health and abilities of the individuals who practice them . Safety is found in the protection of an owner not liable to these vicissitudes . The care of a nation , like that of Providence , as it has the power , so it may exercise the disposition to cherish as well as to preserve ; it may give warmth and vigor to the objects of // its favor , and not coldly receive them into a reluctant superintendence , that they may languish in profitless imbecility . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress has brought forth more genial influence from this high quarter , we shall endeavor presently to show . It is worthy of remark that circulars were addressed , early in 1841 , by the Corresponding Secretary , which were approved by the then Directors of the Institute , the Secretaries of War and the Navy , to no less than one hundred and nine foreign societies and institutions . These circulars announced the establishment of the National Institution , enclosed the constitution , and invited correspondence . Pledges were thus given to twentysix establishments in London , besides four in other parts of England , ( viz. , Birmingham , Liverpool , and Manchester , ) to ten in Russia , eight in Paris , seven in Edinburgh , six in Berlin , nine in other parts of Prussia and Germany , nine in Copenhagen , four in Dublin , seven in Holland , seven in Madrid , four in Brussels , four in Sweden , three in Italy , and one in Greece . A third " Bulletin " was issued in the spring of the present year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February , 1845 . One can not open the volume without being struck with the vast accumulations of the society . Every variety of appropriate contribution appears to have been made in rich and ceaseless liberality . If arguments were wanting in favor of such an establishment , they would be found in countless legions in this interesting record . It displays the tendency of the scientific race to encourage and contribute to the stores of a great national establishment , where they may be nccessible to the irivestigations of the whole world of which they are the citizens , and in vast accumulation and secure deposit , may minister to the laudable pride , the growing curiosity , and the appetite for knowledge of mankind . Books are presented to an extent which must already compose a considerable library . It is not our purpose to go through a recapitulation of these or of any other of the marks of considerate and appropriate liberality , which abound in the minutes of the monthly or more frequent meetings . As a specimen , however , we may refer to one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific , from Georgetown College , according to the Rev. Mr. Ryder 's note to the Curator , " as a small pledge of the interest we all take in the advancement and success of so truly national an institution . " Take at random a few of the minutes of contributions which , besides possessing much intrinsic value , derive interest from the variety of places from which they come , and the peculiar local opportunities to collect them , which have been enjoyed by the public-spirited contributors . Egyptian curiosities , including twelve ancient porcelain idols , from the tombs of Memphis ; mummied crocodile , and other animals , &amp;c. ; authentic verifications of natural history , and the state of the arts in that ancient seat of civilization , " from George R. Gliddon , corresponding member , late U. S. Consul for Cairo , Egypt . " Scientific works and specimens from Charles Cramer , Secretary ( pro tem. ) of the lmperial Mineralogical Society of St. Petersburg , and from Professor Fischer , Director of the Imperial Botanic Garden at St. Petersburg . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of his government , a copy of the Flora Fluminensis , published by that government , in eleven folio volumes and index . Gold and silver ores , " from John Parrott , U. S. Consul , Mazatlan , Mexico . " From Dominico Bartolini , Vice Consul at Civita Yecchia , a collection of Etruscan , Greek and Egyptian vases , &amp;c. , of great value . A model in terra cotta , of a Grecian temple at Girgenti , from Coin . Nicolson , U. S. Navy . We might fill a volume if we weie to multiply these extracts . The object is to show , by a few tokens , how various are the sources and sorts of contributions derived from distant liberality , omitting the outpourings of domestic attachment , which it would be endless to enumerate and invidious to select . These are tokens both of wealth and want . In themselves inestimable , the richest possessions may be a burden , if the wherewithal to display , to preserve and use them , be deficient . Such at present appears too plainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit exists , where safety alone , without other results , can be reached . A very imposing , and , as may be supposed , useful effort , was made by the Institute in the spring of 1844. it consisted of a geneial invitation , and a wide acceptance of it , of members and men of science , associations , public bodies , and every class of individuals who might // take an interest in the object , to a meeting at Washington . A large number attended . A general committee of arrangements was appointed . " The library hall of the Treasury Department was thrown open for the use of the Institute during the convention , and the use of the large Presbyterian Church in 4* street , and of the Unitarian Church , was granted for the purpose of the sessions . The hall of the library contained a variety of objects of interest , and was used during the whole period as a place of reunion and of rendezvous . The press announced from day to day the order of l ) roceedings . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity with public notices , at 10 o'clock , and accompanied by a band of music , moved in procession to the church . " These particulars we obtain from the history of the proceedings included in the " Third Bulletin . " No less than ten meetings appear to have been held from the first to the tenth of the month . At each meeting , three , four or five scientific papers were read by their authors , and many other articles from the pen of persons not personally in attendance , were submitted . On the several mornings the proceedings were opened with prayer , and , from the earliest moment to the close of the last day , a deep interest was manifested by a numerous , intelligent and attentive auditory of both sexes . A brief review of the public and general exercises of the first meeting , may serve farther to illustrate the character of the institution , its connection with the government , and the official and personal consideration which it has not failed to receive . After a highly appropriate and well composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a brief " opening address " was pronounced by the President of the United States , who is ex-officio " Patron of the National Institute , " and in that capacity presided over the deliberations of the day . He adverted to the fact of this being the first general meeting of scientific men from all parts of the Union which had ever been held at the seat of government ; that a brotherhood was established of men of science ; that an auspicious commencement had now arisen from the exertions of a few individuals ; and what , he urged , could the government better do for the " increase and diffusion of knowledge among men , " than by patronizing and sustaining this magnificent undertaking ? Sept. , The " introductory address " was then delivered by Mr. Walker , of Mississippi , " Director of the National Institute . " With commendable judgment the speaker determined to omit in his discourse " the whole range of hyperphysical knowledge , " and to confine his inquiries to the " various improvements and discoveries made by our countrymen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proceeds , " of our achievements , an impartial examination will show that our countrymen have greatly contributed to the modern improvements and discoveries in the various departments of the inductive sciences . " Various parts of fundamental knowledge are then passed in review , with the names of those who have devoted their active and penetrating minds successfully to the pursuit of them ; and the claims of our countrymen to useful original invention and substantial practical improvement and adaptation to the purposes of life , are vindicated with a straightforwardness , cordiality and force , which are highly creditable to the author 's intelligence and patriotism . Beginning with electricity , and attracting a few vivid sparks from the genius and intrepidity of the philosopher who devoted his long and useful life to the cause of science and his country , he pays a merited tribute to others who have soared into the mysteries of this cloud.envelopedagency .

What a catalogue is here ! and how decisive is the evidence of the active , intelligent and productive employment of our countrymen in these rich and diversified regions ! Mr. Walker may rest assured that he has presented proofs " that they have not failed to contribute their full proportion to the inductive sciences . " We quote with pleasure the following concluding passages : " Among the most valuable results of inductive science , is the strong additional evidence obtained in favor of the great and glorious truths of the Christian religion . The fabulous zodiac , which carried back the observations of astronomers to a period beyond the Mosaic account of the creation of man , has disappeared before the light of modern astronomy . The inyriads of bones of giant animals , which could only have lived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperate climate , now scattered in profusion in Northern Siberia , along the verge of the arctic circle , attest the effects and reality of a general deluge . The pyramids of Egypt , which had remained dumb for thousands of years , have been made to speak ; and so far as their hieroglyphics have found a voice , it proclaims many of the facts recorded in the sacred history . While the advance of science has contributed so much to our happiness and comfort here , has it no connection with our eternal destiny ? Is all our knowledge buried in the grave ? and does the untutored savage start in the next world at the same point with Sir Isaac Newton , in the race toward the goal of infinite knowledge-that point , toward which , like the asymptotes of the hyperbolic curve , we shall forever approximate but never attain ? Does knowledge die with the physical frame ; or does it constitute a part of that soul whose phenomena after death we can no longer observe , but which , as an essence of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And now , having detained you too long in this most imperfect sketch of some of the improvements and discoveries of our countrymen in physics , lct me close by declaring , that if the men of science of the Union will come forward and unite with the people in sustaining and advancing the National Institute , they will make it worthy of the greatest and freest nation of the world , and contribute much towards placing our own beloved country as far above all others on the roll of knowledge as it now transcends all its contemporaries and predecessors in a government administered by and for the benefit of the whole people . " Mr. Adams , who presided over the exercises of the ninth meeting , on taking the chair , pronounced a few sentences , expressive of his warm interest in the fortunes of the Institute , and his heartfelt satisfaction at the prosperity which , by the untiring exertions and fervid zeal of its executive officers , it has attained . He yields his testimony to its deserving the fostering care and liberal patronage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could anticipate no happier close to his public life , than to contribute , by his voice and by his vote , to record the sanction of the nation 's munilicence to sustain the National Institute , devoted to the cause of science . Among the few papers emanating from the meeting of April , 1844 , which are published with the " Bulletin , " we find one from Mr. Rush , on the subject of the " Smithsonian Bequest . " It seems by the " notice " prefixed to these few papers , that " it was originally intended to publish the proceedings in extenso , but it was discovered at an early period that this would be both inexpedient and impracticable . Some of the papers were not exactly adapted for publication . Some had already been made public , though not printed . Others have been printed . Several were withdrawn , while others were never submitted for publication by their authors ; and a few would have required costly illustrations . For these and other reasons , the committee , of which Mr. Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small number of the papers should be selected to be printed . Another consideration of an imperative nature compelled the Institute to adopt this course , viz. : the want of funds sufficient to enable it to publish the proceedings more at large . This is the chief reason why the whole work ( the third Bulletin and the proceedings of April ) has been so condensed as to deprive it of much of that attractiveness // and fullness which the copious and interesting materials on hand would have imparted to it . " Mr. Rush , having been brought at one time into close and important relations with the " Smithsonian Bequest , " felt naturally a desire that it should be promptly applied , not only because as long as the application of it is delayed , " the cause of science and letters suffers in its whole extent , " but , as he very properly adds , because " the United Statesare liable to the charge of not performing a duty . " We propose to avail ourselves here of an opportunity to dwell somewhat particularly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief that the affair , although much talked of , is little understood-that it is really curious  --  and more than all , it has within it a redeeming spirit that will , if properly invoked , give effect to the sanguine hopes of the friends of the National Institute , and dispel the clouds which have sometimes appeared to be gathering around it . On the 21st of July , 1835 , the attorneys of Messrs . Drummonds , ( bankers ) of Charing Cross , London , communicated to Mr. Vail , the United States Charg6 d'Affaires , a copy of the will of Mr. Smithson , with the information that on the death of the testator , an amicable suit was instituted in chancery by Mr. Hungerford , the legatee mentioned in the will , against the executors , and under that suit the assets were realized ; that they were very considerable , and that at the time of writing , there was standing in the name of the accountant-general of the court of chancery , on the trusts of the will , stock amounting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the income arising from this property ; hut news has just reached England , say the solicitors , that Mr. Hungerford has died abroad , leaving no child surviving him . The principal person mentioned in the will being thus accounted for , we give an entire copy of that instrument which is brief , and at the same time so characteristic that it could not be mutilated without doing it injury* " I , James Smithson , son of Hugh , first Duke of Northumberland , and Elizabeth , heiress of the Hungerfords of Audley , and niece of Charles the Proud , Duke of Somerset , now residing in Bentinek street , Cavendish square , do , this 23d day of October , 1826 , make this my last will and testament . bankers , Messrs .

I have at divers times lent sums of money to Henry Honor6 Juilly , formerly my servant , but now keeping the Hungerford Hotel , in the Rue Caumartin at Paris , and for which sums of money I have undated bills or bonds signed by him .

" JAMES SMITHsoN . " L. s . Mr. Vail having transmitted these documents to the State Department , a message was sent to Congress by the Pre*ident on the 17th December , 1835 , stating that the executive had no authority to take any steps for accepting the trust and obtaining the funds , and the papers were therefore communicated , with a view to such measures as Congress might deem necessary . The message was referred . to a select committee of the House of Representatives , who shortly afterwards ( January 19 , 1836 ) by their chairman , Mr. Adams , made a report . It is there declared that the Congress of the United States in their legislative capacity are alone competent to the acceptance of this bequest , and to the assumption and fulfilment of the high and honorable duties involved in the performance of the trust committed with it ; and that it is enjoined upon them by considerations of the most imperious and indispensable obligation . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testator , from the nature of the bequest , and from the character of the Trustee to whom this great and solemn charge has been confided . It states that the Percys and the Seymours , from whom the testator declares himself in the caption of the will to be a descendant in blood , are two of the most illustrious historical names of the British Islands . And nearly two centuries since , in 1660 , the ancestor of his own name , Hugh Smithson , immediately after the restoration of the royal family of the Stuarts , received from Charles the Second , as a reward for his eminent services to that house during the civil wars , the dignity of a Baronet of England , a dignity still held by the Dukes of Northumberland , as descendants from the same Hugh Smithson . The father of the testator by his marriage with the lady Elizabeth Seymour , who was descended by a female line from the ancient Percys , and by the subsequent creation of George the Third in 1766 , became the first Duke of Northumberland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was known in the history of our revolu. tionary war by the name of Lord Percy ; was present as a British officer at the sanguinary opening scene of our revolutionary war at Lexington , and at the battle of Bunker 's hill ; and was the bearer to the British government of the despatches from the Commander-in-chief of the royal forces , announcing the event of that memorable day ; and the present Duke of Northumberland , the testator 's nephew , was the Ambassador Extraordinary of Great Britain sent to assist at the Coronation of the late King of France , Charles the Tenth , a few months only before the date of this bequest from his relative to the United States of America . Such is the account given by the committee of the House of Representatives of the family of the testator . Of the character of his bounty it speaks with strong emphasis . " Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses which ever signalized the spirit of the age , or the comprehensive beneficence of the founder , none can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Should it be faithfully carried into effect with an earnestness and sagacity of application , with a steady perseverance of pursuit , proportioned to the means furnished by the will of the founder , and to the greatness and simplicity of his design , as by himself declared , " the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men , " it is no extravagance of anticipation to declare that his name will be hereafter enrolled among the eminent benefactors of mankind . " In the true spirit of this report , an act of Congress was passed July 1st , 1836 , " to authorize the President to assert and prosecute with effect , the claim of the United States to the legacy bequeathed to them by James Smithson , late of London deceased , to found at Washington , under the name of the Smithsonian Institution , an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men . " The President is authorised , by this act , to constitute and appoint an agent or agents , to assert and prosecute for and in behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other proper tribunal of England , their right to this important legacy . The funds which may be received , are to be applied in such manner as Congress may hereafter // direct , for the purpose of founding , and endowing at Washington , under the name of the Smithsonian Institution , an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men , to which application of the moneys and other funds , the faith of the United States was thereby pledged . Whatever might have been the character of the trust , before this solemn acceptance and pledge , there can he no doubt respecting it , from the moment this Bill became the Law of the Land . A contract was entered into of the gravest kind , that the trust should , and would he faithfully executed . Whatever it implies of action , or resolve , became as binding as if the compact had been subscribed with the blood of each individual member of the then and subsequently existing Congresses of the Nation , or as if a pledge had been given in the visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicited concurrence and decree of a foreign tribunal , the American people ,  --  every one of themsolemnly l ) romised and engaged in a form the most authentic , and in terms the most intelligible and clear that the establishment should be founded , and that it should bear a certain designated name , and no other . We blush to record the acknowledgment of one of that people , in profound humility and shame , that after the lapse of ample time and constant opportunity for full and literal conpliance , the promise and the engagement have been thus far violated . No delay or omission can be imputed to the energetic person who then filled the Executive chair . The act of Congress bears date July 1 , 1836 . Authority and instructions were given within ten days to Mr. Richard Rush , who was long and advantageously known both abroad and at home , as he had served for seven years in the capacity of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Great Britain , and for a shorter period in the arduous and responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 11th of July , 1836 , the agent of the United States , to assert and prosecute their claim to the legacy ; and fortified with a formal power of attorney or commission , and with an authenticated copy of the act of Congress , he proceeded upon his mission . The ability , promptness and fidelity , with which he discharged his duty , are a striking proof of the obligation which devolves upon the appointing power to select trustworthy public agents . An obligation too frequently neglected , and yet attended with little or no real difficulty . Let men , whose lives and previous conduct furnish pledges of their faithfulness , and let them alone , be employed in important public functions , and there will be little danger of either blunders or more iniquitous misdeeds . We remember that a gentleman went to England a few years ago , for the purpose of instituting and superintending a suit in chancery . On announcing to his friends in that country , the object of his visit , they told him how much they were gratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst them . Mr. Rush 's energy , and the just disposition of the high tribunal in which the cause of his constituents , the United States , was depending , prevented them from being the victims of any such delay . On the 5th of June , 1838 , he writes to the Secretary of State , that all the forms have been finally and fully completed , and that the accountant-general , as the proper officer of the Court of Chancery , had regularly traiisferred to him , In the consolidated three per cent , annuities , commonly called consols , ? 04,535 , lSs , 9d . In reduced three per cent . annuities , 12,000 . In Bank Stock , 10,100 . These sums , with the exception of five thousand and fifteen pounds in consols , which the court decreed to be reserved and set apart to answer an annuity payable to Madame Ia Batut , ( the mother of Henry James Jiungerford , ) the principal to revert to the United States on the death of the annuitant , and with the further exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountant-general , constituted the sum left by Mr. Smithson to the United States . The stock was well disposed of . By n communication from Mr. Woodhury , Secretary of the Treasury , to the President of 3d December , 1838 , it appears that the amount received in London , by the agent of the United States , under the decree of the Court of Chancery of England , was the gross sum of ? 106,490 ils . Od. , including the sum of // 1845 . IVafonal Institute . missions , insurance , &amp;c. to the sum of ? 104,960 8s. 3d. , which was brought into the United States in gold , and produced at the mint the sum of $508,318 46 . Upwards of half a million of dollars became applicable to this sublime object about seven years ago . The natural increase by way of interest to this time has made it beyond two hundred thousand more , and there stands waiting only a plan , a capital of between seven and eight hundred thousand dollars , " to found at Washington , under the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diffusion of knowledge among men . " At first view , one is inclined to regret that the testator was not more definite in the expression of his views . It would indeed have saved a world of conjecture and inconclusive argument , if he had declared the precise character of the " establishment " which he may have had in his mind . But it is most probable that he had no particular description of an " establishment " matured , or even faintly shadowed out . He looked to a distant country as the dwelling-place of his bounty , a country to which he was personally a stranger . His habits and reflections might have led him to contrive something congruous to those habits and reflections , and admirably adapted to the places and the people that surrounded them , but altogether inappropriate to the place and the people that were to be benefited . The whole bounty might have been sacrificed by too minute a prescription of details , and a corresponding want of flexibility in its practical application and arrangement . Washington was the capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not err in naming it as the site of a national establishment . Knowledge was , he knew , the source of power and virtue . He could inspire virtuous sentiments , and contribute to true greatness in no way more effectually than by increasing and diffusing this essential element among men . With these fixed and certain indications of his will , so simply expressed as to leave no chance for cavil , in terms so brief and few as to afford no room for controversy , except by departing from plain instructions , he left the details to those who would be best acquainted with them . While thus dealing in succinct and comprehensive brevity , it must not be supposed that so intelligent a benefactor intended to throw open the door to the particular fancy of any and every rhapsodist . Understandinfi perfectly the use of language , it may fairly be presumed that if any well-known and familiar kind of institution came up to his design , he would have mentioned it . Colleges , for example , and Libraries , have much the same character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with like influences wherever they may be found . They already existed , he well knew , in considerable number , in the country which he selected for an especial and uncommon provision . He could have specified a library or a college if he had intended a library or a college to be the monument of his munificence . A conclusive negative is implied in the omission of establishments so familiar . Although libraries collect and preserve , and colleges , to a certain extent and in an elementary course , instil inforijiation , yet of neither , in the lofty sense applicable to this testament , can it be said that it increases and DIFFUSES knowledge among MEN . In the true spirit of respect for the intention of the giver should be the acceptance of the gift . Whatever he intended to exclude , we are bound to eschew . Among the schemes suggested for carrying out his design , a very respectable periodical journal has recommended an extensive system of instruction in the principles of government , particularly as they apply to the administration of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how small the proportion of those engaged in that duty bears to the whole mass of the community , how infinitely smaller yet the proportion of those exclusively engaged in the science of politics in any or all its branches , how short-lived is the duration of most of our citizens in public life , how much more the attention of those citizens ,  --  we speak not merely of the many , engaged in trade and mechanical employments in all their variety , but of the comparatively few also , who , as scholars , philosophers and professional men , cultivate liberal studies-is devoted to the acquisition of other sciences , we shall readily reach the conclusion that the study of the means of governing would not be , in Mr. Smithson 's view , the increase of knowledge among men . He was a scientific man , not a politician ; a natural philosopher , not a statesman . He lectured and wrote upon practical and experimental philosophy . He delighted to penetrate the hidden recesses of* nature , to analyze her seeming elements , and to discover new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would narrow down instruction , that would exclude knowledge in any of its varieties , from access to mankind , by such absolute and elevated preference of one single chapter , and that of no peculiar fitness for the universal mind , but differing with the long list of ingredients which go to compose the " spirit of laws , " in every region from another , would not , in his expansive and philanthropic view , be an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men What then , it may be asked , and it must be determined , did he intend ? How are his designs to be carried into practical execution ? Keeping steadily in view his brief and comprehensive phrase , there can be no difficulty in a just and beneficial interpretation . Knowledge is to be increased and diffused . These effects , so momentous , are not required to be produced in a moment or at a single blow . Broad and Jeep foundations may be laid , on which lofty and still loftier pinnacles may from time to time arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the progress of science and the wants of men . A collection can be made , embracing illustrations in the different elements of knowledge . Such a collection is already at hand , and is in rapid progress of accumulation , as shown in the possessions of the National institute , in the fruits of the late exploring expedition , and in the general control of the government . All these sources may be made conducive , whether in joint use or immediate and easy access , to the Directors of a Smithsonian Institution , with reciprocal and reflected advantages to each . The government is bound to prepare a building which would accommodate these several but united purposes . The Patent-Office is yet unfinished . A wing to that fine edifice would furnish , at least for a time , all the room that would be required , and as the benevolent and beneficent ends should be more and more fully accomplished , larger and more complete accommodations would readily be supplied by an admiring and grateful Legislature . For all purposes of research , comparison , study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would contain hooks for the scholar , instruments for the experimental philosopher , specimens of productions in animate and inanimate nature from all the fields of the vast earth and all the caverns of the deep sea , facilities for scanning the sublime mysteries of the heavens , lessons in inductive art , and useful assistance to the patient toil of mechanic industry . From the loftiest flights of the astronomer , to the lowliest labors of the ploughboy , every effort of human genius and skill would be aided , guided and made to prosper . This would be to increase knowledge among men . From a centre so purely patriotic-as free from sectional jealousy as from sectional limit-rays would be diffused to the remotest corners of the land Instruction by lecture , conversation , experiment and text-book , not confined to the seat of government , might he carried home to the abode of every inquirer , however poor and however distant , under the auspices and at the expense of the Central institution . Cheap books , somewhat in the nature of the Penny Magazine , but adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays on science , in all its variety , from government and jurisprudence to agriculture and gardening , may be prepared and distributed . Teachers in the various departments of useful information , may be themselves well taught at the great high school of the nation . They will go out as missionaries of knowledge , and fill the country with one uniform system of tuition , which , derived from the best sources , can scarcely fail to be productive of the best effects . The peculiar tendency of our countrymen to search after what is new , to discover , to improve , to invent , may be gratified by frequent , early and simple explanations of the numerous patents sought for , together with descriptions of models and abstracts of interesting specifications . Observations made throughout the country in the various sciences , may be received , compared and reported on at this recipient and depository . Plants , indigenous to every soil , may be cultivated and made the subjects of valuable investigation , and their properties and adaptations ascertained . A.n authentic record may be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day in the march of intellect throughout the world . An intelligent and impartial Board may be constituted , with a view to guard the public mind against false philosophy and empyricism , and to guide it by clear and certain scientific lights . These and many other arrangements are perfectly feasible , under the bounty of Mr. Smithson , and thou- // sands of kindred uses would be developed , all directly contributing to the diffusion of knowledge among men . The delay which has occurred in giving effect to the lofty conceptions of Mr. Smithson may happily be repaired . While everything immediately connected with his bounty has for seven long years stood still , and has been regnrded , as it should seem , with cold indifference , another institution without particular endowment has , as we have seen , been accumulating possessions from a thousand sources . These are exactly of the description which Mr. Smithson 's establishment would have had to wait for if it had gone into existence by assuming a definite shape seven years ago They are mute instructors , susceptible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will discourse eloquent music if they , are animated by the sounds of a golden lyre . A combination of the inert possessions of the National Institute with the expansive faculties of a Smithsonian Institution , would form one of those chemical compounds , which derive from union of inactive elements , irresistible force and activity . The Smithsonian Institution could receive and employ , preserve and promulgate the productions of art and nature , which are worse than idle in the hands of the unendowed National Institute . The National Institute depositing for a season , or permanently , as might prove the best , its priceless but unproductive gems , or joining them with such as maybe collected gradually under the auspices of the Smithson Institution would give immediate efficacy to the designs of its own founders , without waiting the dull resolves of Congressional reluctance , or the uncertain pecuniary contributions of individual benevolence . Opportunity would thus be furnished of exhibiting at once the value of both . A foreign bounty would go at once into fair and useful exercise , while the treasures of distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful servant , be increased tenfold . In urging a combination of efforts and resources , we are aware that difficulties are to be overcome . What difficulties , however , are entitled to he regarded as formidable impediments , when an object so devoutly to he desired is in view , and when a Roman lustrum as to one of the Institutions , and much more than a Roman lustrum as to the other have already elapsed in hopeless listlessness ? ConVOL. zr. - iio . Hi . 18 congress has done nothing substantially for either . For one of them it has done much less than nothing , for it has accepted the trust and received the fund , and then permitted the first to be a barren waste , and the last an absorbed and buried mine . What hesitation can there be in sacrificing trifling objections , when by such sacrifice alone , it should seem , national pledges can be redeemed , and national benefits conferred ? We are conscious that the proposition to unite these two things of different origin has been already more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who having manifested a deep interest in both establishments , and reflected much , and kindly , and wisely upon them , enjoyed no small share of right to advise . These persons were Mr. Dupon9eau and Mr. Rush . The latter in his paper communicated to the meeting of April , 1844 , ascribes , perhaps justly , the idea to the former , and says that " it has met the concurrence of so many judgments entitled to respect as now to form what may almost be called an enlightened public opinion . " Concurring entirely with those who recommend union , we are constrained to differ with them as to the proposed method of attaining so desirable an end . This is a question so grave that it is but fair to quote the language of the position to which a very amicable protest is here interposed . Mr. Rush says , ( 3 Bulletin , page 458 ) " The Smithsonian fund is small in reference to the greatness and prospects of this country ; but it is great above price . It may he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here I come to a main purpose of this paper . If it be asked in what way shall the fund be brought into activity , an answer is at hand . Let it be engrafted upon the National Institute . " Again on the same page , " 1 would say , then , clothe this Institute with it ; it is now suffering for want of funds-the only want it knows . " It may not appear at first view very important , which is the tree and which the engrafted limb , provided they both grow and bear good fruit together ; which is the body and which the garment , if the one be comfortably clothed and the other be gracefully worn . But in this case , to keep up for a moment Mr. Rush 's well chosen illustrations , it makes all the difference in the world that one and not the other should be the tree and the body ; that // qwq plishment of many more . In the progress of time , if the cause of knowledge can be better promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect it . One powerful and controlling name and influence can , whenever it may be thought best , be divided into two powerful and controlling names and influences , in their allotted spheres , each emulous of the power and the exercise of it by the other to do good to men . Or if the strenuous and united efforts , at first directed by necessity and circumstances rather than by mere choice , shall prove to be the best , it may go on and prosper in happy and harmonious intercourse and association for ages . Thus and thus only does it seem practicable to redeem the time that has been lost . in the mere circumstance of combining two similar Institutions , there could be no embarrassment . The ultimate objects , the paramount purposes of both are the same . Improvement of the condition of the human family is the end . Cultivation of science and practical demonstration of its advantages , are the means . No difference exists in their birth-place , or in the plan of conducting their affairs . Both are at the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great proprietor of all they may severally or jointly possess , the barrier against loss , and the rock on which the permanency of each securely rests , is the Government of the United States . An accumulation of effects under one and the same guardianship , would , for a long course of time , afford variety of illustration without creating too burdensome a load of responsibility or care . Arrangement in detail for exhibition , preservation , instruction and exchanges , might well be united . All the machinery necessary for setting in motion and keeping in activity and energy the designs of the respective founders , might be in form and substance identified . Buildings , one or more , constructed or prepared for the accommodation of either , would equally and profitably accommodate both . These are all prospective and ' possible , although they may be rendered present and certain advantages . The actual condition of the two contemplated Institutions is happilysuch that they maybe made immediately available in connection . One has stores of instructive matter locked up in profitless inactivity . It wants only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place them in a situation to benefit the world . That is the National Institute ; which , having been for some years in existence , has taken initiative measures of usefulness . It can dispose of its possessions in any way consistent with its charter , even to , the extent of a reclaimable deposit of them under the general protection of another corporation , a final direction of them being reserved , and even the immediate use being made to depend upon the consent of those to the care of whom they are legally confided . The other has yet nothing of visible existence ; neither shape nor proportion , objects accumulated or plans matured . lt has a fund which , in implicit obedience to the wishes of the donor , may be and must be devoted to scientific purposes . Years might elapse after it should be in corporate readiness for action , and yet action might still be deferred until objects could be gathered together by its own attractiveness and expenditure , for teaching science practically . Much could , no doubt , sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain inaccessible , which accident , or good fortune , or good management has already placed within its reach . The fund , which should be held sacred as the Vestal Fire , could in a moment be properly employed for the exact purposes of the exalted trust , upon objects thus at once attainable . If all who take an interest in promoting the objects which Mr. Smithson had , and the promoters of the National institute have at heart , will direct their efforts to a single end , and cordially combine in measures to accomplish it , delays , which are the necessary result of divided counsels , and are fatal to designs of moment , will exist no longer , and the Legislature will do its duty . The opportunity presented by the great meeting of April , 1844 , was wisely embraced for preparing two memorials to Congress . One was subscribed by the Vice President , Corresponding and Recording Secretary and Treasurer , and by the Directors , ex officio , on the part of the Government , and Directors on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the establishment , the progress made under the auspices of a government charter , the ownership by the nation of the treasures which it has collected , and its own limited capacity and means , and concludes with asking an appropriation of a sum sufficient to discharge the arrears of expense heretofore incurred and due , an annual appro // priation for the necessary purposes of the association , and the continuance of the indulgence hitherto granted of the use of convenient rooms for preserving the property , and holding the ordinary meetings . The other is a " Memorial of the friends of science , who attended the April meeting , &amp;c. , " and it bears testimony to the zeal and industry of the Directors , in making collections  --  to their disinterestedness in the disposition of them , and to their claims to public approval and encouragement ; to the great value of the property collected and to the absence of a building for the convenient exhibition of their treasures or even for the safe keeping of them . It expresses a hope that the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enlightened nations , would not refuse to aid in securing to its capital the benefit of such labors , and that the then subsisting Session of Congress , would be distinguished by the necessary appropriation of funds to an object so truly national and so truly republican . At the foot of this memorial is found a long list of honored names , most of them well known to science , of which the first is that of Dr. Nott , " President Union College , Schenectady , " and the last , " Edward Hitchcock , Professor , Amherst College , Mass . " Highly favorable reports were made both in the Senate and House of Representatives . The recommendations contained in them , were not responded to by an appropriation , and the Institute remains endowed only by its own merits and the necessarily inadequate pecuniary contributions of its members . Arrangements were made at the beginning of the present year , for the delivery of " The annual address ; " and it was pronounced on the 15th January , in the hall of the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable properties of this truly National scheme , is its obvious exclusion of every semblance of party or political ingredient from its counsels , its exercises and associations . The distinguished members of the different political parties ; in high and excited party moments , have met together upon a common scientific platform , without even appearing to know that pnrty differences , on any arena , existed among them . However separated may be the paths to political eminence , however disunited may be the sentiments of public men , as to the measures and the course of policy which the interests of the re Sept. , public may require , there is up division of union among the wise , as to the pursuit of knowledge . All who deserve the name , with one consent , bow to its supremacy , and unite in promoting its salutary ends , by means which , if not precisely the same , are at least closely similar and perfectly harmonious . Mr. Woodhury , in his very sensible " address , " modestly disclaims ( p. 7. ) making any pretension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made here in the sciences , while he alludes " to some of the most striking cases , where their assistance has been widely invoked among us , and proved highly useful . " To a gentleman long and laboriously engaged in public life , a Governor of a State , Secretary of the Navy , Secretary of the Treasury , and member of the Senate ,  --  for he has filled all these places in succession ,  --  - profound and familiar intimacy with the details of science could not he imputed . But this necessary defect is the very quality that is desirable . Men who are too much employed in public duties to work out problems in astronomy , or to speculate upon organic remains , are they whose influence and exertions are required to help along those , who are at once patient and passionate devotees of science . Jf in any country , science and the arts can advance without the countenance of those who are not their masters ,  --  which we utterly disbelieve-this is not that country . Elsewhere a sovereign fiat , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work which will not cease to diffuse its blessings for centuries . Here , all are people . Each individual is a co-laborer with the rest . They who can not with their own hands fathom the depths of philosophy , are expected to strengthen the hands of those who can . It is delightful to witness how many are ready to contribute , by their own peculiar means of assistance , to objects which become by joint enterprise , monuments of common pride , benefit and glory . One happy result of this kind of cooperation and encouragement , is formed in the adaptation of works of art and science to the wants and necessities of the people . The public mind , as Mr. Woodhury says , has acquired impulses " to mould education more for the practical benefits of the many . " " Bowditch , the translator of La Place on the mechanism of the Heavens , found something more of profit , perhaps , if not fame , in compiling his National Institute . // useful navigator for the multitude who plough the ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At the " annual meeting " of January *9th , 1845 , which it seems is the regular day for electing officers , Mr. Woodbury was chosen President of the institute ; Mr. Poinsett , who had " continued to fill the office , having suggested the propriety of substituting another person in his place , as he felt himself unable to render such services as he could wish . " I'he public station of the new presiding officer in the Senate of the United States , will enable him to give force and direction , to the just sentiments expressed in his annual address . He considers a grant from Congress at once indispensable , of enough to defray the expense attendant on the good preservation and collection of the public materials , in charge of the Institute ; and he urges , as we understand him , ( p. 33. ) that Congress is bound , by its relations to theDistrict , as to this important subject to take all necessary steps there , for the advancement of science , " through some Institution which shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pride of character ; and national in its benefits , so as to comport with that spirit of justice and equality , that ought to pervade all our public measures . " The National institute may be congratulated upon the selection of its officers . it has been made fortunately , for it has been made wisely . Mr. Force , the Vice President , has been for several years laboriously engaged in preparing a Documentary History of the United States , under a contract with the Department of State and the sanction and authority of Congress . His Archuological researches , have developed a mine of curious and interesting knowledge , and have placed him in possession of stores of authentic information relative to a most important period in the annals of the country . He has devoted much time , attention , and probably money to the service of the association , of which he has been the second elective officer from the beginning . The chief executive magistrate , and the members of the Cabinet , are ex officio Directors . Mr. Force is always on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberality , he has been a never ceasing source of advantage . All who have had occasion to observe the proceedings of the Institute , must have been struck with the untiring zeal and aptitude of Mr. Markoe , the Corresponding Secretary . Himself a ripe scholar and a man of science , the pen of the society could not be held by an abler or a fitter hand . Nor ought we , in this course of remark , to overlook the amiable gentlem*n , who not only discharges with fidelity the duties of Recording Secretary , but employs himself , as the published records show , in preparing specimens of Natural History , which , from time to time , have been acknowledged as the gifts of Mr. J. H. Townsend . We have endeavored to show the progress , the present condition , the actual wants , and the probable prospects of the National Institute . In its nature there is nothing which a cautious government *should hesitate to encourage . All its objects are conducive to the prosperity of the nation . Nothing can be discerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , from which danger is to be apprehended in this encouragement . Generations at least must pass away , before the turning point of civilization is reached , beyond which refinement sinks into luxury , and luxury becomes the harbinger of a decaying empire . In the mean time , science and the polished arts , are contributing to the greatness and glory of the nation , and the prosperity of the people.
