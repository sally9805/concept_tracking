Oh , no ! by all her loveliness , by all That makes life poetry and beauty , no ! Make her a slave , steal from her rosy cheek By needless jealousies ; let the last star Leave her a watcher by your couch of pain ; Wrong her by petulance , suspicion , all That makes her cup a bitterness  --  yet give One evidence of love , and earth has not An emblem of devotedness like hers . But , oh ! estrange her once , it boots not how , By wrong or silence , any thing that tells A change has come upon your tenderness , And there is not one high thing out of heaven Her pride o'ermastereth not !
