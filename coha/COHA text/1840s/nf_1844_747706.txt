txt /z/ The name of Mather is one of frequent occurrence , and of distinguished honor , in the early history of New England . The first of this name , who came into the country , was the Rev. Richard Mather , long the faithful and successful minister of Dorchester , 3Ia- . He was born of poor but respectable parents , in the small town of Lowton , Lancashire , England , A. D. 1596 . He was early sent to a public school at Winwick , where he was boarded in the winter ; but in the summer ( so great was his desire for learning ) , he walked daily four miles to school , from his father 's house . He suffered much , while at school , from the unreasonable strictness and severity of the teacher  --  so much , that he often entreated his father to take him away , and permit him to relinquish /z/ his studies altogether . But to this his father would not consent , but encouraged him to persevere ; and for his firmness in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man ; and Mr. Mather himself did not cease to remember him with gratitude and honor , as long as he lived . It is evidence of the proficiency of young Mather , and also of the confidence which his rigid master reposed in him , that he recommended him as a teacher of a public school , at Toxteth Park , near Liverpool , when he was only fifteen years of age . He continued in this school several years , discharging the duties of preceptor with distinguished success , and perfecting himself , meanwhile , in those branches of study which he had occasion to teach . It was while he was here , that he became a subject of renewing grace . The principal means of his awakening was the strict and holy example of a Mr. Aspinwall , the gentleman with whom he boarded . " The exemplary walk of that holy man , " says Cotton Mather , " caused many sad fears to arise in his own soul , that he was himself out of the way ; which consideration , with his hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readins ; of Mr. Perkins ' book , showing how far a reprobate may go in religion , were the means whereby the God of heaven brought him into the state of the new creature . The troubles of soul which attended his new birth , were so exceedingly terrible , that he would often retire from his appointed meals into secret places , to lament his miseries ; but after some time , the good Spirit of God healed his broken heart , and poured into it the consolations of his great and precious promises . " From this period , Mr. Mather seems to have had his mind fixed upon the holy ministry ; and that he might prepare himself in the best manner for so great a work , he resolved to relinquish his school , ant connect himself with the university at Oxford . His residence at Oxford could not have been more than two or three years ; for in 1618 , when he was only twenty-two years of age , he received an invitation to return to Toxteth , not as a schoolmaster , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time with several others , by Dr. Morton , bishop of Chester . When the ordination was over , the bishop took him aside , and addressed him in the following remarkable 12 T H li MATHER FAMILY . language : " I have an earnest request unto you , Mr. Mather , and you must not deny me . It is that you would pray for me . I know the prayers of such as fear God will avail much , and I take you to be of this number . " In 1624 , two years after his settlement , Mr. Mather was married to an excellent lady , the daughter of Edmund Holt , Esq. , of Bury , who was his assistant in his labors , and the partner in his pilgrimage , for more than thirty years . During his Ministry at Toxteth , Mr. Mather was abundant in labors , not only among his own people , but in the adjoining towns and villages . He preached once a fortnight at Prescott , and alwa*s seized the opportunity , which his attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He frequently preached upon holiday 's ; because , as he says , " there was then an opportunity to cast the net of the gospel among an abundance of fish . " Great assemblies were then broudit together , which otherwise would have been worse employed . Having spent about fifteen years in the diligent and faithful performance of duties such as these , complaints were at length urged against him for his non-comformity ; and in August , 1G33 , he was suspended from the ministry . By the intercession /z/ of friends his suspension was removed , after a few months ; but it was again inflicted the next year , under circumstances which led him to despair of being ever more permitted to exercise his ministry in his native land . About this time , Mr. Mather entered renewedly , and more thoroughly than ever before , upon the study of church polity , assisted by the writings of such men as Cartwright , Parker , Baines , and Ames . The result was , that he became a decided Congregationali-t ; and was known henceforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of the year 1685 , Mr. Mather had made up his mind to join the goodly company of confessors and pilgrims , who were bidding adieu to their native land , and migrating to the distant shores of New England . Our fathers of that day reasoned after this manner : " The natural sun shines as pleasantly on America , as on England ; and the sun of righteousness much more clearly . " We are here treated in a manner that forfeits all claim upon our affection . Let us remove whither the providence of God calls us , and make that our country which will grant us ( what is dearer than property or life ) the liberty of worshiping God according to the dictates of /z/ our own consciences . " During the twelve years of Archbishop Laud 's administration , four thousand emigrants become planters in America . Neale informs us , that he had a list of seventyseven divines , ordained in the church of England , who became pastors of churches in America , before the year 1640 . Among these divines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his persecutors , who were in close pursuit of him , he embarked at Bristol , in May , 1635 , and arrived with his family at Boston , in August of the same year . Near the end of his voyage , he encountered a terrible storm at sea , and was on the point of being swallowed up ; but the Lord graciously preserved him , to be an ornament and blessing to the infant churches of New England . Before his arrival , the church , which had been first planted at Dorchester , under the charge of Rev. Mr. Warham , had removed in a body , with its pastor , and settled at Windsor , Connecticut ; leaving the remaining settlers at Dorchester in a destitute condition . Mr. Mather was almost immediately called to exercise his ministry among this people , and after due consultation , he concluded to accept their invitation . A new church was gathered , and he was regularly constituted its /z/ pastor , in August , 1G36 . And here lie remained to the day of his death , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicited to j:eturn to his former charge in England , after the downfall of the hierarchy , and the establishment of the commonwealth ; but he rightly judged the Lord had called him to this country , and that this was the place where he was to spend his days . The preaching of Mr. Mather is represented as being not only sound and instructive , but very direct and plain . He " studiously avoided , " say3 his biographer , " obscure and foreign terms , and the unnecessary citation of Latin sentences ; aiming to shoot his arrows , not over the heads , but into the hearts of his hearers . Yet so scripturally and powerfully did he preach his plain sermons , that Mr. Hooker used to say , " My brother 3Iather is a mighty man . " He had great success of his labors , in both Englands , in converting many souls to God . One of the hearers of Mr. Mather , speaking of events which took place in Dorchester , soon after his settlement , says , " In those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting many souls , and in gathering his dear ones into church fellowship , by solemn covenant . Our hearts were taken off from old England , and /z/ get upon heaven . The discourse , not only of the aged , but of the youth also , was , not How shall ice go to England ? but , How shall we go to heaven ? Hare I true grace wrought in my heart ? Have . I Christ , or no ? the many tears that have been shed in Dorchester meeting-house , at such times , both by those who declared God 's work on their souls , and by those who heard them ! " Mr. Mather lived at a period , when much attention was given , both in this country and in England , to the subject of church government . Our fathers had little dissension or discussion about the doctrines of the gospel . These , having settled down on the good old scriptural foundation of Calvinism , had scarcely begun to be disputed . The doctrinal articles of the several reformed churches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still undecided . The sense of the inspired writers in regard to them had not been satisfactorily ascertained . To these , therefore , the minds of Christians , at that day , were directed , with a deeply interested attention . It is evidence of the standing of Mr. Mather among his contemporaries , tad of the estimation in which he was held , that his rvices were in continual requisition , in resolving and defending points of this nature . In the year /z/ 1639 , thirty-two questions , relating to church government , " ft ere propounded and printed by the General Court , for the consideration of the ministers . Their answer to these questions was prepared entirely by 31r . Mather . He was a prominent member of the Synod of 1648 , and with his own hand drew up the substance of the celebrated Cambridge Platform of discipline , which was then adopted . He is said to have been a member of every synod that was convened in New England , during his residence in the country ; and was actually the moderator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . This circumstance led one of his brethren to write for him the following epitaph : Vixerat in synodis ; moritur moderator in Mis ;  --  among synods he lived ; the moderator of one he died . He was one of three ministers , who prepared the New England version of the Psalms ;  --  a work more creditable to his piety and orthodoxy , than to his poetical inspiration . He wrote an answer to Mr. Davenport , of Xew Haven , on the subject of infant baptism , with which old Mr. Higginson , of Salem , was so well pleased , that he said , * The question between them did not respect the validity of infant baptism , but the lawfulness of baptizing an- , except the children of church-members in full communion . Of /z/ " Mr. Mather is a pattern to all the answerers in the world . " He was the anthor of* several other works , chiefly ( though not wholly ) on his favorite subject of church order and discipline . Mr. Mather was not only an active , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his beloved studies , that only the morning before he died , he importuned the friends that watched with him to help him into his study , " where he had not been for several days , and where , he remarked , " my usual works and my books expect me . Is it not a lamentable thing that I should lose so much time ? " Up to the time of his last sickness , the health of Mr. Mather had been uninterruptedly good . He had never had occasion to call a physician ; he had never been sick of any acute disease ; nor in fifty years together had he been detained so much as one Lord 's day from his public labors . His fatal disease was that terrible one , the stone , with which he was seized while attending an ecclesiastical council in Boston . He was able to he removed to his own house , but never able to leave it afterwards . In the paroxysms of his disea . he never shrieked , and but seldom groaned ; but WBfl a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortified hi son ! under suffering by rending /z/ THE M'ATll 1 F A MILT , 19 Dr. Goodwin 's Discourse upon Patience , which he continued to study to the day of his death . When any one asked , how he did ; his usual answer was , Far from icell ; yet far better than mine iniquities deserve . He died in peace , April 22 , 16G0 , aged seventy-three ; having been , for more than fifty years , a preacher of righteousness . It is remarkable that the lasl sermon which he preached to his people , being then in usual health , was from these words : " 1 am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand . I have f d fight ; I have fin- ished my course : I have kept the faith ; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , shall give me at that day . " 2 Tim . 4 : 6  --  8 . The sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of my appointed time will I wait , till my change come . " Job 14 : 14 . A sermon which he had not preached , but which was prepared previous to his last fatal attack , was from these words : " Ye know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , we have a building of God , an house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens . " 2 Cor. 5:1 . It has long been a favorite opinion with some , that holy men have not unfrequently a presage of their ap- /z/ proaching dissolution , before the event actually overtakes them . How far the facts above stated may go to confirm such an opinion , I leave for my readers to decide . About twenty years previous to his death , Mr. Mather had been called to part with the wife of his youth ,  --  a most excellent help-meet , " by whose discreet management of his affairs , he had been so released from all secular incumbrances , as to be wholly at liberty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the following words on her lips , " Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things that God hath prepared for them that love him . " He was united in a second marriage with the widow of his distinguished ministerial brother , the Rev. John Cotton , of Boston . This lady survived him . Bvhis first marriage , Mr. Mather had six sons , four of whom graduated at Harvard College , and were able and faithful ministers of Christ . It will be necessary to give some account of each of them , in detailing the history of the Mather family . /z/ Samuel Mather , the eldest of . - of Rev. Richard Mather , was born in England , May 13 , 1G26 , and was brought by his father to Xew England , when about nine years of age . He became hopefully pious in mere childhood , before he was mx years old , and is represented as an extraordinary instance , not only of early developed intellectual ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchfulness " An Arabian commentator upon the Koran , reports , that when John Baptist was a child , the other boys asked him to play with them . But he refused , saying , i " was not sent into the world for sport . Such seems to have been the thoughts of the child , Samuel Mather , so far as his thou 3re indi- cated by his general course of life . He graduated at Harvard College in the year 1643 , at the early age of seventeen ; and was the first of the graduates who was there retained in /z/ the capacity of fellow or tutor . He continued at Cambridge several years , under the instructive and powerful ministry of the Rev. Thomas Shepard ;  --  a privilege which he greatly prized , and for which , after the death of Mr. Shepard , he felt himself called upon to make some compensation , by publishing a memoir of him to the world . In proof of the estimation in which Mr. Mather was held as a tutor , it is stated , that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the students were in tears , and that when he took his leave of the college , they actually put on badges of mourning ! When Mr. Mather began to preach , he spent some time with the church in Rowley , as an assistant to the venerable Ezekiel Rogers . lie was earnestly importuned to settle with this church ; but owing to his youth , or to some other cause , he did not think it to be his duty . At the formation of the Second or North church in Boston , Mr. Mather was applied to to be their minister . He preached to them their first sermon , and continued with them through the winter following ; but having a strong desire to visit England , which was his native land , he went thither in the year 1G50 . In England , Mr. Mather 's reputation as a /z/ preacher was even higher than it had been in this country . Immediately on his arrival , he was appointed chaplain to the lord mayor of London , where his situation soon made him acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " While in the metropolis , he was so often called upon to preach , that his health became seriously impaired , and he was thought to be in danger of losing his life . After a respite , however , his former vigor was restored ; and we next hear of him preaching at Gravesend ; and then at the cathedral , in the city of Exeter . After this , he was appointed chaplain of Magdalen College , Oxford , where he resided for a considerable time . From this situation , in which he seems to have been both useful and happy , he was called to accompany the English commissioners on their tour into Scotland , where he remained , publishing the gospel of the grace of God , for the space of two years . In 1665 , in connection with Dr. Harrison , Dr. Winter , and Mr. Charnock , he went with the lord deputy , Henry Cromwell , into Ireland . He was here appointed senior fellow of Trinity College , Dublin , and joint pastor , with Dr. Winter , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented for the exercise of charity , /z/ and for the display of that true Christian liberality for which he was ever distinguished ; for when his patron , the lord deputy , gave him a commission for the displacing of several Episcopal ministers , he refused to do it , savins : , " I came into this country to preach the gospel , not to hinder others from preaching . " This was a measure of liberality on the part of Mr. Mather , which was not meted to him again ; for almost , immediately on the restoration of Charles II. , lie was himself suspended on a charge of sedition . This charge  --  a spiteful and malicious one  --  was founded on two discourses which he had preached , in opposition of Episcopal rites and ceremonies , and especially to the enforcing of them by the rigors of the law . When Mr. Mather was notified of his suspension , and of the groundless charge on which it was based , he said , " If it be sedition to disturb the devil 's kingdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , as the Lord Jesus does by his own ordinances in his church , I may say that I did it before the Lord , who hath chosen me to be his minister ; and if this be vile , / will yet be more vile . " When this distinguished preacher could no longer exercise his ministry in Ireland , he return- T H E M A T II Bl F A M I L Y . 25 ed to England , and established himself at Burton Wood , Lancashire , where he continued about two year- ; until , with two thousand of his faithful brethren , he was ejected , by the terrible act of uniformity , haps nothir ever oc- curred , in the whole history of Christianity , more truly honorable to our religion , than the conduct of those ejected mini on this trying occasion . There was , in the first place , a Ly of them , including the ablest and best men in the kingdom . They were in quiet - ion of com- fortable li . and these , in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , wives and children , whose rthly and comforts all depended on their retaining their places . They were thernIves dependent on their professional labors for - upport , not having been trained to any other employment , nor knowing how to obtain a livelihood in any other way . And then all that was required of them was to stretch their consciences , more or less , so it to the Episcopal rites and forms , and give their countenance to what they conceived to be superstitious and unwarrantable additions in th lie worship of God . And yet their consciences could not be stretched . They knew how to make sacrifices , to /z/ embrace poverty , to endure hardships and privations , to go , if it must be , to prison and to death ; but to play the hypocrite ,  --  to trine with conscience , to do what they verily believed would be displeasing to God , merely for the sake of gaining their bread ,  --  they had no heart . They took the spoiling of their goods ; they retired from their livings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast themselves , naked and dependent , but yet believing and confident , upon the grace and providence of their heavenly Father . Verily , here is evidence that there was some conscience still remaining in England ; and that the revival of religion , which preceded and followed the overthrow of Laud 's tyrannical administration , had not been altogether without good fruit . The firmness of this noble band of confessors will appear in a stronger light , if contrasted with what took place in England a little more than a century subsequent to their ejectment . In the year 1772 , about two hundred and fifty clergymen of the church of England , who held Unitarian sentiments ( among whom were bishop Law and archdeacon Blackburn ) , petitioned Parliament for relief from the necessity of subscribing the articles of the church , on the ground that such /z/ subscription was against their consciences . But the House of Commons rejected their petition , and the subscription was enforced as usual . Notwithstanding this , the petitioners , with the exception of a single individual ( Mr. Lindscj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrines of which they had publicly declared they no longer believed ; and Mr. Lindsey was left to complain , that of the multitudes in the establishment who concurred in his sentiments , only one was found willing to contribute towards the expense of erecting him a chapel ! But it is time that we return to Mr. Mather . Being denied the privilege of preaching in England , except on conditions with which he could not in conscience comply , he returned to his former friends in Dublin , where he founded an Independent church , and set up a meeting in his own hired house . And here he continued , without further molestation , to the day of his death . The Mr. Mather of whom we here speak , like several of the other members of his family , accomplished much as an author . He had occasion to go repeatedly into the Popish controversy , and write in defence of the Protestant religion . He preached and published against what he conceived to be the errors of the established church ; while i /z/ he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that church with affection and respect . He published a work , entitled Irenicum , the design of which was to promote a greater degree of union and harmony among the three principal denominations of English Dissenters , the Presbyterians , Congregationalisms and Baptists . This was an object on which his heart was much set , and to further which he did not labor altogether in vain . He wrote also on the prophecies of Scripture ; and a volume of sermons on the types . He had a controversy with an individual in Dublin , on a subject not altogether unlike some of the marvels of our own times . There was one Valentine Greatarick , who affirmed that he had the gift of healing diseases , by stroking and rubbing the diseased parts with his hands . Thousands of persons flocked to him from all parts of Ireland , some noblemen , some learned , some pious persons , and even ministers of the gospel . Mr. Mather had no faith in the impudent quack ; and believing that great evils might result from the delusion , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His manuscript was shown to some of the king 's privy council in Ireland , by whom it was highly approved and applauded . /z/ Mr. Mather was an example of fidelity in all the relative and social duties . To his honored father , whom he had left in this country , he was in the habit of sending valuable donations , year by year , as long as he lived . Of his younger brothers he was also mindful , and d mate- rially in preparing them for usefulness . In the year 1G50 , he was married to a sister of Sir John Stevens , by whom he had several children , only one of whom survived him . His wife died when they had lived together about twelve years . Her closing scene was uncommonly peaceful and happy . Seeing her lie in her last agonies , her husband said to her , k ' You are soon going where there will be no more pain . " " Ah , ; . tie re- plied , " and what is better , where there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " You are going to heaven , " she answered , " I seem to be there already . Come , Lord Jesus , come quickly . " Mr. Mather survived his companion only about three years . He died in Dublin , Oct. 29 , 1671 , at the early age of forty-six , and was buried in the church of St. Nicholas , of which he had formerly been the pastor . The following epitaph was written for him , but whether actually in- /z/ scribed on his tombstone , it does not appear . " Din vixit , licet rum cliii fuit . " He lived long , although he did not continue long . As a preacher , Mr. Samuel Mather held the first rank . His name was known throughout the three kingdoms . His discourses were remarkable for clearness of reason and method , and for the majesty and authority with which they were uttered . It used to be said by critics of those times , " Mr. Charnock 's invention , Dr. Harrison 's expression , and Mr. Mather 's logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " /z/ This was the second son of the Rev. Richard Mather ( of whom we have any account ) , and of him our materials enable us to present but a naked sketch . He was born in England , March 20 , 1630 , and was five years old when he came with his parents to this country . Like his brother Samuel , he was only seventeen years old , when he graduated at Harvard College . After he had entered the ministry , he followed his brother into England , and was presented , by the Protector /z/ Cromwell , to a living in Barnstable , in 1656 . He continued here until 1662 , when he had the honor to he one of that noble band of two thousand , who were ejected for their non-conformity . After this , he went into Holland , and was minister of an English congregation at Rotterdam . Upon the death of his brother Samuel , in 1671 , he was invited to take charge of his bereaved and afflicted church in Dublin . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was afterwards pastor of a Congregational church in London , and one of the lecturers at Pinner 's Hall . He died July 26 , 1697 , aged 76 , and was interred in the burying-ground near Bunhill fields . On his tomb-stone , the traveler may - till read a long Latin inscription , prepared by Dr. " Watts , which ascribes to him a high character for genius , learning , piety , and ministerial fidelity . He was the author of several works , the principal of which are , a treatise , entitled " The llighteousness of God by Faith , upon all who believe ; " and a volume of sermons , preached at Pinner 's Hall . The sermons were taken down in short-hand , as they were delivered , and published after his death . The memorials of the Rev. Nathaniel Mather /z/ have chiefly perished . We have not the means of forming a judgment respecting him , as we have in the case of his father and brothers . But from the several important stations which he occupied , the circles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published , and especially from the character which is given of him by Dr. Watts , and which he caused to be inscribed upon his tombstone , there can be no doubt that he was a learned , gifted , devoted and faithful minister* of the Lord Jesus Christ . It was his lot to live in a trying period ,  --  an era of storm , revolution and conflict ; but he bore the test ; he kept the faith ; and has gone to receive the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , shall give him in that day . /z/ The next of the sons of the Rev. Richard Mather , who went into the ministry , was named Eleazer . He was born in Dorchester , May 13 , 1637 , and graduated at Harvard College , in 1656 . He immediately commenced preaching , being at that time but nineteen years of age . He did not follow the example of his elder brothers , and seek /z/ a field of labor in the cities of the old world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first minister of Northampton , 3L Having preached to the people about two years , a church was gathered , and I - ordained its tor , June 23,1658 . Be died July 24 , K after a mini-try of only eleven years . He is represented as a " very zealous preacher and pious walker , " ' who was instrumental in bringing many souls to the Saviour . His death was greatly lamented , not only by his own church , but by all the then infant churches on the Connecticut river . As he approached the end of life , " he grew bo manifestly ripe for heaven , in a holy , watchful , fruitful disposition , " that many pious persons anticipated his speedy removal . The following are the last words that he wrote in his diary :  --  M This evening ( July 10 , 1669 ) , I had some sweet longing-of soul after God in Christ , according to the terms of the covenant of grace . The general and indefinite expression of the promise was an encouragement to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fir me , which he has promised to do for some . Nor do I dare exclude myself ; but if the Lord will help me , I will live at his feet , /z/ and accept of grace in his own way and time , through his power enabling me . Though I am dead , and without strength , help or hope in myself , yet the Lord requireth nothing at my hands in my own strength , but that by his power I should look to him , to work all his works in me and for me . " The wife of Mr. Mather was the daughter of the Rev. John Warhani , first minister of Dorchester , and afterwards first minister of Windsor , Conn . After his death she married his successor , the celebrateu Solomon Stoddard ; and was grandmother of the more celebrated metaphysician and divine , Jonathan Edwards . The only daughter of Mr. Mather was married to the Rev. John Williams , of Deerfield . She was carried into captivity , and cruelly murdered by the Indians , in the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frontier town , and much exposed to the incursions of the savages . In the night of Feb. 28th , a party of them broke into the house of Mr. Williams , murdered two of his children and a servant before his eyes , and compelled the rest of the family ,  --  himself , his wife and the surviving children ,  --  to set out immediately on their march for Canada . In wading a small river , the second /z/ day after their capture , Mrs. Williams fell down , from exhaustion and fatigue . Finding her unable to proceed farther , one of the Indians despatched her with his hatchet . Mr. Williams survived his captivity , returned to Deerfield , and continued there till his death , in 1729 . It does not appear that the Rev. Eleazer Mather published any thing , while he lived . After his death , there was published , from his manuscripts , a work on the duties of Christian parents to their children , it being the substance of some of his last sermons . /z/ Increase Mather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was born at Dorchester , June 21 , 1639 . He became early a subject of divine grace , chiefly through the instrumentality of his pious mother . I extract the following from his own written account of his religious exercises , before and after the time of his conversion :  --  " The great care of my godly parents was to bring me up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . Whence I was kept from many visible outbreakings of sin , which else I had been guilty of , and had many good impressions of the Spirit of God upon me , even from my infancy . Nevertheless , I swam quietly in the stream of impiety and carnal security for several years , till it pleased God , in the year 1654 , to visit me with a sore and dangerous sickness . For this I have many a time blessed the Lord , and I hope that I shall bless him for ever , for he made it the means of the first saving awakenings to my soul . I was /z/ brought now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternity before my eyes . I was brought , also , to a solemn and awakening sense of sin . After I rcc . the arrows of God still stuck fast in my heart , and I was followed with sore and grievous trouble- in my mind fur several months . In my disi I resolved that I would not live in any known sin ; and on examining my heart , I could not find any sin with which I was not heartily willing to part . I set also upon the practice of duty , and was constant in my secret devotions . Nevertheless , my wounded conscience remained with me . And God set my sins in order before me . He showed me the vanities of my childhood , and made me to - the in- iquities of my youth , so that my heart was read to sink and die at the sight of them . " This interesting youth , who was now not more than fifteen years of age , continues to speak of his distresses and temptaticns , and of the means which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private fasting and supplication . " Towards the close of one of these days , being in an extremity of anguish because of sin , it was put into my heart that I must go and throw myself down at the feet of my Saviour , and see whether he would accept of me or no ; resolving that if he /z/ would accept me , then I would be his ; but if not , then I would perish at his feet . So I came before him , with these words of Esther on my lips , 1 If I perish , I perish . Yet , Lord , if it must be so , I am resolved to perish at the feet of thy mercy . It is true , I am a dog , and unworthy of so much as a crumb . I have been a great sinner ; but I am resolved that I will not offend anymore . I icill be thine , thine only , and thine for ever ? While I was thus praying and pleading , those words of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I icill in no wise cast out . I pleaded this precious promise with the Lord . After this , I had some comfortable persuasions that my sins were forgiven , and that the Lord would show me mercy . So I went on cheerfully in the ways of the Lord . " It is exceedingly interesting to read well-attested narratives such as this , and learn the methods which God pursues in humbling the proud heart of man , and bringing sinners to himself . It is interesting to learn the true nature of conversion , and to distinguish the important moment when the soul is born of God . The instant young Mather was willing to throw himself down , in unreserved submission , at the feet of his Saviour , /z/ his troubled spirit began to find peace . And so it will be with every other anxious , convicted soul . Mr. 3Iather was , at this time , a member of College , though for some unexplained reason , he was pursuing his studies out of College , under the direction of the Rev. John Xorton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his broth Eleazar , in 1656 . The following year he commenced preaching , when he was on ! hteen years old . His first sermon was preached in Dorchester , under which his venerable father v much affected , that lie could scarcely pronounce the blessing , for tea : It will be recollected that Mr. Mather had two brothers , settled ministers in Europe ; Samuel , at Dublin , and Nathaniel , in Engla At the earnest request of his eldest brother , he concluded to follow them to that field of labor . He sailed from Boston , July 3 , 1657 , and after a voyage of five weeks , was landed in England . His first year abroad was spent as a student in Trinity College , Dublin . After this , he preached with much acceptance in various place- , until the troubles which followed the restoration of Charles II. , admonished him to return to his native land . He arrived in New England in i .. miner of /z/ 1661 , and the next year was married to Maria Cotton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her he was united more than fifty years , and was the father of ten children ; all of whom ( except one who died in infancy ) gave early and convincing evidence of piety . After repeated and earnest solicitation , and much misgiving on his own part , Mr. Mather consented to become the pastor of the Second or North church in Boston , and was ordained over it , May 27 , 1664 . In this situation he continued to the end of life ,  --  a period of almost sixty years . In 1681 , 3Ir . Mather- was elected to the presidency of Harvard College ; and at the commencement following , he took the chair and conferred the degrees ; but as his church were unwilling to grant him a dismission , the office was at length declined . After the death of President Rogers , in 1685 , Mr. Mather was again requested " to act as President , until a further settlement be made , " with the understanding that he was to reside and preach in Boston , and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way , his official connection with the College commenced ; /z/ and it continued without any material alteration ( except that he afterwards became not merely , the acting , but the actual President ) for a period of about sixteen year- . This , as all who are acquainted with the history of New England know , was a time of great political anxiety and convulsion , in which both the College and its President n rily and deeply shared . Towards the end of the year 1083 , King Charles II . demanded that the colonial charter of Massachusetts should be given up to him , threatening , in case of refusal , that a quo warranto against it should be prosecuted . The question before the people , was , whether they should voluntarily surrender their charter , or have it forcibly taken from them . Mr. Mather contended earnestly , both in public speeches and from the press , against the surrender of the charter ; alleging that by voluntarily yielding it , the people made themselves accessory to the plots of their enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , the responsibility would rest solely on their oppressors . By his efforts and influence in this matter , he incurred the deadly hostility of the infamous Edward Randolph , the emissary of the king , and afterwards the secretary of Sir Edmund Andros. /z/ One method which Randolph took to injure Mr. Mather is too strongly characteristic of him to be wholly passed over . He forged a letter in the name of Mr. Mather , and caused it to be put into the hands of Sir Lionel Jenkins , the king 's secretary of state , containing severe reflections upon the secretary , and praising certain individuals who were known to be obnoxious to the king . The forgery , however , was so palpable that Sir Lionel treated it with contempt . When this was told to Mr. Mather , he at once wrote to the secretary , disclaiming all knowledge of the letter , and expressing the opinion that Randolph wrote it . This excited the hatred of Randolph the more , and he brought two * successive actions against Mr. Mather for defamation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first instance by being honorably acrniitted , and in the second , by being sent out of the country , on an agency to England . The original colonial charter of Massachusetts was vacated in 1G85 , and Sir Edmund Andros arrived in the capacity of governor , the following year . His secretary and chief counselor was Edmund Randolph . The government of these men continued between two and three years ; and to our venerable fathers it was truly a reign of /z/ terror . Their religious rights were invaded and threatened ; the liberty of the press was taken away ; and their very titles to their free-holds were called in question . They were I rious- ly to consider , whether their lives would be loi secure . In their disl - and alarm , they determined to send an agent to England , to lay their case at the feet of their sovereign , King James II. , and to implore protection and relief . In looki about them for a suitable person to whom to commit this trying and responsible agency , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he to be sent ? The government , with all its facilities and resources , was in the hands of their oppressors ; who , so far from aiding , would certainly frustrate such an agency , if it lay in their power . The government did exert itself to the utmost to frustrate and put a stop to the measure . It was to prevent Mr. Mather from going , that the second action was brought against him for defaming llandolph ; but his friends secreted him from his pursuers , and sent him out of the country in disguise . After his arrival in England , Mr. Mather had an interview with King James , and obtained from him a promise to redress grievances ; but the revolution soon followed , which put an end to the /z/ intrigues and usurpations of James , and placed " William and Mary on the throne . This revolution in the mother country was immediately followed by the overthrow of Andros ' government in Massachusetts . The old charter was temporarily revived , and two additional agents , Mr. Elisha Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to co-operate with Mr. Mather in his endeavors to promote the interests of the colonies . They had repeated interviews with King William and his ministers , in all which , they sought , as they were instructed to do , the legal restoration of their former charter , with such enlargements as the altered situation of the country required . And when , at length , this boon was despaired of , Mr. Mather was chiefly instrumental in procuring a new charter , by which the colonies of Massachusetts and Plymouth were united , and under which they both lived and prospered , down to the time of the American revolution . I ascribe the new charter chiefly to the agency of Mr. Mather , because he acted in this matter in opposition to the wishes , and without the consent , of his colleagues , who preferred rather to return with no charter , than to accept the one which King William offered them . Nor was the procuring of the charter all that /z/ this indefatigable servant of the public accomplished , during the period of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other New England colonies , endeavoring to procure the restitution of their charters , and counteracting the designs of their enemies . A design was on foot to unite the colony of Plymouth with NewYork . This was frustrated through the efforts of Mr. Mather ; for which he received a letter of thanks from the general court of Plymouth . Iii England , as everywhere else , Mr. Mather deeply interested himself in the concerns of religion . He was engaged in drawing up heads of agreement , and in bringing about a union between the Presbyterian and Congregational churches of England ;  --  an object which would not , probably , have been accomplished , had it not been for his visit to that country . Meanwhile , he was doing all in his power to promote the interests of Harvard College . He presented its claims before the king , and solicited for it the patronage of nobles , and of other wealthy individuals . He was instrumental , if not of first turning the thoughts of Mr. Hollis towards the College , at least of encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of his bounty . /z/ It should be added , that during the four years he remained in England , he served his country gratis . " I never demanded , " says he , " the least farthing as a recompense for the time I spent ; and I procured donations to the province and the college , at least nine hundred pounds more than all the expenses of my agency came to . " Having obtained a charter of government ( the best that could be obtained ) , and having been honored with the nomination of the Governor , Lieutenant Governor , and first Board of Council , who were to be appointed by the King , Mr. Mather left England in March , 1692 , and arrived at Boston about the middle of May . The General Assembly was soon after convened , when " the speaker , in the name of the house of representatives , returned him thanks , for his faithful , painful , indefatigable endeavors to serve the country . " The house also " appointed a day of solemn thanksgiving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe return to his excellency the Governor , and the Rev. Mr. Increase Mather , who have industriously endeavored the service of this people , and brought over with them a settlement of government , in which their Majesties have graciously given us distinguishing marks of their royal favor and goodness . " /z/ It is not to be disguised , however , that there was a pretty strong party in the province , who were dissatisfied with the results of Mr. Mather 1 ! agency , and with him for his instrumentality in procuring them . Some , in what had been the Plymouth colony , were i. - fu- d that they were united with Massachusetts . Some were lied that , in his nominations to office , their nan : were omitted  --  showing that human nature at that period , was not essentially different from what it is now . But the principal ground of dissatisfaction was the charter itself . It was not the old charter which had been wrested from them ; and then it contained some restrictions on what were conceived to be popular rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of electing some of the higher officers of government from among themselves . It admits not of a doubt , however , at the present day , that Kr . Mather acted wisely in this most important business . The restoration of the former charter could not be obtained ; and if it could , without important modifications , it would not have been adapted to the altered and enlarged state of the colony ; and had the agents returned without any charter , the way had been open for some second Andros to come and revolutionize and oppress the country /z/ Mr. Mather assumed , indeed , a high responsibility , in consenting to act in so important a matter , without the concurrence of his colleagues , but the more credit is due to him on this account , and it belongs to posterity to award him this credit . It is impossible to conceive what New England might have been called to suffer ,  --  what had been the fate of its churches , its schools , and its free institutions , had not the venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness , seized the favorable opportunity , and accepted the charter which King William offered him . By this act , he lost somewhat of his former popularity , and exposed himself to no little reproach from a class of men  --  such as will always be found more or less , in every free country ,  --  who prefer to find fault with the doings of others , rather than to . incur responsibility themselves , and are fond of haranguing about popular rights ; but he met the decided approbation of the wise and good among his contemporaries ; while historians of later date , and some , who have not been disposed to mete out to him any thing more than even justice , have strongly approved of his conduct in this matter . The following extract of a letter to the General Court at Boston , signed by twelve of the dissent- /z/ ing ministers of London , among whom were William Bates , John Howe , Samuel Annesly , and Isaac Chauncey , will show how the conduct of Mr. Mather was regarded at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We give this testimony , " say these men , " to our much esteemed and beloved brother , 3Ir . Increase Mather , that with inviolate integrity , excellent prudence , and unfainting diligence , he hath managed the great business committed to his trust . As he is instructed in the school of heaven to minister to the affairs of the soul , so he is furnished with a talent to transact affairs of state . His proceedings have been with a caution and circumspection corr - pondent to the weight of his commission . With courage and constancy he has pursued the noble scope of his employment ; and understanding the true moment of things , has preferred the publicgood to the vain conceit of some , that more might have been obtained , if peremptorily insisted on . Considering the open opposition and secret arts that have been used to frustrate the best endeavors for the interest of New England , the happy issue of these things is superior to our expectations . Your present charter secures liberty and property ; and what is incomparably more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ purity and freedom . Although there is a restraint of your power in some things that were granted in the former charter , there are more ample privileges in other things , that may be of perpetual advantage to the colony . We doubt not but your faithful agent will receive a gracious reward above , and we hope his successful service will be welcomed with your entire approbation and grateful acceptance . " Thus far the London dissenting ministers , who at that period felt an interest in New England almost as great as though they had been members of the colony . President Quincy , in his late history of Harvard University , thus speaks of the efforts of Mr. Mather on this occasion . " Whatever opinions we may be compelled to entertain concerning his measures and motives at other times , his conduct in this great crisis of his country , entitles him to unqualified approbation . It is scarcely possible for a public agent to be placed in circumstances more trying and critical ; nor could any one have exhibited more sagacity and devotedness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firmness in acceding to the new charter , and thus assuming a responsibility of the weightiest kind , in opposition to his colleagues in the agency , he saved his country , apparently , from /z/ a rebellion , or a revolution , or from having a constitution imposed by the will of the transatlantic sovereign , and possibly at the point of the bayonet . " * I have dwelt the longer on this great public act of Mr. Mather , on account of the importance of the act itself , and because of its con &qnena; both to himself personally , and to New England . During his absence from home , his ministerial duties were discharged by his son , Cotton Mather , who had , several years before , been ordained as his colleague . At the same time , the College was committed to the care and instruction of Mr. John Leverctt , and Mr. William Brattle , tutors . /z/ INCREASE mather .  --  Continued . Increase Mather , like his father , was connected with all the synods that were held in Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called , which was convened in 1679 , he seems to have been the prime mover , as he was certainly an active and leading member . The result of the synod was drawn up with his own hand , and was commended by the General Court to the serious consideration of all the churches . Mr. Mather was a strenuous supporter of the established faith and order of the New England churches ; and when innovations were at any time attempted , they met from him a decided resistance . Near the close of the seventeenth century , an attempt was made to do away with the established practice of requiring of persons admitted to the Lord 's table a particular account of their religious experience . The Rev. William Brattle , of Cambridge , was one of the promoters of this /z/ innovation . It was followed , in a little time , by the doctrine , openly promulgated by Mr. Stoddard and others , that evidence of regeneration is not to be required of candidates for the holy supper . This Mr. Mather regarded as a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his iiiiluence and exertions . He wrote a preface to his son 's life of Mitchell , * in which he says , that " doctrinal knowledge and outward blamelessni 5S are not sufficient qualifications for admission to the church ; but that practical confessions , or some relation of the work of conversion , are necessary . " At a later period , he engaged in controversy with Mr. Stoddard on the same subject , showing the unscriptnral character of the views he advocated , and their dangerous bearing on the churches of New England . About the same period , another innovation was attempted , if indeed it be not part of the same , at which Mr. Mather was greatly troubled . It was the abandonment , by particular churches , of their separate , independent action in the choice of their pastors , and their consenting to vote only in con- * Rev. Jonathan Mitchell , second pastor of the first church in Cambridge ; a man of whom Richard Baxter said , " If an oecumenical council could be obtained , Mr. Mitchell were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the year 1697 , the church of which Mr. Mather was pastor sent " a letter of admonition to the church in Charlestown , for betraying the liberties of the churches , by putting into the hands of the whole inhabitants the choice of a minister . " The same year , measures were taken for founding the church in Brattle Square , Boston , expressly excluding the distinct action of the church in the choice of a minister , and disclaiming " the requisition of any public relation of experiences , or any other examination than by the pastor , " as the condition of being admitted to the Lord 's supper . The Bev . Benjamin Colman , then a young man , and in England , was invited to become the first pastor of this church ; and so confident were those who invited him that he could not be ordained over it in this country , that they advised him to obtain ordination in England . The leaders in this innovation were Thomas Brattle , Esq. , of Boston , Bev . William Brattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harvard College . I am the more particular in mentioning names , because I shall have occasion to refer to them again . The transaction was one which not only interested the feelings and distressed the heart of 3Ir . Mather at THE M A T H E ft F A U I L Y . DO the time , but it materially affected his situation alter war as . At the request and through the mediation of neighboring ministers , and othe. the members of the new church consented to modify very considerably their original plan , so that Mr. Mather met with them at the dedication of their house of worship , and even consented to preach on the occasion . Still , he was not lied with their proceedings ; and he took occasion to express his dissatisfaction , in a treatise , published in the year 1700 , entitled , " The Order of the Gospel professed by the churches of New England justified . " This gave rise to a reply , and that to a rejoinder , in which more heat and bitterness were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of clerical decency and propriety . Others besides the Mathers were induced to speak out on this occasion , and to utter a solemn note of warning to those who were bent upon departing from the established customs of the churches . It was at this time , that the venerable Higginson , of Salem , and Hubbard , of Ipswich , published their joint " Testimony to the Order of the Gospel in the Churches of New England ; * ' in which they say , " If any who are given to change do rise up , to unhinge the well-established /z/ churches in this land , it will be the duty and interest of the churches to examine , whether the men of this trespass are more prayerful , more watchful , more zealous , more patient , more heavenly , more universally conscientious , and harder students , and better scholars , and more willing to be informed and advised , than those great and good men , who left unto the churches what they now enjoy . If they be not so , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own hands , the houses of God which were built by their wiser fathers , until they have better satisfaction . " Although this controversy so far subsided , as to occasion no palpable breach of fellowship between those concerned in it , t still , a degree of coldness and distance was observable , and they seem to have been the objects of mutual suspicion and jealousy , during the greater part of their lives . This was the more unhappy for Mr. Mather , because those whose measures he had felt constrained to oppose , were the men chiefly concerned , at least for a time , in the direction and government of Harvard College . /z/ As before remarked , Mr. Mather returned from England , and the government of the province was organized under the new charter , in 1692 . In the same year , he prepared a charter for the College , which received the sanction of the General Court . It was afterwards negatived by the kins ; but while it continued in force , and the corporation had authority under it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degree of Doctor of Divinity . It is remarkable , that this degree had never before been conferred in Briti. -h America ; nor was it conferred again , until , almost eighty years afterwards , it was bestowed on his grandson , Rev. Samuel Mather , and on Rev. Nathaniel Appleton , of Cambridge . Repeated attempts were made , during the next seven or eight years , to procure a charter for the College , which should receive the sanction of the kinj ; ; and in more than one instance , President Mather seemed on the point of embarking for England , with a view to the furtherance of this important object . But , for one cause or another , all these attempts failed , and the College continued in an unsettled and embarrassed state . During the troubles of this period , President Mather proposed , in repeated instances , to resign his office ; but the proposition was discouraged and resisted /z/ by the corporation . It was an object with the General Court to induce him to resign his pastoral charge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied that this was his duty . To gratify the friends of the College , he did remove to Cambridge for a few months ; but neither he nor his family seem to have been happy , nor were his people willing that he should be taken from them . Consequently , he soon returned to Boston . It was this question of residence which finally closed his connection with the College . He seems not properly to have resigned his office ; but on his refusing to reside at Cambridge , the duties of it passed out of his hands , and devolved on those of Rev. Samuel Willard , who was appointed vice-president . That Dr. 3Iather was faithful and successful in the office of President , notwithstanding the many disadvantages under which the office was sustained , is testified by all who have written on the subject . Mr. Peirce , in his valuable History of Harvard University , says , " Dr. Mather 's services at the College were assiduous and faithful . The moral and religious instruction of the students had his particular attention . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ - while he was at its head . Its numbers increased , and it was enriched , in no small degree , by the hand of munificence . " President Quincy , also , says , " That Dr. Mather was well qualified for the office of President , and had conducted himself in it faithfully and laboriously , is attested by the history of the College , the language of the Legislature , and the acknowledgment of his cotemporaries. " t He was particularly concerned for the spiritual welfare of his pupils . lie preached to them statedly every week , advised them as to what books they should read , and cautioned them against such as he considered hurtful . He used frequently to send for them separately into the library , and there pray and converse with them , warning them of the terrible consequences of continued impenitence , and charging them to turn from their sins and live . His farewell address to his pupils , on taking leave of the College , concludes as follows : " And now , my dear children , what shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to many of you , ( and that it might be all ! ) I shall meet you with joy at the right hand of Christ , in the great day of his appearing and /z/ kingdom , when both you and I shall rejoice that he ever brought me , and placed me among you . But if any of you prove so miserable as to die in your sins , I earnestly protest unto you this day , that I shall testify against you before the Lord Jesus Christ , in that I have called upon you , both publicly and privately , to make sure of an interest in him . I am pure , therefore , from the blood of your souls ; and if any of you ( which mercy prevent ) shall perish at the last , your blood shall be upon your own unhappy heads . The Lord is my witness , that I have done the part of a faithful father to you . " Dr. Mather lived , after he had closed his connection with the College , twenty-two years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors , he issued from the press not far from fifty distinct publications , the most of them on important practical subjects . He had less learning than his son , Cotton Mather , and a less exuberance of fancy ; but more sound , practical judgment ,  - -  more common sense . His style will compare with that of the best English authors of the seventeenth century . Dr. Blather was a laborious student all his days . Indeed , prayer and study may be said to have constituted the business of his life . His /z/ people sometimes complained , that they saw him so little in their families . His son informs us , that he commonly spent sixteen hours of the twenty-four in the retirement of his study . Of the character of his piety , a judgment may be formed from what has been already - aid . . Still , it may not be improper to exhibit him more fully in this respect , by a few extracts from his private writings . In a time of great perplexity and worldly embarrassment , he pray- a- follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and answer my prayers , I will love thee , and thank thee , and serve thee . And if thou wilt not provide fur me , still 1 will love thee , and bless thee , and serve thee . If thou wilt cast me oft " , I will not cast thee off . I deserve that thou shouldst cast me off , but thou , Lord , never deservedst ill at my hands . " In a season of deep darkness and spiritual desertion , he says , " I betook myself to Christ , and wept before him , saying , ' Lord Jesus , let me be destroyed , if thou canst find in fhy heart to destroy a poor creature , who desires , above all things , to glorify thy name . Here I am before thee . Do to me , and with me , what thou wilt . If thou wilt glorify thyself in my confusion , thy c /z/ will be done . I have deserved that it should be so . But 0 , that thou wouldst have pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rock that is higher than I , I was revived . " A few days before his death , he prepared a written testimony , as to the design of the pilgrims in the settlement of these colonies , and the obligations that were resting upon their descendants to see this design carried out and consummated . This interesting paper concludes as follows : " And therefore , from the suburbs of that glorious world into which I am now entering , I earnestly testify unto the rising generation , that if they sinfully forsake the God , the hope , and the religious ways of their pious ancestors , the glorious Lord will severely punish their apostasy , and be terrible unto them from his holy places . " In the year 1715 , Dr. Mather received a flattering request from the ministers of the province to go to England on their behalf , and lay the expressions of their loyalty at the feet of George I. , on his accession to the throne : but this he thought proper to decline . " His old age , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction which flows from faith and hope , and from the vigorous exercise of /z/ the faculties and affections . He died , August 23 , 173 , in the 85th year of his age , and was interned with all the honors due to his character , and to the rank he had so long held in society . He had been a preacher sixty-six years , during almost . - ixty of which he was pastor of the Old North Church in Boston . " * Dr. Elliott speaks of him as " the father of the New England clergy , whose name and character were held in veneration , not only by those who knew him , but by succeeding generations . " /z/ It remains that we inquire , more particularly than we have done , into the propriety and correctness of some of the representations which have been made , in our own times , in regard to that venerable father in Israel , of whose life and character a brief sketch has been given . He has been charged , in the first place , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England respecting witchcraft . " That both the Mathers , " says President Quincy , " had an efficient agency in producing and prolonging that excitement , there can be , at this day , no possible question . " How Increase Mather could have had any agency in producing the excitement here referred to , it is hard to conceive . The strange appearances , at Salem village ( now Danvers ) , commenced in Feb- /z/ ruary , 1692 , when President Mather was in England , where he had constantly resided , and been most intensely occupied with the important subject of his agency , for nearly four years . How then could he have been instrumental in producing this excitement 3 And the charge of proloufnmr it is even more unfounded than that of producing it . lie arrived at home , May 14 , 1692 , when the excitement was at its highest point . Shortly afterwards , us soon as it could possibly be prepared , lie published his treatise , entitled , " Cases of Conscience respecting Witchcraft ; " in which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the received doctrine of spectral evidence , on the ground of which so many innocent persons had been tried and condemned . Immediately upon this , Gov . Phipps " pardoned such as had been condemned , " and those that were accused , were , I believe , in all cases acquitted . " The confessors , too , " says an eye-witness , " came as it were out of a dream wherein they had been fascinated ; and the afflicted , in most instances , grew easy . " It would seem from this account , which is the true one , that instead of contributing to prolong the excitement , President Mather was a principal instrument in bringing it to a close . /z/ That he was a believer in witchcraft , there can be no doubt ; as who , in that age , whether learned or unlearned , physicians , ministers , or lawyers , were not believers in it ? Even Thomas Brattle , who wrote a book in opposition to the proceedings of the times , was a believer in the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afflicted , but most of the confessors , " were possessed with the devil , and therefore , not fit to be regarded , as to any thing they say of themselves or others . " I use his own words here . But that Increase Mather had any instrumentality in producing or prolonging the excitement on this subject , we believe to be a groundless accusation . He is expressly mentioned by Mr. Brattle , as one of those 4hat " utterly condemned " the proceedings of the courts , affirming that , if persisted in , they would " ruin and undo poor New England . " Another charge , or rather series of charges , against President Mather , has grown out of his treatment of Messrs . Brattle , Leverett , Colman , and others , in reference to the founding of Brattle Street Church . He is represented as acting , in this instance , under the influence of " excited temper and wounded pride ; " as exhibiting " great violence and personality  --  an ill-governed and overbearing spirit . " He was roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H E K b A M I L Y . ( 37 height of indignation , as to lose all sense of prudence and character ,  --  all patience and self-poflsej - ion . " But after much attention to the subject , I can see no sufficient grounds for these heavy , wholesale accusations . That President 3Iather was conscientiously attached to the order of the New England churches , as lished by the Cambridge Platform , and wi is 1 to discountenance any considerable departure from it , there can be no doubt . That he was especially dissatisfied with those alarming innovations which the Brattles and Mr. Leverett were laboring to introduce , is equally clear.t He would be led , therefore , not by " exeited temper and wounded pride , " but by the dictates of his conscience , and * Quincy 's History , Vol . I , pp. 133  --  14J. t " These men , " says President Quincy , " refused to inquire into the regeneration of communicants ; denied the necessity of explicit covenanting rath God and the church ; admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred admission to the sacraments , to the prudence and conscience of the minister ; and held that admission to the pastoral relation might be valid , without the approbation of neighboring churches . " History , Vol . I , p. 200 . Xow whatever President Quincy may think of these innovations , President Mather certainly deemed them of most alarming import . He saw that , if they were not discountenanced , these churches of New England  --  this " garden of the Lord , " as our fathers termed it  --  would be undone . ( 3S THE M A T H E Ii FAMILY . the fear of God , to oppose these innovations , and to discountenance the men who insisted on promoting them . He would labor by all fair means ( and I have yet to learn that he used any other ) to counteract the example and influence of these men , so far as their objectionable measures were concerned , and to keep the College from falling into their hands . This was one cause , I have no doubt , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the College , to hesitate as to the duty of resigning his office . He had before wished , and repeatedly proposed to resign ; but now he seemed to shrink back from it , well knowing into whose hands the institution was likely to fall . He could not think it right to leave his flock in Boston , and become a resident at Cambridge , but was willing to discharge the office of president , as he had done , to general acceptance , for sixteen years ; and if the legislature would not consent to this , he preferred that they , not he , should take t he responsibility of closing his connection with the College . As little can it be doubted , that those who differed from him on questions of church order were exerting , at this time , a secret influence to get the College out of his hands , hopi:ig and ex- /z/ pecting that it might fall into their own . It was owing , in a great measure , to their influence , that the legislature pursued the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemies " obtained a vote , that no man should act as president of the College , who did not reside at Cambridge , ' 1 well knowing " that Dr. Mather would not remove his habitation from a loving people at Boston , to reside at Cambridge , while the College was as it then was ; " i. e. without a charter , and consequently in an unsettled , embarra state ; " and that in this way , they should get the College out of his hands . " It should be borne in mind , that Mr. Leverett was , at this time , a leading member , and I believe the speaker , of the house of representath I will not say that in President Mather 's controversial publications , growing out of what he honestly conceived to be the irregular constitution of the Brattle Street Church , there are no expressions which we may think unwarrantably severe . But thus much may at least be said ; the controversy was conducted with more decency on his part , than on the other ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed more , probably , to the fashion of the age , than to the spirit and character of the men . And as Mr. /z/ Pcirce justly remarks , " it is unfair to take a man out of his own age , and try kim by the standard of another . " It must be said , also , in relation to this whole controversy , that the points for which President Mather contended , though not strictly points of doctrine , were yet of a vitally important character . So he regarded them ; and so they are regarded by evangelical Christians at the present day . He saw that if the principles of Stoddard , and the Brattles , and Leverett , and many others , in regard to the admission of persons to the church , were generally adopted , the churches would , ere-long , be filled up with unconverted members , and even the pulpits with unconverted ministers , and that the vital power of the gospel , if not its most essential truths , would be lost sifrht of and discarded . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inestimable right of electing , independent ! 7 , their own ministers , very soon they would have ministers placed over them , from whose unholy influence they must flee away , or under it they must consent to remain and be corrupted . The experience of almost a century and a half lias shown that Pres. Mather 's forebodh ; - - were well founded . In regard to many of the pilgrim /z/ churches , the worst that he feared from the mistakes of his contemporaries has been more than realized . And that the desolations resulting in part from the innovations then made , had not an earlier and a wider spread , is owing , in a great degree , to the resistance which he opposed to them . So that now , after the lapse of five generations , we may look hack upon Increase Mather as the man , who , in the face of much obloquy and personal sacrifice , not only gave to Massachusetts a constitution of government , hut saved the great body of her churches from a tide of ruin which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them . Another of the objections to Dr. Mather , relates to his treatment of Governor Dudley . On the 12th of September , 1707 , Vice President AVillard died ; and in the month following , John Leverett was elected President of Harvard College . There can be no doubt that the election was displeasing to Dr. Mather . It is now pretended that he expected himself to be restored to the presidency , or at least , that the office would have been given to his son ; and that he was so angry with Governor Dudley for defeating his own , or his son 's appointment , and favoring the election of Mr. Leverett , that he immediately ad- /z/ dressed to the governor a letter , " breathing a spirit of abuse and virulence , of which the records of party animosity contain but few parallels . " * With respect to this letter to Gov . Dudley , I remark , in the first place , that there is not in it a single word , or the remotest allusion , touching any expectations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for his son . Neither does it contain the slightest allusion to the election of Mr. Leverett , or to any influence which the governor may be supposed to have exerted in favor of that event . Indeed , the letter contains but a single reference to the College , in any way ; and that is quite distinct and remote from the subject of the presidency . In order that we may understand the full purport of this famous letter , it is necessary to know something of the history and character of Governor Dudley . He was the son of Thomas Dudley , one of the first settlers and governors of Massachusetts colony , and was graduated at Harvard College in 1GG5 . In his youth he seemed to be truly religious , and used to speak of Dr. Mather as his " spiritual father . " He was educated for the Christian ministry , and was once talked of as /z/ * Quincy ? 3 History , Vol , I , p. 201 . THE MATHER FAMILY . f 3 collearnic with Dr. Mather in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after which his religious impressions seem to have presented no obstacle in the way of his ambition . He was high in favor with the oppressors of the colony , at the time when the charter was taken away . He was the first officer in the government before Androa arrived , tinder hbn he was President of the Council , and Chief Justice , and was deeply concerned in all the oppressions of these troublous tim In the subsequent revolution , when Andros and his creatures were imprisoned , Dudley was kept in close confinement , and was treateven more harshly than any of them , as being thought more inexcusably guilty . Had it not been for the interposition of Cotton Mather ( for Increase was then in England ) , he would probably have been torn in pieces by the violence of the mob . He was ordered to England to give an account of himself , in 1689 j and the next year he was made Chief Justice of Xew York . While Sir William Phipps was Governor of Massachusetts , Dudley exerted all his influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the government , if by any means it could be got out of his hands . During the short administration of Lord Bellamont , he was intriguing to /z/ secure favor , both , in old England and New , that , if possible , he might be again seated in the chair of his native state . He had always professed a great regard for the Mathers ; he attended frequently , if not statedly on their ministry , when in Boston ; * and he had now the address to procure a letter from Cotton Mather to King William , which had much influence in his favor . He was appointed Governor of Massachusetts in the year 1702 , in which situation he continued during the next fourteen years . " The first seven years , " says Elliot , " were spent in debates in the house of representatives , or in private disputes with men who ceased not to accuse him of artifice and deception , of arbitrary conduct , and of enmity even to those privileges which they had obtained by the new charter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , that Dr. Mather , considering the relations that had subsisted between himself and the governor , and the favors which he had conferred upon him , and being wearied and * In a letter to Increase Mather , dated May 17 , 1686 , Dudley pay- . " For the things of my soul I have these many years hung upon - our lips , and ever shall ; and in civil things , I am desirous you may know , with all plainness , my reasons of procedure , and that they may he satisfactory to you . " /z/ disgusted with the course of his administration , addressed to him the letter of which we speak . It is a plain , searching , faithful letter , such as few governors of Dudley 's character ever received , and for which he had much more reason to be grateful than to be angry . It is too long to be published entire in these p A brief analv- is all that I can at present offer . In the fir. -t place , Dr. Mather expr his fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he mentions several instances of this nature which had been sworn to by some of the most respectable men in the provin Next , he acquaints the governor with his fears , that ' - he had been contriving to destroy the charter privileges of the province , " and introduce another government like that of Andros . And jJr . Bancroft , in his Histcry of the United States , assures us that this was true . He says expressly that " Gov . Dudley , and for a season his son also , became the active opponents of the chartered liberties of New England , endeavoring to effect their overthrow , and the establishment of a general government , as in the days of Andros . ' " It was about this time that a letter from Mr. Paul /z/ Dudley , son of the governor , addressed to the English court , was intercepted , in which he says , " This country ( New England ) will never be worth living in , for lawyers and gentlemen , till the charter is taken away . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of chancery in this country . " In the third place , Dr. Mather expresses to the governor his fears , that he had been hypocritical and inconsistent , in respect to the College ; particularly ( if I understand him ) in his attempts to revive , by mere provincial authority , the old college charter of 1650 , which he had often before represented as dead , and never to be revived but by the assent of the king . And President Quincy is of the same opinion with Dr. Mather , on this subject . He represents this act of Dudley , in reviving the old college charter , as " irreconcilable with the duties growing out ot the relation in which he stood to the British crown , " and in contradiction to the " principles which he had openly asserted and maintained . " In the fourth place , Dr. Mather says , " I am /z/ afraid that the guilt of innocent blood is still crying in the ears of the Lord against you . I mean the blood of Leisler and Milburn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the revolution in New York , at the time of the accession of William and Mary ; and were publicly executed , under sentence of Dudley , while he was Chief Justice of that province . Lord Bellamont afterwards declared , that " these men were not only murdered , but barbarously murdered . " Mr. Bancroft , in his History , also speaks of their execution as " judicial murder . " Dr. Mather 's fifth and last fear for the governor was , that " the Lord is offended with you , in that you ordinarily forsake the worship of God , in the holy church with which you are connected , in the afternoon of the Lord 's day ; and spend the whole time , after the public exercise , with some persons reputed very ungodly men . " In conclusion , Dr. Mather says , " How glad should I be , if I could receive satisfaction , that my fears of your being faulty in the matters I have faithfully mentioned to you are groundless . But if it be otherwise , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without respect of persons ; and I shall rejoice if it may /z/ be my dying testimony . I am now aged , expecting and longing for my departure out of the world every day . I trust in Christ that , when I . am gone , I shall obtain a good report of my having been faithful before him . To his mercy I commend you , " &c.; Such is the famous letter of Increase Mather to Governor Dudley ; a letter which , it has been recently affirmed , and that , too , on high authority , " breathes a spirit of abuse and virulence , of which the records of party animosity contain but few parallels . " I have only to say , that I think not so ; and I doubt not that this community , when they come to understand the subject , will wonder that such language could have been used respecting it . For who , I must ask again , was this Governor Dudley ? What was his character , in the estimation both of his contemporaries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before the letter of Dr. Mather was written , a memorial was presented to " the Queen 's most excellent majesty , " and signed by twenty of the more distinguished friends of New England , some in this country and some in London , accusing him of nothing less than treason ,  --  the supply- /z/ ing of the open enemies of his country with provisions and ammunition/* Gov . Hutchinson says of Dudley , " Ambition was his ruling passion ; and , perhaps , like Caesar , he had rather be the first man in New England , than the second in Old . " * Mr. Bradford represents him as " one covetous both of power and wealth , and as probably seeking for the former as the best means of obtaining the latter . " Mr. Brancroft says , " The character of Dudley wa - that of profound selfishness . " He " loved neither freedom , nor his native land . " He " is left without one to palliate his selfishness . " ! It was no disgrace to Dr. Mather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , before quite abandoning him , he was disposed to deal with him in a plain and faithful manner . His letter to Dudley is one of the last things that should be seized upon , as furnishing matter of objection to his character . It is further objected to Dr. Mather , that lie was , to a great and even ridiculous extent , the dupe of his own impressions ,  --  impressions receiv- /z/ ed for the most part , in prayer , and which he deemed of an almost supernatural character . The impression of this kind which has been chiefly commented on , and in the issue of which he was disappointed , was one which he cherished from about the year 1693 to the end of the century , in reference to an anticipated return to England . It was often impressed on him during this period , that " God would return him to England , and there give him an opportunity , in some way , greatly to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ . " He seems to have desired such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened for the accomplishment of his wishes . But from various causes , he was disappointed . His accusers have seized hold of these impressions , and made them matters of ridicule and reproach . They talk of his " genuflexions , and prostrations , and spiritual elevations , " and " glorious , heartmelting persuasions , " in a manner which we deem offensive both to piety and taste ; and finally resolve the whole into " the natural wishes of his own heart ,  --  the cravings of an ambitious spirit . " In reference to the subject here suggested , I /z/ remark , in the first place , that the current opinions and language of our father. - , in. respect to various matters , were so different from ours , that if we are disposed to take them out of our own age , and from among their own contemporaries , and judge of them by our standards ) it is not difficult to make them appear ridiculous . For example , if all that the apostolic Elliot said and wrote , with regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected together , how easy it would be to turn him into ridicule ; or if Governor Winthrop 's account of the terrible judgment which befell Mrs. Dyer , in consequence of her having imbibed the errors of Mrs. Hutchinson , were copied out , and held prominently up to the gaze and disgust of modern eyes , not only the excellent Governor , but many of his contemporaries , might be made to appear ridiculous enough . But it may be questioned whether such a procedure would be fair or generous ; and I have the same scruples as to the propriety of ransacking the diaries of the Mathers , in search of materials for ridicule and reproach , and especially for turning into ridicule their more secret and solemn acts of devotion . But to come nearer to the serious subjects in hand . While I dissent entirely from much that /z/ has been written , in our own times , in respect to what has been called " the progress of faith , " as being not only unscriptural , but of dangerous tendency ; I still believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prayer ; yes , internal heart-melting , heart-dissolving communion ;  --  such as the venerable Mather sometimes enjoyed , when he prostrated himself in secret before God , and wet his study floor with tears . I believe , too , that Christians who abound in prayer , have sometimes such sensible assistance in their supplications for particular favors , that they can hardly resist the conclusion , when they rise from the duty , that the things prayed for will be bestowed . For they reason thus : God would not have afforded me such special assistance in praying for this or that event , if he had not intended to hear the prayer , and grant the request . I see nothing enthusiastical or unreasonable in a conclusion such as this ; though , to be sure , we are not infallible in judgments of this nature , and they should be formed and followed with much prudence and caution . I regard the two Mathers , father and son , as eminently persons of prayer . They observed more private fasts and vigils , and spent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ more ,  --  than was common with Christians , then or now . And not only so , there was , if we may judge from their private writings , a spirit , a fervor in their devotions ,  --  a nearness and intimacy of communion with God ,  --  which has been rarely attained in this world of sin . These men believed , not only in the dut- , but in the efficacy of prayer . They expected answers to their prayers . Xot unfrequently , they had strong impr sions , amounting almost to an assurance , that certain events in providence were about to take place . And in some instances , they did take place . 3Ien may account for such dispensations as they will ; of the fact of their occurrence there can be no doubt . To give but a single example . In the month of November , 1G7G , Dr. Mather had it strongly impressed on his mind , that Boston was about to be visited with a destructive fire . He spoke of it in his sermons , and publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the night following the second Sabbath , the fire broke out ; his meeting-house was laid in ashes ; and " whole streets were consumed in the devouring flames . " Still , Dr. Mather was liable to be deceived by his impressions ; and in regard to his anticipated return to England , he certainly was deceiv- /z/ ed . Yet I see nothing in this , which should justly expose him to ridicule or reproach . This particular impression seems to have exerted little or no influence ,  --  certainly no bad influence on his conduct . He nikrht have returned to England , in several instances , if he had been so disposed ; but the way in providence did not seem to him to be open . His duty was not plain . And until it was plain , his impression had no influence to induce him to go . His recorded feeling in reference to the whole matter was , " Lord , if it will be more to thy glory that I should go to England , than for me to continue here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The Lord overrule this affair to his own glory , and so as that I may see his holy hand pointing me what I should do . " Here , surely , is an unfeigned and entire submission to the will of God ;  --  a feeling as unlike as possible to the restless longings of a selfish mind ,  --  " the cravings of an ambitious spirit . " I can not conclude the discussion of this topic in words more appropriate than those of Cotton Mather himself . " Christians , reproach not a particular faith , as if there never were a gracious work of heaven in it . But yet be cautioned against laying too much stress upon it , lest ye find yourselves incautiously plunged into a hope /z/ that will make ashamed . A particular faith may be a work of God ; but the counterfeits of this jewel are so very fine , that it will require a judgment almost more than human to discern them . It is best that you should be content with the ordinary satisfaction of praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious resignations to his will , and annihilations of your own , as an uncertainty about issues would most properly lead you to . " * Our modern accusers of Dr. Mather charge him with being influenced , almost perpetually , b* worldly , selfish , and ambitious motives . And they think themselves fully entitled to do this , because , in consequence of having access to his diary , they know the motives by which he was influenced . " Of the emotions and master-passions of his eventful presidency , we are enabled to speak , " say they , " with great certainty . " " President Mather and his son both kept diaries , in which they have recorded their motives and purposes ; so that , in relation to either , there can hardly be any mistake . " ! In reference to this soft of diary-evidence , of which so much use has /z/ been made , I feel bound , in passing , to offer a few remarks . And I " ask , in the first place , is it quite fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distinguished men ? These diaries were written , not for the public eye , but for their own private inspection ; or at most , for the inspection of some few personal , family friends . Is it right , then , to lay hold upon them , and drag them out before the public , and turn them to a use for which they never were intended ? Most men say things at their own firesides , and in presence of their families , which they would not wish to have published to the world . And if some impertinent listener were to treasure them up , and make them public , who would not be disposed to complain of the injury ? Most men write letters , and maintain in this way a social , confidential correspondence with absent friends . And who would be willing that , some hundred and fifty years after he was dead , the whole body of his more private letters , or the more objectionable parts of them , should be spread out to public view ? Almost all ministers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the habit of keeping diaries ; in which they recorded their private thoughts , their religious impressions , and the /z/ more important transactions of their lives . But can it be right , at this day , for their successor their descendants , those into whose hands their private papers have fallen , to make an indiscriminate exhibition of these papers to the world ? As well might they strip their venerable ancestors of their wigs and bands , and send them into ' the pulpit in their shirts and nightgown- . Besides ; the real import of the diaries of evangelical Christians is not unfrequently misunderstood , especially by those who do not sympathize with them in their religious feelings and views . Such Christians record , in their closet- , the sense they feel of their many imperfections , their great sinfulness in the sight of God ; and persons who have less conscience of sin than they , and less sorrow for it , infer from the record , either that they were gross hypocrites , or that they had secretly been guilty of abominable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent intimations of his great sinfulness , and the depth of his self-abasement , inferred that he must have been secretly a very wicked man . And Mr. Bancroft has no doubt , from Cotton Mather 's account of his temptations and repentings , that his conscience troubled him /z/ for the part he had taken against the witches . I once knew a man , who bitterly hated what he termed " the Evangelicals ; " and because he had little else to allege against them , he used to appeal , for evidence , to their prayers . " Go and hear the wretches pray . We need no further evidence of guilt . They confess themselves to have committed the most abominable crimes . " There was about as much sense and justice in this kind of reasoning , as in the conclusions which arc sometimes drawn from the humble confessions of Christians in their diaries . Because Job " abhorred himself , and repented in dust and ashes ; " and Isaiah confessed himself to be " a man of unclean lips ; " and Paul groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be inferred that these men were hypocrites ; or that they lived in the indulgence of palpable wickedness /z/ But I have not yet done with this species of diary evidence . " When the diary does not treat of religious experience , but of the common affairs of life , there is reason to receive the testimony with much caution and allowance . For what is /z/ this testimony ? It is not that of an individual under oath . Neither is it the word of one who is writing a history ,  --  writing for posterity ,  - -  stating what he has thoroughly inquired into , and knows to be fact . In the sensible language of a reviewer in the North American , " The writer of a diary puts down his present impressions , which may be materially erroneous , for want of the explanations which a little more time may bring . " Where friendships or dislikes are concerned , or questions of conduct are at issue , he makes his record under the influence of feelings which may bias him from the juster conclusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony is to be produced , when both he , and they who may be harmed by it , are no more , it is simply the testimony of a witness , who can not be cross-examined , against one accused , who can not speak for himself ;  --  a kind of evidence , which no acknowledged principle or process of justice approves . " I have presented these remarks , more because they seemed to be demanded by the general subject , than because of their necessity in order to a vindication of President 3Iather . His accusers are " enabled to speak with great certainty of /z/ his motives and master-passions , " because they have got possession of his diary , or of certain parts of it ; and under the shelter of such a caption , they proceed to charge upon him selfish , base , ambitious motives , in many of the more important transactions of his life . But does the diary bear them out in these accusations ? Does President Mather record in his diary that he really was influenced by such motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but frequently the very opposite . In repeated instances , as I might fully show , were it necessary to go into particulars , the diary assigns one motive for some- transaction , and his accusers another ; the diary assigns a good motive , and they impute a base and selfish one . Now what we complain of here is , that having appealed to the diary , they do not stick to it . They can quote the diary , so long as any thing can be found there which , judged of by our modern standards , . can be turned into ridicule or reproach ; but when the diary assumes another character , it can be readily dispensed with , or directly contradicted ? Finally , the accusers of Dr. Mather sum up his character in the following words : He was " restless , obtrusive , excitable , boastful of his public services , and disposed to complain of THE MATHER f A M 1 L V . 91 neglect and ingratitude . " " He was a partisan by profession ; always harnessed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statesman ; now mingling with the multitude ; exciting the clergy in the synod , and the congregation in the pulpit , and the people in the halls of the popular assembly . " In short , his whole life was " one series of theological and political controversy . "  --  Violent doctrinal dissensions were by him excited and perpetuated in the churches , " through a long course of years/* And yet this is the man , whom Dr. Elliot describes as " the father of the New England clergy ; whose name and character were held in veneration , not only by those who knew him , but by succeeding generations . " This is the man who , to borrow the language of the general court , by " unwearied , indefatigable labor and service , voluntarily undertaken for the good of his country , " performed without charge , " attended with much difficulty and hazard to his person , " and followed by much obloquy from fiery demagogues ,  --  saved Massachusetts from revolution and bloodshed , and gave to her a charter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . This is the man who , by his resistance to unscriptural and alarming innovations , kept back the tide of spiritual desolation from rolling over the churches of the Pilgrims , for a series of years , arid greatly restricted its ravages when , at length , it came ; and the man to whom , I think , Xew England is more indebted , ecclesiastically and civilly , than to any other individual among her sons ;  --  the man who , when he died , was " honored with a greater funeral , " says an eyewitness , " than had ever been seen in these parts of the world , " and in consequence of whose death " the pulpits throughout the country rang with mingled eulogies and funeral lamentations . " But further attempts at vindication would be superfluous . We leave the venerable President Mather to his rest . It will not be disturbed , nor will his reputation permanently suffer by any attempts , at this late day , to tarnish and reproach it . The shafts of his revilers will be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall injuriously on him . /z/ The individual of whom I am now to speak was the eldest son of Dr. Increase Mather , and grandson of the celebrated John Cotton ; in consequence of which he was named Cotton Mather . He was born in Boston , Feb. 12 , 1662 . When a boy at school , he endeavored to persuade his youthful companions to become persons of prayer , and even wrote for them some forms of devotion . He had also the courage to " reprove his play-mates for their wicked words and practices . " At the age of fourteen , he began to observe days of secret fasting and prayer ; on which days he was accustomed to read deliberately and devoutly as many Bfl fifteen chapters of the Bible . He entered college when but twelve years old , and graduated with distinguished applause , at the age of sixteen . At this early period , he matured and disciplined his understanding , by drawing up systems of the sciences , and writing remarks upon the books which he had read . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the church , after a careful and most methodical examination of himself , and with the fullest consecration of his entire beim* to the Saviour . It had been his intention , almost from childhood , to become a minister of the gospel ; but for a time after leaving college , his desires in this respect seemed not likely to be gratified . He had acquired , from some cause , the habit of stammering , which threatened to disqualify him entirely , as a public speaker . While suffering from this infirmity , he entered with great zeal upon the study of medicine , determined that if he could not , as a minister , be directly useful to the souls of men , he would endeavor to ' be useful to their bodies . At length , however , he was enabled to overcome the impediment in his speech ; * when he returned with renewed ardor to his theological studies , and commenced preaching before he was * He overcame the disagreeable habit of stuttering or stammering , by following the advice of a Mr. Cc*let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be glad if you would oblige yourself to a dilated deliberation in speaking ; for as in singing no one stammers , so by prolonging your pronunciation , you will form the habit of speaking without hesitancv. " /z/ eighteen years of age . He was ordained colleague pastor of the Xorth Church in Boston , in connection with his venerable father , May 13 , 1684 . In this situation he spent the remainder of his days , unwearied in his exertions to promote the glory of God , and the highe. -t welfare of his fellow-men 3Ir . Mather was three times married , and had fifteen children , only two of whom survived him . Jiut although he had so many bereavements in his family , he did not faint in the day of adversity . He thought that his chastisements should rather quicken than hinder him , in his various endeavors to do good . Nothing could exceed the diligence and earnestness with which he entered on the task of educating his children , and training them up in the knowledge and fear of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work assiduously , fulfilling , perhaps to the letter , the direction of God to his ancient people : " These words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart ; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children , and shalt talk of them , when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up , " Deut. 6 : 7 . His /z/ instructions and labors were all of them accompanied with fervent prayer , and in respect to those of his children who came to years of maturity , they seem to have been followed with much success . One of the earliest manifestations of the Christian life , in the case of Cotton Mather , was his desire to be useful . He commenced by instructing his brothers and sisters , exhorting the domestics in his father 's house , and doing them every service in his power . He imposed it on himself as a rule , never to go into company where it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself useful . When very young , he commenced devoting a tenth of all his substance to charitable purposes ; a practice which he continued  --  though the proportion of a tithe was often exceeded  --  to the end of life . Mr. Mather seems to have anticipated , while a youth , that plans of usefulness , then unimagined , would ere-long be opened . " A vast variety of new ways to do good will be hit upon ; paths which no fowl of the best flight at noble designs has yet known , where the vulture 's most piercing eye hath not seen , and where lions of the strongest resolution have never passed . " /z/ It was under the influence of impressions such as these , that he engaged in the composition of his well known work entitled , " Essays to do Good ; " a work which Dr. Franklin read in younger life , and to which he ascribes " all the good that he ever did to his country , or to mankind . " * To increase the power of doing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar to that which is now in such active operation thoughout the world .

" /z/ Bible and the gospel to other nations , and in labors for the benefit of tradesmen , soldiers and seamen . There is scarcely a department of Christian benevolence , which has been thought of in later times , in which Mr. Mather , single-handed and alone , did not attempt to do something . He deplored the prevaling vice of intemperance , wrote and published much against it , and widely circulated some of his publications . Perceiving that the colored people ( of which there were many at that time in Boston ) had not those advantages of instruction which were necessary in order to their becoming interested in religion , he established a school in which they were taught to read . " And he himself bore the whole expense of it , paying the instructress for her services at the close of every week . " He also published an essay on the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge a copy in every family in New England that has a negro in it , and also to send numbers of them to the West Indies . " He moreover exerted himself for the special benefit of seamen , though it may be feared without much success . In order to systematize as much as possible /z/ his efforts to do good , Mr. Mather had a series of questions on the subject , for every day in the week . His question for Sabbath morning constantly was , " ' What shall I do , as pastor of a church , for the good of the people of my charge ? " Monday morning , " What shall I do in my family , and for the good of it ? " Tuesday morning , " What shall I do for my relatives abroad ? " Or , " What good shall I do for my personal enemies ; and how shall I overcome evil with good ? " Wednesday morning , " What shall I do for the churches of Christ , and for the more general interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What good may I do in the several societies with which I* am connected ? " " He was connected , " says his biographer , " with above twenty societies of a moral and religious character ; every one of which he would occasionally visit , to do something in them , and for them . " Friday morning , " What special subjects of affliction , or objects of compassion , may I take under my particular care ; and what shall I do for them ? " Saturday morning , " What more have I to /z/ do for the interest of God in my own heart and life ? " These questions , it will be understood , came up for consideration , in regular succession , day after day , and year after year . Nor were they dismissed with only a transient reflection . He was accustomed to go into them methodically and fully ; and to perform the good , or at least to attempt it , which he regarded as within his power . Thus did Cotton Mather continually . In labors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mather was unwearied and abundant . He kept a list of all the members of his church , and " resolved that , in his secret prayers , he would go over the catalogue upon his knees , noticing each individual by name , and praying for the most suitable blessings he cloud think of , to be bestowed upon each person . " He devoted more time than was usual at that day to the practice of visiting his people from house to house , conversing and praying with separate families . In the course of his visits , he distributed a great number of Bibles and other religious books . We are assured , on good authority , that he sometimes gave away more than a thousand a year ; and this at a period /z/ when books for gratuitous distribution were less numerous , and much more expensive , than the j are at present . Nor were his labors for the spiritual good of his people without success . During the first year of his ministry , says his biographer , no. less than " thirty declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under God , of their awakening and conversion ; and many , many ( God knows how many , ) have since been , by his addresses to them , either by tongue or pen , brought home to God . " Mr. Mather had less to do with public , civil ail'airs than his father ; and yet he was not entirely unoccupied in this way . At the time of the revolution , when Andros and his subalterns were stripped of their much abused power , he addressed a meeting of the inhabitants of Boston , dissuading them from acts of violence , and from all such excesses as would be injurious to their cause . At the request of some of the principal citizens , he also prepared a long written declaration , having the same object in view , which was read from the gallery of the town house . It was his interposition in this way as his son informs us , which " saved the fallen oppressors from a tragical fate ; for had a single syllable been said by any man of /z/ influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had inflicted them , they would have been put to death without mercy or delay . " Mr. Mather was of inestimable benefit to the inhabitants of Boston , and indeed of the whole country , by his efforts to introduce among them the practice of inoculation for the small pox . He was opposed in these efforts by many of the clergy , and by all the physicians except one ; but he persevered until the practice was introduced , and the advantages of it were generally acknowledged . The objections to inoculation which he had to encounter were chiefly of an ethical or theological character . It was not thought to be right to create a disease , with a view to prevent a disease . The practice was denounced , as a presumptuous and sinful tempting of God . I close what I have to say as to the usefulness of 3Ir . Mather , and the pleasure he felt in doing good , with an extract from his own private writings . " I am able , " he says , " with little study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweets of all the sciences , which the more polite part of mankind ordinarily pretend to . I am entertained with all kinds of histories , /z/ ancient and modern . I am no stranger to the curiosities which , by all sorts of learning , are brought to the curious . These intellectual pleasures are far beyond any sen.sual ones . Nevertheless , all this affords me not so much delight , as it does to relieve the distresses of any one poor , mean , miserable neighbor ; and much more , to do any thing to advance the kingdom of God in the world . " His habitual conduct , adds his biographer , was altogether consonant to these declarations . " In regard to literature , or an acquaintance with books of all kinds , " says Dr. Chauncy , " I give the palm to Cotton Mather . No native of this country had read so much , or retained more of what he read . He was the greatest redeemer of time I ever knew , and lost as little of it as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely any books written , but he had , somehow or other , got the sight of them . His own library was the largest , by far , of any private one on the continent . He was always reading or writing , and he had the happiest talent of going rapidly through a book . He knew more of the history of this country than any man in it ; and could he have conveyed his knowledge with proportionable judgment , he would have given the best /z/ history of it . " Thus far the testimony of Dr. Chauncy . And what he said in his day , I have no doubt may be said with equal truth now . In point of learning , in the stricter application of the term , as denoting a general acquaintance with books , Cotton Mather was the most learned man that New England ever bred . Dr. Chauncy remarks above , that Mr. Mather " had the happiest talent of going rapidly through a book . " His son informs us how he did this . " In two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell whether it would make any additions to his stock of ideas . If it would not , he quickly laid it by . If otherwise , passing over those parts which contained the things he had known before , and perusing those only which contained what was new . These he pencilled as he went along , and at the end reduced the substance to his common-place book , to be reviewed at leisure ; and all this with wonderful celerity . Nor was his common-place book the only treasury of his rich ideas . It was but a security that he might not lose them . He had them at command , on the most sudden incidents , and in common conversation , which had , therefore , always something new , and was ever entertaining and instructive . It was by this means that he had the most agreeable and effectual way /z/ of reproving a friend for what appeared amior of exciting to a neglected duty , that I ever met with . Instead of doing this directly , which might have been too offensive , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pleasant narrative , which he had ready at hand for all occasions ; and being extremely suitable , would leave his friend to the most pungent application . " As might be expected from much that has been said , Mr. Mather was most diligent and systematic in the improvement of time . He lived and worked very much by rule . Every day and hour had its assigned duties , and every duty its appropriate time and place . He had written in capitals over his study-door , to be seen and read by every visitant , Be short . And yet , says his biographer , " when a friend came to see him , he threw all by , was perfectly easy , and made himself so very entertaining , that his visitor knew not how to leave him . " Mr. Mather had an extensive correspondence with philosophers and literary characters , in different languages , and in various parts of the world . In particular , he had a free correspondence with the celebrated Francke , a leader among the Pietists of Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took a deep /z/ interest in this then infant university , and obtained important benefactions for it , both in this country and in England . He held a correspondence , also , with the Danish missionaries at Tranquebar , the most of whom were educated under Franeke , at Halle . Although the contrary opinion may have been entertained respecting Mr. Mather , he really was , considering the age in which he lived , a man of uncommon liberality of sentiment . It was a settled principle with him , as it had been with his father before him , " that the man who is a good neighbor , and a good subject , has a right to his life , and to the comforts of it ; and that it is not his being of this or that opinion in religion , but his doing of something which directly tends to the hurt of human society , by which this right can be forfeited/ ' In the year 1710 , the University of Glasgow conferred on Mr. Mather the degree of Doctor of Divinity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Society , London . His publications , in all , amounted to three hundred and eightythree . Besides these , he left several large works in manuscript , among which was his " Biblia Americana , or the Sacred Scriptures of Iho Old /z/ and New Testament , illustrated ; ' '  --  sufficient of itself to make three folio volumes. * It will be inferred from much that has been said , that Mr. Mather was a man of prayer . He was preeminently so . Besides his daily secret devotions , it appears from his diary , that he kept , in one year , no less than sixty private fasts , and twenty vigils . His son thinks that , on a moderate calculation , he kept between four and five hundred fasts , in the course of his public life . Indeed , he seems to have acquired the habit of turning almost every thing into prayer . The most common occurrences of life were made the occasion of lifting up his soul to God , in pious , appropriate ejaculations . But with all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses and imperfections . He was inclined to vanity ; a disposition which was fostered , if not created , by the excessive praise which was lavished on him , and the high expectations which he knew were entertained respecting him , in youth . On the day when he left college , he was spoken of by President Oakes , publicly , in presence of himself and of a great assembly , in terms of /z/ honor which might have been expected to ruin him. * 3Ir . Mather seems to have had more genius than judgment ; more learning than taste ; a greater facility for acquiring knowledge , than skill in arranging and employing it . He was naturally credulous , and was inclined to the marvelous , to a degree which exposed him to frequent impositions . His knowledge of human nature , having been acquired rather from books than from the living world , was necessarily defective ; on which account his intercourse with the world was less useful , and , at times , less agreeable than might otherwise have been expected . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which terminated his life . In the note calling his physician , he made use of these words : 11 My last enemy is come ; or , I would rather say , my best friend . " " When asked by one of his church if he was d 3iroufl to be gone , he replied , " I dare not say that I am , nor yet that I am not . I would be entirely resigned unto God . " " When his physician expressed to him the opinion that he could not recover , he lifted up his hands , and /z/ said , " Thy will be done on earth , as it is in heaven . " Taking the hand of his nephew , * " " who stood near him , he said , " 31 y dear son , I do , with all possible affection , recommend you to the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ . Take my hand and my heart full of blessings . " A fewhours before his death , he remarked , " Xow I have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the will of God . " When it came to the last , he said , " Is this dying ? Is this all ? Is this all that I feared , when I prayed against a hard death ? 0 , I can bear this ! I can bear it ! I can bear it ! " When his wife wiped his disordered eye , he said , " I shall be , in a few moments , where all tears shall be wiped away . " ' Indeed , the entire closing scene of this great and good man was triumphant and happy . He died , February 13 , 1728 , when he had just completed his sixty-fifth year . He was followed to the grave by an immense concourse of peopleamong whom were all the high officers of government . " It was the general sentiment , " says one of his biographers , " that a great and good man had fallen . " /z/ Haying briefly sketched the life and character of the Ptev . Cotton Mather , it remains that I attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done consistently with truth , from some of the aspersions which , in our own times , have been heaped upon him . The first and most formidable of the objections referred to , is that growing out of Mr. Mather 's supposed connection with the subject of witchcraft . This , therefore , it will be necessary to examine at some length , and with care . In the first place , I remark , that Cotton Mather was a sincere and earnest believer in the reality , and not unfrccpient occurrence , of what , in his day , was denominated witchcraft . He also believed that the crime of witchcraft , when proved , was justly punishable with death . Nor was his faith in regard to those points at all singular . It THE MATHER FAMILY . Ill was the common faith , of Christendom ; and had been so for hundreds of years . Persons who have not attended particularly to the subject , can have no idea of the extent to which the supposed crime of witchcraft has prevailed in different countries , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of the sixteenth century , not only hundreds , but thousands were put to- death ,  --  many of them by the extremcst tortures ,  --  in Germany , France , and Spain , under the imputation of witchcraft . In 1612 , fifteen persons were indicted and twelve executed , in Lancashire , England ; and in 1634 , seventeen more were put to death in the same county . The Rev. Thomas Cooper , one of the ministers of this county , in his " Mystery of Witchcraft , " published in 1617 , says , " Doth not every assize , almost , throughout the land , resound of the arraignment and conviction of notorious witches ? " Between the years 1614 and 1616 , the celebrated witch-hunter , Mathew Hopkins , was encouraged and employed to visit different parts of England , ferret out those who dealt with familiar spirits , and in bringing them to justice . Through his instrumentality , sixteen were executed at Yarmouth , fifteen at Chelmsford , one at Cambridge , several in Huntingdon , and sixty in the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Matthew Hale presided at the trial of two females in Suffolk , supposed to be witches , both of whom were condemned and executed . At these trials , Sir Thomas Brown attended as a witness , who " declared his opinion in favor of the reality of witchcraft , and entered into a particular discussion of the subject before the jury . " Near the close of the seventeenth century , many were tried and condemned in England under the administration of Chief Justice Holt . It is stated by Mr. Upham , that in this century alone ( the seventeenth ) , " more than two hundred were hanged in England , thousands were burned in Scotland , and large numbers perished in various parts of Europe , " for the supposed crime of witchcraft . In the year 1670 , eighty-five witches were condemned in Sweden , the most of whom , if not all , were burned and executed . There were alo thirty-six children that ran the gauntlet , and twenty were whipped every Sunday at the church door for three weeks together , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the seventeenth ) , a narrative of an alleged case of witchcraft was publi. - hcd in France , under the title of 11 The Devil of Mascon . " The celebrated Robert /z/ Boyle " gave his sanction to the work , promoted the translation of it into English , and publicly declared his belief of the supernatural transaction it related . " Sir William BlacksttMie , the great oracle of British law , who died no longer ago than 1780 , declared his belief in witchcraft in the following terms : " To deny the possibility , nay , the actual existence of witchcraft and sorcery , is at once flatly to contradict the revealed word of Grod , in various passages , both of the Old and New Testaments ; and the thine : itself , is a truth to which every nation in the world hath , in its turn , borne testimony , either by examples seemingly well-attested , or by prohibitory laws , which at least suppose the possibility of commerce with evil spirits . " In New England , at the time of Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been universal . The most experienced physicians who were called to prescribe for the afflicted persons , and the most eminent ministers who were invited to pray with them , did not hesitate to pronounce them bewitched . Even those persons who had the least sympathy with the Mathers on some subjects , as Thomas and William Brattle , John Leverett , and . Robert Calef , all agreed with them as to the reality of witchcraft. /z/ In the year 1694 , two years subsequent to the execution at Salem , a paper was issued by the President and Fellows of Harvard College , and signed , among others , by Samuel Willard , John Leverett and William Brattle , inviting observation and information concerning " apparitions , possessions , enchantments and all extraordinary things , wherein the existence and agency of the invisible world is more sensibly demonstrated . " 2s or was the belief in witchcraft in this country confined to New England . In the early settlement of Pennsylvania , William Penn presided on the bench at the trial of two Swedish women for witchcraft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for some technical error in the indictment . The French and Dutch ministers of New York , when their opinion was asked by the Chief Justice of that province , replied in writing , " If we believe in no venefic witchcraft , we must renounce the Scripture of God , and the consent of almost all the world . " The last book that the celebrated Richard Baxter ever published , was a treatise on the immortality of the soul , and the reality of the world of spirits , established by undoubted cases of apparitio ? is , possessions , witchcrafts , &c; ; and so late as /z/ the year 1720 , Dr. Isaac Watts , in a letter to Cotton Mather respecting the Salem witchcraft , say. - , " Iain persuaded that there was much immediate agency of the Devil in those affairs , and perhaps there were some real witches . " I have cited these testimonies for the purpose of showing at one view , how general , and I might almost say universal , was the belief in witchcraft , one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular in his opinions on this subject . He would have been singular , if he had indulged other opinions . He spoke the truth when he said , in his reply to Calef , " I know not that I have ever advanced any opinion , in the matter of witchcraft , but what all the ministers of the Lord that I know of in the world , whether English , or Scotch , or French , or Dutch ( and I know many ) , are of the same opinion with me . " If there was any difference between Mr. Mather and his contemporaries on the point before us , it was perhaps this , that owing to his natural credulity and love of the marvelous , he was more sincere and earnest in his belief than some of them ; a fact of considerable importance in this inquiry , and which , if duly considered , will go , not to inculpate , but rather to excuse him . It has been said , Cotton Mather was " the chief /z/ cause and promoter " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient agency in producing and prolonging the excitement " on that subject . He " connected his name and fame inseparably with that excitement , as its chief cause , agent , believer , and justifier . " The excitement here referred to is , without doubt , that commonly spoken of as " the Salem witchcraft , " which occurred in 1692 . Of this , Cotton Mather is alleged to have been " the chief cause , promoter , agent , and justifier . " He exerted " an efficient agency in producing and prolonging it . " This certainly is a heavy charge to be brought against a learned and reputable minister of the gospel , who has long been dead . Let us spend a few moments in inquiring as to its justness and truth . AVe have seen that in the days of Cotton Mather , the belief in witchcraft was universal in New England , as indeed it seems to have been all over the world . He did not originate this belief . Ho merely fell in with the general current of thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . It must be remembered , too , that the cases of witchcraft at Salem were not regarded at the time /z/ of - their occurrence , as a new or unheard of thing . Accounts of witches in England , and in other parts of Europe , had been often published , and the stories and books were widely circulated . JThen there had been cases of supposed witchcraft in New England , for almost half a century before the disturbances at Salem . There was a case at Springfield , as early as 1645 ; and another at Charlestown immediately after , which resulted in the execution of the supposed witch . The next that suffered was a woman in Dorchester , and another in Cambridge , both of whom died protesting their innocence . In 16G5 , 3irs . Hibbins , the widow of one who had been an assistant or counselor , was executed at Boston . There were three executed at Springfield , nearly at the same time , one of whom confessed herself guilty of the crime alleged . All these cases occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the year 1662 ,  --  the year of his birth , there were three executed at Hartford ; one of them on her own confession . There was a case at Salisbury , in 1669 ; another at Groton , in 1671 ; a third at Hampton , in 1673 ; and a fourth at Xewbury , 1079 . In 1682 , there were two cases in New Hampshire ; and in the next two years , there were two more cases on Connecticut river . These latter cases varied /z/ much in their circumstances , and in none of them were the supposed offenders executed . There was a notable case of witchcraft in the family of a Mr. Goodwin , in Boston , in the year 1688 . The alleged offender was an old Irish woman , by the name of Glover . She was tried before chief justice Dudley ( afterwards Governor Dudley ) , and was condemned and executed . This case , it has been said , was " brought about by the management " of Cotton Mather ; * but a more unfounded accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicted by the testimony of Mr. Goodwin , the father of the afflicted children . " Let the world be informed , " he says , " that when one of my children had been laboring under sad circumstances from the invisible world , for about a quarter of a year , I desired the ministers of Boston and Charlestown to keep a day of prayer at my house , if so be deliverance might be obtained . Mr. Cotton Mather was the last of the ministers that I spoke to on that occasion ; and though , by reason of some necessary business , he could not attend , yet he came to my house on the morning of that day , and tarried about half an hour , and went to prayer with us , before any other minister came . Never before now had I the /z/ least acquaintance with him . " How then could this case have been " brought about by the management " of Cotton Mather ? The child had been afflicted full three months , during which time Mr. Mather had not once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . But to come back to the strange appearances in Salem village ( now Danvers ) which , as before remarked , commenced in February , 1G92 , and in the family of Rev. Mr. Parris , the minister . That Mr. Mather was " the chief cause " of these ap-* pearances , as has been confidently asserted , or that he exerted the slightest agency or instrumentality in producing them , there is not a particle of proof . After diligent search , I can find no evidence that he had any visible concern , or in fact any concern , with the cases of alleged witchcraft in Salem , until several months after the excitement commenced . Mr. Upham supposes that this excitement originated in the parochial troubles of Mr. Parris ; and that the children of Parris " were acting a part . " 11 1 am constrained , " he says , " to declare my belief , that this dreadful transaction was introduced and driven on , by wicked perjury and willful malice . " If this account of its origin be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its " chief cause , promoter and agent ; " as it /z/ will not be pretended that he had any concern in fomenting Mr. Parris 's parochial troubles . But 31r . Mather is represented , not only as the cause of the Salem witchcraft , but as greatly desiring it , and rejoicing in it . " I can not resist the conviction , " says one , " that he looked upon the Salem trials with secret pleasure . " " He seems to have longed for an opportunity to signalize himself in this particular kind of warfare . " " His boundless vanity , " says another , " gloried in the assault of the evil angels upon the country . " ! Were Cotton 31ather now living to speak for himself , or could he address us from the other world , I am persuaded he would repel the foregoing representations , as doing great injustice to his character . How do his accusers know that he longed for the occurrence of cases of witchcraft ; and rejoiced in them when they appeared ; and regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reality of witchcraft , or that certain individuals were in covenant and commerce with evil spirits , when an instance of this kind was supposed to have occurred , he would feel an interest , both as a Christian /z/ and a philosopher , to investigate it with all the scrutiny of which he was capable . I3ut to suppose that he desired the occurrence of these terrible visitations , and rejoiced in them , and contemplated their results with secret satisfaction , even when they terminated in blood , is to contradict , not only his most solemn protestations , but the gencraljjurrent of his actions and life . He uniformly spoke of the spring and summer of 1GU2 as " a very doleful time unto the whole country . " and of " the descent of the devils upon so many of the good people of the land " as a " dreadful judgment of heaven . " His biographer informs us , that " for a great part of the summer , he spent one day , every week , by himself , in the exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " not only for his own preservation from the malice and power of the evil angels , but also for a good issue of the calamities in which he had permitted the evil angels to ensnare the miserable country . " And if the general current of one 's life is to be regarded as an index to the state of his heart , then Cotton Mather was a benevolent , and not a malevolent man . He desired the good of his fellow-creatures , and not their hurt . He was liable , like other men , to mistake in the appli-/z/ cation of means , and to be deluded ; but lie sincerely sought to be useful to those around him . But bow is this consistent with his longing to witness , and rejoicing in the occurrence , of what he conceived to be the most dreadful of all calamities ,  --  penetrated by the most horrible of all crimes ;  --  a crime justly deserving of death by the laws of both God and man ? It is further objected to Cotton Mather , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his presence , and in various ways urged on the terrible work of blood . " " In the progress of the superstitious fear , " says his accuser , " when it amounted to frenzy , and could only be satisfied with blood , he neither blenched nor halted ; but attended the courts , watched the progress of invisible agency in the prisons , and joined the multitude in witnessing the executions . " When the Rev. Mr. Burroughs was executed , he " rode round , in the crowd , on horseback , " it is said , " haranguing the people , and saying that it was not to be wondered at that Mr. Burroughs appeared so well , for the devil often transformed himself into an angel of light . " t /z/ It is further said , that in " the advices " which the ministers presented to the magistrates in reference to the matter of witchcraft , and which were drawn up by Cotton Mather , the magistrates were urged to " the speedy and vigorous prosecution of those who have rendered themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court. - , when the witches were tried at Salem , himself and his accuser are directly at variance . The latter says he did attend . Mr. Mather affirms that he did not . " I was not present , " he says , " at any of them . " As to his frequenting the prisons where the witches were confined , he may have done this , when any were confined in Boston . To do so , in the case of all prisoners , he believed to be a part of his ministerial duty . There is no evidence that he visited the prisoners in Salem , or that he was often there , during the whole excitement . It was more of a journey from Boston to Salem , in 109:2 , than it is at present . As to his joining the multitudes in witnessing the executions , I find no evidence that this was true , except in a single instance . " When Mr. Burroughs , with several others , was executed , /z/ on the 5th of August , he was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " riding round , in the crowd , on horseback , haranguing the people ; " still , he was there , and sitting on a horse . For certain reasons , 3Ir. 3Iather seems to have satisfied himself that Burroughs was , on many accounts , a bad man , a dangerous man ;  --  that he had been unkind in his family ; was one who had intercourse with evil spirits : and who , of course , according to his understanding of the matter , deserved to die . And when he saw how worthily the old man appeared at the last ,  --  how submissive he was , and how fervently he prayed ; it is very likely he may have said to the bystanders , in the language of Paul , " Xo marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light . " This would be quite enough for such men as Calef , and others , to make a story of ; and is undoubtedly the substance out of which the several versions of the story have since been made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " above referred to , the history of the connected transactions must be kept in mind . As before related , the troubles in the family of Mr. Parris first made their appearance in February , 1692 . During the next three months , cases of /z/ similar suffering were multiplied , and various persons were accused as being the cause of them . These accused persons were examined before justices Corwin and Hathorne , and the most of them were committed for trial . In May of the same year , Mr. Increase Mather and Gov . Phippe arrived from England , with the new provincial charter of government . Almost immediately after the new government had been organized , a commission was issued to seven of the principal citizens and jurists of the Colony , namely , Lieut . Gov . Stoughton , Maj. Saltonstall , Maj. Richards , Maj. Gedney , Mr. Wait Winthrop , Capt . Sewall , and Mr. Sergeant , constituting them a court , to try the accused persons , at Salem . The judges first assembled June 2d , and tried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court then adjourned to June loth ; in which interval , the governor and council asked the advice of ministers in Boston and vicinity , as to the course to be pursued . After due deliberation , the ministers expressed their opinions and counsels under the eight following particulars : 1 . They express their sympathy with those who are " suffering by molestation from the invisible world , " and " think that their condition calls for the utmost help of n* /z/ all persons , in their several capacities . " 2 . They thankfully acknowledge the success which has followed the efforts of the magistrates " to defeat the witchcrafts , " and pray for a full and perfect discovery of all this mysterious wickedness . 3 . They recommend " a very critical and exquisite caution , lest , by too much credulity for things received only upon the devil 's authority , there be a door opened for a long train of miserable consequences . " 4 . The rulers are exhorted not to proceed , in any case , on mere presumption , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be complained of , especially if they have been persons of an umblemished reputation . " 5 . The next advice is , that the primary examination of suspected persons may be without noise , company , or excitement ; and that there " may be nothing used as a test for the trial of the suspected , the lawfulness whereof may be doubted by the people of God . " 6 . The ministers recommend to the magistrates not to convict or so much as commit persons on what was called " the spectral evidence ; " " inasmuch as it is an undoubted thing that a demon may appear , even to ill purposes , in the shape of an innocent and virtuous man . " They also pronounce any " alteration /z/ made in the sufferers , by a look or touch of the - accused , " to be insufficient evidence of guilt . 7 . The ministers farther suggest , whether an utter rejection of the testimonies commonly relied on , whose whole force and strength is from the devils alone , may not put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , in the accusation of so many persons whereof some , we hope , are clear of the great transgression laid to their charge . " 8 . Having given the above directions , suggestions and cautions , the ministers " humbly recommend to the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as have rendered themselves obnoxious , according to the directions given in the laws of God , and the wholesome statutes of the Ens ; lish nation . " By those who seem incliued to traduce the ministers of that day , and especially Cotton Mather ( by whom these advices are said to have been drawn up ) , this last article is almost the only one quoted or referred to . It is quoted often , as though it stood alone , without any restriction or qualification ; as if Mather and his ministerial brethren were only anxious to have the judges make all due despatch , and condemn and hang the suspected witches as fast as possible . But /z/ this , it will be seen , is altogether an unjust view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken and judged of as a whole ; and as a whole , they were manifestly framed and designed with a view to reprove much of the previous proceedings , particularly those of the Salem justices , and to prevent , so far as possible , the like proceedings in future . They do , indeed , " recommend the speedy and vigorous prosecution of those who have justly rendered themselves obnoxious ; " but the recommendation is accompanied with such cautions , restrictions and qualifications , that , had they been duly regarded , there probably had not been another individual convicted . If the trials had been conducted with that " exceeding tenderness " towards the accused , which the ministers recommend ; if the " spectral evidence , " together with all improper tests , had been set aside ; if all " testimony of every kind , which rested " only on the devil 's authority , " had been rejected ; the judges might have proceeded as vigorously as they pleased ,  --  the more vigorously the better , for by this means the jails had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set at liberty . From persons who believed in the reality of /z/ witchcraft , and that the proper witch is justly liable to death ( as all these ministers most seriously did ) , I see not how better advices than those which they proffered to the magistrates on this occasion , could reasonably have been expected . And happy had it been for all concerned , if the magistrates had been content to follow them . But they would not . At least , some of them would not ; particularly Chief Justice Stoughton . He seems to have been fully satisfied , at least for a time , as to the validity of the " spectral evidence , " and other branches of the devil 's testimony ; and consequently the work of hanging went on . It has been further objected to Cotton Mather , that " after two hundred persons had been accused , one hundred and fifty imprisoned , nineteen hanged , one pressed to death , and twenty-eight condemned , one third of whom were members of the churches , and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatise , entitled , 1 Wonders of the Invisible " World , ' approving the proceedings of the courts , and exciting the multitude to a continuance in their belief , and the courts to a perseverance in their vindictiveness " /z/ " With all due respect for the author of the foregoing sentence , I must say that the charge conveyed in the latter part of it is no better than a libel ; and a libel not on Cotton Mather alone , but on Stoughton , Winthrop , Sewall , and all the other members of the court . That these men were deluded , and under the influence of strong delusion , committed great injustice , I do not doubt . But that they were vindictive in their feelings and judgments , I do not believe . There certainly is no evidence of their vindictiveness , but all the evidence that has come down to us , goes to contradict directly such a supposition . Judge Sewall , in his humble confession , several years after , makes no acknowledgment of vindictiveness . Chief Justice Stoughton affirmed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of God before his eyes , and gave his opinion according to the best of his understanding ; and although it might appear afterwards that he had been in an error , yet he saw no necessity of a public acknowledgment . " ' Cotton Mather , speaking of the judges , says , " Although I was always afraid of proceeding to condemn any person upon so feeble evidence as a spectral representation , and /z/ ever protested against it , publicly and privately , and in my letters to the judges , besought them that they would by no means admit it , " yet , when " I saw in most of the judges , a most charming instance of prudence and patience , and knew the exemplary prayer and anguish of soul wherewith they had sought the direction of heaven , above most other people , I could not but speak honorably of their persons , on all occasions . " In reference to these judges , the authors of the reply to Calef say , " What was done by them in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest men believe they did in conscience of the oath of God upon them ; and they followed , unto the best of their understanding , the precedents of England , Scotland and other nations , on such a dark and doleful occasion . " Thus much in vindication of the judges from the charge of vindictiveness . The other part of the charge , viz. , that Cotton Mather , in his " Wonders of the Invisible " World , " " appi'oved the proceedings of the courts , and excited them to a perseverance in their vindictiveness , " is equally without foundation . For , in the first place , he did not altogether approve the proceedings of the courts . This is evident from /z/ what has been already said ; particulary from the ccmtrarietry of their proceedings , in the admission of testimony , tohis private letters to them , and to the advices of the ministers , which he drew up . He further tells us expressly , " I could not allow the principles that some of the judges had espoused . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion that the judges proceeded too far , and were chargeable with mistakes , particularly in respect to the kind of evidence which they admitted , and on which they to some extent relied . And if , as we have seen , the judges were not vindictive , it is impossible that Mr. M. should have excited them " to persevere in their vindictiveness . " There is another fact in the life of Cotton Mather , which is wojthy to be mentioned here , and which shows that he did not altogether sympathize with the course pursued , in reference to those who were thought to be bewitched . " He offerred , at the beginning , that if the possessed people might be scattered far asunder , he would singly provide for six of them ; and he , with some others , would see whether prayer and fasting ( without resort to more bitter methods ) would not put an end unto these heavy trials . " Had this /z/ method been taken in the case of the sufferers , it is probable that the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused had lost his life under the charge of witchcraft . But it is further urged against Cotton Mather , that , not satisfied with the tragedy at Salem , he tried all methods to prolong the excitement , and , if possible , to renew the same scenes in Boston . It is even said , that " he got up a case of witchcraft in his own parish , in 1693 . " " He succeeded the next summer , " says one , " in getting up a wonderful case of witchcraft , in the person of one Margaret Rule , a member of his congregation in Boston . " In proof that Mr. Mather endeavored to prolong the excitement respecting witchcraft , and , if possible , to renew the Salem tragedy in Boston , a private letter has been produced , addressed by him to Stephen Sewall , of Salem , dated Sept. 20 , 1G92 , in which he requests his friend Sewall to send him " a narrative of the evidences given in at the trials , " of some of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object in requesting such a narrative was , that he might be the better able to * Bancroft 's Hist. , Ill , p. 97 . Upham , p. 289. /z/ meet objections against witchcraft , and defend ( so far as he should find them defensible ) the proceedings of his friends at Salem . " I am willing , " says he , writing in his usual familiar , playful style , " I am willing , when you write , that you should imagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch advocate , as any among us . Address me as one that believed not reasonable . And when 3 T ou have knocked me down , in a spectre so unlike me , you will enable me to box it about among my neighbors , till it come , I know not where , at last . " The accusers of Mr. Mather seem to understand from this letter , that having collected all the witch stories he could find , he intended to color and magnify them , and box them about among his neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly tell what . But is this a correct interpretation of the letter ? I am fully satisfied that it is not ; and I am astonished that learned gentlemen should have so blundered upon it , as they seem to have done . What was it , I ask , which Mr. Mather proposed to box about among his neighbors ? Not the witch stories which his friend Sewall might send him ; but the fallen spectre of Sadduceeis my which Sewall had knocked down . " When you have knocked me down , in a /z/ spectre so unlike me , you will enable me to bos it ( i. e. the fallen spectre ) about among my neighbors , till it ( the spectre ) come , I know not where at last . " Such is the strict , proper , grammatical meaning of the sentence ; and it is very different , as every one sees , from the forced , perverted meaning which the accusers of 31 r . Mather have put upon it . Mr. Mather was a firm believer in the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he regarded the disbelief of it as a sort of Sadduceeism , which was little better than infidelity . This unbelieving spirit was working around him , and he sought the means of counteracting and overthrowing it . It was with this /z/ view , and not for the purpose of prolonging the excitement , that he wrote to his friend at Salem , for " a narrative of the evidence , given in at the trials of some of the principal witches , which had just been condemned/ ' That Mr. Mather had no agency in producing the strange appearances in Margaret Rule , is very evident from several considerations . 1 . Calef does not charge him with it , or so much as intimate it . ' 2 . He seems to have had no acquaintance with Margaret Eule , or knowledge of her , before her troubles commenced . But espe- /z/ cially is it evident that Mr. Mather could have had no instrumentality in producing the troubles of Margaret , from the very nature of her disease . Her case , though regarded by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly of a very different character . It was no other than a protracted case of delirium tremens , and other mental sufferings , occasioned by the habitual use of rum . For nine days together , she swallowed little or nothing , " except an occasional spoonful of rum . " When her attendants were asked , " What does - she eat and drink ? " They answered , " She eats nothing at all , but drinks rum . " No wonder she saw spectres around her , and seemed to persons not acquainted with such appearances to have been bewitched . If this is the right explanation of her case , as I have no doubt it is , then Mr. Mather will stand clear of having produced it , unless it can be shown that he persuaded her to drink rum and become a drunkard . In concluding the discussion concerning Cotton Mather 's conection with the excitement respecting witchcraft , the following points seem to me to be well supported . Like most of the learned men of that age , Mr. Mather was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witch , on /z/ due and proper conviction , was worthy of death . He had no concern in getting up cases of witchcraft , in Boston , or Salem , or any where else ; nor when they occurrred , did he rejoice in them ; but they were to him , as they were to most others at that day , events of solemn and painful interest . In regard to the cases at Salem , he was not in favor , at first , of legal proceeding. - , but preferred that the bewitched persons should be separated , and that religious means should be used for their recovery . And when judicial proceedings had been instituted , he was opposed to the admission of " the spectral evidence , " or any other evidence which could be regarded as resting on the devil 's authority . He privately wrote to the judges , beseeching them not to proceed on such evidence , " and drew up cautions and restrictions , in the advices of the ministers , which , had they been duly regarded , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , believing the judges to be sincerely intent on doing right , he did not think it his duty to oppose and vilify them , though he disapproved of some of their proceedings . After the executions were past , at the command of Gov . Phipps , he prepared and published a volume entitled , " Wonders of the Invis- /z/ ible World ; " containing , with other things , an attested history of the trials of some of the principal witches . Such are , in brief , the facts , in relation to Mr. Mather 's opinions and doings with reference to the subject of witchcraft ; and for one , I find little to censure , which may not be resolved into the peculiarity of his natural disposition , and the solemn belief which , in common with most at that day , he cherished , as to the reality of diabolical agency in the case . I would not , of course , undertake to defend every word he uttered , and every action he performed , during the whole of this perplexing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it be a wrong ) , and admit him to have been sincere and honest in his convictions ; and I see little in what he did which does not , at least , appear consistent , and which , if it can not be fully justified , may not readily be excused. - /z/ The aspersions which have been cast upon Cotton Mather do not all relate to the subject of witchcraft . Other objections have been urged against him , the more material of which will be briefly noticed . It has been said , that Cotton Mather , like his father , was a violent controversialist . His " theological zeal was always at the boiling point . " He was " a partisan by profession ; always harnessed , and ready , and restless for the onset . " * If the meaning of this charge is , that he did not always treat those who differed from him with due forbearance and courtesy , its truth is to be , to some extent , admitted . He well knew how to string words together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and grate harshly on the /z/ nerves , of an opponent ; and he sometimes indulged himself in this way , beyond what the circumstances of the case required . It is a mistake , however , to suppose that Cotton Mather was , to a great extent , a controversial writer . Nearly all his three hundred eighty-three publications were on devotional and practical subjects . He says of himself , " Though I have had , first and last , such a number of pamphlets thrown at me , that if I had been vulnerable , I might appear stuck as full of darts as the man in the signs of the almanack ; yet , upon considering the sorry and silly stuff which they have consisted of , and the despicable character of the scribblers ; and remembering , too , that lies have no legs , and what I had learned about treating insolent men with humanity , and angiw men with meekness ; I have thought that Proverbs 26 : 4 , was a full answer for them . I have had so much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't call to mind I have ever once yet published a direct and formal answer to any of them all ; but instead thereof , and once for all , I gave to the public my little book entitled , " The true " Way of shaking off a Viper. /z/ " With respect to controversial asperity , as has been remarked in another place , much regard is to be had to the spirit and customs of the age . It will not do to take a writer out of his own age , and try and condemn him by the standards of another . It has been said , again , that Cotton Mather was not always " so scrupulous as might be wished in his relation of facts ; " or in other words , that he sometimes indulged himself in falsehood . And in order to make good this charge , his private letters have been searched , and his diary ransacked from one end to the other . But after a careful examination of all the instances referred to , I am satisfied that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrepancies in the private journals of different individuals , is of course to be expected . One writer might know what another did not know . One might record what another would omit . The same transaction would be likely to be viewed by different individuals , in different attitudes and lights . I have discovered no instance in the statements of Mr. Mather , which can not be easily explained upon these principles , in perfect consistency with his veracity . /z/ It is further objected to Cotton Mather , that he habitually desired and endeavored , for a longcourse of years , to become the president of Harvard College . If this charge were admitted to the full extent to which it is urged , I see not that it will fasten any serious blot upon the character of Mr. Mather . Good men have often desired public stations , and taken pains to secure them , and yet , in the end , have been disappointed . I am persuaded , however , that the desires of Cotton Mather in regard to the presidency of Harvard College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , to gather up expressions bearing on this point ; and yet almost nothing , of a decisive character , has been discovered . On the death of President Leverett , there seems to have been a general expectation and desire , that Mr. Mather should be elected to the vacant office . As Dr. Elliot expresses it , " The voice of the people cried aloud for Mr. Mather ; and it was declared , even in the general court , that he ought to be president . " Mr. Mather was well acquainted with this fact , and refers to it in his private writings of this date . It is to be remembered , however , that these were private writings , intended not for the public eye , but for his own . Without doubt , he had written /z/ with less freedom , could he have known to what kind of scrutiny his papers , in after times , were to be subjected . I do not find , however , in the diary , any indications of an inordinate desire to become president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was not elected . So far from this , there are expressions of directly an opposite character ; and if we are to receive the evidence of a diary , why should we not receive it all ? " I have personally , " says he , " unspeakable cause to admire the compassion of heaven to me on this occasion . Though I have been a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief , yet none of the least exercises that I have had withal , was the dread of what the generality of sober men expected I desired  --  the care of the College to be committed unto me . I had a dismal apprehension of the distresses which a call at Cambridge would bring upon me . " It has been matter of complaint against Cotton Mather , that he injuriously treated Gov . Dudley , particularly in addressing to him , as did his father before him , a letter of solemn admonition and reproof . In replying to this charge , I need not repeat what was said in a previous chapter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to cultivate the friendship of the Mathers , /z/ so far as this was consistent with his political designs ; and had often availed himself of their influence and good offices , in times of difficulty and distress . At the time of the overthrow of Andros , Dudley probably owed his life to Cotton Mather ; for had not he exerted himself to the utmost to calm the passions of the angry multitude , they had risen in their vengeance , and cut off their oppressors at a stroke . When Dudley , with his confederates , was imprisoned , he wrote to Cotton Mather , imploring his assistance " for rolling the stone from the door of this sepulchre , wherein , " says he , " I am buried alive . " At the time of his appointment to the office of governor , he had the address , as before stated , to procure a letter from Cotton Mather in his favor , which letter was read before the kimr , and had much influence in obtaining for him the office which he sought . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received with tokens of respect by the Mathers , and by the people generally ; but almost immediately , he began to manifest his ingratitude and his disposition to turn every thing to his own personal advantage . In a visit which he paid to Cotton Mather , soon after his arrival , he received from him the following faith- /z/ ful and excellent advice :  --  " Sir , you arrived to the government of a people , that have their various and divided apprehensions about many things , and particularly about your own government over them . I am humbly of opinion that it will be your wisdom to carry an indifferent hand to all parties , if I may use bo coarse a word as partie ; - , and to give occasion to none to say , that any have monopolized you , or that you took your measures from them alone . I will explain myself with the freedom and the justice , though not perhaps with the prudence , that you would expect from me . I will do no otherwise than I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would approve and commend it , if any one should say to your excellency , ' By no means let any people have cause to say , that you take all your measures from the two Mr. Mathers/ By the same rule , I may say without offence , ' By no means let any people say , that you go by no measures in your conduct , but by Mr. Byfield 's and Mr. Leverett 's . ' This I speak , not from any personal prejudice against those gentlemen , but from a due consideration of the disposition of the people , and as a service to your excellency . " But having received this good advice , his excellency went directly out , and misrepresented /z/ and distorted it , much to the injury of Mr. Mather . He went at once to Messrs . Byfield and Leverett , and told them that Cotton Mather had counseled him to be in no wise advised by them . And this was but the commencement of his mal-practices . The first six or seven years of his administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recriminations ; of disputes , encroachments , and complaints . Disgusted with his proceedings , and the spirit and character which he exhibited , the Mathers at length concluded to write him , each of them , a letter on the same day . Considering the relations they had sustained to him , their former intercourse with him , the kind offices they had performed for him , and that he , in fact , obtained the government , in no small degree , through their means , they felt not only authorized , but called upon , to deal with him after this manner . On the letter of Increase Mather , I have already remarked . I proceed to subjoin some brief account of the letter of Cotton Mather , accompanied by such explanations as may be necessary/* He begins by telling the governor , that he feeta /z/ it to be his duty to give him some words of faithful advice , administered in so plain a manner , that they can not well be misunderstood . He touches upon their previous intercourse ; upon the favors which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which these had been requited . He reminds him of his former miscarriages , and of the hopes which were entertained , when he came into the government , that he had repented of them , and would do so no more . He speaks of the sore disappointment which his friends experienced , and of the consequent troubles in which the governor himself had been involved . He proceeds to reprove him for his covetousness ,  --  a sin of which , in the judgment of all his contemporaries , Dudley was notoriously guilty . It was this which had led him into a species of bribery and corruption , to which some of the first men in the country had borne witness , under oath , and their affidavits were then in England . " And this it is , " says the writer , " that many do firmly believe has drawn you in to countenance that unlawful trade with the enemy , which has been carried on by some grateful merchants/* /z/ Mr. Mather proceeds to speaks of the opposition of the governor and his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence of which Mr. Bancroft testifies , and Hutchinson proves that he was actually guilty . He next speaks of the expedition against Port Royal , which he thinks had failed through the governor 's mismanagement . He complains of the manner in which business is often transacted in the council . The members are not allowed to deliberate . They are hurried , driven into improper measures , the blame of which is then thrown upon the council . A day is sometimes appointed for the election of justices , and then privately altered , so that none may be present but those whose company is desired . These things being so , it must needs be that the governor is under the Divine displeasure . There is a judgment to come , when he will be required to answer for the manner in which his duties were performed . Considering his age and health , his excellency ought to lose no time in thinking seriously on this subject , and supplicating the Divine mercy . Mr. Mather further declares , that v.n usage shall ever induce him to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks it his duty to maintain towards all mankind . He has often been silent , /z/ when he felt strongly inclined to speak . He has been neglected , and treated with contempt and aversion . Those who visited him have been insulted , though that act of attention was all their sin . Even those who live in the same part of the town have been proscribed for that , and for no other transgression . " But I cherish , " says he , " no resentment . I can forgive and forget injuries . I hope I am somewhat ready for sunset ; and the more so for having discharged the duty of this letter . " Such , for substance , is Cotton Mather 's letter to Governor Dudley . It is less definite , methodical and guarded , than that of his father . It is more wordy and discursive , and betrays more of impatience , and a disposition to retort . As to the charges contained in it , the most and the worst of them were true ; and the remainder were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any are disposed to think that Mr. Mather used too much freedom with the governor , let them bear in mind the former relations and intercourse which had subsisted between them ; the numerous favors which the former had conferred on the latter ; and especially the influence which Mr. Mather had exerted in procuring the appointment of the governor , which had brought upon him , as /z/ he says , " an extreme displeasure in the country . " Let them consider , too , that the early days of New England , the minister and chief magistrate were more nearly on a level than they are at present ; and that ministers were accustomed ( perhaps because they were more faithful ) to use a greater freedom in reproving wickedness in high places , than is customary now . I will not say that every word or sentence of the long ; letter which lias been under review is to be approved ; but I do sa T , that I more admire the boldness and faithfulness of the writer , than I can find it in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us of the old prophets in Israel , he tells the governor a great many truths , which probably no one else would , and points him forward to solemn future scenes which , in the midst of the care- and temptations of government , he was very liable to forget . On the whole , I think Dudley had mure a to be grateful for such a letter , than to be angry at it ;  --  more reason to thank the writer for his faithfulness , than to rail at him ( as be did ) for his rudeness and impertinence . It has been objected to Cotton Mather , that he was not friendly to the interests of Harvard College . He speaks of the College , daring the /z/ presidency of Mr. Leverett , as " in a neglected and unhappy condition , " and as " betrayed into vile practices . " He complains of the commencement seasons , as " time sorrily enough thrown away , ' "  --  as " a se - . noisy imperti- nency . " Be speaks of the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curators and officers as without legal authority . He talks about the " pretended president , " and " ihose called the oycrseers , " and " the six men who call themselves the corporation . " He sides with malcontents in opposition to the corporation ; favors the establisment of Yale College ; and labors to turn away the bounty of Mr. Mollis from Harvard to Yale . In reply to all this , it may be remarked , that several causes contributed to make Mr. Mather dissatisfied with the condition of the College , during the greater part of the administration of President Leverett ,  --  perhaps more so than he ought to have been . It seems , however , that he was not alone in his feelings of dissatisfaction . The uneasiness increased and became so great , that in 1723 , the overseers were induced to take the matter up , and by a committee of visitation , to /z/ make diligent inquiry into the condition of the College . In their report , this committee state , " that there is too common and general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  that " there has been the practice of several immoralities ; particularly stealing , lying , idleness , picking of locks , and a too frequent use of strong drinks ; which immoralities , it is feared , still continue in the College ; "  --  " that the scholars are many of them too long absent from the College ; "  --  that they " spend too much of the Saturday evenings in one another 's chambers ; "  - -  and " that the freshmen , as well as others , are seen in great numbers going into town , on Sabbath mornings , to provide breakfasts . " Only a few years later , another committee of the overseers reported , that " religion was much upon the decay in College ; that the worship of God in the hall was by many scandalously neglected ; " that " great disorders had appeared among the students ; " that " gross immoralities " were prevailing ; and that " the general condition of the College calls loudly for the interposition of the wisdom and authority of the over- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that Mr. Mather 's impressions as to the state of /z/ z* " * o the College were not altogether without foundation . And the fact that he recorded them , not in a way of public accusation , but in his private writings , and as a matter of lamentation before God , can not reasonably be urged as any objection to his character . The disorders at commencement , about this time , were Buch as to defy all college authority and law . To prevent them , it was proposed to have private commencements . Uut this plan not being successful , the civil authorities were required to interpose , and to establish a patrol " on the evening of commencement day , and the night following , and in and about the entry of the college hall , at dinner-time , to prevent disorders . " In view of a state of things such as tin facts and records indicate , the public will judge whether Mr. Mather is greatly to be blamed , for describing the commencements as " time sorrily enough thrown away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at home , and pray for the College , rather than patronize , by his presence such a " noisy impertinency . " But Mr. Mather , it is sometimes said , used language , which implied that the College had no proper legal existence . And this was the exact truth respecting it . When the colonial charter /z/ was vacated , in 1G84 , the College charter , in the judgment of all concerned , died with it . Nor could it be legally revived or reanimated , but by the royal authority . And hence the efforts which were made , through a series of years , to frame or procure a College charter , which should receive the approbation of the crown . But not succeeding in these efforts , Gov . Dudley undertook to revive , by mere provincial authority , the old charter of 1650 ;  --  a thing which could not legally be done , and of the impossibility of doing which , no man , probably , was more fully sensible than Dudley himself . Yet this rotten , illegal foundation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times of which we now speak . No wonder , then , that Cotton Mather thought the College in a precarious and unhappy situation , as having no legal , chartered existence . No wonder that he sometimes spoke of Leverett as the " pretended president , " and of the overseers and corporation as being such only in name . The malcontent , with whom Mr. Mather is thought to have sided , in opposition to the corporation , was a Mr. Pierpont ; who , having applied , in 1718 , for his second degree , was refused , on the ground of certain allegations brought /z/ against him by a tutor . The corporation sustained the faculty , in their decision respecting Pierpont ; upon which he immediately commenced a suit against the tutor , at common law . Of the particular circumstances of this case , no recond has come down to us . It is certain that Mr. Mather sympathized with Pierpont , considering him as an " abused and oppressed man . " It is certain , too , that Governor Shute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Indeed , the opposition to the course pursued by the faculty and the corporation had become so formidable , that it is hard to determine what the consequences might have been , had not the justices at common law , when the matter came before them , ordered the complaint to be quashed , and the defendant to be dismissed . That Mr. Mather felt a deep interest in the establishment of the new college in Connecticut , and solicited for it the patronage of the Hon. Elihu Yale , intimating that his munificence might procure for it the name of Yale College , is all very true . But is this to be urged against him , as an objection to his character ? Or should it not rather be recorded " to his honor ? He loved Harvard College , and had given it many proofs of filial affection and gratitude . No one can read /z/ its history , in the Magnalia , and doubt this for a moment . But , unlike some men , his regards were not all * circumscribed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to a single institution . He believed that a College was needed in Connecticut , and he felt disposed to assist it by such means as he had at his control . That Mr. Mather ever attempted to turn away the bounty of Hollis from Harvard to Yale College , there is absolutely no proof . It seems that Governor Saltonstall , of Connecticut , enclosed to Mr. Jeremiah Dummer , of London , an anonymous letter to Mr. Hollis , " recommending to him the collegiate school at New Haven . " But that Cotton Mather wrote this anonymous letter , there is not a particle of proof . And if he did write it , or whoever wrote it , it does not appear that the object of the letter was to withdraw the charities of Mr. Hollis from Cambridge , but merely to " recommend the collegiate school at New Haven . " Mr. Hollis might have done all that he ever did , or thought of doing , for the college at Cambridge , and might have liberally Lsted New Haven too . Another objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of /z/ President Leverett . It is said , that in a letter , written after the President 's death , to Mr. Holli. - of London , he denominates him an " infamous drone . " The alienation of feeling between the Mathers and Mr. Leverett commenced about the year 109 8 , and grew out of the controversy respecting the Brattle Street Church . The breach was widened through the influence of Governor Dudley , who , during the first half of his administration , seems to have made it an object to increase the prejudices existing between these men , and to profit by their differences . It is further likely that Mr. Leverett , though a good man and a Calvinist , was not that holy , spiritual , engaged Christian , which Mr. Mather would have liked to see at the head of the College . I infer this from his general course of life . He was first a preacher then , for many years , a civilian ; and after he came to the government of the College , he assumed the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a minister as Increase Mather ; nor did he labor as President Mather was accustomed to ' do , for the conversion and salvation of his pupils . It was matter of earnest complaint with Chief Justice Sewall and others , during his presidency , that he did not expound the Scriptures to the students in the college hall . Still , I am of opinion , that the /z/ expression quoted above from Cotton Mather 's letter to Mr. Hollis , was altogether too strong , and quite inexcusable . President Leverett could not , with any propriety of language , be called a drone ,  --  much less " an infamous drone . " It is possible that Mr. Hollis did not read Mather 's letter right , not being able to decipher his chirography . He complains , in one instance , that he could not read the letters of the first Professor Wigglesworth ; * and I suspect that Cotton Mather 's letters were quite as unreadable as his . This conjecture is the more probable , because the expression , as reported by Hollis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsisting between Mather and Leverett , for a course of years . To be sure , there was but little cordiality between them ; still , their feelings were not openly hostile . They often met and deliberated on questions of interest , and were in the habit of exchanging , pleasantly , the usual courtesies of life . We find their names appended frequently to the same public documents . Mr. Mather placed his son at Harvard College , during the period of which we speak , with a handsome letter of introduction to the President . He alo encouraged /z/ the young men of his congregation , in seeking an education there . In one of his letters to President Leverett , he says , " It is a satisfaction that I can reckon sixteen or seventeen of the sons of the church whereof I am the servant , who belong , at this time , unto the College . " I believe , also , that at the funeral of President Leverett , Mr. Mather officiated as one of the pall-bearers . We can only say , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that possibly there may have been some mistake , and that Mr. Mather never wrote it . But if he did , it must have been written by him in one of those seasons of hypochondria and depression , to which he was subject in the latter years of his life ; as it certainly is not consistent with the general state of his feelings towards Mr. Leverett , during his presidency . It has been farther objected to Cotton Mather , that at the time of the revolution , in 1689 , he sternly resisted the wishes of the people , in not being willing that the old colonial charter should be set up and restored . But if this was true of Cotton Mather , it was equally so of nearly all the magistrates and principal men of the colony . The old magistrates were willing to assume , as /z/ they did , a temporary provisional government , under the old charter , and to act upon it , till they could hear from England . But they were not willing , of themselves , to undertake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all wished it might be restored ; but it must be done legally . It must be restored , if at all , by that same royal authority through which it had been forcibly taken away . To sum up all : It has been represented that Mr. Mather was a man of " malign " and " vehement passions ; " of " violent , " " never-sleeping animosity ; " and of a " self-glorifying spirit , " who would " resort to underhand measures to gratify himself ; " that he was characterized by " violence of passion , frequent coarseness of language , and deficiency of judgment to a degree , at times , scarcely reconcilable with common sense ; " that his spirit " was restless , violent , selfish , and passionate , craving distinction , and claiming it by every form of self-illustration and display ; " that through the faithful medium of history , he " must be transmitted , as an individual of ungovernable passions , and of questionable principles ; that he was credulous intriguing and vindictive ; often selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of /z/ means ; wayward , aspiring , and vain ; rendering his piety dubious by display , and the motives of* his public services suspected , by the obtrusive- -s of his claims to honor and place . " In line , it is said that " he disgusted his cotemporarie-. " and " became the frequent subject of ridicule and derision ; " * that he fell " into such disgrace , " eays another , that " he became the object of public ridicule , and open insult . " t In proof of the last of the charges here urged , viz. that Mr. Mather " became , at length , the object of public ridicule and open insult , " reference is made , not to any thing of which the public had knowledge , but ( as usual ) to his own private writings , his diary . In the latter part of his life , this diary was often penned in seasons of severe domestic affliction , and ( what is more ) under the influence of deep mental depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to construe everything pertaining to himself in the most unfavorable light . It is remarkable , that at the very time when he was led to record , in his diary , the Beverest things against himself , he was actually in the highest favor with a large portion of the religious public . It was at this * Quincy 's History , Vol . I pp. 137  --  237 , - 330  --  34 " . Upham 's Lecture on Witchcraft , p. 115. /z/ very time that he was a prominent candidate for the presidency of Harvard College ; when , as Dr. Elliot says , " the voice of the people cried aloud for Dr. Mather , " and it was declared , even in the general court , that he ought to be president . But the most perfect refutation of the charges before us is found in the general mourning which was occasioned by his death ; in the circumstances of his funeral ; and the many testimonies to the high excellence of his character , which were given , at the time , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 13th , 1728 , when he had just completed his 65th year . " He was followed to the grave , " says 3Ir . Peabody , " by an immense procession , including the Lieut . Governor , the honorable council , the representatives , and all the high officers of the province . ' ' " The streets , " says Dr. Elliot , " were crowded with people , and the windows filled with sorrowful spectators , all the way to the grave . It was the general sentiment , that a great man had fallen . " The mourning was compared by some of the ministers , to the mourning of the children of Israel , on the death of Aaron . Funeral sermons were preached for him in most of the churches in Boston ; where his brethren in the ministry  --  his contemporaries  --  tood up in the /z/ midst of his contemporaries  --  those among whom he was born , and with whom he had always lived , and who were perfectly acquainted , both with his taknesses and excellences ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Thus lived and died , Dr. Cotton Math said Mr. Thatcher in his funeral discourse , " the glory of learning , and the ornament of Christianity . " " The capacity of his mind , " Baid the Rev. Mr. Gee , " the readiness of his wit , the vastnesi of his reading , the strength of his memory , the variety and treasures of his learning , in printed works and in manuscript ; the r of virtue which , through the abundant grace of God , shone out in the tenor of a most entertaining and profitable conversation ; his uncommon activity , his unwearied application , his extensive zeal , and numberless projects of doing good ;  --  these things , as they were united in him , proclaimed him to be a truly extraordinary person . " " One of the most elegant compositions of those time- . ' ' Bays Elliot , " was a funeral sermon upon Dr. Cotton Mather , by Dr. Benjamin Colman . " In this sermon , Dr. Colman says : " We mourn the decease from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first minister of the town ;  --  the first /z/ in age , in gifts , and in grace , as all his brethren very readily own . I might add , it may be , without offense , the first in the " whole province and provinces of Xew England , for universal literature and extensive services . Yea , it may be , among all the fathers in these churches , from the beginning of the country to this day  --  of whom many have done worthily  --  yet , none of them amassed together so vast a treasure of learning , and made so much use of it , to a variety of pious intentions , as this our reverend brother and father , Dr. Cotton jlather . " " His printed works will not convey to posterity , nor give to strangers , a just idea of the real worth and great learning of the man . His works will , indeed , inform all that read them , of his great knowledge , and singular piety , his zeal for God , and holiness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls . But it was his conversation , and acquaintance with him in his familiar and occasional discourses and private communications , that discovered the vast compass of his knowledge , and the projections of his piety more , I have sometimes thought , than all his pulpit exercises . Here he excelled ; here he shone ; being exceedingly communicative , and bringing out of his treasure things new and old , without measure . Here it was seen how his /z/ wit and fancy , his invention , his quickness of thought , and ready apprehension , were all consecrated to God , as well as his heart , will , and affections , and out of the abundance within , his lips overflowed  --  dropped as the honey-coin b  - -  fed all that came near him ; and were as the choice silver , for rich and brightness , for pleasure and profit . " The Rev. Mr. Prince , after quoting the foregoing passages from Dr. Colman , adds : " Every one who intimately knew Dr. Mather , will readily subscribe to the above description . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest distance might discover arach of his superior light and influence ; but they could discern in these only a more mediate and faint reflection . They could neither see , nor well imagine , that extraordinary lustre of pious and useful literature wherewith we were every day entertained , surprised and satisfied , who dwelt in the directer rays  --  the more immediate vision . " " Great abilities , an insatiable thirst for all kinds of knowledge , an extraordinary quickni of apprehension , liveliness of fancy , with a ready invention , and active spirit , seemed to be the chief ingredients of his natural genius . And all these , being sanctified in his early days , endued with a /z/ divine bias , and turned to the noblest objects ; he became inflamed with the most ardent desires to amass unto himself , from all sorts of writings , an unbounded treasure of curious and useful learning , and to find out all imaginable ways of employing it , for the glory of God , the good of men , and the advancement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might increase in goodness and usefulness , and become a greater and more extensive blessino- . " " So much erudition , such high degrees of piety , and such an active life in doing good , united in the same person , are very rarely seen among the sons of men . By a transient acquaintance with him , one would think that , being sanctified from his birth , he had made the utmost improvement of his time in the pursuit of knowledge . But upon a farther view of the social part of his life , the continual resort of visitants , with his gentle and easy entertainment of them at all hours , and how he would scarce let the meanest or youngest pass him without instruction ; it seemed as if almost all his time were swallowed up with conversation . And yet , being let into a more intimate discovery of his numberless and perpetual contrivances and labors to do good in the world ; one would then be ready to conclude /z/ that he would have no time left for either , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think to wish a richer blessing , than that the God of the spirits of all flesh would , in my own dear country , and every other , raise up numbers of such ministers as this ; that they may burn and shine as he , and prepare the world for the most illustrious appearance of the great God , our Saviour Jesus Christ . " In an obituary notice of Cotton Mather , published in the Boston News Letter , he is describe 1 a " the principal ornament of his country , and the greatest scholar that was ever bred in it . Besides ; his universal learning , his exalted piety and extensive charity , his entertaining wit , and sins ; - ular goodness of temper , recommended him to all , who were judges of real and distinguished mem . " Such then was the man , in the estimation of his contemporaries  --  those among whom he lived and died  --  who , by certain writers in the 19th century , is represented as possessing some of the most odious traits of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart ; who is declared to have forfeited all consideration and influence in the community , and to have become , at last , " the object of public ridicule , and open insult . " My readers must judge between Mr. Mather 's contemporaries , and his modern traducers , both of whose /z/ testimonies have here been given . Which had the opportunity to know him best ? Which are to be regarded as the most competent judges of his talents , his learning , his piety , his usefulness , and his moral worth ? It is admitted , indeed , by one who has uttered the severest charges against Mr. Mather , that his contemporaries endeavored " to draw a vail over his failures , wherewith to cover his defects and infirmities ; " but " time , " he says , " has lifted that vail , and thrust aside that mantle , which the tenderness of friends and professional interest desired to spread . " The public will judge , however , whether the funeral and mourning above described , and the testimonies above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to draw a vail over infirmities and defects ; whether they are not evidence , full and decisive , as to the estimation in which Cotton Mather , after a life of more than sixty years , the whole of which was spent in Boston , was held by the Bostonians of that day . It deserves consideration , too , whether it is , indeed time that has lifted the vail , and thrust aside the mantle above referred to ; or whether this mantle has not been torn aside by rude and officious hands , to be replaced , in due course of time , with brighter colors and in smoother folds . /z/ In this and the two previous chapters , I have presented a brief sketch of the life , labors and character of Dr. Cotton Mather . I have also wished to vindicate his character against some of the aspersions which , it has - vein . I to me , have been unjustly heaped upon it . I have not represented him as a perfect man , for lie was not BO . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was more sensible than himself , and which he took no great pains to conceal ; so that they occasionally stand out , with considerable promirence , in his writings , and in his own personal history . Still , he was a holy man  --  a highly gifted man  --  an eminently learned and useful man  --  an honorable and honored son of New England  --  whose reputation should be'dear to the present sons of Xew England , and which it devolves on them to guard and defend . I conclude the chapter with repeating a sentence before quoted from the testimony of the Rev. Thomas Prince : " I can not wish a richer blessing than that the God of the spirits of all flesh would , in my own dear country , and in every other , raise up numbers of such ministers as Dr. Cotton Mather , that they may burn and shine as he , and prepare the world for the most illustrious appearance of the great God , our Saviour Jesus Christ . " /z/ Our . acquaintance with the Mathers would be incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  such as the meagre accounts that have come down to us permit ,  --  of some of the remaining members of this remarkable family . - I have previously said something of the Rev. Nathaniel Mather , son of Richard , and brother of Increase . There was another Nathaniel Mather , son of Increase , and brother of Cotton , who died young , and who , we are assured , was a very remarkable youth . He was born July 6 , 1669 ; and from his childhood , says his brother Cotton ( who was his tutor ) , " his book was dearer to him than his play . As he increased in years , I was often forced to chide him to his recreations , but never for them . To be bookish was natural to him ; and to be plodding was easy and pleasant , rather than the contrary . Indeed , he afforded not so much a pattern , as a caution to young students ; for it may be truly said that study killed him . /z/ If is candle would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , he thought his bones would all fall asunder . " While he thus devoured books , it came to pass that his books devoured him . His weak body could not bear the toils to which he used himself ; and his neglect of exercise , joined with his immoderate lucubrations , soon destroyed his digestive powers ; so that by the time sixteen winters had snowed upon him , he began to be distempered with pains in his joints , which were at last to him the gates of death . " His success in study was according to the measure of it , great . He was thoroughly prepared for college at the age of twelve : soon after which we hear it said of him , that he had accurately read through the Old Testament in Hebrew , and the New in Greek , and was able to converse familiarl v in Latin . He was distinguished for his attainments , not only in languages , but in mathematics , philosophy , history , theology , and rabbinical learning . He graduated at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oration , on the state of learning amoncr the Jews . The natural disposition of this young man was exceedingly amiable . He was condescending and /z/ obliging  --  always more ready to confer a favor , than others could be to ask it . But it is specially to be recorded of him , that he became early and devotedly pious . At the age of fourteen , he entered into solemn covenant with God , writing out the instrument at length , and subscribing it with his own hand . The concluding part of this interesting paper is as follows : " I renounce my own worthiness , and choose thee , as the Lord my righteousness . I renounce my own wisdom , and take thine for my guide . I take thy will for my will , and thy word for my law . I do here willingly and joyfully put my neck under thy yoke . I do subscribe to all thy laws , as holy , just and good ; and do promise to take them as the rule of my thoughts , words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sab* ject to many failings , I do protest here before thee , that unallowed miscarriages , which arc contrary to the constant bent of my heart , shall not disannul this everlasting covenant . " The future life of Mr. Mather was in strict accordance with this solemn transaction . The leading features of it are summed up by his biographer - under the following heads : 1 . He was one that walked hy ride . Them by which he lived were all written , and many ot /z/ them put into verse , . so that they might be the more easily remembered . 2 . His was pre-eminently a life of prayer . He prayed much in secret , and was accustomed to meet the pious young men of his acquaintance in a stated prayer meeting . Indeed , prayer had become so habitual to him , that he not unfrequently engaged in it in the hours of sleep . His very dreams , often , were made up of prayers . 3 . He was a very thoughtful , contemplative young man . Xot a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the connection between soul and body , may serve as a specimen . " The Lord does not require me to ueglect the body , but to have my body for a few days or years  --  I say few , for they can not be jiany  --  to be wholly at the service of my soul ; and to be willing that the union between them should be dissolved : the soul taking its flight to everlasting bliss ; the body being laid in the dust , jntil the resurrection in the last day . With my body I must expect to lose all the pleasant enjoyments of this world  --  liberty , library , study , and relations ; and yet , in a higher sense I shall not lose them . So far from losing liberty by dying , I shall gain it ,  --  even freedom from this body of sin . As for my library , if I die in Christ , I shall /z/ not need it . My understanding shall be enough enlarged , and I shall no longer need to turn over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , but the paradise of God above will be larger , better , more complete . As to my pious relatives on earth , I shall only go before them to heaven ; and if any of them are not pious , the longer I stay with them , . the pain of leaving them will be the more intolerable , to think that I part with them for ever . " 4 . It may be said of this thoughtful , prayerful young man , that he strove against sin , and especially against his easily besetting sins . Nor did he struggle and strive in vain . The Lord gave him the victory . 5 . He seemed to have a presentiment that his life was to be short , and was very diligent and faithful in his preparation for death . His last sickness was a very painful one  --  a malignant tumor in the lower part of the back , extending to the thigh and leg ; but he bore his Ferings with most exemplary patience , and submission to the Divine will . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron patience , we never saw so patient a patient . " He died October 17 , 1G8* , while his lather was absent on his agency in England . /z/ A brief memoir of him was published by his elder brother and minister , Cotton Mather , which went through several editions on both sides of the water . A considerable part of the first edition was purchased by Mr. Philip Henry , for charitable distribution . To the fourth English edition , B most instructive an 1 highly characteristic preface was prefixed , by the celebrated Matthew Mead , author of the " Almost Christian . " " I could not read the book , " Bays Mr. Mead , " without great reflection and shame : For , thought I , God will not gather his fruit till it is ripe ; therefore I live so long . Nor will he let it hang till it is rotten , therefore Nathaniel Mather died so soon . We are not sent into the world , merely to fill up a number of years , but to fill up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time is done ; we have lived to maturity . And so did this dear youth . He came to his grave , in a full age ( though at nineteen ) , and fell like a shock of corn in his season . " /z/ The Samuel Mather of whom I now speak , was the third and youngest son of Dr. Increase Mather . /z/ He was instructed in classical learning by his elder brother Nathaniel , and was with his father in England , at the time of Nathaniel 's death . The following is part of a letter which he wrote to his afflicted friends on that mournful occasion . " When I parted from him ( Nathaniel ) not a year ago , I hoped it would not have been my last farewell ; but I now lament my unhappiness , in that I gained no more by him . And yet I must acknowledge that the little understanding which God has given me in the Hebrew or Greek tongues , was by that brother as the instrument ; so that I shall have cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but know , that if I should not fear and serve the God of my brothers , and of my fathers , and of my grandfathers , the nearest relatives I ever had in the world will be witnesses against me at the last day . " It is doubtful whether this Mr. Samuel Mather ever returned from England to America . He received his first degree at Harvard College , in the year 1690 , but it was probably sent to him , as he could not have been present in Cambridge at that time . He became " a faithful and useful minister of the gospel , at Wilncy , in Oxfordshire . " " He was the writer , " says Cotton Mather , " of several valuable treatises ; among which Lis ' Vindi- t /z/ cation of the Doctrine of the Trinity , ' and his ' Vindication of the Deity of the Holy Spirit , ' and his ' Vindication of the Sacred Scriptures , ' shine forth with a particular lustre , and challenge a name for him among the blessings of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson of the Rev. Richard Mather , of Dorchester , but in another line . He was the son of Timothy Mather ; was graduated at Harvard College in 1971 ; and was ordained pastor of the church in Windsor , Conn. , in 1GS2 . This , it will be recollected , was the church which first settled Dorchester , Mass. , and early removed with its pastor , the Rev. John Warham , to commence the settlement at Windsor . It had long been in a broken , divided state , but was happily united under Air . Mather , and so continued through the whole of his ministry . He was a highly and respectable useful man . We find his name among the trustees of Yale College , from the year 1708 to 1721. /z/ This is the last of the name that I shall introduce to the notice of my readers ; and with a brief /z/ sketch of his life and labors , shall conclude what I have to say of the Mather family . He was the son of Dr. Cotton Mather , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. 1706 . In his early youth he visited Europe ; but how long he remained there , or how extensively he traveled , does not appear . He entered College when only thirteen years of age , and graduated at seventeen . In the year 1732 , four years after his father 's death , he was ordained over the same church to which his father and grandfather had so long ministered , as colleague pastor with the Rev. 3Ir . Gee . Previous to this he had been a preacher for several years , and some of his sermons had been published . In 1729 , he published the life of his father ,  --  an instructive and interesting volume . During the revival controversy , which occurred about ten years after his settlement , the Old North church was divided ; a majority , with the senior pastor , remaining in the usual place of worship , and the minority , with Mr. Mather , withdrawing to another place . The separation was effected by mutual agreement and consent . A house of worship was erected for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people Mr. Mather continued , as long as he lived . He died /z/ June 27 , 1785 , aged 79 . He was a man of learning , of piety , and sound orthodoxy , though not a powerful or captivating preacher . His disposition was amiable , and his habits retiring and unobtrusive , as appears from the circumstances of his funeral , which , by his direction , was strictly private . He was disinclined to controversy , though capable of undertaking it , whenever he saw the interests of truth in danger . His principal publications , besides the Life of his father , were , " An Apology for the Liberties of the Churches of New England , " and his reply to Dr. Chauncy on Universal Salvation . This was his last work , and was published only a few years before his death . He received a diploma of doctor of divinity from Harvard College , in /z/ It was unfortunate for Dr. Samuel Mather , that his contemporaries could hardly avoid drawing comparisons between him and his more distinguished ancestors . In almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he really was ) a man of learning and talents , of piety and worth , a highly respectable and useful minister of the gospel . But the difference between him and his father and grandfather has led , on the part of /z/ many , to an unjust and too unfavorable estimation of his character . His church seems to have been scattered , after his death , and his place of worship assed into the hands of the Universalists , with whom it has since remained . He was the last of his family who , for a long tune , and perhaps to the present time , had been distinguished among the ministers of New England . Dr. John Elliot remarks , in 1809 ; " For more than a century , the name of Mather was known and celebrated in every part of the land . Man ' branches of it are now cut off , and * must go out of the State of Massachusetts to fina one engaged in the work of the ministry ; though formerly so many of them were distinguished among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
