txt Ma . MORELL is extensively known as the author of " An Historical and Critical View of the speculative philosophy of Europe in the Nineteenth Century . " This book , though not above criticism , is generally if not universally allowed to be the best work of the kind in our language . It is both Historical and Critical . So far as it is historical , it is a clear and pleasant record of the opinions of others . So far as it is critical , it involves to a limited extent the statement and vindication of the author 's own opinions . These critical notices , however , do not fully reveal his strength or his weakness , as a philosophical thinker . In this new volume , he presents himself as an independent thinker , on some of the most important as well as most intricate subjects which can task the intellect of man . The title , " The Philosophy of Religion , " has a strange sound to English ears . It is a translation of the " Religions-Philosophie " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of religion . Such an inquiry includes the critical study of the nature of man , as a being capable of religion , and of the sources of religious truth , as found in man himself , in nature and in revelation . Such an inquiry is also essential to every consistent system of theology . No system of theology can be thorough and scientific without it . It too often happens indeed , that the first principles which ought to have been ascertained by severe investigation and a close analysis , are taken for granted as foregone conclusions-and thus an imposing structure is reared , without a foundation ; or the foundation is left loose and shifting as the sand . But though these inquiries are necessary to every system of theology , they are not necessarily a part of any particular scheme . They are rather preliminary to all theology . It might almost be said , that a theology could be Mohammedan , Jewish or Christian , and still be based on the same " Philosophy of Religion . " It certainly is true in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professedly derived from the same general principles . On the other hand , it is equally true , that different conclusions , as to these fundamental points , must greatly influence the particular views both of religion and theology , which are consistently derived from them , by a rigid and logical deduction . Inquiries into these " foundation truths " derive an especial interest at this moment , from their relation to the times in which we live . This interest is both speculative and practical . The present age is generally thought to be practical only and not // speculative , and in some quarters , special efforts are made to bring contempt upon close thinking and sharp definition , especially in regard to the foundations of religion , as metaphysical , frivolous and antiquated . And yet it is true , that there never was a time , when speculation was more busy with religious truth than at the present . Especially is it true that there never was a time , when the truths and principles which are vital to all religions faith and feeling , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of thousands , we had almost said millions , of thinking men , than at this instant . Error and skepticism have withdrawn themselves from the attack upon particular doctrines of the Christian system , as objects too trivial for their notice , and have fallen back upon the great verities , which are vital to all religious faith and feeling . Certainly , they do most audaciously deny the possibility or necessity of any supernatural communication from God to man , the attestation of such a communication by miracles , and the record of it in an inspired writing . At such a time as this when a speculative skepticism , upon points necessarily and in their very nature philosophical and even metaphysical , has taken possession of entire and extended classes of thinking ulen ; it would seem that the discussion of speculative questions , was never more called for , and could never be more timely . rpl*e relation of these discussions to our practical religion is equally intimate . If we live in times of earnest thought about speculative principles , they are also times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , and in which practical views already taken , will find or make a theory for their justification . As the present is an age of wavering and of unbelief , so is it an age of marvelous credulity and dogged mysticism . It is not strange that it should be so-for skepticism and mysticism produce each other-not only in the same age among different minds by the law of antagonism ; but they are now and then prominent in the same mind , like strangely assorted bed-fellows fighting for the occupancy . The reason is l ) lain . If a man can not or will not justify his faith to his intellect , he will blindly grasp it by his feelings . He will then proceed-to deny that the intellect has jurisdiction upon points of faith , and will construct a " Philosophy of Religion " accordingly . Or having adopted his philosophy at the outset , he will carry it out in his religious life . If he is a Deist , he will seek to bask in the roseate but cheerless rays of a natural pietism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others by the fond fancies of a sickly mysticism . No man , who has his eyes open upon the signs of the times , can fail to see , that such a mysticism , both Christian and Infidel , is gaining rapid progress and is defended by its own philosophy of religion . // The publication of this work we regard as altogether timely ; and whatever may be the merit or the fate of many of the opinions which it propounds , the attempt to make these fundamental points the subject of a separate treatise , deserves the highest commendation . We are pleased also with the tone and manner of the discussion . The author does not write like a divine , but like a philosopher . He does not adopt the technical terms of any class of religionists , but employs the language of thinking men . But while , for the reasons already given , we are prepared to examine such a volume as this with especial interest , we find in the doctrines advanced in this book , an argument still more cogent for-subjecting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word is impossible . We shall indicate the school to which Mr. Morell belongs , when we say that he believes in " the reason " rather than in reasoning , and that he exalts feeling and depreciates logic . That many who aspire to the name of philosophers belong to this school , our readers can not be ignorant . It is still more notorious , that there is a much larger class of religionists , who are prepared to welcome any opinions which exalt the sentiments and dispense with logic-who are animated with an extraordinary zeal in this direction , without knowing whether there is any philosophy in their favor , but who will accept anything in the form of an argument which favors their position . Logic as we are told has had its day . It has corrupted our theology and chilled our piety , and it is time that it should adopt a more modest tone , and yield the place to a higher authority . This treatise is the first formal and elaborate attempt , in our language , to show the scientific grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely philosophical , the views which we have indicated . It seems therefore to demand especial attention . We can not promise to go over all the ground traversed by our author ; nor can we discuss , at length , all the questions which he has raised . All that we propose is to venture a few strictures on some of his positions . A word only of the Preface . It consists mainly of a series of expostulations with the English public , in reply to several objections which the author anticipates will be raised against his book . It will be objected , he remarks , 1 , that these views are German and neological ; 2 , that they are rationalistic ; 3 , that they are a departure from the simplicity of the gospel ; 4 , that they can lead to no useful result , inasmuch as they will tend to the substitution of a philosophical system for the gospel ; and if we have the gospel , that is all we require ; 5 , that they are premature . These objections , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be urged by his countrymen , only show that there is as great ignorance and narroxvuess of mind on such subjects // in portions of the religious public in England as there is in this country . The author might , however , have been less impatient in his replies to these objections . Leaving the preface , we proceed to the work itself . Chapter I , is entitled , " On the Faculties of the mind . " The object of this chapter is , to inquire into the nature of those faculties in man which render him capable of religion . To express briefly at the outset , what the author thinks he finds as the result of this examination , is a little difficult . He does not begin with a clear and pointed statement of his positions , and though he endeavors to give us the resuit of his investigations-yet even here , his language is vague , and poetical rather than precise . We understand him to hold , that there is in man a religious faculty , or powers appropriate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty are revealed the objects of faith and feeling ; further that these objects are directly revolved to its inspection or intuition , but are in no sense reached by any process of combination or deduction ; and finally that this religious faculty is not simply intellectual nor simply emotional , but that it partakes of a double nature , being to use the author 's own language , a " kind of intellectual sensibility . " To substantiate this view , he conducts us through a brief survey of the powers of the mind . He begins with the lowest , the sensational faculty . First of all , as he propounds , the mind is active but undeveloped . Before it is conscious of a distinct sensation , and xvhile it is ignorant of any object separate from itself , it exists in " a dim undefinable state of consciousness " " designated as bare feeling . " From this state the mind emerges , and its separate functions of intellectual and emotional activity begin to be performed . Then ensues the condition of mere sensation , corresponding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct - next is perception , with its appropriate emotions in the animal passions . Then is developed the logical faculty , with the emotions that arise on the perception of abstract truth . Last of all comes faith in the beautiful , the good , and the true , xv hich like the faith of infancy is first given in that blended form , in which intellect and feeling are lost in a higher unity , from which unity they are developed in their separate agency . For the accuracy of this analysis , and its fidelity to nature , the author gives no voucher . He doubtless thinks it confirms itself , and would simply refer us to consciousness as its authority . We must own it is a very pretty piece of fancy , by which the mind is made to set off in its lowest stages from the condition of bare feeling , and is then brought around again in its highest attainment to the same condition , in which the mind must first feel , in order that it may know . It has a savor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little child , before he can enter into the kingdom of heaven . But is it true , and if it is not true , what are the reasons by which it is made to appear to be true ? VOL . VII . // We think it is not true , and we hold ourselves ready to show , that the reasons which are alledged in proof are mere plausibilities , which strike the fancy with favor , but do not hold good to a closer inspection . The first consideration , which seems to weigh with Mr. Morell , is the alledged fact , that the mind in its earliest state , . is in a condition of bare feeling , from which as is said , it afterwards passes into that of intellectual activity . The fact , if it were true , would not prove , that the same law holds good in respect to the perceptions of religious truth . But the representation is not true . Mr. Morell confounds the fact , that the mind does not by reflection separate its intellectual from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a nondescript tertium quid , which is neither the one nor the other . The gradually clearer recognition of the distinction between self and not-self , and between thought and feeling , as the mind learns to look steadily in upon itself , he mistakes for a mysterious separation of thinking from feeling . It is enough to say on this point , that we can not form the most indefinite conception of an intellect , in the exercise of a single power appropriate to itself which does not know , and which if it feels , at the same time , does not know while it feels . It may not reflect on the fact that it knows or that it feels . It may not hold its own processes so distinctly before its internal gaze , that it distinguishes the one from the other , but to suppose that it does not exercise these separate powers , and in their natural order , is to suppose that it is no longer an intellect . But we shall here be asked , what is the natural order for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizant of an object , and that the object which it perceives should awaken feelings . To this Mr. Morell and his followers reply , No indeed , for in the case of the perception of material objects , we have a plain reversal of this order . There is here a sensibility first , or a feeling through the bodily organism , and this must precede the cognizance of the external world by the perceiving intellect . This is the strongest point which can be advanced on this side of the question . Mr. M. reasons from it thus . rphe mind , by the awakening of its sensibilities , perceives material objects , therefore , through the medium of its sensibilities , it becomes cognizant of the beautiful and the divine . We rejoin , this argPinent if it proves so much ought to prove more , and it should follow , not only that the mind must first feel before it sees the religious , but it ought first to feel logical relations before it perceives them , and so on , till the conclusion is reached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellect , and the old-fashioned notion that we know first and then feel is entirely exploded . The fact is , that Mr. Morell uses the word sensibility in a sense altogether indefinite , and his whole argument from the phenomena of perception , is a simple play upon words . In common // usage , we employ the word sensibility , to express that affection of the mind by means of an impression on the bodily organism , which is the necessary condition on which we perceive material objects . We apply it also , to those pleasurable and painful states of feeling which accompany this affection of the mind through the senses . We apply it also , to what are appropriately emotions , or the pleasurable and painful feelings which follow those perceptions which are appropriately intellectual , and because forsooth , the mind perceives by means of the sensibilities in the first sense of the word , therefore the mind sees God through its emotions ! This is the argument . The man who chooses , may make it his own . We quote in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher state of consciousness constitutes a kind of intellectual sensibility-an immediate intuition of certain objects , which are in no respect cognizable by the senses and the understanding . " " As sensation reveals only subjective facts , while perception involves a direct intuition of the objective world around us ; so , with regard to higher truths arid laws , the understanding furnishes merely the subjective forms , in which they may be logically stated , while intuition brings us face to face with the actual matter , or reality of truth itself . " After thus propounding this view , he proceeds to give some instances of " the intuition " " of the actual matter or reality of truth . " He takes first , " the perception of beauty in nature or art . " " This perception arises from a direct sensibility of our whole intellectual and emotional nature . " " Beyond sensation and beyond mere understanding , there must be a glimpse of something positive arid real , which we designate beauty-something which appeals to , and corresponds with , a higher state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loftier region of truth , and leaves in the soul a longing for the infinite . " But where is the proof that " this perception arises from a direct seusibility of our whole intellectual and entotional nature ? " A child perceives a beautiful object and is delighted . It has not as yet formed any notion of beauty , or learned to judge of any thing by the standard of beauty . It sees and is delighted . What have we in this process ? P*irst there is the perception of an object by the intellect , then the consequent emotion of pleasure , a very familiar succession of mental states , and following it is worthy of notice , the ordinary law , by which an intellectual perception precedes an emotion . There is nothing thus far of " a direct sensibility of our whole intellectual and emotional nature ; " nothing at all ; nothing that is peculiar or new , except the fact , that the being is by the laws of his nature so constituted , as on condition of the perception of the given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go forward . After many observations of beautiful objects , and the repetition of // many delights of the kind , the observer learns to notice those qualities in these objects which occasion this peculiar emotion . It separates them from those which are indifferent or repulsive . It accustoms itself , as each new object is present to its view , to trace in it the cause of its delight , and comparing each with what has given delight before , it erects these qualities into a separate existence and gives them a name . It calls them the beautiful or beauty . But this essence is " no actual matter , no reality of truth itself , " but simply and solely the product of " the logical consciousness . * , To speak accurately , there is no discernment of beauty in the object at all , but the mind is affected by the object with a distinct and peculiar species of delight . This capacity of the object thus to give it delight , it calls by a separate name , and conceives as a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this something , which a peculiar sense is said to discern . The operation is wholly indirect and reflexive . The direct action of the mind , regards only the object , from which proceeds the delight . This object , and its power thus to affect the mind , are reflected on , as also is the process by which this result is attained . This object of reflex thought , thus indirectly brought to the mental vision , is called beauty or the beautiful , and this indirect and reflex process is always repeated in every case in which beauty is affirmed . At each new observation the mind grows more delicate in its enjoyment of the beautiful , and more nice in its discernment of the causes of its pleasure . It superadds the refined delight , which comes from the consciousness of intellectual power , in discriminating between the beautiful and the ugly , and in suggesting the appropriate reasons for the pleasure it enjoys  --  the peculiar happiness of understanding the causes of its joy . At last , the man with an eye cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe and having feasted on every variety of landscape , attains a judgment so refined , that he pronounces with the rapidity of thought , and a taste so just , that he needs but to look , and he is offended or entranced . He beholds a wondrons painting , which the vulgar would pass by as indifferent or unadorned , and his eye takes in all its import , and reads at a glance the intent of its author . He is intrbduced to a delicious landscape , and the scene is swimming in beauty , while he forgets himself and is dissolved into rapturous delight , losing his consciousness in the picture before him . He forgets that he sees , forgets that he feels , forgets all the processes through which he has passed , forgets all the multitude of perceptions and judgments which he is at the very instant enacting , for he lives only in the object before him . Here , if any where , would be a case of " a direct sensibility of the whole intellectual and moral nature . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // that eye , in every glance of that discerning intellect , in every exquisite delight of that refined sensibility , there are represented , thousands of delights and comparisons and judgments , that have gone before . In the busy workings of that entranced spirit , there is the most exciting and exhausting activity of an intelligent nature , not the passive subjection to a potent spell . What is to be thought of that philosophy of the beautiful , that would degrade all these intelligent processes to a mere instinctive sensibility , that would deny the wondrous power of thought and feeling , to twist their " secret chains " so finely together , that they should seem to be one magic cord , and insists on calling such ajudginent and such a taste , an instinct or an unreasoning sensibility . What ought we to judge of a philosophy , which calls itself by all the high-sounding names in the dictionary , and spurns its humbler neighbor with epithets borrowed from the kennel , but which itself degrades the cultivated taste or the intelligent conscience , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the unreasoning skill of the bee and the beaver . We repeat the assertion , that this high-sounding and self-confident declamation about the sense of the beautiful , as though it were a blind instinct , and about the moral faculty , as though it were the passive recipient of an impulse from without , and not an intelligent and complex power appropriate to a being made in the image of God , does not elevate but rather depresses man . Whatever may be the assumption of those who bid us follow feeling , in matters of duty , and let alone reasoning ; or who exalt faith in matters of religion , and distrust argument , their views will be found on a nearer inspection , to tend to depress man to a rank with the brutes , rather than to raise him to a fellowship with the angels . On this Doint we need not follow the author any farther . In order to illustrate this higher consciousness , he refers us to the perception of moral truth , and its recognition of the true and divine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of evidence leads us to " assign a separate sphere to moral truth , and appeal to moral consciousness as the direct foundation of our thoughts and feelings on this subject . " Of faith he says , " Faith we regard to be the highest intellectual sensibility . It is not possible to say whether it resembles most an intellectual or an emotional state of consciousness , the two seem to be perfectly blended in that pure spiritual elevation where our intellectual gaze upon truth , is not separable from the love and ecstacy we feel in the contemplation of it . " WTe might comment at some length on these dicta of our author . But we do not think it necessary . The course of thought which we have already followed in respect to the sense of the beautiful , , * can easily be applied to the alleged sense ( or senses ; shall we call them ? ) of the good and the true . // Chapter II . is " on the distinction between the Logical and the intuitional Consciousness . " The title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen to indicate this distinction , is open to serious objections on scientific grounds , but the distinction which it describes is one of the most important which can be drawn . It is no other than that between thoughts and things , between our perceptions of realities and the abstract conceptions which we form concerning them . it is , as our author observes , not a new distinction . It has not , however , been developed by any writer as clearly as is desirable , and as we shall show , it has not been rightly conceived by our author . It is a distinction to which he attaches the greatest importance , and from which he derives the most sxveeping conclusions in respect to the essence of religion , the nature of revelation , and the true character and value of doctrinal theology . To it he solicits the especial attention of his readers , as vital to his whole system , and we must do the same for the remarks which we make upon the use to which he applies it . His first remark is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness is representative and indirect ; while that which we obtain by the intuitional consciousness is presentative and immediate . " To the truth of this remark we assent . We acknowledge also its very great importance . The concrete must precede the abstract . The abstract all depends upon the concrete . The abstract can convey no new element of knowledge to the mind . It can simply combine and separate those which are given in the concrete . The original and direct cognitions of the mind , including the perceptions of the senses and the disceruments of the intellect , are the only materials from which the entire structure of knowledge is reared . To illustrate what we mean , let us suppose an inhabitant of an inland country never to have seen a ship . The way to give him the fullest and most complete notion of this existence , is to show him a ship , or in the language of Mr. Morell , to give him a direct intuition of it . If this can not be done , you can describe a ship to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing , by the abstract conceptions for which they stand , you can bring before the mind , some concrete realities to which it is like , and thus give a vivid impression of the thing ; or failing of this , you can induce by logical definition a notion , less satisfactory indeed , but which yet may be better than no definition at all . If , however , the mind has not had the intuition of every simple element to which you refer it , your description so far is in vain , if for instance , it has never had the impression of color , no descriplion of color can avail . Even if the mind has had cognizance of every such essence , the description must fall far short of the intuition of the reality . No words could give to any man who has not seen them , anything like a full conception of a ship , a // mountain , the ocean , or a thunder-storm. &amp;o far , we agree with Mr. Morell , and so far we presume . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application which he makes of these principles . " The case is precisely the same with regard to the existence of an absolute Being , of a God . If any one imagine that he can ever attain the full conception of the Deity by a process of logical definition Or reasoning , he xviii be utterly disappointed of his hope . the primary conception of the infinite , the absolute , the self-existent , is altogether undefinable , &amp;c . Reason up to a God , and the best you can do is to hypostatize and deify the final product of your own faculties , but admit the reality of an intellectual intuition , and the absolute stands before us in all its living reality . " He then proceeds to place the necessity of this intuition of God , on precisely the same footing , with the necessity of having a direct intuition of harmony in music . We inquire here , does Mr. Moreil suppose that by the process of intuition even , he or any one beside , " can ever attain the full conception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze on the iiving " reality " of that Being whom " no man hath seen at any time . " We see not how he can hold back from this conclusion , on the principles which he so confidently propounds , but we will not hold him to it . We will suppose that if he replies , as he must to save himself from impiety , that by a full conception , he intends an adequate logical notion , or a conception that represents all the elements of the notion of the infinite one , and refers us to what he says of " the infinite , the absolute and the self-existent , " which must be given directly to our intuition , our first impulse is to shrug our shoulders and pause to take breath . After this natural , if not necessary interruption , we proceed . Let it be conceded that the infinite , the absolute , and the self-existent given to our intuition , is not the infinite , the absolute and self-existent Being , but a primary conception that is nudefinable , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then of a conception , not of an existence , that we have this cognizance . If this be true , it is quite aside from the way in which we are acquainted with the finite , the related and the dependently existing . rfhese are given to our intuition , not as " the finite , the contingent and the dependent , " but we have to do with limited , contingent , and created beings , whose qualities we abstract and constitute into logical essences , which have no separate existence out of the minds which create and communicate them . To these conceptions , by an original law of thought , we attach another conception , that of negation , and then we have the not or In-finite , ( or , as the spiritualists will have it in order to save their favorite infinite from an origin so humble and earthly , the indefinite , ) the not contingent or absolute , the not created or self-existent . To this ordinary process , the mode by which we are told we gain these pe // culiar conceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in striking contradiction , and we are told in the very place where so sharp a distinction is drawn between the intuitional and logical consciousness , that we have a distinct and direct intuition of an indefinable kind of conception , which itself proves to be nothing but an abstraction , pertaining to the logical consciousness ! But we go farther ; if we have not the direct intuition of a Being to which pertain the three qualities of the absolute , the infinite , and the self-existent ; but these are to be considered as peculiar and indefinable conceptions only-then as it is manifest , that the conception of the absolute , is different from that of the infinite and both from that of the self-existent ) it follows that there are three conceptions , each of which is separately given to this higher intuition . But it is clear that we have not yet attained the full conception of the Deity . The conception of the absolute , the infinite , the self-existent , does not give us the conception of the absolute , the infinite , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if these are given as three several conceptions . In either of these cases , it still remains to be shown , how the mind unites them into a single conception , in which these three constituents become one . By what intuition is this accomplished ? This difficulty being gotten over , though we see not how , we need another intuition by which we know that there exists rn rerum natura , an actual Being answering to this conception . It will hardly do to say as our philosopher ought to say , that he sees the reality , the " actual matter " of the truth itself . It would run a little counter to the plain statement of the Scriptures , as well as be a little immodest . For with all his intuitions we can hardly suppose , that our spiritualist will claim to have attained to the beatific vision of God , whom no man hath seen nor can see , and live . If it still be urged , that it is of little use to push these questions out into these refined details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether sui generis , we have only to say , that it is still desirable to know what the genus is , however peculiar it may be . It gives a degree of satisfaction to know , first , that the mind is furnished with a kind of intellectual sensibility ; second , that this sensibility discerns a conception , which is not exactly a conception ; and last of all that this conception is somehow referred to a being which is not distinctly known to exist . Such is the discernment of this boasted intuition which was to give us the " matter , " or " actual reality " of the truth . We arrest our course of criticism upon Mr. Morell , in order to explain what we suppose to be the true relation of the knowledge which we attain by abstract conceptions , to that which is given by direct inspection , or if we use the language of the author , the relation of the logical to the intuitional consciousness . We have already illust*rated what is the difference between the // two in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between the inspection of a ship and the descrip. * tion of it , is apparent to all . The fact is equally obvious , that no description can give an impression as full and adequate , as that which actual inspection secures . It is equally apparent , that unless all the notions of which the description is composed are present to the mind , the description itself can not supply them . What now is the relation of that knowledge of spiritual realities , which is attained by a logical description , to the actual intuition of the same ? We answer , the same as in the case of sensible objects . This Mr. M. allows , but adds , that the elements necessary to the conception of these realities , can be furnished from no other source , but are elements which no other kind of being shares in common with them . This we deny , and it is precisely at this point , that we differ altogether from him . We conceive of God as a Being-infinite , self-existent and independent . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first that of existence , and is not this common to all the things that are ? What shall we say of the notion of the infinite ? Do we not possess the notion of the finite , by abstraction from the limited objects with which we are conversant , and when we have attached to it a negation , and proceed to affirm that all the attributes of God are not limited like our own , have we as yet occasion to apply to intuition for any new notion ? Is it replied that this notion of the infinite , is only negative , and can not be a positive notion-we ask , what if as a conception it is negative ? Without doubt it is . But when we procccd to apply it to powers and other attributes actually existing or conceived og we affirm that something exists , be it knowledge , wisdom , or power , which is unlike these limited powers or attributes of finite beings ; and thus by its application , it becomes affirmative . However little knowledge this may give us , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive too . If the argument is driven still farther , and we are told that on our own principles , we have no right to the notion of the infinite , because we as yet have had no intuition of an infinite in the concrete , we reply , that the two notions are given together ; that on occasion of every limited quality , we affirm the actuality of its limitation , and the possibility of its want of limitation . If we are asked whence we get the notion of negation , we reply , that thus much is certain in regard to it , that to find it , we are not required to resort to a peculiar intuition which is appropriate to spiritual objects , but it is common to things celestial and things terrestrial . We are not disposed for the sake of a system , to turn skeptics , or to defraud our nature of a single elementary notion which it requires , because we can not answer all the questions that might be asked in regard to it . Still less // are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when those already possessed will suffice . But here we are asked , Do you imagine that this conception is at all adequate to the reality ,  --  that it is in any sense a full conception of the Deity ? We reply , we do not contend that this conception can be at all adequate or full , , compared with that of the vision of God . The description of a ship falls far short of the sight of it . the man who had seen the most elaborate , the most just , and the most highly wrought description of Mount Blanc from Chamouney , would exclaim , when he came to see the " axvful mount , " that the conceptions which he had possessed were altogether poor and miserable , when compared with the reality which he beholds with amazed senses . How much less can any conception be adequate to the actual vision of the uncreated God , if such vision shall ever be allowed . We ask Mr. Morell , in our turn , whether he proposes by intuition to gaiu a full conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he say , " If any one imagine that he can ever attain the full conception of the Deity by a process of logical definition or reasoning , he will be utterly disappointed of his hope . " If we substitute " intuition " for " logical definition , " the remark will be equally true , and equally appropriate to his own partisans . But to frame the conception of God is one thing ; to affirm that a reality corresponds to this conception is another . How is this accomplished ? What name shall we give to the act ? We reply , we believe that a being exists answering to this notion , according to the same princil ) les and by the same laws , through which we believe any other truth . What these laws are , it is no place here to explain . We affirm only , that there are no peculiar laws , no principles other than those which are employed in every case of belief , whatever may be the subject which that belief concerns . As there are no peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception may be framed , so there are no peculiar principles by which this conception is affirmed to exist . Not an element of this conception is given to the religious intuition alone , not a principle is furnished by which it is declared to be , nor a peculiar process by which its reality is proved to the mind . It is true this sublimest of all conceptions may be suggested to the mind as by a flash , and the arguments whicl'r prove it to exist may arrange themselves to a convincing conclusion with the speed of lightning , and the mind may rest with unshaken fixedness upon the overwhelming conviction , so as to know that God is , as really as it knows its own being . But it is by faith , not by intuition ; for when the result can be attained by faith , what need is there of a special insight . It is by faith , not by sight , else there were no room for responsibility ; it is by faith , not by revelation , otherxvise the religious in man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties by which he knows his // God , could neither give a reason of their hope to themselves , nor to other minds . It is true also , that the moral feelings may have much to do with the healthy action of the reasoning powers , and with the distinctness with which the mind reaches and holds its conclusion . It is true , that when these feelings are right arid vigorous , the mind from premises so obvious , rushes to its conclusion , with a speed which its own rapid eye can not trace . To call this process intuition , by a very loose use of the word , may be tolerated ; but in no strict and philosophic sense is it even tolerable . To make it a special process , in distinction from the ordinary methods of belief , needs a " special intuition , " which we neither possess nor desire . But says Mr. Morell , " Reason tip to a God arid the best you can do is to hypostatize and deify the final product of your own faculties , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute stands before us in all its living reality . " Of the first part of this remarkable passage we need say nothing more , than that it is difficult to see how a conception of God by man , can be any other than the product of his own faculties , and if a man " hypostatizes " or " deifies " this product so far as to believe it exists , we see not what more is required . In respect to the latter half , we have only to repeat the questions already askedWhat is " the absolute which stands before us in its living reality ? " Is it the conception of the absolute , or is it the absolute being , and if neither , what is it ? And here we leave this chapter " on the intuitional and logical consciousness . " The distinctions in it are many of them well drawn . But whether true or false , they do not require in this place any notice from us . We are compelled also to omit any extended notice of chapters 3d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " On the Essence of Christianity . " The essence of religion , our author makes to consist in " the feeling of dependence , " which feeling , not being exactly an emotion nor a cognition , but a state " of the intellectual sensibility , " implies and therefore reveals an object corresponding to itself . As the feeling is of the nature of the infinite , the being whom it involves is of course infinite . These views we regard as vague and false . There is but little of tkem that we understand ; the little that we do understand , we regard as wholly false . Doctrines similar to these , are advanced in Theodore Parker 's " Discourse of Religion , " and were discussed by us in our notice of that work . Chapter V. is on Revelation , and it contains principles that require the closest scrutiny . If they are true , they are of the greatest importance . If they are false , the error is most serious in its nature and in its consequences . We shall state them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to our author , is the comtnunication of knowledge . It supposes , // therefore , something to be communicated , an intelligent being or beings to whom it may be imparted , and some process or method of which this being is susceptible , by which it may be brought within his reach . The only two methods of which the human mind is capable , are those of the intuitional and the logical consciousness . To suppose any third method , would be to suppose the human being altered in some of the essential constituents of his nature . The author then proceeds to ask , By which of these methods is religious truth revealed to man ? To prove that it is given by intuition , and not by the logical method , he gives the following reasons . Intuition , like revelation , supposes that the object is given to the mind-i , directly , 2d , from God himself , 3d , that it could not have been gained by our own efforts ; and 4th , it supposes a kind of knowledge which lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration , he dwells at some length . The processes of the logical faculty are two , definition and reasoning , and neither of these he contends can convey to us new knowledge . Definition can not , for it implies some previous knowledge of the thing to be defined . If we have had no experience of the thing , " we can only attempt to convey the idea in question by comparing it with some other experience which it most nearly resembles . " Reasoning can do no more . " Whether our reasoning be inductive or deductive , the conclusion of the whole is always virtually involved in the premises . To reason at all , we must have certain DATA* and must also employ distinct and intelligible terms , but it is evident these data and these terms always imply an amount of experience in the question , without which all our reasoning would be empty , and beyond which our conclusion can never go . " " The object of a revelation is to bring us altogether into another and higher region of actual experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data from which we may draw new inferences ; and all this lies quite apart from the activity of the logical faculty . " But here another question arises : Can not a verbal communication of religion be made by an inspired teacher , through the medium of a logical explication of doctrines , which mankind are to receive as sent to us on Divine authority ? To this he replies , So long as the teacher keeps within the range of the experience of his hearers , so long they can understand him , but there is nothing new revealed . If he goes without this range , he is not understood , and of course there can be no revelation . The only way , m which he can be the means of imparting new truth , is by being the means of elevating his hearers to a new and higher religious consciousness , so- that they can see the truth for themselves . This being done , he can explicate to them their own knowledge in the way of definitions , and draw from it , appropriate inferencos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the // Jewish and Christian revelations were in fact made to man . " The aim of revelation has not been formally to expound a system of doctrine to the understanding , but to educate the mind of man gradually to an inward appreciation of the truth concerning his own relation to God . Judaism was a J ) rop*deutic to Christianity ; but there was no formal definition of any one spiritual truth in the whole of that ceconomy . " " If we pass on to the Christian revelation itself , the mode of procedure was generically the same . There was no formal exposition of Christian doctrine in the whole of the discourses of the Savior . His life and teaching , his character , his death and resurrection-all appealed to the deeper religions nature of man ; - instead of offering a mere explication to the understanding , they were intended to furnish altogether new experiences , " &amp;c . The fallacy of this plausible scheme , arises from the equivocal sense in which the phrase , " new knowledge , " is employed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conception of spiritual realities , no elementary notions are required , which are either new or peculiar . To say then , Can you give to a blind man the notion of color , or to the deaf man that of sound , by using any number of words , is to use illustrations which have not the least pertinence . As far as new conceptions are required to reveal God to man , they are new combinations of simple notions common to all the race , and these it is competent for the " logical consciousness " to create , and to comprehend . When then , a messenger comes to me from God , and presents before me those sublime conceptions which describe spiritual realities , he does but take those elements which are common to the intellect of man , and unite and arrange them together into new combinations . His office , however , is not simply nor mainly to present new combinations of thought . To do this , would be to amuse me with glorious pictures of his own imagination , or to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge which he gives me , is the assurance by proofs which I can not resist , that there are realities which correspond to these conceptions , or in other words , that these conceptions are also facts-that these words of his , which in the mouth of a false prophet , would be the imaginings of man , do in very deed stand for things this is knowledge ; if it conveys to us the belief of new facts and realities , it is new knowledge , and this kind of knowledge , the logical consciousness is able both to impart and receive . Nay , it is only by means of this part of our nature , that new knowledge can be revealed at all . Nor is it true as the author states , that " the aim of revelation has not been formally to expound a system of doctrine to the understanding , but to educate the mind of man , " &amp;c . The aim of revelation , has been to convince men of certain truths , which they // could well enough conceive , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not like to obey them . It is true , that these truths were not made known to them in the terms of systematic theology , for the plainest of all reasons , because this was not the way to lead men to believe and obey them ; but it is true , that at every step of the education of the race , the great object of revelation has been to bring truth before the mind , as a reality , either by making known that which had been unknown before , and which when known , would be new , or by exciting a new belief in that which was already familiar . The elementary notions employed , were common to the race-they were given by the conscience of every responsible human being . rp he new conceptions into which these were combined , were few in number , easily comprehended , and they soon became familiar to the mind . The great object of the inspired messengers has been , to inculcate and secure the belief in their reality , and to excite to the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that this has been a gradual work . Through moral perverseness , and consequent mental imbecility , the race has slowly received these truths , and hence by great pains-taking and at an immense expenditure of instrumentality , has one truth after another been established in the belief of mankind . We do not forget that there is a knowledge of things , which is higher and more complete than any which is given by words , and that one great value and use of words , is to direct and revive our knowledge of things . We are forward to confess also , that the knowledge by experience , is far more impressive and vivid , than any which mere descriptions can furnish . All to which we object is , that illustrations should be drawn from facts of this kind , to subjects to which they have no application . Nor do we deny , that the life of the Savior produced a stronger impression on his generation , than the many words which fell from his lips ; nor that the pure lives and serene deaths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cause of Christ , than thousands of sermons , or perhaps , than any single book of the written word . We only say that these facts have nothing to do with the doctrine which they are adduced to confirm . The value and power of all this knowledge by experience is , not that it frrrnishes new conceptions , but new and more vivid convictions ,  --  not that it gives us new knowledge , but a more realizing and controlling faith . And here it is natural to ask , whether on the principles of Mr. Morell , a revelation can be supernatural , and at what stage and part of this process , a miraculous agency can be exerted . The author most distinctly affirms his belief in " special and divine arrangements " which lead to a state of mind , " in which there is involved an extraordinary and miraculous elevation of the re // ligious consciousness of certain chosen individuals , for the illumination of humanity at large . " This state of mind he calls inspiration , and in it he includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation , " as distinguished from revelation in general . To this subject he assigns a separate chapter . At the outset of the discussion of the supernatural in the Christian system , under this somewhat novel denomination , he tells us that revelation implies two conditions or parts , the objective and the subjective ; and that according to this distinction , " we may say that revelation in the Christian sense indicates that act of Divine power by which God presents the realities of the spiritual world immediately to the human mind ; while inspiration denotes that especial influence wrought upon the faculties of the subject , by virtue of which he is able to grasp these realities in their perfect fullness and integrity . God made a revelation of himself to the world in Jesus Christ ; but it was the inspiration of the apostles which enabled them clearly to discern it . " Inspiration " mdicates rather the elevation of the religious consciousness , and with it , of course , of spiritual vision to a degree of intensity peculiar to the individuals thus highly favored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles to the question of the inspiration of the Scriptures . This , as he justly remarks , is incidental to the previous question , concerning the possibility and the nature of revelation to living men , for it is quite supposable that revelation should be given , and yet never be committed to writing . Leaving this question for the present , we will look a little more narrowly at the bearing of this view of revelation and inspiration as above defined , upon the great question of their supernatural and miraculous character . We do not push the question , for we have no right to do so , What is the nature of these divine arrangements , by which inspired men , with the religious consciousness supernaturally raised , are enabled to see religious truth . The author affirms that these arrangements must be extraordinary , and that the faculties which discern the truth , must be supernaturally exalted to a special insight . Let us admit that a revelation is thus secured , arid that it is miraculous . We ask , what can this inspired man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How can he make it known . He must strive to impart it , else it were useless to any beside himself . Can he communicate it to others , or-which is the same thing-can others receive it , unless a supernatural influence is exerted upon their souls ? Let us see ! He goes abroad , and seeks to describe by his own " logical consciousness " and to that of his fellow men , the things which he has seen in inspired vision . In burning words , and with glowing soul , he sets these realities forth . But according to Mr. Morell , they can not be understood . The " intuitional consciousness " of his hearers knows // no ideas signified by these words , and they attach to them no meaning . How then can they discern these truths ? There is only one method possible . The " in tuitional consciousness " of the recipients must also be warmed and roused , to behold the " actual matter " and the " reality " of truth . The author does not shun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others to make it for him . He boldly asserts it , and quotes in its support the declaration of the Apostle , that the things of the Spirit of God must be spiritually discerned . But are all men then inspired , and if inspired at all , are they equally inspired ? There is nothing surely in the principles of the author , nor even in the conclusions to which he himself carries them , which can save us from this inference . He does indeed speak of the tendency of the representations of men inspired , to awake and arouse the intuitional consciousness of others , but in a way so vague and uncertain , as to fail to clear up our doubts . The question still returns-How can t.hese representations of the logical consciousness , possess any such power ? How can these words in an unknown tongue , . supply the idea , not yet present to intuition ? If they can not fully supply it , how can they furnish it in part ? What tendency is there in these words , which though to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living , are to him who hears them cold and dead-what tendency have they to give that which the recipient alone can furnish ? None at all so far as we can see . We fall back upon the dilemtna stated by Mr. Morell himself , if the truth be known , it is not new , and if it is new , it is incomrnunicable ; and we are forced to another , if the truth be known by the recipient , he has been inspired to see it , which if it is unknown , he must be inspired that he may see it , therefore it follows that all men must be inspired , in order to attain any religious truth . It follows also , that those who attain equal amounts of religious knowledge are inspired to the same degree ; and as a supernatural revelation is necessary to attain any religious knowledge , therefore all believers are supernaturally inspired in some degree , and may be to any degree supposable . Thus the truth of a supernatural and miraculous revelation is saved , by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs the wondrous feat of causing the mountain to march to himself , by marching irrperson to the mountain . The discernment of the word by the " inward light " and illuminating spirit as held by William Penn , ends in the degradation and rejection of the same word by Elias Hicks . In regard to such a point as this , we care little for words , but we are bound to care much for things . Mr. M orell may use the term " spiritual intuition " in as loose a sense , or in as many senses as he chooses , and say that he covers all the ground which the truth requires , and may claim that such a use of language is altogether the most rational and philosophical . He may confound as he // does through the entire volume , that intuition of elements which is essential to , and universal with every human intellect , with the intuition of these new combinations which vary with the range of thought that is peculiar to each individual . Both these , he may confound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and all this may be considered well by the author and his readers . rVl*e attempt to follow him in all his obscure windings may be resented , as scholastic and over-nice . But when it happens , as is the case in this connection , that the belief of a fact is also taken up into this large and all-comprehending term , and by being taken up , is in fact lost sight of , the error becomes palpable and as it would seem , of most serious consequence . lATe have already seen that the great end sought for by revelation is belief or Faith . Forasmuch as this faith is and must be connected with a moral subjection to the truth believed , it always depends upon the moral character , and is well called " the obedience of faith . " The truth believed because it is obeyed , will be loved . If loved , it will be thought of , in its reasonableness and in its evidence , in its relations to the wants of the soul , to human duty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought of , and while it is thought of , its truthfulness is seen and acknowledged . Above all , as the man knows in his own bosom how good is the love to God and love to man which it enjoins , how rich in blessedness , how intense and satisfying are its joys , his spiritual intuitions of all these realities project their own clear brightness upon the inspired page , before so unmeaning because not cared for , and they put meaning into uttered words , which till then had been " uncertain sounds . " This intuition is a consequence and not the cause , it is incidental to the belief in the words , not the end for which the revelation is given . Thus to lose sight of the cause in one of its consequences , is a blunder sufficiently serious . But this is nothing to the practical evil with which the error is fraught . This view of spiritual intuition , by defect and omission , ignores altogether the relation of revelation to man 's responsibility , and sinks out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by guilt , active and inexcusable guilt , that man " loves darkness rather than light . " Such an omission as this in " the Philosophy of Religion , " can not but involve a most dangerous error . What too becomes of the authority of revelation and of its binding force , if the truth of its testimony concerning things unseen is not to be placed on the highest ground ? XVhat must be thought of that view of revelation , which fails to recognize the truth , that its inspired messengers bring tidings , which they alone are competent to declare , and which on being declared , carry with them the obligation to be believed ,  --  of the view which sinks this fact out of sight , by an overstatement of the other fact , that this reyelation finds its confirmation in the corres XOL . VII . 74 // pondence of many of its declarations with the experience of men ? Such an omission is not a mere oversight , or if it be , it is an oversight which greatly weakens the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revelation , Mr. Morell has connected a special discussion of the question of the inspiration of the written word . We shall not follow him in this discussion . If revelation is no more than he makes it to be , the question of what is the authority of its record , is hardly worth discussing . If his view of revelation has been proved to be inadequate and therefore to a certain extent erroneous , we need not follow him in the consequences which he must derive from this view . The questions , what this inspiration is , to what subjects it applies , what are the books of which it is true , and what are the evidences by which it is sustained , must stand or fall by independent argument , and to that argument , if fair and truthful , we are willing to trust them . We acknowledge the truth of some of the remarks advanced by the author . Others are halftruths and errors-others still are grossly imperfect and wrong . We leave this subject , because in its relation to the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not take into our plan to argue at length . Chapter VII . is " on Christian Theology , " and is followed by Chapter VIII . " On the Analysis of Popular Theology . " These two chapters are a still farther application of the leading distiuctiori of the book to the subjects named . This application involves the same mixture of strength and xveakness , of truth and error , which have adhered to our author 's apprehension of the distinction thus far . He first inquires into the nature of theology as distinguished from religion . Religion pertains to the intuitional consciousness , and without this , and the sensibility of which it is an affection , theology would not be possible . " In a few words , all religion and all theology have their origin and possibility in a direct and inward revelation . " But this power of religious sensibility is neither steady nor perfect in its action , and hence the logical process must come in " to give greater clearness and distinctiveness to our intuitions ; hence the impulse we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence , in fine , the rise of a formal theology . The effort of thec%gy. it will be seen upon reflection , is always to give a definite form and scientific basis to our religious life and to the spiritual truth involved in it . " We call the attention of our readers to the last phrase , " the spiritual truth involved in it . " How is this spiritual truth involved in this intuition ? What is the process by which it becomes certain of its reality ? This is the question which all along has been confounded by the author , with that of original and direct insight . Or if for a moment its true character , as being a moral or probable inference from appropriate signs , is discerned , it // is still called by this all-comprehending name of intuition , or by what is still worse , " direct revelation . " Without dwelling longer on the nature of theology , which the author explains at some length , we pass to the next point , which concerns " the conditions necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the first and most important is , " the direct inward presentation of the spiritual objects involved in Christianity to the mind , " or in other words , " a religious nature awakened hy the development of the Christian life , " and secondly , " the application of logical reflection to the elements of Divine Truth , which that life spontaneously presents . " Our readers will see for themselves , how these conclusions necessarily follow from the principles of the author . His error is , the inference that a man can not think of a thing without believing it , or in logical phrase , that a man can not have a conception without first believing that this conception has a real existence . It is undoubtedly true , that there are objects of which a man will not be likely to form distinct conceptions until he believes their reality , and especially is it true , when these objects are matters of internal experience , and involve the exercise of moral and religions feeling . But it is not true , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does form them , and that his " reasoning will not be conclusive . It is also true , that in judging or reasoning on matters of fact , the value and interest of a real existence is often of the greatest importance , to enable a man to do justice to its weight as an argument , and hence unbelieving interpreters of the scriptures and scoffing speculators about conscience and the government of God , sometimes make the xvildest work in reasoning , as to what is truth and error ; but the difficulty here is not that they can riot form a notion of the truth , but that they will not open the mind to its real import . Often is it evident that they do distinctly conceive of the truth , but that they do not give to it its just weight , through haste and the inadequate apprehension of its importance . Nor is it in the least true , that " men unregenerate " are really or necessarily destitute of the materials from which they may , and often do reason correctly . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as both groundless and absurd . The author does not name the Bible as one of " the essential conditions of Christian Theology , * ' arid gives as the first reason , that the written word was not necessary to theologians of the apostolic times , nor need it be to the existence of theology at all ; which is true , but not pertiiient to the case in hand . Secondly , he remarks that the scriptures are not valuable , as a repository of theological truth , but to enable us to experience the spiritual life of the Apostles , that we may see truth with their eyes , so that from the knowledge implied in his own intuition , each man may construct his theology ; which is not true , and therefore not pertinent . // On this point we need not repeat the remarks ah'eady made , which were designed to show that the scriptures furnish to all men new knowledge , and that this knowledge can be comprehended by all . If thos** views are just , the theologian must resort to the scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of which to construct his logical system of theology . It is scarcely necessary to state , what are the opinions of Mr. Morell in respe'ct to the method of theology . As all theology is produced by the action of the logical consciousness , as it reflects on the materials furnished by the spiritual life , the only right theological method will be first to create the materials , and then to reflect upon them , and arrange them in logical order and consistency . Any other method is consequently nnnatural and productive of evil . The develo*ement of theology is equally easy of explanation . Theology will change and make progress , as the spiritual life is more and more enlarged and purified , for so will its materials be furnished in more ample abundance . So also , will it depend for its ultimate perfection , on the perfection of logic as an art , and the correctness of the philosophy on which this art is based . Upon these points and on the uses of theology , we need not offer extended criticism . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our critique of his opinions . If we have not exhausted the patience of our readers , we confess that we have wearied our own , in the task of following the replication of the same fundamental error , in its varied application to each new topic that is started . While we are interested by the practical truth which is often so well stated and enforced , we are as often vexed with the scientific explanation of it ; while we respect the discernment of the author in understanding so well the inquiries and difficulties of the cultivated men of our times , we wonder at his want of success in meeting these difficulties . There is one topic , however , which he discusses at great length , which we may not dismiss , and that is the true nature and value of dogmatic or metaphysical theology . This point is a prominent theme in this volume , and we doubt not that the tone of our author on this subject will give him much favor with many amiable and earnest men , who will vary greatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or who will reject entirely his philosophy . We choose rather to state the views on this subject which are adopted with more or less distinctness by not a few of our own time , without inquiring whether we state them precisely as advanced by Mr. Morell , or whether we do or do not add to those which he propounds . It is objected against scientific theology , that it is human speculation , and therefore imperfect and not to be trusted . ' So also // the interpretation of the scriptures is human , and therefore liable to error . For the same reason , human intuition of spiritual truth is exposed to imperfection , and is so far exposed to this evil , according to Mr. Morell , as to require the aid of the logical consciousriess to fix its gaze , and to correct its observations . If by the word " speculation " is intended reasoning from premises that exclude scriptural testimony , the objection applies to infidel or half-believing philosophy , which is only one kind of metaphysics ; or if is meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason alone , this also is rationalistic speculation , which is still another kind of scientific theology . Let the arguments against these particular species of metaphysical theology be urged , and we certainly shall interpose no hindrance . Only let not objections against a subordinate species , be ignorantly or hastily transferred to an entire class . It is objected again , that each system of theology displaces the one that has gone before it ; ' that one philosophy of religious truth , has its day , and then another takes its place , equally confident of success and of lasting influence , ' so that philosophy as applied to such points is a matter of fashion , and like the fashions in other things is changeful and fleeting . ' Of this objection we can only say , that if the fashions change in philosophy , they change also in interpretation ; if new versions of scientific theology , take the place of those which are gone by , so do new versions of the meaning of the Scriptures . If therefore we ought not to trust any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will by-and-by be abandoned ; so we ought to form no opinions of the import of a part or the whole of the Scriptures , because we are as certain that these intqrpretations will by-and-by be displaced in part by others . Besides , not only do new and diverse interpretations of the word give place to each other , but this is eminently the case in regard to views of Christian duty . On no subjects do the opinions of religionists suffer greater changes than upon such questions . At one time practices are tolerated , which not many years afterwards are denounced by large numbers of Christians , who wonder at their former ignorance and blindness. rp0 be consistent , the objector should meddle with no questions , and form no opinions , upon points of practical morality . He should establish no principles and perform no actions , lest he should think or act in such a way , as to be inconsistent with the views of the coming generation . That the science of theology should make progress , and in its progress should suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthy the attention of every student of truth . Scientific theology must change , as every other branch of knowledge changes , by its advancement . It will and ought to make progress , as it developes and abandons the errors which other days have allowed , and as it sees more clearly and defines more // successfully the truth , received both by the past and the present generation . But it xviii be asked , Of what value then are your creeds , that claim to be orthodox ? If one is truer and better than another , why refer to both as standards of Christian truth . ' We reply , because all these creeds contain so much truth , and because the error in each of them is so slight and unimportant compared with the truth which they all contain , and because also the most imperfect recognize the great essentials of the Christian system . But we are told that the Scriptures are sufficient of themselves ; ' and that the study of the Scriptures without the embarrassment of scholastic metaphysics , is the safest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of Christian truth . ' We reply , that the language of the Scriptures is in part philosophical , and the reasonings logical . Or if this be denied wholly , it can not be denied , that all language is logical , for it attempts to convey to us thought by description and testimony . In other words , it seeks to define to us truth , to give to us precise and clear conceptions of things , and to excite in us a firm belief of their real existence . It may not do this by the peculiar method called scholastic , by the use of terms exclusively abstract , but its end is only attained , when we have notions of things . If then we have correct notions of things , we ought to be able to express them , and in that language which is acknowledged to be the most accurate and clear of all others , the language of science . To do this is our dignity and our duty . Accurate interpretation , leads ns at onc.e into scientific definition and reasoning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To avoid this inference by denying that the Scriptures give us positive truth , and to say that their main design is to waken spiritual life , is to utter nonsense to avoid the force of an argument , or to commit suicide to avoid deserved hanging . Besides , it can be demonstrated from the history of metaphysical systems , that their worst errors have resulted not so much from incorrect reasoning as from false premises , and that these premises in the majority of cases , have been errors of interpretation . The exegesis , not the metaphysics of philosophers has been oftenest in fault . What then can be done to avoid the recurrence of the evil ? Shall we not reason at all ? It were as reasonable to say that a man should never use his eyes , because now and then he sees amiss . Or , shall we reason without rule and without instruction , instead of reasoning metaphysically and by the rules of science ? If it can be shown , that reasoning in common life , is a different process from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force ; but as this can never be shown , we can not , and shall not believe , that reasoning any more than " reading and writing come by nature . " Moreover , it is now beginning to be understood , that while truth is one and always // consistent with itself , yet the same truth may be differently stated , and that the truth in the Scriptures is expressed in the language of common life , and is so to be interpreted . Metaphysicians have doubtless erred in finding their own philosophical dogmas , too often and too readily , in the declarations of the inspired word . This may be objected against scientific theology , as an evil incidental to science condncted by human hands . It is fair to ask however , what men would not have found there , if they had let metaphysics alone ; what vagaries and fancies , what contradictions and nonsense ? But to whom is the merit to be ascribed of discerning the true nature of Scriptural language , and the difference between this and the language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be by their own mistakes and errors that theologians have learned to make this distinction , but yet it is to them chiefly that their adversaries owe it , that they are able to contrast the Scriptures with metaphysics , to the injury of the latter . But scholastic metaphysics have intermingled their own absurd and unreasonable dogmas with the simple doctrines of Christianity , nay it is even true , that many of the most common terms that are now in use by unlettered Christians , originated with some hair-splitting schoolman , who derived them in about equal portions from his Aristotle and his Bible . ' This may be true , but how much greater had been the evil , if there had been no scholastic theology and no Aristotle-xvhat a loss to vigorous thought , to clear distinctions , to cogent argument and to consistent faith . If all this good has been attended with unavoidable evil , does the advantage cease to be real and great , because the evil is serious ? Rather does the evil impose upon the student of Christian truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , that it may expel the errors of past metaphysics . But the spirit of scientific theology is a spirit of excessive refinement and of sharp controversy , upon points that are of trifling moment . It cares more for a perfect system of conceptions than it does for a practical belief in the realities to which they correspond . It rests contented with an orthodox creed of abstract statements , and asks not for an earnest faith in the stirring facts which these statements concern . ' It is true , that faults of this kind may be brought to the charge of many theologians , and that a spirit of this sort always prevails in communities , that are wasting away under the " dry rot " of a " dead orthodoxy . " We acknowledge that zeal for sound and consistent conceptions of truth , is a very different thing from faith in the realities which those conceptions concern . But periods of dead orthodoxy are marked with little zeal for metaphysical discussion and little faith in scientific inquiry . They are usually times when such inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , // and the searching spirit of analysis , are rejected as profane , and scouted as " metaphysics . " Old symbols are then reverenced with a superstitions regard , as of higher authority than the word itself , and it is forgotten that they are no other than noble monuments of the zeal and prowess of the scientific theologians of another generation . Such facts as these , constitute no argument against metaphysical theology . At this moment , the men who understand most fully the value of creeds , and who know how to distinguish them from the facts which they concern , are the men who have given to scientific theology their best energies . Other objections , of a similar character to these , might be noticed , but it will suffice to have glanced at the above in passing . To those who seriously propose to substitute the " spiritual life , " as a bond of union and source of knowledge , we have space to offer only a word . It would seem that first of all , a clear and definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life " may be , and of the sources from which it springs and by which it is sustained . To us it appears , that to an intelligent " spirit " like nian , there can be no " life " of higher dignity than the enlightened faith in that truth which God has made him capable of believing and loving , and living for . This truth must be embodied in conceptions self-consistent , else it were not scientific , and any truth other than this were an insult to man 's ration ? il nature-it must be believed to represent real existences , else it were not equal to his demands as a morat being . We do not insist that it should be presented in the careful language of abstract science . But let it be clothed with all the life and energy with which a glowing imagination can invest it , let it be urged home upon the heart with all the energy with which an ardent soul can speed it to its mark , or let it be distilled gently into the softened spirit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which man believes and loves , when he lives indeed . The soul may seem not to know that it responds to this truth , by a consenting judgment . Its discerumeuts may escape its own capacity to trace them out , and its inferences may be more rapid and unerring than the wonderful instinct , with which the creator in pity to the stupid animal , ekes out the scanty supply of intelligence ; yet they are not blind nor mechanical , but are all intelligent processes of a soul made in the image of God . They are parts of that " life " which are fin to belong to such a being , and have no affinity to the functions that are the " life " of the lower creation . " The words that I speak unto you , they are spirit and they are life . " rpo such a being , it is life to feel . Love is his life , but this is surely not an unreasomug and blind eniotion , which knows not what it regards , nor why it loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // heart in swelling joy , to the glorious being in whom it believes . Why should it be thought a higher life first to begin to love , we know not what nor why , and from this love to discover what we love , than first to know what we love and then to love it ? But we may be referred to the mysterious Spirit , that is the author of life , and be told that we may not scrutinize his ways nor limit his power . We would do no such thing , but we must believe , that as he works in nature and gives life to nature according to its laws , so he gives to man his higher life according to the laws of his thinking spirit . We confess that when we hear so much of " life " as differing from the perfect fulfillment of the functions of the moral nature , and of " light " as higher and better for man than intelligence , we greatly fear that an unreasoning and fanatical respect to mere feeling , may soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large experience arid well instructed mind , may seem to be a safe and trusty guide , because the intellect is too wakeful to suffer her chosen son to go astray , even though he pertly disowns her guidance and rejects her authority . It is not in men like Mr. Morell , that we expect to see the results of fanaticism and folly to which their principles may lead . But in minds of another class , this boasted spiritual " light " becomes the wild will-o ' - wisp that leads them idly and at its capricious call , " over bush and briar ; " into a foul arid miry swamp ; and this vaunted " life " terminates in the morbid dreams of the self-deluded mystic , or the passionate convulsions of the self-tormented fanatic.
