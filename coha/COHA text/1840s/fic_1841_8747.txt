If he has improved none since I last saw him , he must be an odd specimen of humanity . Puts letter in his pocket . Mrs. Dibble . Mrs. Dibble Well , my love , and can he not be improved ? Did you ever see a Yankee that could not , in time , adapt himself to all kinds of society ? Dib . Dibble I dare say the city will soon remodel him . His father is immensely rich , and he will probably inherit a large portion of the estate , therefore it is as well to look to him . Who can tell what may be brought about ? Emma is now marriageable . They were schoolmates and favorites with one another . Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble You had better encourage her union with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with one of those animals having more hair than brains  --  the most riciculons of the tribe ourang outang ever yet seen ?

Well , I guess ' t was t' other day . Dib . Dibble So long ago ? Ebe . Ebenezer Not long ago  --  only day ' fore yesterday . You see , I did n't come right here  --  you know such a power of things to see here that a body never sees afore , they strike the mind at once , and time passes afore one becomes anxious of its departure . Hello ! here comes the chap with my trunk . Enter Porter , L. H. , with a trunk . Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Put it down anywhere for the present . Ebe . Ebenezer I say , you feller , what 's your name ?

Ebenezer Life everlastin ' ! you look as handsome as May Rose  --  marciful gracious , I should'nt have known you . Em . Emma You flatter me , Ebenezer  --  tell me why you did not come to see us , when you first came to town . Ebe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it was fore ordination ;  --  you see I had a curious sort of a notion , to see things as they dew them up in New York , and so you see I thought to take a look round fust . But of all natur ' , where did you get such a fine dress ? Em . Emma Fine !  --  I think it is very plain , myself ! Ebe . Ebenezer Sufficient Providence !  --  why our gals , when they 've got on their best bib and tucker , do n't look nothin ' so fine . Em . Emma It is the diffirence between the city and country . But tell me what have you been doing , since you have been in the city ? Ebe . Ebenezer Well , I hai n't been idle , I calculate . You see as soon as I got in , I budged straight off to a tavern , where I see a hull lot of folks  --  some on ' em pourin ' down the liquor  --  some talkin ' politics , and a hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the winders  --  and on the tables , a readin ' newspapers like all fury ; so says I , I guess I 'll do so tu  --  so I lit on a paper and stuck myself in a chair , and my feet on a table along with some pies and doughnuts , and I went to readin ' , I guess ; a letlle the loudest they ever heard  --  read so loud , all the other fellers left the room  --  ' spose they was lookin ' over the papers , but could'nt read . Well , what do you suppose my eyes first lit on ? Em . Emma I could not say ! Ebe . Ebenezer I rather guess you could'nt ; I swanny , if it war n't a real genuine advertisement for a wife . Em . Emma An advertisement for a wife ! Ebe . Ebenezer Yes , right out and out ; think says I , I never hearn of such a thing afore , in all my born days . Em . Emma Oh , it is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me afterwards  --  he told me too , that regular courtin ' was goin ' out of fashion ; well , thought I , I guess I wo n't let any feller get ahead of me , and I calculate I wo n't be out of fashion neither . Em . Emma Well , what did you do ? Ebe . Ebenezer What did I du ? well , I guess I did'nt du much , but what I did du was something  --  I got a sheet of paper , a pen and some ink , and I writ out straight , that I wanted a wife tu . Em . Emma Impossible . Ebe . Ebenezer ' Taint no such thing , I did , by golly  --  I paid a dollar and had it put in a paper , right off ; that was yesterday , after breakfast ; I 'm going down to get an answer . Em . Emma You do not expect any one will be foolish enough to answer it , or even notice it . Ebe . Ebenezer Maybe I du though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please me , I can get another ; I 'll try you , kum , you have hearn say I ' spose it 's most likely , that the proof of the pudding , is in chawing the bag . Em . Emma A very odd and vulgar adage . Aside . I 'll play a trick upon this cousin , yet  --  come , let us into breakfast , it is waiting . Ebenezer and Emma exeunt , R. H. SCENE II .  --  A chamber in Dibble 's house . Enter Emma , R. H. meeting Mary , L. H. Em . Emma Oh , Mary , I 'm so glad you have come  --  I want you to assist me in a little plot or intrigue of my own ! Mary . Mary A love affair , I 'll warrant . Em . Emma It is indeed , but a very harmless one , in which I am concerned . Mary . Mary Well , let me know in what way I cun assist you , and I am at your service . Em . Emma My cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , he has been in the city several days , during which time he has advertised for a wife . This is in strict confidence , now ; he is shortly to go to the office for answers to his advertisement . Wishing to play him a trick , and having some interest at heart  --  I  --  I  --  Mary . Mary You have answered it ! Em . Emma But that is not all  --  I have taken the liberty to use your number , in directing him where I could be found ; there I will receive him , disguised , and win him , and not till he is fairly won , shall he know it is his cousin that has hoaxed him ! Mary . Mary A very fair plot , my friend  --  and I will do my best to render you all the aid necessary ; my house , you are perfectly at will to use , to carry out your designs . Em . Emma If such be the case , then , my fine cousin , it is hard if woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon you . Mary . Mary But , how do you propose to effect your purpose ? Em . Emma In this manner ! Your husband is now absent , and will be for some time ; I wish , when my cousin comes , ( for come , I am sure he will ) to represent myself as Mistress of the house , and you shall appear as my companion . Mary . Mary Very well conceived , indeed  --  but if you should fail to ensnare the gentle cousin ? Em . Emma I have no fear of that ; if we but act our parts well , we shall be sure to make a decided hit , for which our friends will applaud us . Mary . Mary Let the affair proceed rapidly ; I have all a womans ' curiosity for the issue . Exeunt R. H. SCENE III .  --  A Street  --  a Placard on the side of the House  --  Fifty Dollars reward , &c.; Enter Little , L. H. Lit . Little Well , if I make nothing out of this game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ! ha ! why should I not gull him ; ' t is the way one half the world lives , by cheating the other half  --  Ha ! what do I see  --  fifty dollars reward  --  stolen from a jeweler 's shop , a splendid gold watch , worth two hundred dollars ; I am very suspicious , that means me ; I must be on the look out . Enter two Constables , L. H. exeunt R. H. Lit . Little Comes forward . They are after me , that 's certain , but if they catch me , I dare say fifty one dollars will answer my safety  --  oh ! money and villainy , you are the two great levers of the human heart ; the poor rascal is sure to meet his just dues , while the rich one is at liberty to enact his villanies at his own pleasure . Exit , L. H. Enter Ebenezer , R. H. Ebe . Ebenezer Well , I swan to man , this is the tarnallest place  --  this ere New York . All sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em  --  foreigners by the bushel . Guess Europe are unpopulated , now  --  anyhow all come here to see New York . Well , I wonder if dad thinks what I 'm dewing  --  guess he do n't  --  and marm , tew , bless her old soul ! wonder who she gives her warm milk tu , now ? Howsomdever , I 've got my portrait from old dad , and I guess I 'll make it swing  --  if I do n't , put me under a harrow ! The first thing to be done is to introduce myself into society ; I 've lain a plan for that  --  I 've advertised for a wife , ' cause I seed as how the practice is very common , and I do n't want to be behind the age ; besides , I 'm naturally bashful , for I never seed a petticoat that did'nt make me blush . Hello ! here comes my friend Little  --  a fustrate feller , he looks good natured  --  I guess that he has got some news of a wife for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , that I let him into my secrets , right out ; I did  --  he 's a darnation slick chap , I know , ' cause he 's so willin ' to show me and tell me everything . Lit . Little Well my covey , I wish you joy ! Ebe . Ebenezer Du you , though  --  now you do n't say so . Lit . Little I 'm blowed if I do n't ! Ebe . Ebenezer Show now ; I say , you  --  any news about a wife ;  --  have you been tu the office ; is the advertisement answered ? Lit . Little Take care  --  take care  --  do n't be in such a hurry , our New York girls wo n't like you so well for it . Ebe . Ebenezer Shut up , du , I wo n't believe a word on it ; I guess they like to have things done in a hurry , if they do n't , they ai n't like our down east gals . Lit . Little Oh , that 's a notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one from a young widow . Ebe . Ebenezer Damn young widows  --  I 'm afeered on ' em ! Lit . Little I tore it up ; there was one from a spinster . Ebe . Ebenezer A spinster ! do n't know what that is  --  take it away ! Lit . Little I demolished it ; there was one from a chambermaid ! Ebe . Ebenezer A chambermaid ! I say , mister , that wo n't do ; very suspicious ; I do n't like chambermaids . Lit . Little I annihilated it . Ebe . Ebenezer You what ? Lit . Little I annihilated it ; destroyed it . Ebe . Ebenezer Well , why did'nt you say so in the first o n't : speak English , I ca n't bear French ; I never liked the looks o n't  --  that 's why I would'nt have it , go on ! Lit . Little There was one from a girl , whose parents are unkind ; making her home unhappy  --  she wishes for another . Ebe . Ebenezer An unhappy gal  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her note . Lit . Little Here it is ; shall I read it to you ? Ebe . Ebenezer Why , yes  --  that is , if it wo n't be asking too much ! Lit . Little Not at all  --  here it is . Reads letter , which he takes from his pocket . Sir :  --  Having read in the Sun , of yesterday , your advertisement for a wife , I am induced to answer it ; present unhappiness is all that drives to me , to it , else would woman 's natural timidity deter me from taking such a step ; I am young , but twenty  --  am called handsome  --  am industrious , economical and not quarrelsome  --  could love a good husband , and am not fond of society . An interview can be had this afternoon , as my parents are now out to town . If you should conclude to call , you will find my number on the inclosed card ! Ebe . Ebenezer Is that all ? Lit . Little That is the conclusion . Ebe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mistake . Now , what 's on the card ? Lit . Little Never mind that , at present  --  you must get yourself ready  --  she begins her name . Miss Angelica Pink . Ebe . Ebenezer A real novel name , by gosh ! Yes , I will get ready . Will you go with me ? I 'm awful skittish when I get among the gals ; never kissed one but once in all my born days , and then I blushed so that my face burnt my shirt-collar clean off  --  if it did n't dig my turnips ! Lit . Little I dare say , a very backward youth . But you will do better now . Ebe . Ebenezer I calculate I shall . Perhaps I may , but I feel a leetle sheepish , anyhow . Lit . Little No doubt . But let us dispatch business ; ' t is now half-past three ; I will order a carriage directly . Meet me at the Star House in ten minutes ; from thence you can go immediately to see the lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all in a prickly heat with perspiration ! Tarnation ! I guess when dad hears the news he wo n't stare nor nothin ' , nor think I war n't born for no eend ; I reckon Sal Snubbins will kind a wish she 'd had me , after all . Hello , here comes Mr. Little back ; I wonder what it 's for . Enter Little , L. H. Lit . Little I say , Venture , my good fellow , I 'm devilish short of money for a day or two ; oblige me with the loan of ten dollars . I shall be in funds again soon , and will repay you . Ebe . Ebenezer Oh , sartin . Maybe you do n't want twenty ? You can have it if you do ; jest say so . Lit . Little So much the better , my dear fellow ; just make it twenty , though perhaps I shall not need it . Ebe . Ebenezer Never mind that ; here it is . Takes out his pocket-book . There 's a five on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Magnetic Bank ; well now , there 's a tu  --  that 's twelve ; there 's a three , and here 's a one ; and there 's a three on the Temperance Bank  --  that 's nineteen . Let 's see if I ai n't got no change . There 's half a dollar ; here 's a ninepence ; here 's fourpence-halfpenny ; here 's a pistereen and another ninepence , and there 's two cents . That 's right , ai n't it ? Lit . Little All right . Now , sir , consider me your friend . Shakes his hand . How very hot the day is ! Ebe . Ebenezer Not so darned hot , neither . Fust-rate weather to make hay ; as for sweating , that 's reckoned healthy down East , where I come from  --  Rockingham county , New Hampshire . Why , sir , I once drew a yoke of oxen one day when it was so hot they could n't sweat , nohow  --  it dried up ' fore it come out . Exeunt , L. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mary 's ) House . Enter Mary and Emma , R. H. Em . Emma Now I believe all is complete , and I expect him here every moment . Mary . Mary I am really interested in this affair , and hope it will end happily . Knock , L. H. Hark ! did not some one knock ? Knock again . Now draw your vail , and remember your character . Exit Mary , L. H. Em . Emma Well , the sought-for moment has come , and if my hopes are realized , I shall win my cousin 's heart . He is rough and unpolished , ' t is true , but still he has good sense enough to adapt himself to the best society . Drops her vail . Re-enter Mary , conducting Ebenezer . Mary . Mary This is the lady , sir . Ebe . Ebenezer Yes , I expect so . How de you do ? how are you ? To Mary . You may go . Do n't want any more use on you . You may get out . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me , sir ? Ebe . Ebenezer Yes  --  no  --  that is kinder  --  du you ? that is  --  yes  --  du you ever read the Sun ? Em . Emma Sometimes I do ! Ebe . Ebenezer You du ! Well now , so do I , sometimes  --  do n't believe half they say about pills and consumption medicines though ; ca n't gum this are Yankee so , no how  --  although I must say , that steam power is almighty swift , I calculate  --  it beats lightning a leetle ; comin ' down the sound , the Cap'n sead a shower a risin ' , and the way it was a comin ' , war n't a circumstance . The passengers all got afeerd and some of the ladies fainted right out ; I knowed what a time there would be so I thought I 'd be a general benefactor , so I went to the Cap'n and told him what I thought , and that he 'd better put on steam , says he that 's jest the very thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order  --  the steam was put on , and in five minutes we had clean outstripped the storm , though it begun to sprinkle when we started . My dad once heern tell on steam , and he was so taken with it , that he gin ' order , right straight out , for a steam churn , forty hoss power , and the way it would make butter , was a caution  --  and it was the most economical savinest machine , tu as ever drew the breath of mortal life ; why , if you 'd believe me , it would make twenty pounds of butter from a gallon of sour milk . Em . Emma Astonishing ! Ebe . Ebenezer Greatly so  --  maybe you do n't believe it . Em . Emma Certainly I do ! Ebe . Ebenezer Well , I thought so  --  look here , though I snore you 've got a real shck smartish house here  --  hai n't ye ; taint your'n , I ' spose ? Em . Emma No , my parents rent it . Ebe . Ebenezer They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I say , you , whose picture is that are , what you got hanging up there ? regular rum looking customer , ai n't he ? Em . Emma That is one of our ancestors . Ebe . Ebenezer One of your aunt 's sisters , dressed in man 's clothes , I du declare  --  sociable old critter she must have been ; did she ever take snuff ? Em . Emma Snuff , sir ? Ebe . Ebenezer I guess so  --  look here now ; maybe you do n't know what I come here for . Em . Emma I must plead my ignorance of that . Ebe . Ebenezer Well , now , I calculated as much  --  but I can tell you about as quick as anything , I guess ; now I think jest as like as like as not you do n't know who I be neither ; well , as the world has got to hear from me , in some way or other , I may as well begin with you ; I was born down East , in Rockingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first that was hearn of me . When I was born , uncle Zeb said of me  --  you know uncle Zeb  --  heern tell on him ? get out ; you have though ? No ! du tell . Look here , did you ever study jography and ' stronomy ? never did ? well , I thought so . Guess you ai n't never read Thomas 's Almanac ? never did ; well , I thought so ! not know uncle Zeb ! Well , if these New Yorkers ai n't the most ignorantest nation of people ever I did see , then smash my onion bed  --  not know uncle Zeb , I du declare . Why , he raised the biggest turnip in his garden ever did grow , not excepting any . Why , it was so big , nobody would'nt believe it was turnip , and no livin ' soul believes it to this day ; it was so big , it took all the strength of the earth to bear it . Well , uncle Zeb said , when I was born , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , that Miss Natur had done her puttiest that time , any how . I guess she did tu ; there was a thunder storm when I was born  --  I 'll tell you what , if it did'nt roar more than amazin ' , and all the folks said they never saw the like afore . I 'm the youngest of seventeen children , all boys , except one , that 's a gal , she 's next to me , and the handsomest critter you ever set your eyes upon ; folks say she and I look jest alike  --  the gals used to say , that I was proper handsome , but I never thought so ; I never liked myself much , no how , some way or other . Well , my mother named me Ebenezer , that 's my name , Ebenezer Venture , Esquire ;  --  I was educated in school , the school marm always called me her little genus , but it did n't make me proud ; my father was select man of the town , my mother was President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of the Charitable Society at home ; my aunt Nabby , she was a snorter  --  a screamer  --  she conducted the singers in the core of the meeting house , Sabbath days ; as for me , I 'm a team by myself , twenty oxen and a stallion ; I come down to New York to see the place , and tell the folks a thing or two ; I can play on the jews-harp , fiddle , fife , drum and bugle horn , the sweetest ; I can dance anything , from the college hornpipe , to Jim Crow  --  I can read loud , sing , and sometimes make poetry . Em . Emma Make poetry and sing . Ebe . Ebenezer I guess so  --  but like enough you do n't believe me ; Godfray Domano  --  goody gracious  --  du tell . Rot me , what du you wear that are pesky vail for ? Here , I 've been sittin ' all the while and did n't notice it ; come now , take it off  --  you tarnal critter you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am under a vow ; three days must expire before I can remove it . Ebe . Ebenezer A vow ! Well , that does beat natur ' all holler , by jingo ! I suppose you know what I come for , so there 's no harm in showin ' me your face . Em . Emma Impossible . Some might think it was adopted to hide a deformity , but I can assure you such is not the case ; on the contrary , I have been told that I am very handsome  --  but I love not flattery . Ebe . Ebenezer Political destruction ! where 's the man that says you ai n't handsome ? Such pretty feet and hands , and neck , and sich a sweet voice , never can belong to an ugly face . Em . Emma Now you are disposed to flatter , sir . Ebe . Ebenezer Dod rot it if I be , though There ai n't nothin ' in me but what is sincere . But if it ai n't askin ' a favor too much on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you  --  du you sing ? Em . Emma Sometimes I sing a very little to please myself , but I have too poor an opinion of my vocal powers to attempt to amuse others . Ebe . Ebenezer Get out , dew ; you need n't be afeard on me ; I 'll be as quiet as a sucking lamb . Come , jest sing once . Em . Emma Well , then , since you insist , I suppose I must gratify you . SONG .  --  Emma . Love comes not with the din of arms , In battle 's thrilling hour , Nor with the gaudy glow of wealth Is felt its mightiest power : Nor in a glare of glorious fame , By wild ambition bought ; The haughtiest titles earth can give By love are heeded not . But to the soul that spurns the earth , And heavenward loves to gaze , Yearning for brighter , happier spheres , Love is no sudden blaze . It spurns the aid of dazzling wealth , Gold can not tempt its truth ; Its life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ebe . Ebenezer Fiddlers and jewsharps ! if that are ai n't music , then there 's no snakes , that 's all . Now I suppose its my turn next , so I 'll sing you a song of my own making . Em . Emma Nothing would give me more pleasure than to here you sing one of your own songs . Ebe . Ebenezer You do n't say so . Well , I guess I 'll do it , so here goes . Sings . There , now , I guess that 's a cute one , anyhow . Em . Emma I admire your song and singing much . Ebe . Ebenezer You do ! Well , I knowed it ; and now there ai n't only one thing in all human natur ' to make me feel better than wheat at a dollar a bushel , and that is  --  I say , you , did you ever see this letter afore ? Produces letter . Come now , say yes  --  now du . Em . Emma The letter is mine , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised for a wife ? Ebe . Ebenezer I should n't wonder . I ruther suspect I am . Well , there ai n't no use standin ' on ceremony ; so if you 'll have me , I 'll have you , and there 's an eend on it . I want no other recommendation than yourself . I always judge by the physiognomy , when I can see it . So , is it a bargain  --  yes or no ? Em . Emma Why , sir , I would rather have some time to consider upon it . You  --  that is , I am not quite prepared . Ebe . Ebenezer Do n't say a word about that . Come now , do n't be squeamish ; consent to be made Mrs. Venture ; I 'll consent to become your husband , that will be one of my first adventures  --  there will be lots after that , of course . Em . Emma If you insist upon it , I suppose I must , since I have been bold enough to answer your advertisement . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to this singular step . Ebe . Ebenezer Do n't mention it . I 'm told it 's quite fashionable in New York to advertise for wives , and that the old fashion of courtin ' is goin ' to be sacked ; folks have got too much business to attend to this are age of improvements and general railroad extension , to ' tend to courtin ' . But Jehu Christopher ! if you only let me see them eyes  --  they shine , I know they du ! Em . Emma The day previous to my marriage you shall behold my face , and if you do not approve of my looks , you can relinquish me . Ebe . Ebenezer That 's fair , by Hokey ! I 'll marry you to-morrow  --  if I do n't , consarn me all over  --  with your permission . And now I 'm going to my old uncle 's , to tell the news , for I think jest as like as not wo 'll be married there . You 'll like ' em , I swirm . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you 'll like her , tu . Told her all about it , so she knows what I 'm up tu . I 'm goin ' right there now , and then I 'm coming back after you , and you must go there with me , and then  --  Em . Emma And then my vail shall be removed , and you can , if you please , withdraw your promise . Ebe . Ebenezer If I do , I am a pandowdy etarnally ; rip me tight , if I 'd do any sich a thing  --  lands me , what hull acres of happiness in prospective . I could spatiate till there war n't nothin ' left on me ; I must go uncles , right off , and on my way , maybe I wo n't buy nothin ' for the comin ' nuptials ; I do wonder in all natur ' , if jinin ' in the holy bands , tickles every body , as it does me ? Stripes and stars ! Exit , L. H. Em . Emma Well , the plot goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I must hasten , and tell Marry of my success . What a laugh I shall have , at my poor cousin , bye-and-bye ! No time is to be lost , for I must meet him again , at my fathers . Exit , L. H. SCENE V. Enter Mr. and Mrs. Dibble , R. H. Dib . Dibble So , my dear , this is a pretty story , that I hear about my nephews ' advertising for a wife ! Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Very well , my dear . Dib . Dibble But , I tell you , it is not very well , Mrs. D. ; I tell you it is not very well  --  what is Emma to do ? Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Emma will do very well , much better than to marry such stupid fellow ; I am sure she is too good for him . Dib . Dibble How dare you , Mrs. D. ? Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble How dare you , Mr. D.

Ebenezer Hello ! tarnation rot me , what 's the matter ? Judas Iscariot ! but , I guess the marriage pot 's been bilin ' over ; well , thanks to my stars and worsted garters , as my old great grandmother used to say , when anything extraordinary came over , but , I guess I like to have got myself into a pooty pickle , with that are vandew feller in Chatham street . But , I guess I were n't born in the woods to be skeered by owls . Enter Emma , L. H. Ebe . Ebenezer Oh , here you are , are you . Em . Emma Yes , cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you have succeeded with your advertisement . Ebe . Ebenezer Capital , by golly , I 've got a gal right out , and no mistake . Em . Emma You are sure there is no mistake ? Ebe . Ebenezer Conscience all sufficient ! I do n't want specs to see that . Em . Emma What color are her eyes ? Ebe . Ebenezer By the great Ichabod , they shined so bright that I could'nt fix on any particular color , but I calculate they was black as a young skunk 's , if they war n't , they was most almighty blew . Em . Emma Has she handsome teeth ? Ebe . Ebenezer Had'nt she though , I always thought snow was white , but it ai n't no circumstance , compared with her teeth ! Em . Emma Will she marry you ? Ebe . Ebenezer Said she would , right off . I came back to tell you all about it , and I 'm going right off ' to fetch her here , and Em , you mus n't be jealous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Em . Emma You need not fear me , cousin , there is not a spark of jealousy in my composition ; besides , I am very much inclined to think , that there is no occasion for it  --  for I do n't believe half you say of her  --  I know she must be positively ugly , but make haste and bring her here , for I long to see her ! Ebe . Ebenezer To-morrow is the appointed time ! Em . Emma Oh , no let it be to-day  --  you can easily pursuade her , I know women better than you do  --  let it be to-day ! Ebe . Ebenezer Well , seein ' it 's you , I do n't care if du  --  in the mean time , there 's the key of my trunk ; I want you to du a leetle fixin ' to my things  --  I think , like enough you 'll find a dirty dickey and a bosom there , that wants washing , and mind you put in lots of starch . Em . Emma All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good gal  --  I ' spose you know my trunk ? Em . Emma I think I do . Ebe . Ebenezer I thought likely  --  it 's covered with horse hide ; perhaps you do n't know what hoss that are skin come off on  --  he was the darndest slickest , fastest hoss you ever did see , I tell you now ; he could outrun and outjump anything this side of creation , I do n't care where tother was , but he died one day  --  he got old and thin and week , so darned weak , that he had'nt strength to lay down , no how  --  he used to have to lean against the barn , when he wanted to sleep , and dad used to pull his eyelids down , because he had'nt strength to shut ' em himself . Well , he was sleepin ' so one day beside the barn , dad had just left him , when a big hoss fly  --  you 've seen a hoss fly  --  well , a tarnal big hoss fly , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and future bliss , and he stung him right under the eye and the pain caused him to expire , without a groan . It was a kinder horrible thing to think on  --  but I believe after all , it was a blessin ' . Em . Emma A blessing ? Ebe . Ebenezer Yes , a blessin ' ; he would n't never die . Em . Emma Never die ? Ebe . Ebenezer No , he was tu weak , tu far gone , tu die  --  he could n't stood it out ; we 'd give him up ; it was the opinion of the minister he had n't strength enough to die . I used to tell dad he 'd better borrow another horse to help him draw his last breath . Em . Emma He was certainly a most singular animal . Ebe . Ebenezer Guess he was . Dad had him skinned , and put his carcass in the cornfield to scare the crows off . Em . Emma To scare the crows off ? Ebe . Ebenezer Yes , I guess so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornfield after that ; they were taken by surprise . Wall , that are 's his hide upon my trunk . Em . Emma You must consider such a curiosity very valuable . Ah ! here comes my father . Enter Dibble , R. H. Dib . Dibble Oh ! you are here , Emma , and you too , Mr. Ebenezer . So I hear you have taken upon yourself to advertise for a wife . Do n't you think it a pretty business ? Ebe . Ebenezer Well , I like it pretty well , as far as I 've tried it . Dib . Dibble You do ? This is my return for being so anxious to see you . Ebe . Ebenezer Anxious ! Well , that 's what Elder Job Stone used to say to mother afore she ' sperienced religion . " Sister Charity , " says he , " do you feel anxious to-night ? " Dib . Dibble I should be pleased , sir , to have you leave my house immediately ; your company is burdensome , and your board an expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't put yourself out on my account , nohow ; and as for expense , I can pay that . Dib . Dibble I wish , sir , to see you move . Emma , come with me to your mother , girl . Nephew , good day . Exit , R. H. Em . Emma Take no notice of this , cousin ; he is in a pet at present . I shall not go near him , but take my hat and shawl , and make a short call on a friend of mine , till the storm blows over . Good by . Let me see you before you leave the city . I wish you all success with your intended . Exit , L. H. SCENE VI .  --  A Parlor in Mrs. Mindfull 's House . Mary discovered at table , C. , sewing . Enter Emma , hastily , L. H. Em . Emma My friend , assist me quickly ; take my hat and shawl . That 's right ; now help me to put on my vail . I had almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knocks , L. H. That is his knock .

Emma Now for the consummation of my plot . Hark ! he approaches . Sits down and sews . Enter Ebenezer , L. H. Ebe . Ebenezer How d'ye do ? I s'pose you know what I came after now ? Em . Emma You 've come , I suppose , to see me . Ebe . Ebenezer You 've guessed it , by golly . But I want you to marry me right straight off , to-night ; I want you to rig right straight off , and go with me to my uncle 's . Yes , you will now  --  say yes . Em . Emma It is rather sudden ; but if you think it necessary , I see no cause for delay . Ebe . Ebenezer Hurra ! you 're the gal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for this world 's blessin ' ? Em . Emma Blessings ? Ebe . Ebenezer Yes , blessin ' , the rhino ; the dust ; that is what I mean  --  money . Em . Emma Ah , sir ! I 'm not possessed of much ; one thousand dollars is the extent of my wealth . Ebe . Ebenezer Du tell ! I want to know ! Well , I 'm glad on it , ' cause I ai n't huntin ' for riches . I likes to make the gal I love rich myself  --  them 's my notions . Em . Emma I respect your sentiments ; and as a proof of it , I will go with you to your uncle 's immediately , if you desire it , and there , before you all , will I raise the vail that conceals the mystery . Ebe . Ebenezer Hurra ! I feel as happy as two clams in the mud . Put on your bonnet  --  put on your things , and let us away before it is dark . Du you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose  --  but what in particular ? Ebe . Ebenezer Hit me a dough , but if I would n't like to raise that are vail and have a peep at the two eyes that sparkle beneath it ; and tarnation ! I would n't mind havin ' a smack or two at them cherry lips , that hide such pretty teeth , through which sometimes comes such musical sounds . It 's jest like a man going to Paradise , and hearing the fiddlin ' and dancin ' inside : he wants to get in and ca n't ; they wo n't let him go inside of the walls nor have a peep over . Em . Emma You must purchase the fruit before you taste it . Ebe . Ebenezer Heavenly temptation ! Exeunt , L. H. SCENE VII .  --  Mr. Dibble 's Parlor . Enter Mr. and Mrs. Dibble , R. H. Dib . Dibble Hark ! some one is coming up stairs . Enter Ebenezer and Emma , L. H. Ebe . Ebenezer Well , uncle , I 've come to say farewell to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't got no objections ? Dib . Dibble I have objections , sir . I told you , plainly enough to be understood , that I wished to see nothing more of you . Why are you here now , and who is your companion ? Ebe . Ebenezer This'ere critter ? Scrupulosity ! but perhaps you ai n't never seen her afore . But do n't you profane her with your hard names , or may be , I calculate  --  Dib . Dibble What language is that to me , sir ? Leave the house , and take that baggage with you . Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Do n't get into such a passion , my dear . Dib . Dibble Will you leave this house , sir ? Ebe . Ebenezer Well , may be I will , when I once make up my mind ; but I 'd like to argee . Dib . Dibble I want none of your argument , sir . Ebe . Ebenezer That 's jest what I come for . ' Tai n't quite all , neither . You gin me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would n't marry Em . Now I had nothin ' particular against Em , only it war n't to be , that 's all , and what ai n't to be wo n't be , so the minister says . I got a gal by advertisin ' , and here she is , by golly . Dib . Dibble Well , sir , take her away  --  away with the hussy ! Ebe . Ebenezer Come now , do n't bust your b'iler  --  ' tai n't no use ; I sha n't get out as soon as you expect . Dib . Dibble But what are you here for ? Why the devil do n't you explain ? Ebe . Ebenezer That 's jest what I 'm goin ' to do , if you 'll give me time . This ' ere gal seed my advertisement , and she liked the looks o n't , so she answered it ; we met , hitched horses , and come here to show ourselves . I want to see the whole on you , Em and all , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show you that I know enough to get a wife , without other folks havin ' a finger in the pie . Why do n't you sing out for Em ? I sha n't budge an inch till I see her . Dib . Dibble Call Emma , my dear ; I believe it is the only way to get rid of him . Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Emma ! Emma ! Ebe . Ebenezer To Emma . Wait till the critter comes , and then you can show yourself , she 's proper anxious to see you , and I 'm almost ready to jump out of my skin , to have a peep under that are pesky vail . Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Why does'nt the girl come ? Dib . Dibble Call her again . Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble Emma ! Emma ! where are you ? Em . Emma Throwing off her vail . Here I am , dear mother , do you want me ? Ebe . Ebenezer Amazin ' constarnation ! Mr. and Mrs. D. Mr. and Mrs. Dibble Emma ! Ebe . Ebenezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know , is that you ? Dib . Dibble So , this has been a mask to deceive us ? Em . Emma On my part , all a mask ! Dib . Dibble What ! and is Ebenezer , then , a dupe too ? Capital ! capital ! Ebe . Ebenezer Well , I 've heern uncle Zeb say it took a woman , but I never believed it , till now ! Mrs. D. Mrs. Dibble But , why have you carried on this masquerade ? Em . Emma Anon , I will explain all  --  father , will you forgive this deception ? Dib . Dibble Aye , that I will , my girl , and Ebenezer must forgive me too ! Ebe . Ebenezer Well , seein ' as how I must , I ' spose I will ! Em . Emma And will my cousin forgive me , and as a token of his forgiveness , accept my hand ? Ebe . Ebenezer Well , considerin ' all things , I ' spose it 's most likely I shall , but before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends here before us , if they want to procure the women of their suit , to announce it in the newspapers  --  the price of each advertisement , is , one insertion , one dollar  --  that 's what the printer charged , and I snow it 's cheap . Gals and fellers , if any of you are ready to cunnuberalize , and ai n't got no partner , jest write out a notice . Them cute critturs , the printers will tell you , that advertisin ' for eenmost anything , from a shoe-peg to a wife , is all the go , and settin ' up late at nights a-courtin ' , is now out of fashion . If it ai n't so , inquire at the Ledger Office . THE END .
