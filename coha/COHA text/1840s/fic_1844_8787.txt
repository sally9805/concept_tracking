INTRODUCTION . The following Tragedy was commenced in 1842 , during the time of the Rhode Island controversy , for the purpose of showing the identity of the doctrines of the Dorr party of that State , with those of the Jacobins of the French Revolution ; but so slow was the progress of the author , that before he could complete the first act , the miniature Robespierre , of Providence , was a fugitive from justice in a neighboring state , and before the first copy of the play was finished , a second war was ended , and the redoubtable Governor , a second time an exile from his dominions . Finding that he could not be in time to aid the cause of law and order , with his pen , the author was in less haste to bring the work before the public , and perhaps might have abandoned it altogether , had it not been for the fact that many prominent members , ( perhaps we might say leaders , ) of the Democratic party , the party to which the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of the Rhode Island disorganizers , and thus shown to what a lamentable extent Jacobinism had pervaded the party .  --  This fact showed him the necessity of drawing the line of distinction between the democrats who derive the power of the majority from constittutions established in accordance with natural rights of all , and those who derive constitutions , from the inherent power of the majority ; between those who would limit and define that power and those who would make it omnipotent over the lives , liberty , property and opinions of the minority . To show how far this distinction was involved in the controversy of which I have spoken , we will take a brief view of the history of the republic of Rhode Island , and of its position at the time of that controversy . We find then that two centuries past , a band of men , anxious to enjoy more freedom , religious and civil , than could be enjoyed under any established government of the world , by a mutual and free arrangement among themselves , imigrated to Rhode Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This government was then established by the contract and consent of every individual of mature age interested in it at the time it was formed ; and every individual who afterwards became a resident of the province must be supposed to have given it his consent likewise , for surely those who disapproved that government could have found space enough in the world without encroaching on the microscopic and then unimproved territories of Providence plantations . We thus find it a government established by the compact and consent of all its citizens . It was understood by each of these contracting parties that the government they formed then by their contract might subsequently be modified by the joint act or consent of the government of the colony , the majority of the people and the government of England . After being several times thus modified it settled down in a form that subjected it to little more than a nominal allegiance to England , while the government of the colony was , perhaps , more Republican in its character than any that had previously existed ; such a thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . We may then safely decide that Rhode Island was a Republic before the American Revolution . Under her liberal institutions , which first proclaimed to the world the great principles of religious freedom  --  principles which have disarmed superstition and robbed bigotry of its sting . Rhode Island flourished to such an extent that Newport was the rival of Boston and New York , until the Revolution had given to her sister colonies institutions equally liberal with her own , and enabled these cities to attain the superiority which their position ensured them , when other circumstances were equally favorable to their growth . Strong in its freedom , this little colony was , at the revolution the first that dared to set the power of England at defiance . On the 26th April , 1776 , the Legislature of Rhode Island , declared , by resolution , that the King of England had forfeited his claim to their allegiance , by assuming powers not yielded to him by their existing constitution ; and on the 4th of July of the same year , the delegates of Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies in declaring the whole independent of England . In these transactions , there was no civil war in Rhode Island , there was no overthrow of an old government and establishment of a new , but war was carried on between Rhode Island and England , each acting under its previously established government , until in 1783 , the latter surrendered its claim to the allegiance of the former , and gave up to the government of the Colony all the power which she , England , had before claimed over it . The effect of this surrender was then clearly such that whatever the government of England , the government and majority of the people of Rhode Island , might rightfully perform before , the government and majority of the people of Rhode Island might thence forward themselves perform ; in other words the government and majority of the people of Rhode Island might thenceforward modify that government , because they had power to do this jointly with the government of England before , and all the powers of England had been surrendered to them . In 1787 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Government . That government was formed by the mutual compact of the thirteen old states , each consenting to the constitution ; and it was stipulated in that compact that every one of the thirteen states that would , should be admitted into the Union , and had any one been refused it would have been such a violation of the constitution as would have released all the others from its obligation . Over the admission of the new states Congress had power , but the old states were admitted into the Union by the constitution itself . The constitution also provides that Congress shall guarantee to each state a Republican form of government ; but as the old states were admitted by the constitution , their republicanism was clearly acknowledged by that instrument . Congress can never , then , call their Republicanism in question , as long as they retain the form of government with which they entered the Union , because that matter has been settled , by an authority paramount to that of Congress . It was in the face of these facts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government organized in Rhode Island . Ridiculous as this conclusion was , it was less absurd than the measures adopted to form a new government . If Rhode Island was at that time neither a state of the Union nor an independent Republic  --  if it was merely a territory in the state of nature , there was no bond of union between the inhabitants , and the majority could organize no government that could have rightful power over the minority . Neither God nor nature has any where ordained that Block Island , the Islands of the Naraganset , Bristol Peninsula , the town of Tiverton and the western shore of the Naraganset shall form one republic . It is not to be determined by reasoning a priori ; that the Paweatuck river must bound this republic on the south west and the Pawtucket on the north east . How then , can a constitution formed by a majority of the inhabitants of the whole territory , be binding on those sections where a majority has not assented ? What shall prevent the inhabitants of Block Island , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " we will form an independent republic , we owe no submission to the majorities of other sections , and we yield nothing to them . " But if the majority of the whole can not rightfully force a constitution on a recussant section , it can not on an individual , for sections may be subdivided till they contain but a single inhabitant . Yet it was by the consent of the majority simply , that the self-styled People 's constitution was pretended to have been established , a consent not obtained by regularly organized elections , but given in taverns and cornfields , in many instances without any knowledge of the instrument to which assent was expressed . Now this idea , that the majority of any nation can form a constitution binding on the minority , was the great error of the Jacobins of France . If a majority can , in the beginning , establish a constitution , they can at any time abolish or amend that constitution , ( for the power that creates can abolish or amend , ) and if the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unlimited power over the minority , for what is there to restrict their power but the constitution . Whenever , then , a party holding this doctrine , finds itself in the majority , it believes itself omnipotent of right and places its will above the laws , because it believes that all laws emanate from its will . We have no reason to be surprised , then , if it deal harshly with its opponents , when its theoretic opinion is that it rightfully possesses full power over their property , their liberty and their lives . Much less can we wonder , if it alters and abolished constitutions , with a fickleness that renders all government unstable , when its doctrine is , that constitutions are mere declarations of its pleasure , intended to guide and restrain its delegates and servants , but not in the least to restrict its own power . If such a party long predominates in a republic , it usually ends , after a multitude of changes , by placing absolute power in the hands of some favorite , with the sole proviso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority , of course , reserve the right to withdraw this power , when it pleases , but it is often rather too diffident to take measures for such a withdrawal . The history of this party in France , in short , is its history in every nation where it obtains power . But to return to Rhode Island , in the conduct of the Dorr party , there was shown a recklessness of consequences , a disregard of human life , not exceeded in the French Revolution . It is true that not much blood was shed , because the agitators were soon persuaded that death would seize upon the wrong men , yet they proved that they were willing to involve the state in civil war , when it was clear that the matter in controversy , must in the end be settled by law , and not by arms , and that a victory in the field could not aid them in the least . How came it then , that in a republic , long enjoying peace and freedom , there was found a faction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in blood , upon so slight a cause , or as it might better be said , without any cause , except the influence of personal ambition ? The only answer that can be given to this question , must be drawn from what I have said above , that a party believing itself omnipotent of right , is shocked at the commission of no excesses , because it believes its acts are right , each and all of them , because they are its acts , and consequently that it can do no wrong . This was the case with the party that supported Mr. Dorr . His friends reasoned thus : " We , " thought they , " are the majority , we have for that reason a right to unlimited power , for the majority must rule the minority . " " Sovereignty , " say they , " belongs to the majority , and our party being the majority , is of right sovereign , and if any one opposes its sovereignty , he must endure the consequences , and has no right to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom is right whatever it may be , because the power is sovereign that orders it . " It is by reasoning like this , that men of these principles are reconciled to crime and blood . If they would reflect that this word sovereign is meaningless in America , if they would banish it from their vocabulary , and remember also , that the minority have rights , over which the majority can have no power , if they would ask whence the majority derives its power , if not from the whole people , they might be led to different conclusions , and might , perhaps , think it more in accordance with virtue to change constitutions by legal means than to overthrow them by the force of arms  --  arms stained with fraternal blood . It is with reluctance that the author speaks on this subject , when the conduct of the accused is about to undergo a legal investigation , but when attempts are making in the Congress of the Union to agitate this question anew , it is the duty of every friend of good order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see to it , that he does not unintentionally give his vote to the promoters of confusion . The author has said that he belongs to the democratic party , he has voted with that party for some years , and intends to vote with it still , if it can steer clear of obnoxious doctrines , but he would deem himself unworthy the privilege of the elective franchise , should be deposite a vote in support of the doctrines of disorganization . He is opposed , as much as any man , to a property qualification , a qualification that would exclude him , at present , from the list of electors ; but he had rather be disfranchised forever and deprived of all voice in the selection of those who are to guide the state , than be subjected to the sway of a majority , believing itself sovereign and omnipotent of right , without any check on its power , derived from a constitution , placed beyond its own control . It may be added to what has been said , that most of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if we except the leaders of the agitation , ) were foreigners , who , if they had resided in that state at all , were the temporary employees of its permanent inhabitants . Such men neither did or could understand American republicanism , and were of course apt instruments for the factions office seekers who guided their movements . And what was the object of these office seekers ? An agitation which should enable them to ride into power and notoriety ; for this they were willing to risk the stability of our free institutions , and to give the supporters of hereditary power an occasion to shout through all Europe a new proof  --  a new proof that man is incapable of self-government .

To act in their behalf ; and for a time Thou seemed inclined to hear me , when , alas !

We know that the departments , Ere now , had rescued France , had they not feared To weaken by division our defence Against the common foe  --  the monarchs leagued To prostrate us , and crush the hopes of freedom . And even now , those who have flown to arms , In virtue 's cause , are unsubdued and strong . Wimpfen , though beat at Pacy , still has force That may appal the foe ; the Marsellais , Though driven from Avignon , still resist ; Lyons defies the power of the Convention ; Bordeaux still baffles Tallien , while behind him , Through all Gironde , burns the pure love of freedom , Warming the hearts of its inhabitants .

Dupre . Dupre My friend , there 's danger In thinking thoughts like these , here in the streets ; But let us now proceed to the Convention And hear the charge against the Girondins , If they are condemned to death , or what is now A sentence tantamount to that , delivered To the tribunal of the Revolution , Headed by Fouquier Tinville , for their trial , I will proceed to Bordeaux with the news , And witness the effect in the Gironde .

Curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Enter Charlotte Corday and Le Fevre . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Happy am I , my Charlotte , once again To fly to thy embrace . The sick'ning thought Of France oppressed , and groaning in the chains Forged by herself , forsakes me only here . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Why , France is free . Do not her public prints , Her patriot speeches and the rabble 's shout Proclaim her so ? ' T is true , her citizens Sometimes ascend the guillotine ; but that 's Because we have liberty to take their heads . Did not the philosophic King of England Proclaim that country free , whose crowned head Might order what it pleased , and be obeyed ? Who , then , can say our people are not free ? When what they will is law ; when Kings , Princes , Perish at their command ; when haughty nobles And reverend prelates fall at their behest . Can it be said , they feel oppression 's yoke , Whose wildest wish , although it be to take The heads of virtuous men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution ? How sayest thou , then , the people are in chains ? Le Fevre . Le Fevre Thou shouldst not ridicule our State 's misfortune . The people have the power political In their own hands , as every where they have , ( For what is power that is not of the people ? ) Yet they are governed by the demagogues Whom they have raised to such a height of power That none now dare oppose its bloody course . So we are slaves to Robespierre and Danton , As much as are the mutes of the Seraglio To Turkey 's Sultan . Liberty and life Are in their hands , and where their hatred falls , Death follows in its train . Their victim 's trial Is but a mockery of legal forms In their worst shape . What can be worse oppression Than that which takes our lives for cause unknown , Or deeds , not crimes by law , until committed ? Or which , from mere suspicion , pents up thousands In dungeons close and crowded ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And are we not , then , free ? Have we no freedom , Who shout its blessings to a world in arms , And even force them on the slaves who hate it . Surely my dear we have liberty to spare , And those who die are only put to death Because they will not take the surplus from us . Why speakest thou then , of tyrants and oppression , When we should waste our hours in talk of love ? Le Fevre . Le Fevre Many who spent their hours in talk of love , Many who thought to keep aloof the storm By steering free from strife political , Have waked to find their names already written Upon the list proscribed . So it may be With me , though humble and but little known . Yet I 'll forget all danger while with thee , Forget my country 's wrongs , her patriots ' doom , Forget our slavery , dream that we are free , And rest , absorbed in love , though all around The friends of freedom fall . Charlotte . Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers that beset us , Though I have met thy melancholy brow With mirth and levity . Oft in my dreams I have seen thy headless corse , flung from the scaflold , Or heard thee plunged beneath the midnight wave , The dread baptism our republic gives But what can woman do to avert these horrors ? Unless it be to woo the man she loves From all participation in the strife . She illy plays the orator or soldier  --  Although , before I last returned from Caen , I had half a mind to buckle on my armor And be a Joan , in the cause of freedom . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Then why not suffer me to fly to arms , And join defeated Wimpfen in the west , Or threatened Bordeaux , or the Marsellais . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Thou couldst do little , being but a man . But I , a female , should have roused the French , As did the maid of Orleans , to the rescue . Had Barbaroux or Petion urged me much , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it wrong that France should strike Against herself , while foreign foes demand Her utmost power to drive them from her soil Le Fevre . Le Fevre But hadst thou not so soon returned to Paris , Thou might'st have seen me , in my arms , at Caen . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday ' T was that I feared , for since I found the French Would not be roused to quell intestine broils , ' Till foreign arms were driven from their borders , My care has been to screen thee from all acts That might expose thee to the faction 's vengeance . Thou knowest my life is linked and twined with thine , Past separation ; for since first I came , A pilgrim from the modest schools of Caen , To worship science in her temple here , I have owned my love to thee . How could I then , Rest far from thee , knowing thy zeal would lead thee To daring deeds , and speedily to death . Le Fevre . Le Fevre And so thou cam'st to force me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , to bid thee bide the time , When action might prevail . When France is freed From foreign arms she will establish order ; Then will the virtuous rise , then may we act , With sure success . But in the interim Let it be mine to make Le Fevre happy , To chase despondence from his troubled heart . Le Fevre . Le Fevre A task that must be difficult indeed , When all around him spreads this desolation ; Blotting his friends ' names from the book of life , And warning him that no man knows the hour He may be doomed for crimes be recked not of . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Still hear the song I have composed for thee , Hoping to chase the cloud from thy fair brow And drive stern melancholy from thy breast . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Well let thy harp make me awhile forget The sea of crime that dashes fierce around us Its raging waves . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I will not promise thee Forgetfulness of this dark troubled sea , But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the harp . Though desolation round us reign , I yield my heart to love and thee ; And now , whatever fate ordain , We 'll spend our hours in mirth and glee . To-morrow it may be our doom To mount the bloody guillotine , To famish in the dungeon 's gloom , Or sleep beneath thy waters , Seine . But why anticipate the hour ? Say , why to meet its coming haste , And call imagination 's power To fancy ills we need not taste . Oft among precipices dark , The fearless sleeper walks unharmed , While those that wake , and dangers mark , Are lost , by peril 's glare alarmed . Oft when the storm is raging wild , The careless ship the tempest braves ; While those that seek for havens mild Are sunk beneath the yawning waves . The air-borne car may safely glide O'er mountains high , o'er oceans vast , If unchecked winds its wanderings guide , Though forests fall before the blast . Then why should we , by fear or care , Increase the gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're doomed to share , With borrowed stings , and terror 's pains ? Or why provoke our jealous foes By looks and fears that banish mirth ? While such their dread of human woes , They strike the gloomy head from earth . No ! be it ours to live in love While life may last , whate'er our fate ; And by our days of gladness prove That love is blest in every state . Le Fevre . Le Fevre That song , my love , will never chase the cloud From thy Le Fevre 's brow . It speaks too much Of the dark gloom that overspreads us all , And shows its sorrow through attempts at mirth . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Is , then , my labor lost ? or , worse than that , Have I increased the gloom I would dispel ? Why , then , I may as well be sad myself , Wear on my brow a sympathetic cloud , And mourn with thee the terror of the times , Enough , indeed , to make the merriest mourn . Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul than mirth , Which only mocks the grief it would assuage . But I have news , my love ,  --  sad news , of course : This eve , the case of Brissot , Vergniaud , And their colleagues , pent in the Luxembourg , With that of Madame Roland , thy great friend , Is heard , as it is said , by the Convention . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday To hear , is to condemn  --  and execute . I had long hoped the fear of the Departments Might stay their trial till the times improved . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Even yet there is some hope they may be saved . I doubt if the Convention will decree Their trial yet , knowing how popular They are in the Gironde , and all the South ; But if they do , I trust that they may find There is some virtue left yet in the people ; Aye , that the South will all take arms , and march Direct on Paris .

And could their lives be spared , indeed ' t were better To overlook excesses , than involve The land in civil war , or to divide The power of France , now battling for her rights Against all Europe leagued . Le Fevre . Le Fevre But if the faction That now disgraces freedom , was destroyed , The invading powers were half annihilated , Even by that act . Let our excesses cease , And soon the charm of Freedom will o'erspread The States arrayed against us , and their ranks Be by the name of Liberty dispelled , As are the morning mists before the sun ; While France , united , might at once arise Omnipotent against the faltering foe . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Thy words , indeed , are true . Our mad opponents May boast the energy of their defence , But they create the crisis which they meet . Had their means been less base , we had not needed Their vaunted energy , to quell the foe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Fevre That is true ; But I forget , I have engaged to meet Some friends at the Convention . Will you go  --  Charlotte . Charlotte Corday And hear the eloquence of virtuous Marat , Whose form shows equal beauty with his mind ? Well , I will go ; for I would gladly hear What can be said against that trait'ress Roland . Le Fevre . Le Fevre It is high time , then , for us to be gone , Or we may lose some morceau from his lips . Or those of the sage Robespierre , whose course Has ever been to block the wheels of crime Against all retrogression from excess . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I will be with thee in an instant 's time . Le Fevre . Le Fevre But hast thou ever heard the virtuous Marat ? As thou so justly stylest him . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday ( Preparing . ) Never yet , In the Convention ; but some two years since , I heard him harangue , in the streets , a rabble Who hung upon his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garb , from which I judged His soul had soiled his linen . Little then I thought , while he urged on the mob to crime As the best road to freedom , that so soon He would be hailed the Saviour and Dictator Of France enfranchised . But I now am ready . Undoubtedly his dress is much improved With his increase of power . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Yes ; but he still Is negligent of dress , knowing his power Rests on the apparent sacrifice of all things , And strict devotion of each instant 's time To care and study for the people 's welfare .

What say you then , shall one month 's work of death Drive us from our high purpose ? shall we yield The revolution , how so far progressed , Forsake the cause of freedom and of man , In fear , effeminate , to shed the blood That holy cause requires ? What if your armies , Now battling for your rights , against the foes , Traitors have brought upon you , should desert Their post of honor , fly before the foe , Give up the cause of freedom and their country , Rather than lose four men in every thousand They muster for the combat ?

Shall we then , We who have torn the tyrant from his throne , And prostrate laid the palaces of kings , We who have battled in the cause of freedom , ' Gainst Europe leagued in arms , shall we now falter ? Fainting like a sick girl at letting blood . Three hundred thousand lives  --  why what are they ? Will the earth be unpeopled when they are lost ?

Millions now kept from earth by tyranny , Losing their all of happiness and life ? Republicans of France , you all revere The great example of America , You all admire her sages and her heroes . But did not her thrice honored citizen , The virtuous Adams , Footnote : 1Kb to the world proclaim That he would brave contest , though of all Who trod her broad domains , from the proud lakes Where loud Niagara thunders , to the gulf That laves her shores beneath the tropic 's sun , But one in every hundred should be saved .

Ask you what are their crimes , or wherein treason Hath in their bearing shown its hideous form ? Our answer is that some have raised the flag Of civil war , and even threatened Pairs With desolation , ' till its name be blotted From out the list of cities , and its site Known to the curious traveller alone .

Scene IV  --  Prison  --  Cell of Madame Roland . Madame Roland and Charlotte Corday . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Illustrious friend , my highest thanks are due To Danton , though he is the pest of France , That I enjoy the privilege to see thee , And gather wisdom from thy counsel . Roland . Roland Mine , No less than thine , my dear young friend , are due To Danton , if it is to him we owe The privilege by which thou tread'st these halls . I thank him not for what he gives , but what He leaves me yet of pleasure , since to him I owe my long abode in these dull cells For which I am not grateful , since without him I should be free to breathe the air of heaven And seek society in scenes more lovely Than these eternal walls . But as our fate Dooms us to suffer wrong , we must be thankful , Even for the mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks That thou canst walk these floors , though many have More of that privilege than they highly prize . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But I 've the privilege to leave them too , And that , I think , many now here would prize . Roland . Roland That is a favor great and rare indeed , And valuable , though of uncertain tenure . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday True , I am almost old enough to be A victim of the champions of freedom , But heaven allots me such a feeble share Of wisdom and of virtue , that my life May for a time be spared . Roland . Roland Oh do not lay " That flattering unction to thy soul , " my friend , That thou art free of virtue or of knowledge . Long have I marked thy talents in the schools . And know them such as fits thee for the scaffold ; And for thy virtue , canst thou boast a vice , To screen thee from that fate . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But my dear friend , Tell me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whence it happens That now the vicious reign , the people 's choice ; While virtue wastes in dungeons ? Why the best And wisest friends of freedom are immured Within these walls , while Robespierre and Danton And the distorted Marat rule the land ? Roland . Roland These are distracting questions ; troubled thoughts Rise in my mind , for freedom and for France , Contemplating the fate of virtue here . When Petion yields to Marat , Brissot to The canting Robespierre , and Vergniaud To boisterous Danton and demure St. Just , T is time to view our theories of freedom , With some distrust . But though the glorious cause Seems wrecked in blood , and every thing but lost , We should not yet despair of its success . We from misfortume learn the errors that Have spread confusion over the republic  --  Rendered abortive , our great revolution , And blasted freedom 's name in other climes ; And having learned our errors , were we spared We might retreive them , but we dare not hope That such will be our fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now awake , seeing the lives Of her most honored citizens are threatened And that her favorite deputies are doomed To trial by a merciless tribunal , And call back the Girondins the seats From which they have been hurled by insurrection Of the vile mob of Paris ? Roland . Roland That I doubt . I know we are upheld by the good will Of millions , more than they could rally , in A contest to decide their fate and ours . But then the terror of the foreign foe Will gather the republic , for the time , Around the men already placed in power . How'ere abhorent may have been the means By which that power was won . The Jacobins , Now lords of the Convention , use its name To govern France , and as that body hath No limit to its power , no expiration Of its existence , ' till it shall proclaim Its work performed , and thus dissolve itself Of its own will , the time is distant far When those who sway it cause its dissolution , And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who ne'er gave it To them , but to the men they have deposed . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Their policy is plain , I see it now They have , by fraud , obtained ascendancy In the Convention , and they will prolong The existence of that body , since their power is based upon it . Roland . Roland And the people will not Rise in their majesty against a power Which seems to emanate from them , and bears A name which they revere , while foreign foes Are threatening us with chains , although in fact That power has been by insurrection changed From that which was ordained by them , more than Was Adam , by the serpents machinations , From that which God created him . And this Reminds me of the error which I mentioned Had been by us committed . It was clearly An error , first to give to this Convention The power legislative and fundamental . This was a step that France must rue for ages ; For evil must result whene'er a body Ordained to fabricate a constitution By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which both governors and people find Their power delineated and described , Has power to act on men , or to control The measures of the times , by vote direct . Factions which blaze too strong , even when kindled By one source of contention , are in power Redoubled when to contest about men And about measures we add equal contests And greater differences of thought about The fundamental forms of government . Besides , all power to administer the laws , And power of legislation , should be fixed And limited to a known period ; Which can not be the case with power to form A constitution for the state 's acceptance . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday For who knows when the work can be performed . Roland . Roland Or who can fix the period ' till that work Has been performed . But our second error Was the decree which made of the Convention A court to try offences ' gainst the state , This brought in it collision with the hatred Felt by contending parties ' gainst the men Esteemed by their opponents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to save the state from anarchy . These two mis-steps have given to the Convention A power over the state which men are slow To drop when once attained  --  a power which hath No period of surrender or return To those who gave it , as I said before . So the Committees which now sway that body Rule without limit , either of power or time , Over a nation thinking itself free . Charlottee . Charlottee Corday But will the people long endure that rule ? Roland . Roland Yes . While the cause I 've mentioned checks their action They will not rise against the power that governs , Though but the name of freedom shall be left , Though it consign to death their former friends The Girondins , and thy poor friend with them . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Can it be so ? And is there then no hope ? I can not speak of this , my faltering tongue Would fail to tell the anguish of my soul , At thought of such bereavement . How shall I Endure the awful dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roland Reflect that I have had my day of honor ; That I have lived , not all in vain , though early I am called from earth . ' T is not my fate To fall like some , leaving no name behind me , Or one that is abhorrent to mankind . Reflect , too , that I die a noble death , Falling with men who are their country 's glory , And ornaments of earth . I too have been The wife of one whose pure and ardent heart Burned with the long desire to rescue freedom From the excesses which have curst its cause And roused the world against it . One whose name Would save mine from oblivion , if I had No merit of my own ; a man so honored , ' T were epitaph enough upon my tomb To say here sleeps the dust of Roland 's wife . Why should I then desire to change my fate With that of other mortal . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Yet France must not Permit that fate to end in death so soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still I trust my country may he spared The violation of that sacred awe That hallows lofty virtue . Kings may perish As criminals , and still men may pursue Their wonted avocations , recking not That life is less abundant . But when genius Clad in the awful majesty of virtue , And honored with the nation 's trust , is doomed To death for love of under , will not reason Wake in the soul of man and , tear the veil From faction 's hideous face , and save the great . Already the decree which gives your trial To that accursed tribunal of blood , And the proposed arrest of four score more Of France 's best sons , members of the Convention , Clothed with inviolability of right , Have agitated Paris , and sent off Some friends of order , to awake the people In the department ; and full soon , I trust , The men of the Gironde , led by Condorcet , And the Bretons headed by Barbaroux , And Petion and their friends now leagued at Cacn , May enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Well have the mountain faction marked the hour They may proceed against us . Their first step Thou knowest , was to confine in their own houses The Girondins who were most influential , Next they transferred them to the Luxembourg , For safer keeping . At each step the people Were much incensed , but yet not quite enough To rouse them to revolt , in strength sufficient To overwhelm their foes . Now , when the few Who ventured to resist are nearly crushed , They venture to decree we shall be tried By their tribunal revolutionary . This will , I fear , awaken fresh revolts Among our scattered friends , but not enough To meet with more success than did the efforts Of Bordeaux , Lyons , Marseilles and your Caen . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday And thus our friends will be destroyed by piecemeal ; Part rising at a time and the rest waiting For greater provocation , as you think , Until it is too late . Roland . Roland E'en so . And when These new revolts are quelled , as they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of weakening France , invaded from without And threatened too by royalists within , When those whose real for truth o'er comes these motives , And goads them to resistance , are destroyed , Our foes will think they safety may proceed Upon our trial and our death , which soon Will follow after sentence , lest the people Should rise again to save us . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Let me hope Still that you may be saved , still that the people Will disappoint the oppression which would rob them Of the exalted worth of the Girondias . But canst thou tell me , my illustrious friend , How men are found with character and skill To influence the people , in whose hearts Burns such insatiate love of blood and crime ? How chances it that an enfranchised people , Whose breast we should expect would swell with love And gratitude for their deliverance from Oppression 's yoke , can harbor such strange lust Of carnage indiscriminate , recking not Whether their vengeance falls on friend or foe ! Must we , in view of their excess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for from the mutual love Of millions linked in freedom ? Or can we Discover yet the cause of the illusion Which has misled the nation , and remove it ? Roland . Roland The only answer to this question , which Awakes our gloomiest thoughts , that I can give , Is that there are two factions which unite In giving power to the majority . Both are republican , both democratic , But in their theories they are opposite As king and people . They are antipodes In premises , but drawing like conclusions And wishing like results , as I 've explained In former conversations . While the one Derives all power from the whole people , acting In individual right and by their compact , Mutual and free in each , establishing Their constitution and their government , And wisely vesting in the greater number A power political , in its extent Defined and limited : the other takes For granted that all power belongs , of right , To the majority ; that constitutions Are made to limit but official power , To restrain rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's who can make or unmake Kings , constitutions , emperors and senates , Acting the while by the majority . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday And this last faction think the power they find In the majority omnipotent , Reaching to life and death , freedom and slavery . Roland . Roland Precisely so . And hence you see their aptness To doom their foes to slaughter : they assume The people have a right to inflict death On such as they deem worthy . They persuade Themselves that traitors ought to suffer death , And that all men are traitors who subscribe not To their own creed ; and from these premises They justify all murders by the mob . To them the power supreme , and that which gives Power to all tribunals subordinate . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday And when the prisoners of September died , ' T was but the people dooming punishment , For gross offences , not of act but thought . And by this faction 's creed the people had A right to make a magistrate of Maillard , And try by night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too crowded In prison then , waiting too long for judgment From the slow laws . Roland . Roland Most true , and if we add To theories like these , a soul like Marat 's , Which feels no sympathy with man ; but when Murder is crushing hearts , dissolving ties That make existence sweet , destroying all The confidence that man should feel in man , And rendering virtue less secure than guilt ; Sees all the evil in statistic tables Of our diminished numbers , need we wonder That terror triumphs over liberty , Crushing our souls  --  Enter Jailor . Jailor . Jailor Madam , it is the order Of the committee of the public welfare That all the prisoners , late decreed to trial By the Convention , be removed at once To the Conciergerie . Roland . Roland That looks something like Dispatch in business . But sir , canst thou tell me If yet our day of trial has been fixed ? Jailor . Jailor Not yet . I think that the Committee wait For news from the department , ere that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Well my dear friend , farewell ; I fear thy visits Will be forbidden , at my new abode , And that on earth we shall not meet again . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Drive me not to despair , still let me hope This is not our last parting , that thy life Will yet be spared . Roland . Roland ' T is crime to hope so here . Jailor . Jailor Lady , let me advise thee to withdraw . Thy longer tarrying here may move suspicion That thou art an accomplice of the prisoner . Roland . Roland Do so , before you unawares commit The sin unpardonable . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday No , my honored friend , I will not leave thee ' till the hatest moment . Jailor . Jailor And that is now . The prisoner must depart Immediately for the Concergerie . Thou canst not longer be with her , depart . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Why then farewell my friend , but still I breathe A prayer for thy deliverance , and a hope . ACT II . Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charlotte . Le Fevre . Le Fevre How fans my love this morn ? which would be fair Were not its beauty marred by human crime . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday As well as one may fare who sees around her A land all smeared with blood of those she honored . Oh my Le Fevre ! I have been to wild , Have talked too lightly of these horrid scenes . But Ronald doomed to trial , which ensures Her speedy death , has shown my heart its error , And made it serious . Le Fevre . Le Fevre These are serious times , And women should be serious ; but for men , ' T is time that they should rouse themselves to action , And strike this despotism from the land . ' T is time for deeds heroic , and I trust That such will be  --  that France will rouse herself , And show she is for order and for freedom . Dupre and Rioufle have gone forth to seek Condorcel , mongst our friends in the Gironde , Where it is hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte . Charlotte Corday May the powers Of heaven aid them in their enterprize . Le Fevre . Le Fevre I say amen to that , and mean to give Them something more than prayers to aid their cause . I had set forward with my friends for Bordeaux , Had not thy love and beauty bound me here Until our hands are joined ; but then I 'll seek The tented field and see what my right arm Can do for France . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday And yet my dearest love , Be careful of that life on which mine hangs . I will not bid thee still restrain thy hand , Burning to strike for France , as I have done ; For , I admit , there is less of safety now In peace inactive , than in battle fields Our hope , henceforth , must be in victory ; If female virtue can not now escape A bloody death , there 's little hope for those Who seek their safety in obscurity And dull inaction . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Then my dearest love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oft have I urged the dangers of inaction , Still did'st thou counsel it as safest course . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Perhaps till now there was no time for action ; But now it has come ; this day we 'll join our hands , So that in life or death we may be one ; To-night I 'll seek with thee my native Caen ; For there I learn our friends have made a stand , And mean to strike for liberty and law , Although discouraged late by Wimpfen 's loss . Le Fevre . Le Fevre My friends expect my presence in Gironde ; But do not think to share with me the dangers Attendant on an enterprize like this , Whether I battle in Gironde or Caen . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I should be safer in the battle field Than here in Paris , were our union known And thou away on such an expedition ; But at my home in Caen I shall be Safer than elsewhere in the realm of France . I can abide there safely ' till the fortune Of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink from dangers which thou sharest . Le Fevre . Le Fevre But how shall we find passage hence to Caen . Our foes encompass it and will arrest us . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But we may pass perhaps , as bride and lover ; Our best of all pretensions will be truth . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Well thou shalt fly with me . We will to Caen , Where thou wilt be more safe , I am convinced , Than in this city .  --  But whom have we here . Enter Officer and Guards . Officer . Officer Le Fevre I arrest thee of high treason ; By Marat 's order thou art prisoner . Le Fevre . Le Fevre By Marat 's order ! then my schemes are up , My days are near their close ! But , citizen , What have I done to merit this arrest . Officer . Officer I know not that , I execute the orders The people give through those who represent them , And do not stop to ask for what they are given .

Do'st thou not think , citizen officer That Marat may be mov 'd to show him mercy If I plead humbly for his life , and prove That he has not been guilty of a crime ? Officer . Officer Why , there is little hope to save his life . Entreaties do not soften Marat 's heart . But thou , perhaps , may'st gain another lover , For he is very fond of pretty women . A Guard .

Seek thou for other happiness ; but still , When I am cold and mouldering in the earth , Remember thy Le Fevre lived and loved . Charlotte .

Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Alas ! I know the price he would demand To grant that favor ! That must never be ! I can not , and I dare not call on him . Eleanor . Eleanor I have a thought  --  but still there 's little hope . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Yet , let me know that thought , however desperate . I must omit no means to save his life ; The thought would be to me eternal torment , If I should do it . Tell me then thy plan . Eleanor . Eleanor A female 's prayer will some times melt a heart As cold and hard as rocks on Zembla 's shore . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But I have said I dare not call on Marat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He holds my honor dearer than his life ; And should I save him by suspicious means He would destroy the life Marat had spared , And I should make him his own murderer . Eleanor . Eleanor But possibly another might prevail , For every female the has power to plead . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Not one has power to move a Marat 's heart , Unless she 's beauty to excite his lust . Eleanor . Eleanor We must not too severely judge the tyrant , For even the worst have some redeeming points . We should not yield all hope yet from his virtue , But try our power to move him . If we fail It will not be too late then for despair . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But who will venture the experiment ? Who now in France will strive to save a life ? Eleanor . Eleanor My friend , my wish to save you from despair , To snatch your lover from impending fate , Prompts me to undertake this rash adventure , For rash it is , although I have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will be excited by it . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Oh ! wilt thou Undertake this for me ? Oh , take my thanks ! For though I entertain but little hope , We 'll nothing leave untried . But still thy task Will be most difficult . Thou must assume Some character , to justify thy pleading In his behalf , but what I can not say . Eleanor . Eleanor Perhaps ' t is best I feign myself his wife . And plead for mercy for a husband doomed , Tell him a tale of woe and beg his pity . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday My friend , a thousand thanks for thy suggestion . Thou art indeed a sister in affliction ; If thou succeed thou art my guardian angel , And I will yield my life to pay the debt Of gratitude that I shall owe to thee . Adopt thy plan , prostrate thyself before The tyrant 's feet and plead as never plead , ' Till now , the the tongue of woman . Eleanor . Eleanor Never fear But I will do my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the powers that nature Has given to our sex , and all the art That chance and study may have given me . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I know that thou art not defficient there , For I have heard thee plead and know thy power , I will not yield me wholly to despair Until thy effort fails ; but do thy best , Tell him that thou art ruined by the death Of him thou lovest and dependest upon ; Tell him too , that Le Fevre knows no crime Save that of wishing well to France and freedom . Eleanor . Eleanor Well I must hasten to perform my task , I must army me as befits his wife , O Marat may suspect me . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Tell my maids To bring the garments that have been prepared For our espousal , which I thought was nigh , Thou shalt array thee in a Lridal dress , And tell him that Le Fevre was espoused To thee within an hour ere his arrest . Eleanor . Eleanor My friend , I hasten to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be hope ? or do I now but dream ? I know Eleanor 's power to plead , but who Can move the stony heart of cruel Marat ; He is a wretch whose aliment is blood  --  The blood of freedom 's friends , although his plea Is all for freedom . What hypocrisy , What plain deceit will ever gull mankind ; The men who have enslaved the land are held As freedom 's champions , as the Gods to whom This nation must look up for liberty , And offer hecatombs of lives to buy That precious gift which they dispence in blood ; While those whose pure souls burned with ardent love Of freedom and her cause , have , by the hand Of a freed nation , met the felon 's doom . Oh ! must the people always be thus blinded ? Is it inherent in their nature , that They must be led astray ? Must nations always Bow down before some idol or some tyrant ? Will wisdom never govern men , that they May rule themselves  --  rule without tyranny ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never See that glad time when peace shall reign with freedom And when security shall bless our land . Security ! thou art the height of freedom , The boon for which mankind should ever toil . We well may die to win security For ages yet unborn ; but will France win it ? Will she attain that state when men who keep " The whiteness of their souls , " whose hands are pure From stain of guilt shall unmolested walk In their own paths of life , lords of themselves , Secure that they shall not be judged to death To serve the unknown pleasure of some faction , Some worthless demagogue or tyrant crowned . She will attain that state ; nations have won it , And one enjoys it now , and what has been , May be again , but who shall see that time ? Not I , nor he I love , for he is doomed And I am bound to him by such a tie That easier you might tear the moon from earth , And bid her chase some wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Eleanor . Eleanor . Eleanor My friend , I am prepared now for my task . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Alas ! I little thought those bridal scales Should deck another 's person ere my own : And that another 's tongue should style him husband , Ere I could claims of him the name of wife . But let that pure . If we can save his life What matters it , even if another 's arms Should clasp him ere my own , Haste to thy work , Plead as he were thy husband , loved by thee With love like mine , love not released by death , But love which stronger than the marriage bond , Cling to its object even beyond the grave . If thou succeed two lives are saved by thee , For like the widow on the Ganges shore , I follow him to death if that 's his fate . Eleanor . Eleanor Fear not that I will fail to do my best . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday She 's gone ; heaven speed her in her hopeless task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see already in the tiger 's grasp . Can her entreaties tame the savage beast , Or teach him mercy ?  --  but I 'll not despair . Scene IV .  --  Marat 's House . Marat and Hebert . Marat . Marat Has young Le Fever been arrested as I gave command ? Hebert . Hebert Illustrious citizen ! He is in prison , waiting there the hour You may name for his dismissal from the earth . Marat . Marat At the Conceirgerie , or Luxembourgh ? Hebert . Hebert He is confined now at the Luxembourgh . Marat . Marat He must be taken , then , to the Conceirgerie , For his confinement is to be but short , Although he must have patience yet a day , ' Till he can tell us something of his friends Now fled to seek Condorcet in Gironde . Hast thou heard aught of them , young citizen ? Hebert . Hebert They have left Paris  --  little else is known . Marat . Marat They have fled southward . Thus much I have learned From spies who traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join revolted Bordeaux . Or stir up the Girondin in our rear . They hope to find Condorcet these before them But ' t is not certain yet , he has escaped , Even from Paris . There are some who thank He is secreted yet within the city . Hebert . Hebert But hast thou any fears of their success Even were Condorcet now in the Gironde . Marat . Marat Gironde is strong against us , give them time To raise their standard on the rear of Tallien And they 'll give us more trouble than I like . But if the danger now can be arrested . We are safe forever more . No one will dare Henceforth to lift his hand against our power . Hebert . Hebert We do not know , illustrious citizen , What men may dare . Rienzi , when he thought His power the highest in the Roman state , Was crushed by sudden outbreak of the men He thought the prop of his authority . Marat . Marat ' Twill not be so with us , our cases differ ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whose daily bread was by injustice won : He sought to make the people free , yet left them In poverty , only to be sustained By wages paid from the contending nobles , For service criminal or military . The people had no land , no shops , no houses . No bread to eat , no soil whereon to raise it . How could they live but by the noble 's hire ? But nobles did not need them when the state Was freed from crime , and from intestine feuds ; Thus the poor plebian , though made free as air , And from all wrong protected , could not live . Because he could not eat the winds of heaven , And these were all that he could call his own . But we have shunned that error , we have made The people free , but there we have not stoped , We confiscate the wealth of the condemned And overthrown aristocrats , with which We hire for the state 's cause , those needy men Whose occupation with our kings and nobles Have passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who think these confiscation most unjust . Marat . Marat What would they have us do ? these virtuous men Who shrink from this injustice as a demon . Sent forth to steep this land in crime and blood , They go for freedom , yea , for the republic ; They would prostrate the aristocracy And rob the nobles of all privileges But that of wealth . But when they have done this What have we gained ? Why we may choose our rulers , May vote this man to office and that out , But can we dine on votes , or stay our hunger By changing lords who bar us from the land That God has given to man for his subsistence ? We chafe the nobles , we offend their pride . Take from them privileges they claim as rights , And what 's the consequence ? Enraged at this , They give us no employment , and we have not Houses to shelter us or lands whereon To raise our needful food . How shall we live If unemployed by them ? We can but starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so we were selfexiled from our country , Our liberty were but our banishment , Were we the fools to leave these haughty lords Their ill got wealth when their good will is lost . Hebert . Hebert I see the wisdom of your policy , You extirpate your foes , you seize their wealth , And with it rule the state . Marat . Marat And those who seek To save the traitors we condemn to bleed , But throw themselves before our chariot wheels , And die the death they merit by their rashness . Our course can not be stayed to save their lives . Hebert . Hebert Your plan is wise , for gold can buy the people , The lands of the condemned supply the gold . Your power is firm , based on the double rock Of wealth and freedom . You have nought to fear . Marat . Marat When these revolts are quelled , when I have seen Condorcet and his friends beneath the axe I shall fear nothing . Hebert . Hebert I have wondered much That thou hast shown more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lately so popular and still renowned . Marat . Marat Condorcet is the stablest of our foes Now left at liberty . Science profound , And hatred of our cause combined to make him More dangerous than the assembled traitors Who threaten us from Caen , though among them Are souls more prompt at fierce and daring deeds , Besides , I have an augury that bids me Fear none but him . Hebert . Hebert Does Marat then believe In idle auguries ? Does the citizen Who casting fear away , hath trampled on The heads of kings and sages , and made slaves Of haughty nobles , dread an omen 's meaning , And tremble at a fortune teller 's tale . Marat . Marat Heaven hath its revelations for the men Ordained to purpose high , such we may trust . These sometimes come by dreams , sometimes by words Of sooth sayers , or men of special gifts , Sometimes by signs and tokens in the sky . Sometimes by warnings given direct from God . Hebert . Hebert But what may be this augury. that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marat . Marat ' T was when Condorcet 's influence was the highest I had a dream  --  a strange and fearful dream : Methought I saw a comet in the sky . Wheeling its course in splendor toward the sun , Its tail hid half the stars , obscured the moon . And threw a light , bright as the lightning 's flash . Upon our world . But when it near approached The orb of Mercury , I saw before it That planet , placed directly in its course . They met , and each became a warrior armed , And drew his sword and fought for mastery . Long was the contest , fierce and hard their blows : I heard the din of swords , bright scintillations Like bursting meteors flashed across the sky , Paling the stars with their coruscant light ; But ere the battle ended I awoke , And could not learn to which the victory fell . I sought a man skilled in interpretations , And asked of him the meaning of my dream . " That comet , " said he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate and course in life : The planet is Condorcet , whose calm wisdom Shines like a planet , steadily and bright , But without blazing like thy firey course . The battle is between you , ye are foes , Made so by fate , which you can not avoid . Where falls the victory this dream does not show , But if thou master him thy course is clear , There is no other planet in thy path Unto that sun to which thou dost aspire . " This struck me as most probable , because Condorcet is my opposite in all things , The staunch supporter of the sciences Which it has been my glory to disprove . Hebert . Hebert Thy dream was strange , but still I hold it wisdom To disregard all dreams : give me but power And wealth on earth , and for a watch cry freedom , And little care I though the starry host Do battle in my dreams , and shake the heavens With clashing swords , or even with the roar Of loud artillery thundering in the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady craves Admittance to thy presence . Marat . Marat Who is she ? Officer . Officer I know not , but she comes to sue for mercy . For one condemned , or at the least imprisoned . Marat . Marat Well , as I am at leisure , I admit her . But ten to one she finds her errand fruitless . Exit Officer . We may perhaps gain information from her , If she gains nothing in return from me . Hebert . Hebert The course thou takest is politic and wise , ' Twill show thy justice and thy kind attention To all the people 's wants , to hear her prayer Although thou art resolved to grant it not . Marat . Marat Thy words are wise  --  but here the lady comes . Enter Eleanor . Eleanor . Eleanor Illustrious citizen , I kneel before thee To claim thy mercy for my hapless husband , Who hath incurred thy anger , as it seems . But two short hours I was his wedded wife , Ere he was dragged to prison from my arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imprisoned . Eleanor . Eleanor He must have been arrested on mistake , For he is a friend to freedom and to France , And can not be the foe of the just Marat , Who is the known protector of our freedom ; But whatsoe'er he may be show him mercy , For mercy is the noblest attribute Ascribed to Deity . Marat . Marat Though that is true , Lady , we have devoted none to death But those whose lives stern justice doth demand . If then , thy husband is condemned to death , ' T is justice asks his blood , can we refuse it ? Eleanor . Eleanor But mercy is most wisely joined to justice . Justice would strike with indiscriminate blow , The hardened and the thoughtless ; mercy shows Who may be spared from death for penitence . Justice is blind , and mercy is her guide , Justice sees no excuse , mercy shows them , ' T is mercy , therefore , bears the eyes of justice . Which show her when to strike and when to save . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice without mercy is a fault . Marat . Marat Well who is he for whom thou plead'st so long ? Tell me his name that I may judge his merit , And know if he be subject lit for mercy . Eleanor . Eleanor I beg of thee the life of Charles Le Fevre . This morn arrested , and by thy command . Marat . Marat Lady , it is an idle waste of words To ask his life from me . Hope not for him ; There 's not a prisoner pent within our dungeons I would not sooner spare than this Le Fevre . Eleanor . Eleanor What has he done to merit thy displeasure ? He is no traitor he hath joined no faction , For though he loves his country and her freedom , He keeps himself aloof from party strife His plottings have been all against my heart . How then should he offend the virtuous Marat ? That he is doomed to death , and past all mercy . Marat . Marat I know he hath consorted with the men , Friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head were severed from his trunk , But that I have some questions yet to ask him , Concerning secrets which should be disclosed , But might be kept too closely in the grave . Eleanor . Eleanor Great citizen ! I have been humbly bred , And do not know Condorcet ; he may be A man of guilt , for aught that I can tell , A traitor to his country , if thou wilt , But must his friends be doomed to death with him , And his friends ' friends ? Then should I also die For loving young Le Fevre , and my friends For loving me , and thus we all might perish . Oh , virtuous Marat ! shun this bloody course . I 've heard of mercy that would spare the guilty , But ne'er of justice that condemned their friends , And even then would not hear mercy plead . Marat . Marat But if their friends abet them in their guilt , Is it not just they suffer for that guilt ? Eleanor . Eleanor These many months has young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To guide the state to safety or to ruin , As it might chance , to plot in secret conclave The nation 's glory or their own advancement To power , built on a nation 's degradation , Or wealth drawn from its coffers . Leaving this To more aspiring minds , he gave himself To love and me , thinking that one so humble Might tread in peace the private walks of life , And draw down no suspicion on his head Of guilt political . He loved his country , Exulted in her glory and her freedom ; He honored those who by the people 's choice Were called to rule her ; and his own high merit Gave hope that he might win the people 's favor , And gain her highest honors . Still for him Sufficed my humble love , he was content To yield for me his natural aspirations For power and honor , and to leave to others The glory , cares and strife of public stations , So he might dwell with me in peace and safety . He then could be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Himself so far removed from public strife . Marat . Marat Madam , ' t is vain to plead ; I know the man  --  I 'd sooner spare the serpent in my path ! He is a rank Girondin , and my foe ; Dangerous to France , to freedom and to me . I say again his life must not be spared ! Eleanor . Eleanor How can his life be dangerous to his country Or to her freedom , when he loves his country , And sighs to see her free ? I have seen him weep O'er the dissentions of the friends of freedom ; Mourning that a pure cause should know contention , And that its banner should be stained with blood . He then is freedom 's friend , and those who seek His life , I fear , can never be her friends . Marat . Marat Lady , thou dost but waste thy time and mine  --  He dies to-morrow , and I will not spare him . Eleanor . Eleanor Bethink thee that the price of blood is blood ; None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will requite his fate upon thy head . Marat . Marat Madam , ' t is France condemns him ; I her servant Do but announce the doom which she awards . Eleanor . Eleanor For what does France condemn him ? what offence Doth she lay to his charge ? or by what office Dost thou announce the doom that she awards ? Marat . Marat The public voice makes me the nation 's organ ; The public voice that makes and unmakes office . It is the people 's will that I dispense Their justice for offences ' gainst the state . Eleanor . Eleanor So thou dispensest death without offence . Marat . Marat Have caution , or thy words may bring upon thee The people 's vengeance ; I too long have listened To thy petition , thou had'st best withdraw , For be assured all further suit is vain . Exit Eleanor . Scene V.  --  Charlotte Corday 's House . Charlotte , Charlotte Corday Solus . When will Eleanor come  --  oh this suspense , Based on faint hope , is less endurable Than dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something in our hearts that buoys us up To meet our fate with calmness and composure . I would I knew the worst . Fool that I am ; I 'm scarce contented to believe all lost , But I must know the certainty of ruin . The little hope I have now , makes me wretched , For I 've enough to banish resignation , But not enough to yield one moment 's peace . Yet if he dies , what then remains for me , Nothing but death . But how shall I die ? I would our blood might mingle in one stream , And sink in earth together . Yea , for this I 'd mount the bloody scaffold as a felon , And leave a felon 's name behind me here . But here comes Eleanor . Enter Eleanor . Oh my dear friend Tell me thy news , although they banish hope . Eleanor . Eleanor Le Fevre dies to-morrow ! Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Dies To-morrow ! Would nothing move the tyrant  --  art thou sure His doom is fixed beyond all hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , And I survive to see to-morrow 's close . Eleanor . Eleanor I plead for him , till seven times I was told I plead in vain , and warned I was in danger To suffer with him , if I longer plead The cause of one , whose name was so much hated . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Then farewell hope , farewell all peace on earth . There 's nothing left me but to choose my death , For who would live in such a dreary world ? Thou sayest thy life was threatened ; would that I Had been there in thy place ; I had provoked them To take my life with his ; so had I died Contented , mingling then our blood in death . Eleanor . Eleanor My friend , dismiss these thoughts . We must resign Ourselves to our friend 's loss . Heaven has ordained That all must die , and those who love must part . It is our duty then to yield to Heaven , And when the dreaded hour can not be shunned To part from friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to other love . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Oh , do not talk to me of other love  --  But rather show me how my life may end . What can life be , bereft of those we love , But a sad task , weary and comfortless , Upon the end of which we build our hopes , Knowing nor joy nor peace till it is done . Even as the exile , fated long to roam Within the frozen circle of the North  --  Counts the long years his feet are doomed to tread On hated soil , far from his father land , Postponing joy , until he sees again His long lost home , and walks his native plains ; So I , when young Le Fevre is no more , Shall think this world a place of banishment , And sigh to leave it , hoping here no peace . Eleanor . Eleanor My friend , the exile banished from his home  --  Finds flowers in other lands , even in the wilds Of cold Siberia , when the summer sun Shines dimly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath it beauties , though the sun Be banished from the heavens , and the winds Howl round his ice-bound mansion , threatning ruin ; He sees bright gems strown sparkling on the snow , Views the bright stars as glorious round the pole They sail incessant ; and their queen , the moon , As she at times returns a messenger From the long hidden sun , dispensing beams She hath received of him , to cheer the waste . He traces , rapt her trackless course , as round The chill horizon , first from South to North , And then from North to South she takes her course . He views with wonder , the ascending lights Which in those climes blaze glorious in the sky , And finds in all the works of nature 's God . Beauties , he little hoped , when tyranny First drove him forth to tread those frozen shores . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday What means this tale so cold ! thinkest thou that I Have now a relish for these icy beauties . Eleanor . Eleanor ' T is so with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at first would seem to banish hope , Drown every joy , and render life a curse  --  A curse past all endurance , fall upon us . We meet them first , as exiles for the North , Enter its frozen realms , deeming that there , Nor joy , nor peace of mind , can e'er be found . But soon new ties will grow around the heart , New friends , to whose warm souls we must respond , Meet us on every side , new hopes arise , New beauties every where unfold themselves , Showing that God in every situation  --  As in all realms , has strewn his bounteous gifts ; Till those afflictions which at first seemed death To all our hopes in life , become new life  --  But I talk to the air , thou heed'st me not . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I can heed nothing , but Le Fevre , now . To me the world is nothing without him . Eleanor . Eleanor But , it may be , time may assuage thy grief . Charlotte . Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Oh that the Austrian Legions were within it . Better by far we were a conquered people  --  Forced to endure a despot we abhor , Than to be slaughtered thus in freedom 's name . Eleanor . Eleanor Madame , ' t is dangerous to express such thoughts . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday True , we are slaves , and must not speak our thoughts  --  Slaves to vile Marat , and to Robespierre . Hath France no Brutus ! Heaven ! to free us from them ? The famed Corinthian struck his brother 's heart To free his country  --  and hath France no son Will strike a blow for her ? Eleanor . Eleanor Oh my dear friend , Forbear these thoughts , forbear these dangerous words . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Talk not to me of danger  --  danger 's past , For henceforth I have nothing left to fear , Having lost all I prize , that man can take . Eleanor . Eleanor But thou hast some friends left , who prize thy life , If not for thy own sake , for love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vengeance Upon thy head , ay , and upon thy friends . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday What is a slave 's life , that my friends should prize it  --  Or what is death , that they or I should fear it ; ' T is but deliverance from a world of sorrow Now can I see the truth of that old maxim , " Those whom the Gods love die in early youth . " For surely it 's a blessing thus to die . Eleanor . Eleanor Why then , thou shouldst not wish the death of those Who wrong their country , if death is a blessing . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I wish their death , not from a love of vengeance , But for their country 's good . The man who strikes The heart of Marat , strikes a blow for France  --  For freedom , virtue , and for public order . Eleanor . Eleanor The death of Ceasar deluged Rome with blood . But did not free her . Brutus slew in vain The man he loved . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried against them , I 'd not ask Vengeance upon their heads ; but as it is , What holier prayer can we breathe to heaven , Than that destruction may be swift upon them  --  What holier deed can human hands perform , Than strike them to the heart . Eelanor . Eelanor Do not speak thus , These frantic words but make thy fortunes worse . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday What virtuous man is dead of late , in France . Whose blood can not be found upon their skirts  --  What man of virtue is still left to us Whose life they do not seek  --  the noble Brissot , Eloquent Verniaud , with all their friends , The ardent Barbaroux , the lovely Roland  --  The honor of her sex ; her patriot husband , The gallant La Fayette , who fled from France To aid in freedom 's birth in the young West ; The sage Lavoiser , who reduced to order Chaotic matter  --  Dumouriez , great Orleans  --  The wise Condorcet , and the virtuous Petion Are all proscribed in this tumultuous reign Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ; although compared With these , his name is humble and obscure , Is doomed for the same crime  --  love of his country . It is for that he dies . Were it not well If men who do these deeds , died by the dagger  --  Have they a claim to law , or law 's protection , Who punish without law , inflicting death Where interest dictates , or where hatred prompts . Eleanor . Eleanor My heart would feel no pity for these tyrants , Died they a thousand deaths , by the worst torture Contrived by human malice ; but their death Might be the harbinger of bloodier times , The people would avenge them , should they fall By private daggers , with a sea of blood Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I knew not that . The hour is almost come When France will view their deeds with horror just ; A nation may be blinded for a time , But not forever . Were our tyrants dead By the assassin 's dagger , it might be That all the friends of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trembling the while Last they be doomed to death , even for their tears , Would rouse themselves , and find their name is legion . It is not that the many love the blood Of martyred friends , that they do sanction death , In its remorseless course , but that they fear Each other  --  yes the many , fear the many  --  Each man believing that his neighbor 's soul Unlike his own , burns with a thirst of blood . Were Marat dead , they might be undeceived , And deem him justly slain , as Rome at first Even pronounced upon her Ceasar 's death . Eleanor . Eleanor But there was found an Anthony to turn That first decision , to a burning rage , For vengeance on his foes , so would it be With us , were Marat slain . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But he 's no Ceasar , For he has won no triumph in the field , To bind men 's souls to him . He is distinguished But by his cruelty , while Ceasar 's course Was marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Girondins might return And win the people to the love of peace , And milder freedom founded on just laws . But why talk we of dark assassination , We timid maids , who dare not entertain The bare imagination of such deeds , Much less to do them . Eleanor . Eleanor Which of us hath thought Of doing such a deed ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Neither I trust  --  But tell me now , what crime or what suspicion , Was urged against Le Fevre , that he dies . That question I at first forgot to ask ; For when a man 's arrested now in France , The crime and proof are things of small importance . Eleanor . Eleanor ' T was either that he was Condorcet 's friend , Or his friends ' friend ; I can not certainly Remember which  --  the most that I can tell Is , Marat fears Condorcet and his friends , And thinks himself secure when they 're destroyed . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday He fears Condorcet ; now may heaven grant  --  His fears prove just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are leagued at Caen . But he is wrong to think Le Fevre 's death Will guard against his danger  --  ' twill but add New proof of his enormity , to aid Our friends in winning back the people from him . Eleanor . Eleanor Little he thinks one death would swell the numbers Of those whose blood now cries for vengeance on him . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Le Fevre 's life thou think'st of small importance , After the death of the illustrious men , Who owe to him their fate  --  I had forgot That he whose life was everything to me , Could be as nothing to the general mass  --  That he may die forgotten , unavenged , Even when the people call to retribution The miscreant demagogues who shed his blood ; This is to be unknown  --  to want the fame , He might have had , had I not held him back By silken conls of love from glorious deeds , Hoping in vain to find security In dull inaction . There my dearest friend , Has been my greatest error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braving all dangers In freedom 's cause ; then had he had some chance In proud success , to shun a felon 's doom . Eleanor . Eleanor My friend your course was the most prudent , though Fortune it seems has ruled it for the worst . Even had Le Fevre used his utmost power , To aid the Brissotins , in freedom 's cause , He had not stayed their fate , but fallen with them  --  Then had'st thou blamed the rashness which had led him To tread the path of danger and of death , Deeming inaction might have saved his life . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But then too , had he died a death of glory , And when the scales that blind the peoples ' eyes , Have fallen away , they would avenge his death ; And even now , his death may be avenged  --  And his destroyers may be taught the lesson It is not safe to trample on the humble . Wrongs to a peasant 's wife , caused Murray 's death , Scotland 's proud Regent , bled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Le Fevre Have some bold friend who will avenge his fate . Eleanor . Eleanor Why should we think on vengeance ? Will that raise The dead to life or warm the mould'ring clay ; Or will it soothe the soul in other worlds , To know its wrongs in this have been avenged . But to return  --  I said before that Marat 's Chief fear , was of Condorcet and his friends ; ' T is said that in Gironde they gather force To rescue Bordeaux , and march on to Paris . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday He says they gather force  --  then is there hope That they may soon be here , and save the city . Is there no chance to stay Le Fevre 's fate For a few days  --  could he but live a week The rescue might arrive . Eleanor . Eleanor There is little hope His death can be delayed . The tyrant told me He had not lived till now , but that some secrets Were to be drawn from him before he die Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Why then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eleanor . Eleanor But that will not avail ; They will not wait till then , before he dies , Even though his knowledge die untold with him  --  Moreo'er , they soon will gain his information From other sources , if he will not tell it ; For all they want to learn , is of Condorcet , His rendezvous , and movements  --  and that they Must learn , before Condorcet march to Paris . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Thou wilt destroy my hopes ; but feeble hopes Distract worse than despair . My dearest friend , Leave me awhile alone  --  in my own thoughts I will seek consolation , from the grief That weighs me now to earth ; crushing my powers , And all unfitting me for social converse . Eleanor . Eleanor If solitude can calm thy troubled soul , I 'll leave thee to thyself to night  --  to-morrow At early hour , I trust that I may see thee . Charlotte .

Exit . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Solus . So , then I am alone ; for life alone ; The man I love , I can behold no more Although this night he tarries on the earth  --  To-morrow night the dogs may tear the flesh From his unburied limbs ! ' T is I have slain him ! Had it not been for me , he had gone forth To join Condorcet , and had thus been saved . But I have kept him here , and he hath fallen Into the tiger 's grasp . How oft our fears ,  --  Our selfish fears , do lead us to destruction . I should have bid Le Fevre share the danger Common to all the friends of peace and order , I should have urged him forth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face Of Marat , and of Robespeirre , and Danton . Perhaps his talents might have turn 'd the scales , So nearly were they poised , to Brissot 's favor . But now he dies  --  lost by my coward fears , To let him combat bravely  --  I have acted Like one who opes his doors to murderous bands , Fearing to give offence by rude denial , And after all , is murdered for his fears .  --  As wisely might the sailor let the pirate Who shows the black flag , board his bark in peace , As I have acted in my craven course . But is there nothing I can do to save him ? I have asked that question oft  --  it has been answered  --  But I will ask it still  --  till death has done His dreaded work , and put an end to hope  --  Could his death be postponed but a few days , The Girondine from Caen , or Condorcet With aid from Bordeaux , might arrive , and save him ; And can I not achieve that brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiend below , Can yield him one week 's life , at my behest , For I will consort with the spirits lost , If that will save him . I have now a thought A dark , a horrid thought !  --  A dreadful scheme Flashes upon my soul , and something , whispers That it will save him  --  and will save my country . I know not if it be a fiend from hell That thus would tempt me , or the holy spirit Of love and patriotism , urging me To deeds of noble daring , for the sake Of him I love , and for my bleeding country . This man deserves to die ! That is most clear ; For he has dipt his hands in human gore , And steeped his soul in blood ! For him no tear Can drop from pity 's cheek . But should he die By the assassin 's dagger , or can I Stain my own hands with blood , to save a nation  --  Or that dear life , I prize above a nation ! These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not if the deed be classed With noblest actions , or with bloodiest crimes . It 's strange , that guilt and virtue thus do join , And blend themselves together . It is said , There 's but a step between the high sublime And the ridiculous . So there 's but a step Between our noblest aspirations , and The blackest crimes that e'er degraded man  --  So that we scarce now whether our course may lead To the seventh heaven , or to lowest hell . As men may travel westward , circling earth , Until they reach the regions of the east , So may we travel virtue 's path , until We find ourselves on guilt 's detested shore , All smeared with blood , and odious to ourselves . The man who strikes a tyrant to the heart , And frees his country , does a noble deed , And earns a glorious name for future times  --  But he who strikes , and can not free his country , Who spills the blood of one the nation loves , Or one the law ordains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not right , And that the victim is his country 's foe , Is a vile murderer ! Though he thinks the while He strikes for freedom , or for love of heaven . Which would he be , who should strike Marat dead ? The murderer , or the patriot ? That depends On the effects that flow from such a deed .  --  Marat 's a tyrant , and deserves to die ! But would his death give freedom to his country ? Perhaps it would , and even the slightest hope Of freedom , ought to balance such a life ; Then too , would my Le Fevre be avenged , Or saved perhaps  --  I will reflect on this . Seats herself , and pauses for some time with her hand upon her hand ,  --  then rising . I am resolved ! My course at length is chosen , The die is cast  --  bear witness for me heaven , And all ye powers above , who read my soul ; Rear witness ye who know my course on earth , I have no lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet will I do that deed ! Exit . ACT III . Scene I.  --  Charlotte 's House . Charlotte , Charlotte Corday Solus . The day now faintly dawns  --  the fatal day  --  The last of Liberty , if not of life To me , and death I fear to him I love , It is a glorious though a fatal morn , Too fair for the dark deed I meditate . Far in the west rides the resplendest moon , The queen of night , flying before the day Her dreaded conqueror ; while in the warm south Shines fiery Mars , and rising in the East That brighter planet , emblem of a power That conquers conquerors .  --  Brightly it ascends , And beams in glory . May it be an omen That love shall triumph in this awful work . But yet among the host that stud the heavens I see no emblem of bright patriotism That other power by which I trust my soul Is fired to action ; can it be so feeble  --  It stands unrepresented in the sky . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hath humbled nations , and drench 'd earth is blood , Guiding the souls of those the world call great , Goading them on to peril their own lives In slaughter of their brethren , and while love Binds in one chain the victor and the vanquished . Thou holier deity , thou friend of man , Of peace , of freedom  --  hast so little power Thou scarce canst raise the peasant from his home , To save his country from the hungry grasp Of demagogues , who prize the blood of man As wolves and panthers prize the lives of sheep . I marvel not , that of the starry host , None hath been made thy emblem , when so weak Thou art on earth that none will do thee homage . Ye glorious orbs , ye do not climb the sky To represent the powerless with your beams , But whatsoe'er ye are , ' t is the last time That I shall gaze upon ye ; never more Shall I behold your orbs blazing on high , Or mirrored from the waters of the Seine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more gloomy dungeon , which your beams Abhor to penetrate ; Oh ! let me then Bid my farewell eternal to your shores , Unless my soul may mount to tread your spheres From the cold grave , to which I hasten now ; But while I speak , ye fade to nothingness . Before the coming sun so shall I fade From earth , perchance before again ye show Your light in heaven ; and so alas fades all We prize on earth ; Oh may it be before Objects more bright and glorious , as the stars Fade at the coming of the brighter day .

But wherein can I aid thee ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Thou said'st the tyrant wanted information Drawn from Le Fevre , ere the guillotine Should silence him forever  --  canst thou tell me What was all the knowledge that he chiefly wished . Eleanor . Eleanor As near as I could judge , it was of those Who late have fled from Paris , to enlist The people in the cause of the Girondins , And that he chiefly wished to learn their place Of rendezvous , whether they fled to Bordeaux .

Hopest thou to save His life by treachery ; thou art deceived And knowest not the men with whom thou dealest . They 'll make thee promises , then take his life . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Oh fear me not . If I give information , It shall be such as never shall do harm To that dear cause I love , the cause of from dom ; Not e'en to save Le Fevre 's life would I Turn traitress to that cause ; nor would he prize A life thus won , nor love the maid who save him By means his soul detests .

If he is gone To the Gironde he may stir up the people , In Tallien 's rear , and thwart all his design O'erwhelming him , ere he can enter Bordeaux , Such news would give new life to malcontent In every part of France ; encourage Caen , To energetic acts , stir up all Bretange , And in the end , bring Barbaroux and Petion And all their friends , in triumph back to Paris , Still is the danger small , if the precautions Are taken now against it . We must check All risings in Gironde with care until Bordeaux is ours , and then farewell to fear . We are the lords of France , for Caen can not Hold out when Bordeaux yields , and as for Lyons , Resistance but postpones its hour of ruin , Closely besieged , cut off from friends without What can it hope for !  --  Ignorant La Vandee May give us trouble , but no fear , because It draws the sword for absolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are down , Our power established , firmly as the stars Are fixed in heaven .

I must now peruse Some fresh despatches sent us from Gironde , I have some fear of further insurrection In that department . Officer . Officer I obey your order . Marat . Marat It 's bad to loose this opportunity ; But these Girondins must be looked to well , Then all is safe . But otherwise we fall By sheer neglect to guard against our foes .

Robespierre . Robespierre People of France ! It is no time to weep for Marat now , Though low he lies , a martyr in your cause . His blood cries out for vengeance from your hands ; This crime for expiation , which will leave you No leisure hour for grief  --  nor is there need , For Marat 's mind still lives and rules the land ; His thoughts are stamped upon your hearts  --  his writings , Will teach his wisdom to posterity . There is then no cause for grief  --  though much for vengeance .

I see their daggers pointed to my heart , But still I heed them not , if ere they strike , I be allowed to stamp my souls impression Upon the hearts of men , as did great Marat . But though we see their impotence of malice Which strikes the tree after its fruit is saved , Though we lose nought till Marat 's foes can tear His burning thoughts from our tenacious souls , Still the imperative demands of justice , Forbid impunity to deeds like this ; And still does Marat 's blood ask an atonement From hecatombs of foes of liberty . But yet , let not your vengeance fall too heavy On her who did this deed , before you learn The whole conspiracy that urged her to it ; But rather let your wrath seek out the men  --  The coward hearts that plotted this foul crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , to a misguided maid . I learn the murderess is late from Caen  --  The lurking place of treacherous Barbaroux , A foe to Marat and to me  --  who hoped , To govern France by beauty , and who well Might rouse the soul of woman to this act . She has consorted too with the proud faction Of the Girondists since she came to Paris . It 's further known that she has visited The cell of that great idol of the party  --  The noted Madame Roland ! by permission Of the wise Danton . There is then no doubt That faction have consented to this deed .

But it is done , and vain is all regret , In vain , remorse , dost thou inflict thy sting ; My guilt remains unchanged . Still have I done No worse than Brutus did ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . One , who had ruined all my hopes on earth ; A guiltier tyrant too , than Rome beheld  --  And if I judge my guilt by that of him Who slew his brother for his country 's good , My soul seems white in contrast , though his deed By bards and monuments has been proclaimed As virtue 's noblest effort , to the world . I would my hour of trial were arrived . The time seems long  --  I think it must be near ; But in these cells we poorly judge the time , Since all is dismal night . Enter Officer . Officer . Officer Lady , the hour Appointed for thy trial has drawn nigh . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday These are glad tidings  --  tedious seems the time Alone mid these dark walls . Officer . Officer Lady , I fear Thy tedious hours on earth are near their end . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I trust they are . Officer . Officer  --  And yet there is some hope  --  If thou expose to punishment and death , Those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will accord thee pardon , And Danton bade me say to thee as much . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday What ! Would they have me then betray my friends ? Officer . Officer O , they are traitors who have ruined thee , By leading thee to guilt . It is but fair To yield thee now to justice  --  save thy life , And let them die for crimes which they have plotted . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday When the hour comes they 'll see what I disclose ; Perhaps I may reveal a plot to slay The virtuous Danton . Officer . Officer That will save thy life  --  Disclose it all , and doubt not of thy pardon ; But I must lead thee to the hall of justice . Scene II .  --  COURT OF THE PRISON . Charlotte Corday passes guarded , near Vergniaud and Duchastel  --  Madame Roland advances from the interior . Roland . Roland Was not that Corday , my young friend from Caen ? Duchastel . Duchastel Madam , it was . Roland . Roland It is but three days since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I little thought to see her here so soon , Iron 'd and guarded too . Vergniaud . Vergniaud Thou hast not heard then , The bold and bloody deed she has committed . Roland . Roland The bloody deed ! She never yet seemed one Disposed to lend her hand to works of blood . Vergniaud . Vergniaud Yet she has pierced the heart of one , whose acts And words have spread dismay throughout all France . Marat is dead !  --  dead , by that Lady 's dagger ! Slain e'en amidst his guards , in his own house . Roland . Roland Can it be Charlotte , who has done this deed ? Vergniaud . Vergniaud None else were there , and she avows the crime . Roland . Roland That blow was boldly struck , but badly aimed . Marat was but the van-guard of death 's ranks  --  The plotting Robespierre 's forlorn of hope , Whom he set forward to stir up this whirlwind , On which himself might ride to power supreme . If daggers then could aid the cause of freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) ' T were Robespierre that should have met this doom . Vergniaud . Vergniaud If she has done this deed to rescue France , She has deeply erred in judgment  --  but I learn That private wrongs have urged her to the act ; That one she loved  --  one whose life was her all , Had lately been by Marat doomed to death . Roland . Roland ' T is thus men 's acts reflected on themselves , Punish the evils they inflict on others ; Marat has counsel 'd crime  --  back on himself Comes unchained murder , from the hands of one , Whom his own wrongs have roused from virgin softness , To deeds , at which the hearts of heroes faint . Yet , little did I think the lovely Corday , With her bright beauty , with her wit , and science , Would give her life so prized , to purchase vengeance On one so worthless as the guilty Marat . Vergniaud . Vergniaud ' T would seem she had some hope to save her lover , Thinking that succor might arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duchastel I knew her well At Caen  --  she was there the ornament Of freedom 's cause  --  so fair , so wise , so ardent In her devotion to a pure republic , And hatred of all crime ; she seemed to us , The bright creation of a poet 's fancy ; Withal so gay , so witty in her converse , That few could hate the cause which she espoused . But suddenly she left us  --  why , we knew not . Vergniaud . Vergniaud The Jacobins contend she came to Paris On this black errand of assassination ; Instructed to it by our friends at Caen , And sanctioned too by the Girondins here . But I have learned ' t was love of one she knew When heretofore at Paris , that now called her To visit this wild city ; when she found His life was threatened beyond hope , she roused Her soul to this rash act . Roland . Roland By which , she brings On freedom 's cause a bloodier period ; For Marat 's friends will charge the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Vergniaud . Vergniaud But will the world believe , that we selected A young and timid girl for such a work  --  The act itself proclaims our innocence ; Those who plot murder never yet employed A virgin soft , to execute the crime ;  --  As quickly would the hunter choose the sheep To chase the lion from the wilderness . SCENE III . Hall of Judgment .  --  The President and Members of the Revolutionary Tribunal . Robespierre , Danton , Tallien , Charlotte Corday , &c.; President . President Charlotte Corday , although thy crime confessed Renders thee worthy death without respite . Still , as it seems this treason  --  unsurpassed In all crime 's annals for its bloody boldness  --  Must have accomplices , we give thee time Before we fix the hour of execution , For full confession , that thou may'st not die With truth untold dying upon thy tongue . We now accord thee liberty of speech , To tell the motives which have led the on , To deeds so tragic . If thou dost reveal The name and guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I give thee thanks for this .  --  Freedom of speech To one who stands upon the verge of death , Is a great favor which I prize full high , And faithfully will I improve it now . First for my motives then ! I saw all France Drenched in the blood of wise and virtuous men Slain on the scaffold for their country 's love , Of men who would have given their all for freedom And for the weal of France ; dead by the hands Of those whose shouts were loud in freedom 's cause . I saw the peeople phrensied and led on To deeds of blood  --  even to the massacre Of their best friends , by vile and crafty men  --  I knew the demons who had thus deceived them  --  Traitors , not merely to their rights and interests , But to their virtue , leading them to guilt In freedom 's garb , and urging them to crime By cries of bravery , fame , and patriotism .  --  I saw no hope for freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peirced the heart of one Who was his country 's worst and deadliest foe Because the foe of virtue and of order .  --  Robespierre . Robespierre Charlotte Corday ; the man who fell by thee Was freedom 's champion  --  Virtue 's champion too ; For though he would consign a few to death , Out of the millions thereby rendered happy , Still , he contended for the people 's power And sovereignty , and right to government , Omnipotent in the majority . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday He was the champion of error then , If he contended for the unchecked power Of the majority , as thou averrest . Robespierre . Robespierre Such is the Gironde doctrine ; but is not All government of the majority , Or shall the smaller number rule the greater Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Man was not born to be the slave of any , Both of the few and many is he free , By nature 's right and Heaven 's equal law , And saving their subjection to the law Which nature gives to guard their liberty Against infringement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself alone ; The greater number only can have power Over the smaller , where that power is given Singly by those o'er whom ' t is exercised . Would that be freedom where our lives and all We hold most dear , were subject to the will , Or the caprice of fickle multitudes ? Or would it be a state that men should reign ? No ; let me have that liberty , where I , In my own mode seek my own happiness , While steering free from guilt and from infringement Upon the just and equal rights of others . Robespierre . Robespierre How can each be the ruler of himself ? Man was not born to tread the earth alone In independence , of himself sufficient For his own government and happiness . Nature hath formed him for association ; He must associate , and the greater number Of right must rule in that association . If each is lord and ruler of himself , There is no union , and you doom mankind To anarchy , or endless solitude . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock on which the state is wrecked ; Men must associate , but by their free will And mutual compact , otherwise their union Is slavery to the dissenting part . Robespierre . Robespierre Men must associate . Then there is compulsion , Or at the least , necessity of union . Necessity will justify compulsion , When free will fails , ( as it must after fail ) And when no mutual compact can be made ; Else might the obstinate prevent forever The union which necessity ordains , Refusing all assent to plans and laws The greater and the wiser part suggest , Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Why , then , the greater and the wiser part May form a union of themselves , and leave The obstinate to nature and their choice . Robespierre . Robespierre But when the last inhabit the same realm With the majority , a separate union Becomes impossible , all must unite  --  For otherwise no nation can be formed . The greater number then may use compulsion , If the minority refuse assent To wholesome plans of union and of law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being but to force upon the few , Those schemes of law the many would adopt . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Necessity , the mother of invention , Is mother of agreements , and of compacts , Sufficient for the government of man ,  --  These must exist before mankind acquire Fixed habitations , and till they are formed Men have no realm . In their first union then , They are not joined by ties of common country  --  Or local interest  --  but by mutual minds , And in that mutual mind they form the law To which they promise mutual submission . But as all law is of itself imperfect ( As are all human things , ) as it may fail In application to events which time In unforseen contingencies brings forth ; The first law , or first compact , should create Some power which thenceforth may enact new laws , But with due limitation and precaution Against abuse . This power is wisest placed In the majority , or else in men Whom the majority at times elect . But if ' t is wrongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact which creates the State , Are not the wisest , still , while some dissent To better schemes of union which are planned By the majority , to render man More blest and happy , there can be no change , Unless provision for such change is made In the first constitution ; for we have No power to force on the minority New laws to which they never have assented , Either directly , or by giving power To the majority to form such laws ; Those then who wish new laws , must form themselves Into a separate State . Danton . Danton Were it not better , At once to force the obstinate to union , And bring the whole into a happier state , Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But who shall say which is the happier state , Unless each judges for himself . Besides If we compel men , acting from the plea That union is a necessary law , And binds mankind to an association , Such as the greater number may ordain , We ruin order , and establish nothing ; We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater number one day makes , A dozen converts may the next annul . Life can not be secure in such a state , For he who loses popularity Dies with the loss ; and as for liberty , It may exist in name , but ' t is a mockery Worse than the slavery of the Russian serf , For without order and security For life and person , there can be no freedom ; But grant the greater number has the right To rule the less ; what then shall constitute That greater number which must rule supreme ? Is it the greater number of the earth  --  The greater number of the men of France  --  Including Corsica , or without Corsica  --  For scarce we know whether that is of France Or of another nation ,  --  or is it The greater number of this troubled city , Rent by its factions , guided by a frenzy That ruins all things , that must be obeyed  --  Or why not each department rule itself , For who hath formed the line by which our union Shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yonder stream , forever Your fates are linked  --  God has ordained your union ,  --  If none hath said this ; if the God of heaven Has drawn no lines for nations how can they Be formed , but by the compact of the people , Of which they are composed , a compact free , And mutual in its origin , to all Who thus unite . This is the only way They could begin , and every government That rules a nation , owes its origin To the same compact that creates the nation ; Since without government there is no nation , But each man is a state . Danton . Danton Charlotte Corday , When was this compact formed ? When has the nation Met to propose a contract of the kind ? We have heard much of this from Brissotines But , can they show a compact which a people Have ever formed for their own government ? Charlotte Charlotte Corday He who becomes a citizen of France , Or being born in France , remains to share The rights accorded to her citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aid and support the laws and government France hath before ordained , if such exist . For France is owner of the realm of France , By compact , formed at her first settlement , And he who there inhabits , must obey The terms prescribed , even as the tenant yields Not to his landlord 's will , but to his terms , Or quits possession ; so the citizen Must yield to terms established , or must quit The lands the nation owns : and if he choose The former course , this is his compact , free And mutual with all the citizens . For each hath stipulated to obey In the same manner , and each one is bound To the same laws , and the same government . Tallien . Tallien But I would ask then , whence may revolutions Be formed , in governments tyrannical If there the people too are bound by compact To obey the established laws and government ; For though their yoke be heavy and oppressive , They ought to yield , or abdicate their right Of citizens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thy doctrine The established government must be obeyed Though it should be the bloodiest tyranny That ever earth has suffered . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday When a nation Is by its government oppressed and wronged The rulers break their compact with the people , And compacts broke , are thereby null and void , And thus , the mutual league between the people Dissolves itself , and those who are oppressed Have now a right to seek their own redress , Punish the rulers , who have done them wrong , And their adherents all . Their labor next , Must be the re-establishment of law , Of order , and of better government ,  --  If in this labor they should disagree Beyond all compromise , their rightful course Must be to form in nations separate  --  For when the band that bound the state together Is totally destroyed , none have the right , To bind the others by the laws they make ; But if in the partition of the realm , Agreement fail , the period arrives , In which force rules , while law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails , By bravery or numbers gives the law , The conquered must obey . Tallien . Tallien But if the people Are bound by compact to monarchal States , They are enslav 'd e'en by that mutual compact Which tyranny will not have need to break Charlotte . Charlotte Corday If men are fools , and league themselves to chains , They must endure the evil , but their sons , May shun a like agreement . Talien . Talien Then they must Fly from their native land . For that belongs , According to thy scheme , all to the state Or to the few who still uphold the state . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Not so  --  the few can never own a realm ; For nature 's right rises superior To former occupation , and to claims Drawn from dead men 's conveyance ; when the many Are ousted from their native soil by laws That give it to the few . Danton . Danton It boots us not , To waste our time here in discussions idle , Of fancied rights from subtle metaphysics , Drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy only chance of life Now rests on the disclosure of the guilt , Of those that urged thee to this bloody crime . Denounce then thy accomplices in treason , For such , we all are confident thou hast . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I had but one Danton . Danton And who was he ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday ' T was heaven  --  ' T was heaven that nerved my arm to strike the heart Of one whose death should be a warning lesson To his accomplices in guilt and treason . Robespierre . Robespierre Think'st thou that Deity has left the skies To aid a murderess in her deeds of blood ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I do not think the Deity hath changed The laws by which he governs earth and man , To aid me in this deed ; for it was caused By the immutable and unchanged law Impressed by God upon the human soul , That whosoever sheddeth human blood , Or heaps oppression on the head of man  --  By human hands shall fall . In crushing him I acted as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fate was one which should have been foreseen  --  Yea , calculated from his work , which must Lead to this end . For me , the instrument By which his doom was wrought , I was till now A maid fond of retirement  --  My ambition Was to be thought a gay and giddy girl , And please the man I loved . But roused to action By wrongs which left me nothing more to hope , I seized the dagger ; as the worm will turn Against the foot that crushes it , I rose ' Gainst him who crush 'd my heart ; and if he fell , He fell by that resistless principle  --  The eternal Nemesis who never yet Left human wrong without redress on him Who was the perpetrator of that wrong . ' T was this that wrought his fall , which will work thine And thine , Pointing to Robespierre and Danton. and that of your accomplices , Who all are hastening to a bloody end . Robespierre . Robespierre Perchance thou knowest some conspiracy Now formed against us ; if thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's mercy . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday None against thee : but one aginst that man ? I do suspect . pointing to Danton . Robespierre . Robespierre Against the illustrious Danton ? Reveal it then , or else the people 's rage Will tear the secret from thy stubborn heart . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Perhaps the people will not trust my word , But if they will , the little hope of mercy They have held forth , will be to me a motive Ample to lead to the development Of all I know . Robespierre . Robespierre We will investigate All thy disclosures . If they are important , Doubt not the people will accord thee pardon . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Then I will speak . If I can rightly judge From all my eyes have seen , or ears have heard , Or if one standing on the verge of death May be allowed the gift of prophecy , His death will spring from thee . Thou art the main Plotter against his life of whom I spoke . Robespierre . Robespierre I ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operated long In counsel dangerous , for the people 's good . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Deeply that bard of England erred , who said That devils concord hold . Accomplices In guilt like yours , can never long agree , Save where necessity compels agreement . When there were three of you , a mutual check Ye were upon each other , and your power Thus balanced , ye were kept in amity ; But one being lost , the balance is destroyed , And mutual jealousy soon leads to plots Against each other 's life , and Robespierre The strongest with the people , must prevail . Danton . Danton Darest thou accuse that virtuous citizen , Of crimes like these ? Robespierre . Robespierre Yet let her speak the whole , That all the world may know we do not fear To meet her accusations . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday It was so With the triumviri who ruined Rome While they were three , they rul 'd the commonwealth  --  Destroying opposition in their union ; But when one fell , the others were united But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye traitors to the holy cause Of freedom and the equal rights of man . And now , scarce is your giulty compeer 's blood Congealed in death , before your mutual hate I see , although disguised with friendly words . Danton . Danton aside . By heaven she speaks my thoughts . I must enquire What she has seen . aloud Murderess , canst thou tell Of aught which thou hast seen , which implicates The illustrious Robespierre in plots against me , Or me , in plots against his valued life ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Use thine own eyes for thy protection ; while He plots against thy life I 'll not expose him . Oh no ! I 'll draw no dagger ' gainst his heart , If he 'll confine himself to game like thee . Danton . Danton Well , what shall be his fate , if such is mine ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday When thou hast paid the debt thou owest justice , Awhile he rules deluded France , alone , And must be left unto the tyrant 's doom , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , who can not read A fate as plain as his . There 's little need Of prophecy , to tell a tyrant 's end . Robespierre . Robespierre Thus far we have list'ned to the prisoner 's railing , That we might show how little is our fear To meet her accusations . Witness , all Ye citizens of France , we do not shrink From charges brought against us ; we confide In our own virtue and the public justice , Too much , to fear the murderese ' invectives . For me , I have aspired to rise to fame , By making France a free and happy nation . It is for this I 've labored , and when I Forsake that cause , or advocate another , I will submit to your just condemnation . People . People Vive Robespierre ! Vive Robespiere ! the patriot incorruptible . Robespierre . Robespierre Traitress , what canst thou urge against my acts , Or those of the illustrious citizen , Late minister of justice , that thou darest To brand us traitors to the cause of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most virtuous citizens , And that of the Republic 's staunchest friends , Slain by your mandates , witnesses your guilt That ye are traitors to the cause of freedom . And if ye now pretend to be her friends , And advocate her cause , it doth but blacken To tenfold darkness your unhallowed deeds . Have you not dared pollute her holy cause By doing in her name your deeds of blood ? Was it not by you , and your associate , dead By a just retribution , that your prisons , Fill 'd to overflowing with your foes enchain 'd , From weak suspicion or from private malice , Were emptied in one night by murder foul ? Was it not by you the deputies elect From the Gironde , the wisest sons of France , And favorites of their constituents , Were driven from their seats in the Convention , Thus changing the complexion of that body , Enabling the minority to rule ? Is it not by you that now their lives are sought , And quickly will be taken ; and are ye Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us , Robespiere , hast thou not sought To be dictator of the realm of France ? And is it not , for their dull comprehension , Which could not see necessity for this , That now the Girondins are doom 'd to death , Or waiting to be doomed . Thou speakest of fame ! Thou art condemned to everlasting fame ! A fame as black as ever fiend obtained ; A fame that ranks thee with the pests of earth , And gives thee high pre-eminence among them . For when the mists that shroud the eyes of France , Have passed away , thy deeds shall seem as dark And guilty as the deeds of Caligula , With treason coupled to his bloody course . Thy name shall be a term of reprobation , And men shall spurn thee as the vilest thing That ever trod the earth  --  a fierce hyena Clothed in the human shape . But some shall wonder That such guilt could exist , till they suspect Some secret virtue , which they can not find . Robespierre . Robespierre Thou rail'st against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law who could approve The law , as those who execute the laws . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday But our complaint is that there is no law ; We die not by the law , but by the will Of demagogues , who overcome the law . But for your condemnation , t is an honor I would not change for thy ill-gotten power , Or all the gold that 's paid thee for thy treason ; Yes ! now to die the death of criminals Is honor high , and shows a virtuous life . Those who live uncondemned in times like these , Will be suspected of some hideous crime , For who 'll believe ye spared a virtuous man . President . President It is not meet that we should longer listen To these upbraidings . Prisoner , the doom Allotted to thy crime , thou knowest is death .

Citizens of France , We now adjourn our court , you may retire . The people retiring  --  Desmoulines accosts Danton . Desmoulines . Desmoulines Well , thou hast had thy fortune told to day . Danton . Danton Yes , and I fear me all too truly told . I have observed that Robespierre of late Is plotting something that bodes me no good ; I must be wary , or the prisoner 's words Will prove too true . Desmoulines . Desmoulines Yes , and if Danton fall , He will not fall alone . His friends must share The doom allotted him , whate'er it be . Nor matters it if they he true or false . Danton . Danton Thou speakest truly ; treason to me now Would hardly screen my friends : for jealousy Would never trust to such abandonment ; But here comes Tallien and we need his counsel ; Enter Tallien . Tallien , I think thou art a friend to me . Tallien . Tallien A friend to thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danton Thou heardst the prisoners words foretelling death To me from Robespierre ; what dost thou think Of such a prophecy ? Tallien . Tallien Quite probable , For who can tell who will be left alive . Danton . Danton Thou seemest cold , but still I 'll trust thy honor ; I fear the prisoner knows designs against me . Wilt see her in her cell and ferret out The knowledge she may have of such designs ? Tallien . Tallien I 'll see the prisoner , for I have some reason To seek her knowledge , which I find is great . Danton . Danton Well I will see thee then again on this . Exeunt Robespierre and Sechelles pass . Robespierre . Robespierre Truly she said we can not long agree . His deeds have grown too black , too many deaths Of late have stained our annals  --  causeless death I held is wrong . Sechelles Sechelles Aye , but the people think You have agreed in all this work of death . Robespierre . Robespierre Why , I have counselled the decapitation Of royalist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republic needs ; But he and Marat often have sent men Without a crime to mount the guillotine . Did he not sanction the September murders And all the horrors of that dreadful night ? Who then can say his conduct has been just ? Exeunt ACT V SCENE I.  --  PRISON . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday The day has come that witnesses my death . I feel its dawning light , though the sun-rays Scarce penetrate these walls . A few more hours And all is past with Charlotte . I shall be Food for the hungry worm .  --  No he 's not hungry The worm of late is too well fed for that . Still worms will gnaw my flesh . These veins  --  these nerves  --  Formed with such wondrous skill , will be their food . My heart will not escape them , and my brain Will make their daintiest dinner . They will revel Like Bacchanalan 's in my thoughtless scull . But where will be my mind  --  my thinking part  --  The soul that animates this frame ? Will it To its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to be Re-organized in other reasoning souls ? Or is it the mere property of matter In that organization which the God Of nature stamps upon each human mould  --  Ceasing with the disruption of the parts Of which , in life , it was a quality ? Or will it live to visit other worlds , Aud view in them the wondrous works of God , While its frail tenement returns to dust ? Well , these are questions which earth can not answer . Time and the guillotine must end my doubts ; But when all 's past , what will earth say of me ? Will nations rank my name with that of Brutus , Who slew his friend to save his country 's freedom ? Or will they brand me as a murderess vile Who , fired with private hate , destroyed a man That was his country 's idol and protector ? Well , be it as it will ; for what is man , That I should give a thought for his esteem ? Enter Tullien and Barras . Tallien . Tallien Lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruded on thy solitude . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday It 's small intrusion . Whatsoe'er the charms Of solitude may be , they are not found here : ' T is not mid dungeon walls that the heart pants To be alone . The free  --  none , but the free  --  Can relish solitude . Therefore , ye are welcome . But what wants Danton that he sends you here ? I think , you said you come by his request Tallien . Tallien We did , But not from his request alone ; Yet first his errand must be told . He craves To know what thou hast seen in Robespierre , That leads thee to believe he meditates The death of Danton ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Bid him play the spy In his own cause , and in his own defence . A secret , that may tend to save his life , Shall never be disclosed by lips of mine . Tallien . Tallien Well , then , I must proceed to my own errand : However strange it seem , I come for counsel To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  To thee , the murderess of the man , whose friend I have been deemed . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Why , this is strange indeed . I little thought that my last hours of life Would witness such a scene ,  --  that Marat 's friends  --  Friends who did aid him in his work of death  --  Tallien and Barras , his abettons both , Would come for counsel to his murderess . Barras . Barras Lady , we did support him while we thought He sought his country 's freedom ; but his work Of death was not persued by our advice . Tallien . Tallien And we had counsell 'd before Marat 's death , What should be done to rescue France and freedom From that disgrace our bloody course has won . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Were ye not of the faction by which France Has been cornered to shed her children 's blood ? Tallien . Tallien We were  --  but while we did not see the end At which our leaders aimed . We sure believed Power might be trusted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of death . We thought the people , acting by the voice Of the majority , could do no wrong . But in the evil of the times we 've proved The error of our system . Our wild trial Has taught the world , power must be limited Though it were vested in the angel 's hands . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Does Tallien , who has desolated Bordeaux , And stained her streets with gore  --  with the fresh blood Of Biroteau upon his unwashed hands , Profess to be the friend of moderation , Or hate the acts we witness now in France ? Tallien . Tallien I have but punished , where the law compelled A punishment which I could not refuse . The life of Birotenn was forfeited By his rebellion . He had been condemned And outlawed ere he was my prisoner . His was a sentence I dared not remit ; Besides , I deem 'd it just that those who warr 'd Against the state should perish by its laws . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday It was not Birotean and his associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That drove them from their seats by force illegal  --  O'erawing the Convention , till its fears Accorded their expulsion . Tallien . Tallien Ne'ertheless , I could but deem them rebels , since the power For which I acted , had declared them such , Still have I spared all that my situation , Would let me spare . And now I come to save One whom the powers that be , devote to death , One beauteous as thyself ; one without crime Save that her friends are foes to Robespierre . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Thy task must then be easy . One so free From stain of crime , can be in little danger If Tallien and her beauty plead her cause . Tallien . Tallien Thou errest ! Robespierre demands her life ; And still refuses mercy . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Hath he then Power to demand the life of one who stands , Convicted of no crime ? Tallien . Tallien Power to demand it ! I thought the tyrant 's power was known to thee ; Hast thou not learned that his demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday If it be so , what shall we say , of those Who helped to that power , professing still That they were freedom 's friends . Tallien . Tallien That they were traitors To freedom , or deceived as I have been ; But I have said , that my belief is changed , That I would limit power , and even the right , Of the majority to confer power , Which I once thought unbounded and inherent . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Your changed belief is wise . I have loved the people . I die their friend , their champion ; ay , the martyr Of their just cause , for here I call on him The searcher of all hearts , to witness for me , I did not strike my foe , from private malice , Though my own hopes were crushed , but all for France , All from the hope to set my country free . Yet though I love the people and would have All power political derived from them , That power should have its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think alike , and thy remarks Made at thy trial , have excited in us , A wish to question further thy belief . Barras . Barras We saw from what thou said'st thou hadst reflected Much on the rights of man , much on his right As a free being , born his only lord . ' T is on this subject that we would hear more . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Do men renowned for knowledge  --  men whose names Are known in distant nations , ask of me , A girl condemned , questions of human right . Tallien . Tallien We have proved thy knowledge . In a few hours more It passes with thee to the voiceless tomb And to the world ' t is lost , unless thou now Can'st pour that knowledge in our listening ears , Marvel not then that while such wisdom lives . We seek to learn what in another hour Were sought too late . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday The wisdom I can boast Is small indeed , but such as it may be It need not perish when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survives The flowing fountain whence I drew that wisdom  --  There you may slake your deepest thirst for knowledge  --  There when the axe hath done its work on me You still may learn all that these lips can tell , If questioned now , and time allowed to speak Tallien . Tallien Well , wilt thou point us to that copious fountain ? It must be deep , for thou hast deeply drunk . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday If you would study deep the rights of man , And learn the way that freedom is seemed , If you would be champions in the bright cause Of order , and of human liberty  --  If you would rescue wretched France from blood , If you would make her glorious , face and happy , And teach the people how to away themselves , Go study well the infant institutions Of young America , where freedom dwells , And peace her sister reigns . There you will find No gory streets ; no waters red with blood , Drawn from the veins of freedom 's dearest friends , No guillotine does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . There the law rules  --  the people make the laws . Barras . Barras The people !  --  that is the majority . For never are the people all agreed . Go on their plan the greater part must rule The smaller , and the smaller must submit . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday There the majority have power so far As it is given them by their constitutions , Which also fix the limits of that power . They do not claim omnipotence as here , Nor that they are the fountain of all law . They can not reach the freedom or the lives Of those their faction hates . They can not touch The people 's purses but by a fair levy . No confiscation there  --  none for their wealth Are doomed to death on accusation false . The states can never punish the commission Of deeds , made crimes by a subsequent law , Though the majority cry loud for vengeance . Moreo'er the government is checked in actions By forms which often neutralize its power , And check all movement till the amplest time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the smaller number may prevent All change of law ; defeating thus the will Of the majority , which asks a change . Tallien . Tallien While then their system doth forbid all change , Except by sanction of the greater number , That greater number can not always out Against the will of the minority . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Most true , for satisfied with their condition . They put a check on change , knowing their freedom Can not be lost , until their laws are changed . Study their system well , you will find in it Something nomarchal and outinocratic , Something avoiding power wherever lodged And making each man ruler of himself ; Yet shunning anarchy , and all infringement Upon the rights of others ; having enough Of law for this , although as I have said They make no claim to inherent power Vested in numbers by a right divine , But draw authority solely from compacts Which emanate from the consent of all , And which define the power that may be borne And exercised by the majority . Barras . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say That all America has met in council , And with one voice enacted these decrees , Or how else do they emanate from all ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday When first that land was settled , government Was there established , by the mutual wish Of all that settled there . Then was the power Which the majority might thenceforth hold , Fixed by agreement of the emigrants Who sought that region to establish freedom . Thus , their colonial government were form 'd By mutual compact between all concerned , Or subject to their laws ; while those who joined Them at subsequent dates , by that one act Assented to the compact made before . Their revolution did not change their system It being but war against the parent clime , Carried on by governments before established , Which thenceforth by acknowledgement of England , Become free States . Their general government Was likewise formed by the consent of all , Of all the States ; for had one State dissented , It had not been a member of the union , Though the assenting would have formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tallien But all the men Who concurred in , or who assented to The first organization of these States , Are long since dead ; the same fate must soon Fall upon those who have participated In the arrangement of the new born nation . When these are gone , and others in their place , Shall tread the fields and halls where once they trod , What obligation will then rest on them The new born generation , to obey The laws their fathers made , and not themselves ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday A generation does not fall at once , And leave the world to a new generation , Unless it be a Robespierrean era.  --  Men one by one do leave the stage of life , And one by one enter its busy scenes . When each in turn becomes a citizen , He then becomes a party to the compact , By which the former citizens were bound , Having assented to it by that act . Thus as the State receives new citizens , The compact , which originates its power , Receives new parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established law , As firmly as the men who first combined . Tallien . Tallien Well , these it seems are explanations plain , Nor shall this interview be lost on us . We have resolved to stay this waste of blood , If fate permit , though the odds are against us ; We are the friends of freedom and of France , We love our country , as we trust thou dost . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I love my country ! Have I not proved that , By yielding now my life ,  --  But I forget . ' T is he I slew , is deemed my country 's friend , And I , her enemy , for slaying him . But yet I loved my country , as I loved That mother from whose veins I drew my blood . Yes , wretched France , my highest aspirations Have been to see thee free ; to see thee happy . As for myself , my hopes were but to live A happy woman , in a land of freedom .  --  But fortune broke my dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my country 's cause ; A murderess of one who earned his death By many a crime , but still a murderess .  --  Oh citizens ! it is a dreadful thought ! For one so young to die a murderess . Tallien . Tallien Well , what is there that we can do for thee ? It is not in our power to save thy life , For now , the citizens demand thy death . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I do not ask for life  --  I knew my death Was fixed as fate , before I did the deed ; Nor is it meet that I escape the doom Allotted to all murder .  --  Though I slew A man who well deserved the fate he met . But there are two things I would ask of you , If you have power to great them , you may soothe My dying hours , and bless my end with peace . Tallien . Tallien Whatever they may be , we 'll strain our power To grant thee thy request ; but speak thy will , If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlotte Corday If Charles Le Fevre lives , I yet would see him . My next request , is to address the people Who may assemble at my execution . Tallien . Tallien Le Fevre lives , his death has been postponed , In hopes to wring either from him , or thee , Some information that may shed more blood Him thou canst see , for we have power to do Whate'er may tend to draw from thee disclosures ; And he may be brought here with that pretence . Thy next request is far more difficult  --  Danton and Robespierre will scarce permit One they condemn , to speak before people . Barras . Barras But , there is one way , this may be accomplished . If she will promise then to make disclosures , There 's little fear her wish will be denied . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Tell them I will disclose all that I know : There 's little fear that that will do them good . Tallien . Tallien Le Fevre then shall soon be ordered here . And we will now bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no time to lose , So we must bid thee now a long farewell . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Farewell , and may you live to rescue France , Barras . Barras Although thy deed is not approved by me , I yield full credence to thy good intent , And bid thee farewell , as a friend who dies A martyr in the cause of France and freedom . Exeunt Tallien and Barras . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Alone again , it is a fearful thing To be alone , so near upon the brink Of vast eternity ; but ' t is not long That I shall be alone . The hour of death Is near at hand . But of the little time That yet remains , I trust much may be spent In the society of him I love  --  Of him , whom I would gladly die to save  --  My heart now leaps to meet him . Here he comes . Enter Le Fevre . My own Le Fevre , I indeed am happy , To see thee once again ; yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last allowed by fate , Though like all lovers we but meet to part . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Alas ! my Charlotte , is this the last hour That we shall meet , and canst thou still be happy ? Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Happy !  --  thrice happy , that we meet this hour . It is a world of life to be allowed This unhoped interview  --  this last assurance That our firm hearts falter not at our fate ; And now my soul will only drink the bliss To be with thee .  --  It will not think of death . Le Fevre . Le Fevre My noble Charlotte ! thou art brave indeed , But what do I not lose in losing thee ! Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Why , we shall tread the path of death together , At least , thy steps will not be far behind . We do not lose each other ,  --  hand in hand Shall our proud spirits wing their fight from earth .  --  Proud ! for we triumph  --  even in the defeat Of our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for though our blood Should flow , till the gorged earth could drink no more , Still must we triumph  --  still must the result Proclaim our wisdom to all realms ! all time ! And prove that guilt , against which we contend . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Well death will lose its sting when thou art gone . I shall not dread to try the unseen world , When so much beauty enters there before , When nought is left behind to bind me here . But hark ! that bell ! is it the hour of death ? Enter Jailer . Jailer . Jailer Lady , that is the bell for preparation , And thou must be arrayed for the last scene . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday Then fare thee well for life  --  a short farewell , One kiss , one last embrace , and then adieu . We die as freedom 's champions ! We 'll not sully The brightness of our destiny with tears . Le Fevre . Le Fevre Farewell  --  Oh , may I meet the doom that waits me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that thou wilt ! I know that death will not appal thee more When thy loved Charlotte slumbers in the tomb . A Dieu ! pointing upwards . Le Fevre . Le Fevre as she is going Adieu ! why linger in the world . Scene II . A crowd before the Guillotine ,  --  Danton and Tallien meet . Danton . Danton Tallien , what news ? What says the prisoner ! Tallien . Tallien She says she will disclose all that she knows At her last moments , if she may address The people at the place of execution . Danton . Danton Then we must grant that favor . I must learn The secret of the warning which she gave me , But what will Robespierre then say to it ? Tallien . Tallien Why we must urge that she can make disclosures , That may affect the public peace and safety ; But here comes Robespierre , we 'll learn his mind . Enter Robespierre and Barras . Robespierre . Robespierre 1 2 Danton , I am informed by Barras here , The prisoner craves permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to me a very strange request . Danton . Danton Yes , but'tis said that she will make disclosure , Which may affect the safety of all France . Tallien . Tallien There is no other way we can discover The secret plots , which led her to this crime . I therefore think , that she should be indulged . Robespierre . Robespierre Well be it as you will , but yet I fear That her disclosures will be but harrangues To instigate the people to revolt . Exit Robespierre . Enter Charlotte Corday guarded passing towards the guillotine . Danton . Danton Charlotte Corday , we grant thee thy request . Thou mayst address the people from thy scaffold . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday I thank thee , noble Danton , for that favor . She mounts the guillotine Danton . Danton People of France , the prisoner would speak ; It 's said she will disclose some secret plot Against the state . Listen ye all to her . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday People of France . The illustrious citizen , Has told you truly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first , would I say something of the crime , Committed by myself  --  I would explain The cause that led me to its perpetration . A few weeks past it was my cherished hope To pass my life in peace and freedom here , Happy in loving , and in being loved , No dream of murder troubled then my heart . But as a daughter of the realm of France , I prided in her freedom , and her glory ; Aye ! I was charmed by the republic 's name ; A name which ever had a magic for me , And I supposed that France once a republic , Might rear her citizens in happiness . It was my ardent hope to see the time When every man , setting beneath his vine , Might rail at kings , and the people too , And never feared vengeance was at his door , But soon the scene was changed . The skies of France Were overcast with blood . Instead of freedom , Terror o'erspread the land , wild anarchy Usurped the place of law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . Suspicions vague supplied the place of proof , When vengeance sought the aid of legal forms . Our state grew worse , till the best blood of France . Blood from the hearts that throbbed in freedom 's cause Was shed by those who breathed the name of freedom , And swore they were her friends , albeit their lips , Were red with gore fresh drawn from freedoms veins  --  And you ; even you were taught the love of blood , Taught you were free when you could slay your friends , And drive your patriots into foreign climes , Exiles from home and all that they hold dear , As you have driven the virtuous La Fayette , Who was the champion of human rights , When you were bowing neck and knee to kings . Nor dreamed that you should ever dare resist . Was this well done ? Alas ! ye men of France Ye have mistaken power for liberty : The demon for the goddess ,  --  and your error Has cost the lives of those that loved you most . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who urged you on to these false steps , Have plotted foul against your liberty . Robespierre . Robespierre Hear her no more , for she discloses nothing , Her only aim is to excite sedition . People . People Yet hear her through , we will her more from her . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday My tale is nearly told . When blood became The order of the day , my hopes were lost , But still I smiled in dreams of better days , Until the man I loved torn from my arms , Was borne to dungeons never to return . All hopeless then I seized the bloody dagger  --  You know the rest , it is I slew the man Who was the slayer of my peace on earth . Robespierre . Robespierre Well make an end ; or bring forth thy disclosures For justice can no longer wait thy death Danton . Danton Be not too hasty , let us learn the whole . Charlotte . Charlotte Corday My tale is told ; and now my countrymen , If you would drive oppression from your soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would not see millions fall by tyrants , And tyrants by assassins , while these perish By justice 's stern decree , staining your streets With mingled gore , from virtue and from guilt . If you would constitute a pure republic  --  If you would be the bulwark of earth 's freedom  --  I bid you turn your eyes for an example Unto the West , unto the glorious West ! Beyond the broad Atlantic , you may see A clime that 's free , and yet unstained with blood ; There every man is monarch of himself , And does not fear the many or the few .  --  There , power is checked by fundamental codes , Which say to faction , let thy waves be staid . There , every man is governed by the law , The law made known before the deed is done , Which it condemns . This constitutes their freedom , Not the sad power of shedding human blood . You all have learned this truth my countrymen ; A man may be a tyrant , and not free ; You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have power and not be free ; And thus it is with you , ye men of France . Ye are the tyrants who enslave each-other Robespierre , Robespierre We wait no longer ,  --  bind her to the scaffold , And bid the guillotine be expeditious . Too long already is her death delayed . Citizens crowd round the guilotine as Charlotte is bound to the scaffold and obstruct the view ; the axe of the guillotine falls . One citizen is heard speaking to another . First Citizen . First Citizen And couldst thou see her die ,  --  and did she keep That noble bearing , even to the last ? Second Citizen . Second Citizen Ay , to the last  --  for even her severed head , Upheld for the assembled rabble 's gaze , Looked that calm scorn upon her enemies .
