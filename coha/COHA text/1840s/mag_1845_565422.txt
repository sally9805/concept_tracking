txt ASAHEL NETTLETON was a genuine " New Englander , " as well in thought , feeling and manners , as in the place of his birth , education , and usual residence . He was born of reputable parents , April 21 , 1783 , at North Killingworth in Connecticut . Here he spent his early years with his father in the laborious business of agriculture . In his eighteenth year , at a time of special religious interest in his native town and extensively in New England , he became deeply anxious for his soul . After about tea months of mental trouble , in which his convictions of sin were at times very clear and pungent , he found relief . Now , in the words of his biographer , " A sweet peace pervaded his soul . The objects which had given him so much distress , he now contemplated with delight . Lie did not , however , for several days suppose that he had experienced a change of heart ; but finding at length that his views and feelings accorded with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he * Memoir of the Life and Character of Rev.

Pp. 372. began to think it possible that he might have passed from death unto life . The more he examined himself , the more evidence he found that a great change had been wrought in his views and feelings respecting divine things . Old things had passed away-all things had become new . The character of God now appeared lovely . The Savior was exceedingly precious ; and the doctrines of grace , toward which he had felt such bitter opposition , he contemplated with delight . He had now no doubt of their truth . He saw clearly , that if there was any good thing in him towards the Lord God of Israel , it was not the result of any efforts of his own , but of the sovereign and distinguishing grace of God . He was ready to say with the Apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am. " pp. 24 , 25 . In this extraordinary way did God begin to prepare the retired young farmer for the extraordinary work before him . This preliminary was soon followed by " most intense desires to be instrumental in the salvation of his fellow men . While laboring in the field he would often say to himself , if I might be the means of saving one soul , I should prefer it to all the riches and honors of the world . " His purpose was // soon formed to exchange the plough for the pulpit . At the age of twenty two he entered Yale College , and in 1809 took his first degree . The following statements by his classmate and room-mate , the Rev. Jonathan Lee , show the steady and bright flame of his piety , with the increasing strength of his ruling passion , love to souls , amid the unfavorable influences of college life . " On becoming more particularly acquainted with Nettleton , I perceived that he was one who feared God . Ever kind , courteous , conscientious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore the most powerful testimony to my conscience , to the genuineness of his religious principles . He evidently had a taste for the spiritual themes and exercises pertaining to religion , so predominant and controlling , as to leave small space for mere literary ambition . His best loved place was the chapel , listening with devout solemnity to the prayers and preaching of of the venerated Dwight . His best loved book was the Bible . His best loved day was the Sabbath  --  and his best loved friends were those who knew the joys and sorrows of a pious heart . He was intimate with only a few select companions of congenial spirit , and who felt most interested in communing together upon the topics of doctrinal and experimental religion . " p. 34. - " In the winter of 1807-8 , a revival of religion began in New Haven and in Yale College . The first subjects of it among the students were in the Freshman class . Nettleton was no indifferent spectator , but among the first to discover indications of special religious impressions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , contrary to what I had before witnessed of intimacy between the upper and lower classes , often did I see him with one or two heart-burdened youth of the youngest class , walking arm in arm in the college yard , before evening prayers , conversing upon the great interests of the soul . I observed , that so soon as he became acquainted with a student under religious impressions , his company and counsel were sought and greatly prized ; and it was manifest , that his conversation with such individuals , his silent and unostentatious labors in connection with his Christian brethren in their meeting for prayer and conference , held a very prominent and important place in that memorable and joyful season . His feelings were more deeply interested in the whole progress of the revival , and it seemed almost to absorb his mind by day and by night . " p. 38 . At the close of his academic course , he had a strong desire to be a missionary to the heathen . Even before this time he had made the acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over benighted pagans were quite similar . Yet neither of these ardent youth became a foreign missionary . In the wise ordering of Providence , however , each of them probably did far more for poor heathen , than if the first desire of his heart had received gratification ; one , by an extensive agency in founding societies of most kindly bearing on some of the darkest places of the earth  --  the other , as an honored instrument in the conversion of many , who afterward went in person to preach the gospel in pagan lands , and of thousands more whose hearts the Lord inclined to become efficient and liberal helpers in the missionary cause . Mr. Nettleton received license to preach the gospel from the West Association of Nexv Haven County , May 28 , 1811 . In the summer of 1817 , he was ordained as an evangelist . The reasons why he never became a missionary are thus given in the Memoir . " Soon after he began to preach , his labors were // crowned with signal success . Wherever he went , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren in the ministry , witnessing the success of his labors , were of opinion that he ought at least to delay the execution of his purpose to leave the country . In deference to their opinion he consented to delay ; and as his labors became increasingly successful , his brethren became more and more convinced , that God had called him to labor as an evangelist at home . Still , he never entirely abandoned the idea of a foreign mission until his health failed in 1822. " p. 49 . During these first ten or eleven years of his public life , while the Great Master gave him health , and enabled him to labor abundantly and with unparalleled success , Mr. Nettleton performed the great and peculiar work for which God raised him up , and on account of which he became so extensively known and endeared to Christ 's ministers and churches . Nearly all this time , the man of God was seen hastening with the ardor and energy of a husbandman in harvest , from one white field to another , and the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with tears amid the most heart-stirring scenes . To himself , it was almost literally one long , powerful , delightful revival . Near the beginning of this golden period of his life , our eyes first saw him . It was at an evening meeting in a small destitute parish of Connecticut , and he was plainly in his element , surrounded by a breathless throng who had come flocking from the highways and hedges to the gospel feast . Nor is the fact without interest that his reverend biographer , then in his youth , sat by the side of young Mr. Nettleton that evening , and was the preacher . Soon after this , we had several interviews with him in his next field of labor , and we found his whole soul in the great work of his life . He seemed alike dead to the common topics of the day , and the unholy ambition of some young candidates for the ministry . Instead of seeking great things for himself , his worthier ambition was to seek good things  --  the best things for deathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savior*s crown . While some other candidates of popular talents seemed to be making inquiry for wealthy and intelligent parishes , he appeared to prefer places beneath their notice - not anxious for ordinary compensation , but ready to enter the most humble field of usefulness , and there spend all his strength in winning souls to Christ . Our position ever afterwards , was favorable to mark his conspicuous movements through the period now under review . The Memoir specifies forty revivals in which he labored successfully within the ten years prior to his prostrating sickness in 1822 ; and we distinctly remember the fame of him at the time in most of these places . Some of the larger churches received not less than two hundred members each , as the fruits of these seasons of refreshing . We should like to give some specimens from the volume , of the solemn and thrilling scenes in these revivals ; but our prescribed limits will only admit of a few extracts from the testimonials of sundry pastors of churches , where he labored in this main work of his lik . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the greater part of several months , he was indefatigable , laboring in season and out of season , to the full extent of his health and strength . " " In an important sense brother Nettleton 's talent was one . In the cultivation and improvement of that one , he was unwearied . By the concentration of study always directed to the most useful point , which is practical piety , that talent had risen to the first order . Hence the depth and // exactness of his knowledge in true experience , and the things which are essential to salvation . Hence too , the quickness of discernment relative to the specific instruction , and the manner of imparting instruction , that every mind needed with which he came in contact . He had a quick and precise perception of the sources whence objectors and cavilers draw their difficulties . In replies , showing the true answer and the only remedy , he was ready and appropriate , generally silencing and not rarely convincing . In the whole of his intercourse he was exemplary . " pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a revival in Wethersfleld , 1821 , first published in the Religious Intelligencer , remarks : " Previous to the revival , our church consisted of about two hundred and sixty members . As its fruits , precisely two hundred have been added . Of this addition , seventy-nine are heads of families . " " Peculiar are our obligations to the Rev. Asahel Nettleton , who was much with us , and whose labors were blessed eminently and extensively . To us and the churches in this region he has been of as great use as were to ancient Israel their chariots and horsemen . Though in this work there has been the strongest coincidence between the means used and the success , and between the prayerfulness of Christians , and the conviction and conversion of sinners , yet God has displayed his glorious sovereignty in the work which is emphatically l9Iis . To Him all the glory is due . To Him let it be given now and evermere. " pp. 135 -7 . In a letter of recent date from Dr. Tenney is the following language : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1818 , while he was laboring in a revival in Rocky Hill , a parish in Wethersfleld . My acquaintance became intimate during nearly three months of his labors with me in a great revival , in the winter of 1820 - 21 . I have felt that he was a remarkable man-fitted to draw forth the often repeated saying of a venerable president of a distinguished college , respecting him- ' a wonderfully wise man ! " ' " The word of God in his hands was indeed a sharp two-edged sword that pierced , and was a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart . His preaching was emphatically in demonstration of the spirit and with power . ' There was not the least attempt at display . He was always hidden behind his subject , and he would present that so clearly , and naturally , and justly , and strikingly , that his hearers were filled with the light of truth , rather than admiration of the man . He addressed the reason and consciences of men in a way not to excite their animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach , and search , and move the deepest sensibilities of their souls . This did , under him , as it does in every case , secure the utmost stillness , the most fixed and almost breathless attention , and the most profound solemnity . His was the eloquence of thought , of truth , of living , burning truth from the living God . In such eloquence I have never known him surpassed-seldom equalled . The Spirit of God was in it . His preaching seemed in perfect harmony with the word of God , and with the influences of the Spirit upon the minds of men . " pp. 357-60 . Dr. Porter of Farmington , in the appendix of Dr. Sprague 's Lectures on Revivals , thus speaks of Dr. Nettleton . " To his labors , so far as human instrumentality was directly concerned , the progress of the revival must be chiefly ascribed . The topics on which he principally dwelt , were the unchangeable obligations of the divine law , the deceitful and entirely depraved character of the natoral heart , the free indiscriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate repentance , the variety of those ex // cuses to which awakened sinners are accustomed to resort , and the manner , guilt and danger of slighting , resisting , and opposing the operations of the Holy Spirit . His addresses were not formal discussions , first of one and then of another of these subjects , but a free declaration of the truth of God concerning them all , just as they lie in the course of spiritual experience , and would best subserve the particular end which he was laboring at the time to gain . They were too plain to be misunderstood , too fervent to be unheeded , and too searching and convincing to be treated with indifference . On the first Sabbath in June , a hundred and fifteen were added to the church , and at subsequent periods , a hundred and twenty besides . Of these a few have since been rejected , and others have declined from their first love . But I have not perceived that a greater proportion of . hopeful conversions in this revival , than in others previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died , and many have removed from our immediate connection , but those who remain , now constitute the chief strength of the church . " pp. 143 , 4 . The following statement is from the Rev. Dr. Shepard of Lenox . " His labors consisted principally in preaching the word . He sometimes appointed what was called an inquiry meeting . At such meetings , he manifested an almost instinctive discernment of character ; and his remarks , in accordance with it , were sometimes attended with a powerful effect . In his preaching , his humility was apparent to all . He was , I believe , eminently a man of prayer . That he entered the pulpit or the inquiry meeting directly from the mount of communion ' with his Maker , no one would readily doubt , who was witness of the holy calm , the indescribable , the almost unearthly solemnity and earnestness of manner . His countenance was peculi4rly expressive , his demeanor was dignified , and his voice was at times very melodious . The joy with which his heart seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , in giving his life a ransom for sinners , marked his preaching , and imparted an unction and uncommoa energy to his eloquence . When he spake of the glories of heaven , it was almost as if he had been there himself . When he made his appeals to the sinner , he made them with a directness which placed before him , as in a mirror , his utterly lost state It seemed at times as if he was about to uncover the bottomless pit , and to invite the ungodly to come and listen to the groans of the damned ; and then , drinking deeply of the spirit of his Master , when he wept over Jerusalem , to urge them to flee from the wrath to come , with an expression of countenance which it is not in my power to describe . Many who came with a skeptical and caviling spirit to hear him , had their attention arrested at once to the great truths communicated by him , and , at the close of the meeting , were anxiously inquiring what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching , seemed , in short , to be a plain and clear illustration of all the distinguishing doctrines of the gospel , by a humble , devout , praying , unpretending man , constrained to his duty by the love of Christ . " The influence of the revival upon the interests of the church in this and other places , was very happy , and is plainly to be seen , especially in regard to the faith once delivered to the saints , up to this time . The tendency of Dr. N. 's preaching , and indeed of all his labors , here and elsewhere , as far as I have learned in regard to them , has been to establish the churches in the faith and order of the gospel , and to strengthen the hands of every clergyman with whom he labored . I never heard that any minister , among whose people Dr. N. labored , ever // expressed any regret that he had been with them . On the contrary , when I at any time meet with a minister , who formerly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival , he never fails to express great respect for him , and unfeigned gratitude , for the benefit derived to him and his people from his labors. " pp. 154-156 . For a more full and formal delineation of Dr. Nettleton 's character and manner of labor in revivals of religion , we refer our readers to the able statement of his biographer , and of President Humphrey , at the close of the Memoir . Such was the ten years ' work of Dr. Nettleton  --  the great work of his life , to which the Memoir , as well as our review , has given a marked prominence . Nor was it strange , if this greatest promoter of pure and powerful revivals , in his time , should have imitators , and if some of these , with less of the spirit of Christ , less of sound doctrine , less discernment of character , less practical wisdom , less , in fact , of every qualification , should soon begin to exhibit spurious religious excitements , and , to some extent , should even bring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ought not to render doubtful the purity of those revivals which were connected with Mr. Nettleton 's high mission , of which purity the volume before us furnishes more than sufficient evidence of the best kind-intelligent witnesses at the time , and careful observers in subsequent years of the happy and durable fruit . As the appearance of counterfeit coin may well make a community more cautious to distinguish the spurious from the genuine , so false revivals should carefully be distinguished from the true . In both cases , however , the existence of a spurious article , so far from discrediting the genuine , is good evidence of its reality and its sterling worth . By the aid of a good " detector , " the real difference between the two is often made as clear and broad , as was the contrast in early time between the true miracles by the hand of Moses , and the juggleries of the magicians ; and one valuable service to the church of Christ , which Mr. Nettleton , after the failure of his health , was for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rare skill and large experience in separating the precious from the vile in revivals . While we most fully believe the inspired declaration , " Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , saith the Lord of hosts , " we at the same time acknowledge the action of a great mind in Mr. Nettleton . His new and successful course , which for the time filled with amazement , and struck with a sort of religious awe the highest order of human intellect , was emphatically his own . God plainly raised him up to go before the ministers and churches of his native state , and of other states , in the promotion of genuine revivals . While pastors of the first rank were accustomed to sit as learners before him , and to notice carefully his wisdom in winning souls to Christ , with a view to shape their own course the better , the humble originator of this extensively approved method called no man master . In recollection of these well known facts , we were pleased to find , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my estimation , Dr. Nettleton was a great man-not great merely as he was good , but great in the common meaning of the term . " How far his superior ability , as developed in the main work of his life , might have been owing to the solemn consecration of his " whole spirit , and soul , and body , " to this one business ; how far his greatness , as the admitted master-spirit among human agents through a wide circle , as to the best mode of addressing sleepy Christians and dead sinners , was the result of this concentration // of his entire being on this one subject , day and night , it is not easy to say . If , in the original structure of his mind , in his very deep and thorough convictions of sin , in his favorite studies , his marked religious character , and his strong desire for the salvation of souls , amounting to a holy passion , we see God making him great for the work of his high mission in particular , the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise Providence , no man is great at all points , and for all purposes . While the subject of this Memoir was yet in his prime , his work of promoting revivals was suddenly brought in a measure to a close . The manner we find stated in pp. 165 , 6 . " For ten or eleven years , Mr. Nettleton had been laboring almost constantly in revivals of religion . During this time , he preached , generally , three sermons on the Sabbath , and several during the week , besides spending much time in visiting from house to house , and conversing with individuals on the concerns of their souls . How he could endure such accumulated labors , was a mystery to many . " " It appears , from a memorandum among his papers , that on Oct. 5th , 1822 , he visited a sick person in South Wilbraham , before breakfast , and took the typhus fever . He was sick at Bolton , at the house of his friend Mr. Parmele . He was brought so low , that his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . His mind was composed and peaceful . As he afterwards remarked , the scenes of the revivals , in which he had been engaged , and the countenances of the young converts , were constantly before him ; and the hymns and tunes in which he had been greatly interested , were running in his mind , particularly these words : Soon shall I pass the gloomy vale , Soon all my mortal powers must fail , 0 may my last expiring breath His loving kindness sing in death . ' " From this sickness he never entirely recovered . He was never after able to engage in arduous labor . " Yet his Lord and Master did not , at once , take him to himself . While other bright suns , as Brainerd , Mills , Martyn and Cornelius , have often been removed from human view to a higher sphere , at their mid-day of earthly usefulness or before , our merciful Father spared Dr. Nettleton for many years , and allowed his friends still to enjoy the sight of him , as a luminary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vnrious density , down to the natural evening of human life . During this period of diminished activity , the Memoir presents him-as the compiler of the Village Hymns , a work of extensive circulation and usefulness , especially in revivals and in social meetings ,  --  as a defender of gospel truth and of pure revivals of religion ,  --  as attended still by the powerful influences of the same divine spirit , while using his feeble strength , in Bethlem and Enfield , Conn. ; in Brooklyn and Jamaica , on Long Island ; in Taunton and Monson , Mass. ; in Albany , Durham and Lexington Heights , N. Y. ; in Newark , N. J. ; in Virginia and North Carolina . In the following extracts from one or two of his letters , in 1826 , to the pastor of the church in Taunton , we see his master-passion still strongtoo strong for his enfeebled frame . The first is dated at Jamaica , L. I. " My head , heart and hands are so full , and health so feeble , that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since you left us , we have been much employed in listening to the relation of Christian experience by the young converts , preparatory to a public profession of religion .

On the 2d of July , we held our communion , // and seventy two were added by profession and three by letter . The assembly was full and very solemn . Eighteen were baptized . Since that day , the revival has received a new impulse . Many were awakened , who have since come out joyful . It has often been observed , that it seemed like the judgment day . We have had but few meetings of inquiry , since you left us . At our last , including young converts , there were about one hundred and forty .

" Not a day , or a night has passed , since I parted with you , when those interesting scenes in which we mutually shared , of sorrows and joys that are part , have not been fresh in my mind . Brother , these are scenes never to be forgotten . I was pleased with the solemn stillness , the readiness to act , the apparent interest , and the decision of the members of your church .

" I can not forget that interesting circle which used to meet to consult on the great concerns of the soul . Often have I fancied myself seated in the midst of the same circlesome weeping  --  and some rejoicing in hope . Their countenances are all familiar to my mind . With what feelings of affection and solemnity , have I bowed together with you , my friends , around the throne of grace . While thus employed , often have I thought , shall we ever meet in heaven , around the throne of God and the Lamb ? Shall we be companions forever , in that world of unclouded glory ? The thoughts of such a meeting seem almost too much for such sinners as ourselves . But I know it is possible ; and the vilest of sinners are invited . Some of the chief of sinners will repent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinners as ourselves ? " I can not forget those anxious souls , who are still out of Christ .

Have they gone back to the world ? My dear friends , if you have not already given your hearts to Christ , once more , from this far distant region , would I lift up my voice , and warn you by the worth of your souls to flee from the wrath to come . I entreat you not to rest , till you find rest in Christ . I have not forgotten you . I shall still remember you at the throne of grace , till the joyful tidings of your repentance have reached my ears ; or the sorrowful tidings that you have dropped the subject of religion , and gone back to the world .
