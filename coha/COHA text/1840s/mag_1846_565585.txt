txt Tua fall of man acted with disastrous influence on the harmonies of our world . The blow that struck Adam , struck his race , and created as many separate , independent and discordant centres , as there have been minds affected by it . Men by nature have ever been proud and selfish . Each one has acted for himself . Or , if men have acted together // for the accomplishment of some common end , the same poison has diffused itself through all their associated action , and made it as odious as that of each separate individual . The great object of Christianity is to correct this evil  --  to destroy this disjunctive , repellent force  --  to bring together the separated fragments of a once glorious humanity . It begins to act , therefore , on the minds of men , with influences that draw all men toward one center . It appeals to human nature by considerations which tend directly to break the disturbing force in human action . It proclaims that God bath made of one blood all the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It thus takes away from each one and from every association of men , alt possible claim to preeminence above others on the score of descent . For it makes all members of one family , and binds them to the acts and affections which grow out of that common and intimate relationship . Christianity also spreads over all men the wing of healing mercy . It presents a Savior , who has tasted death for every man , and who commands his disciples to go into all the world and to preach the gospel to every creature . It gathers our race , therefore , all around one and the same Savior , and makes his cross the source of blessings to all . There is here , therefore , another mighty influence , which , as it acts upon meh , draws them near each other , making them one in the provisions of mercy , one in the agonies of Calvary , and one in that mightiest attraction which love exerts upon the moral elements of our nature . Christianity goes still further . When men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life . They are no more strangers and foreigners , hut fellow citizens with the saints , and of the household of God ; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and proph ets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone , in whom all the building , fitly framed together , groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord ; and are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit . They are thus brought into a new and higher relation to each other and to him , which relation , as it makes them all one body in Christ , makes them , every one , members one of another . If it be said that , with the exception of a brief period at the commencement of the new economy , Christianity has never visibly bound its disciples into such a unity , we admit it . The brotherhood of believers has been , and still continues to be , broken into many different sects-all jealous of each other ; some assuming a superiority to others-claiming for themselves peculiar gifts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salvation beyond the lines which encircle their own communion . But we well know that these divisions have long been contemplated with pain by many of the people of God , and that many are now looking for the remedy . The aspect of the times is leading evangelical Christians to think and act on the subject of union . Common dangers , infinitely more to be dreaded than any and all the points about which they differ , and common duties , resulting from a common cause and from the presence of a common foe , are calling for the strengthening influence of a common fellowship , in which to meet those dangers , and to perform these duties . The mighty efforts , which are now made to arrest the progress of truth , and to bring back again the darkness that had once begun to flee away , are leading the friends of spiritual religion to higher ground on the subject of union than they have hitherto been disposed to take . They are beginning to think more of // the things which make them one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that for the sake of what they hold in common , they ought to act towards each other on the principle , that , though many , they are yet one body in Christ , and every one members one of another . However this movement may result , one thing is quite certainthe movement is in accordance with the teaching of God 's word . The Bible views all believers as members of one body , and branches of one vine . Hence Christ in his intercessory prayer before he suffered , said , " Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also , who shall believe on me through their word , that they all may be one , as thou Father art in me and I in thee-that they also may be one in us , that the world may believe that thou hast sent me . " The Scriptures insist upon this oneness of believers . It is to this one body that men are added by receiving Christ ; for this body Christ gave himself , and to this he is head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is one body and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling-one Lord , one faith , one baptism ; one God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all . For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one spirit . And , therefore , we being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another . This was the idea of the church which the early Christians entertained , and which was so cherished by them . The oneness of believers was to them a delightful fact . In this they saw the image of the heavenly-the tie of a ceaseless brotherhood ; and in their love of the brethren , they possessed the evidence of their own new creation . Seldom did their feelings flow out in a higher , or more impressive eloquence , than when dilating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this light of the world diffusing itself , like the rays of the sun , over all the earth , and yet forming but one effulgence . They had no higher joy than to see the chain of this brotherhood connecting heart with heart , through the whole company of the redeemed , uniting all in one circle of affection , and sparkling , wherever touched , with the same fire of heavenly feeling . But in what sense are believers one body ? Or in view of what facts , is this oneness of the church asserted in the Bible ? This point is of vital importance in any attempt to arrive at a successful result in this great question of moral dynamics . For the effort to calculate the revolution of the comet without taking into the account the disturbing forces through which it has to pass will not more certainly fail , than will any plan of union which does not recognize in the Christian all the liberties and influences recognized by the Bible . All arbitrary action here is out of the question . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attempt " to bind the influences of Pleiades , to loose the bands of Orion , or guide Arcturus with his sons , " and to force his comet through its orbit without its doing an " obedient reverence " to the forces ibrough which it passes , than it is in any man , or body of men , to forms and to seek to carry into effect , a plan of Christian union , which attempts to bind influences that the Bible allows to operate , or to loose bands that it has bound , or to guide the conduct of the believer , where it leaves him free . The Bible-the M*c1manique c6leste of the moral world , teaches us the existence of liberties which any plan of union must respect  --  the action of influences with which it can never intermeddle-rights which it must not for one moment question . The plan , // whatever it be , must recognize , and not attempt to disturb , these forces . It must bend to them . In view of what facts then , does the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this question will help to develope the form which any plan for Christian union must assume , if it is to be successful . We say then , that this oneness of believers is not asserted on the ground that they have all the same gifts and graces . For there is no such uniformity among them . The body hath many members , but all the members have not the same office . There is a diversity of gifts . Some have one talent-some twosome five and others ten ; yet they are all one . Nor is it on the ground , that they all use the same forms and ceremonies of worship . For this has never been the fact . Even in the days of the apostles , the church . es of Christ differed from each other in this respect . There were usages in Palestine , which were not practised in the churches gathered in heathen lands . There were leaves growing on Jewish branches , which were not found on the branches of the wild olive tree , when they were grafted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root and fatness of the olive tree . And notwithstanding this difference , they were one . Nor is this unity of the church asserted on the ground , that believers all think and feel alike on all matters of faith and practice . For this has never been true . Diversity of opinion on many points has always existed . A perfect agreement in every particular we regard as impossible , in the nature of the human mind . Nor is it , in our present state of existence , desirable . We should as soon think of digging down every elevation , and filling up every valley , and reducing the surface of the whole earth to one uniform , dead level , in order to promote the health of men , as to think of advancing the interests and happiness of men by bringing the whole action of the moral world into the bondage of an unbroken uniformity of thought and feeling on the subject of religion . The thing is impossible . The unanimity of which Rome boasts , as existing in her domain , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the weight of crushing despotism . Beneath that surface there are fires that are burning fiercely , and threatening to upheave the level surface , and scatter it , at no distant day , into a thousand fragme nts . The Bible nowhere insists upon these things , as essential to the oneness of believers . It speaks of unity where there is diversity . It makes of one blood all the bodies of men ; and yet those same bodies differ from each other in form , figure , expression , color , temperament , motion , and in many other particulars . So does it speak of believers . It makes them one in their character and destiny ; or in other words , they are one by reason of the work of God wrought in them , and in the object or end for which that work is carried forward and completed . This is the mighty nexus in the kingdom of Christ , among all the redeemed . We may expand this idea a little . Believers are all new creatures in Christ Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a new and peculiar relation to him and to each other . By faith , they are in Christ , as branches are in the vine . In this particular they differ from all the unregenerate ; and in this they are all perfectly alike ; for they have all put on the new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness . Being created anew , they are also the abode of the heavenly spirit . For they are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit . They are the temple of God , and the spirit of God dwelleth in them . This fact also makes them different // from the rest of mankind , and like each other . The same Spirit that actuates one influences all , sanctifies them , works in them to will and to do , and seals them unto the day of redemption . They are alike moreover , in the substantial reception of the gospel . However they may differ on minor points , they agree in all that is essential to salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Israel of God ; and there must be in the nature of the case . For here they are led by the spirit-are all taught of Godare led to believe to the saving of the soul . Here therefore , there is harmony . Heart meets heart-hope blends with hope . We add , that in the end for which this work of God in them is begun-carried on and completed , believers are alike . For in each case that end is for the praise of his glory , according to the eterial purpose , which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord . The cross , therefore , is the centre of every circumference , the point of mightiest attraction , where all the elements in the kingdom of God come together , and are arranged in one glorious constellation to the praise of the Redeemer . The work of the new creation then , in man , is the broad and deep foundation of the Christian union spoken of in the Bible . here is true unity . Diversity of forms  --  and variety of sentiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are not of it . It will be seen at once , therefore , that the disturbing forces all lie out of and beyond the basis of the union recognized in the Bible . The collision of believers is in things external to the work of the spirit in them . This is the place of difference-this the " nimborum patria , " to which chafed and noisy disputants are wont to repair for the materials of war , and where imprisoned energies are easily let loose , and scenes follow in the moral world not unlike that in the natural , so graphically described by , the Roman poet " Venti , velut agmine facto , qua data porta , ruunt , et terras turbine perfian t . Incubuere man , totumque a sedibus irnis , Una Eurusque Notusque mont creberque procellis . * ? fricus , et vastos volvunt ad litora fluctus . Yes ; it is here that Christians have usually been most sensitive to the action of each other , and have been armed at every point , and like Milton 's angels , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and been deeply injured . For if they had exercised the proper charity towards each other in the matters of difference , if the importance of those matters had been rightly appreciated , and if they had remained unarmed , they might and would have evaded the collision " by quick contraction or remove . " It is here , therefore , that the work of reform must begin . It is into this region of wintry storms that a warmer sunshine must be poured , to warm the bosom of the earth and to cover it with a different vegetation . The eye must be fixed on the image of Christ in the soul  --  and the ear listen to the inward harmonies , until the heart is entranced by them , and a voice goes forth from the church over all these agitations , like that heard on the lake of Tiberias , saying , Peace , be still . We must each bring a branch from the soil of our common olive domain , and cast it into the waters of Marab , and thus heal them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work to be done is plain . But how it is to be accomplished , is the inquiry . The oneness of believers exists ; but the great work is , to bring them to see and feel this , and to act accordingly towards each other . It is evident at once , that no species of force can ever effect this end . Human legislation , the decisions of councils , the edicts of kings and emperors , have all been tried , and have signally failed . They // have been little better than ropes of sand ; nay , they have been much worse . And such measures must ever have the same result . The human mind can not be thus bound . Differences can not be thus harmonized . " Compulsion is not concord ; a forced concession is not faith ; " and , without faith , even in these things , it is impossible to please God . Norcan any thing be accomplished in this matter , by attempts to unite the various systems of evangelical opinion all in one . Tbis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have set themselves to accomplish it with much zeal , and with the hope of success . They have taken up the several creeds ; have examined " the points of difThrence ; have defined , explained , and distinguished ; and have attempted to show that after all there is no diversity , but that Lutherans and Calvinists and Arminians mean the same thing , though they have an unfortunate way of expressing their mutual harmony ;  --  or if there really be some discrepancy , it is so slight that they might well consent to split the difference . On this system Richard Baxter tried to reconcile the advocates of a limited and a universal atonement , and Archbishop Usher sought to unite the opposing forms of Episcopacy and Presbytery . But the usual upshot of these eclectic efforts , is a new division ; and the via media proves a via tertia . The difference is made , but the division is not healed . " It never can be . Truth is in the way . Calvinism and Arminianism , in their distinctive points , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more unlike-indeed , are uncompromising opposites . Still more visionary is the idea of some , that this union is to be effected by the coming of all Christians into the circle of their own denomination . They feel that they certainly are right ; they know that believers should be one ; and there fore they are confident that all others must come to them . And that confidence they feel , not because their own denomination is more liberal and catholic , or because the arms of its charity include a wider circle of Christian brotherhood , but on the ground , professedly , that it is less liberal , and more exclusive than the rest ! The expectation is cherished on the principle , that the less ought to absorb the greater ! that the charity , which overleaps the barriers of form and ceremony , and which embraces all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in the bonds of a common discipleship , ought to be contracted into that narrowness of spirit , which knows of no churchmembership out of and beyond its own enclosure ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only a return to that , which has ever crushed the free spirit of piety , and made the church a hissing and a by-word among the nations of the earth . Nor is there any thing to be hoped for from attempts to enlarge the basis of union , by multiplying articles of agreement , as far as possible , and then excluding or prohibiting all action on the remaining points of difference . This is Utopian . Christians can never be brought together on any such basis as this . As much as they may desire the end in question , they never will consent , for the sake df it , to yield one iota of what they believe to be truth  --  or to pause in any aggressive movement , against what they regard as error . They can not put themselves in such a relation to these things , without injury to the conscience . In view of what the basis includes , they may meet in harmony ; but if , for the sake of the same , they can not allow of liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of union , and becomes the beginning of a terrible despotism . If we are to have union , therefore , we must have it without any compromise ; without the concealment of // any particle of our faith , and without the slightest infringement on the freedom of thought and speech on any and every subject . We must hold fast to our system of truth , and to our right to inculcate the same . For , while there are many points in that system of faith , which are not essential to salvation , those points may still be necessary to the influence , on our minds , of those truths which are essential . No one , therefore , can surrender this freedom , without consequent degradation . " The feather that adorns the bird , supports his flight . " If you strip him of his plumage , you leave him indeed * bird , but you fix him to the earth . Such a basis of union has no tendency even , to bring Christians together in the bonds of affection . In the exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such movement . It is in reality , the basis of a new party or denomination in the church , whose territory is bounded by certain lines , within which no one can come , except under restrictions ; where no one can speak , unless he speaks according to orders ; and where even the works of the holy and illustrious dead can not be allowed to circulate until they have been clipped and trimmed with the shears of a Lilliputian criticism , or have been forced to say what their authors never thought of . The action , therefore , of this new party , formed on such a basis , may be more intolerant than that of any evangelical sect in Christendom . It seems not to have occurred to those who have advocated such a basis of union , that its tendency is to introduce intolerance ; and that by its proscription of free thought and utterance on all points beyond the lines which limit its territory , it cultivates in those who come upon that basis , and who demand such sacrifices of freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should as soon think of securing the peace of the world by reducing the popula tion of the globe to one uniform stature , through the Procrustean process , as to dream of working out the freedom of Christendom from the enslavement of those illiberalities which now separate the people of God , by drawing such lines and exercising such dominion within them . It can not be done . The whole tendency is the other way , and leads to a deeper bondage . The imprisoned spirit of Christian union can not gain its freedom , and give expression to its tone , in any of these ways . We are glad to find , therefore , that the Evangelical Alliance , recently formed in England , seems to abandon every such plan of union , and asks no one to surrender his conscientious convictions , or to cease from denominational effort , or from attempts at ecclesiastical development . This is right , and is a great advance upon any previous step . We hail it as " the commencement of the church 's manhood . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things of the past on this subject , and to act a manly part . Whatever may be the result of this effort , and we confess we are not without many fears as to what the result will be , yet one thin.g is certain , the movement is in the right direction . Success can come from no other quarter . If Christians will not go upon ground higher than that which has hitherto been occupied by them , then the walls which now separate them , must continue to hide them from each other . What is wanted is enlargement of vision , together with a corresponding and consequent expansion of fraternal feeling . But these results can only be obtained from the summits of a higher elevation in Christian action . flow then is this elevation to be gained ? and how are these other results to be secured ? We shall endeavor to answer . In the first place , no denomination of Christians must assume to be the church . If believers are one body , // then no single denomination has any exclusive right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , and is peculiar to none . Each is a part , but is only a part of the church . It is but a branch among many others , of one and the same vine . For any one to claim this name for itself alone , is to exclude all the rest , and is , therefore , to rend the body of Christ . The assertion of this claim has ever disturbed the harmony of the church . Its whole tendency is to separation and contention . It naturally produces spiritual pride , and , consequently , the most exclusive and bitter sectarianism in the sect which makes an attempt so arrogant . The moment any denomination assumes that it is the church and not a portion of the church , the lines of separation are drawn . In the judgment of the men who make such a claim for their sect , all other believers are out of the church ; and the whole exercise of Christian confidence and affection on their part is confined within the limits of their own communion . If there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as aliens from the commonwealth of Israel ; and if they be not without God in the world , they are left to his " uncovenanted mercies . " This is one of the evil spirits , which have been , and still are , at work in the church , and which must be exorcised . It breaks up all Christian brotherhood , and infuses into the soul the poison of a mean illiberality . As well might one of the states of of this union claim to be the nation , and exclude the others . Not a whit more absurd would it be in one child of a numerous family to pretend to be the child , and deny to all the others the relation of children to the same parent . Just as well might the foot assume to be the body , and on that ground refuse to recognize the other members as component parts of the same . The next thing to be done , is for each denomination to act in reference to its forms of worship , its manner of administering the ordinances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preftrence , and not exclusion . This would open the way at once for intercommunion . It would leave each portion of the church in the free and full enjoyment of all its peculiarities in these things . It would allow to each church its forms and rites and ceremonies , with all the attachment which the most decided preference can produce , and would permit each class of Christians to engage heartily , and with all commendable zeal , in efforts to extend the boundaries of their ecclesiastical domain . It would allow any kind of denominational action , except the passing of the Rubicon with forces arrayed under the banner of a j*ts divinum claim , demanding every thing for themselves , and granting nothing to others . And why not act on this principle of preference ? The whole field of difkrence lies beyond the lines which include what is essential to salvation . It does not even border upon the oneness of the church , as defined by the faith and practice which Christ has made necessary for admission into his kingdom . Why not ascend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe its pure air ? Christians must come up to this , if they are to see the bless . edness of Christian brotherhood . For so long as any sect or denomination , claims an exclusive divine authority for its own peculiarities , and refuses to admit the * ) propriety , or validity , of those which belong to others , the union of all is hopeless . Such exclusiveness crushes the spirit of Christian fellowship . That spirit is stifled by such a claim , and can not even speak . But is it right , that these outward differences should be allowed to interfere with the mutual attraction which Christians feel in view of the work of God within them , and of their common reception of what is essential to salvation ? // Should those who come around the cross of Christ , and who cling to it as their only hope , allow outward influences so far to detach them from that center of light and love and salvation , as to be sundered from each other in any of the interchanges of a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is light about us on this subject . Ten thousand stars glitter in the firmament above us , and one star differeth from another star in glory ; still they all shine in harmofly , and help to form one firmament , declaring the glory of God , and showing his handiwork . So it should be in the church . Each denomination-a constellation by itself-ought to shine in the beauty of its holiness , and blend its light in harmony with that of other clustered stars ; and thus help to fill the whole hemisphere with the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . There is still another elevation upon which Christians must l ) la1*t themselves . They must consent to meet on ground which they hold in common ; and , for the sake of what they alike possess , and which makes them one body in Christ , allow perfect freedom of thought , feeling and action in reference to points of doctrine on which they differ . This position has been greatly overlooked in its bearing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence , and to that enlargement of mind necessary for any advancement in such union . It is indeed a great mistake , to suppose that the spirit of Christian brotherhood is not disturbed by any denial of this freedom , or by any unkind feelings growing out of its exercise . We might as well imagine that the heart of the ocean is not affected at all by the storms which madden its surface . It is even a greater mistake to think that we can expand the minds of men , and call into existence a noble catholicism , by circumscribing their freedom of thought and of utterance ; by tying them down to the littleness of some sectarian object ; or by placing them on some common platform where they are bound with fetters , and where sectarian jealousy sits commissioned to do its work . Never can such a process expand the mind  --  or elevate the affections of the heart , or blend the sympathies of Christendom together . As well might we imagine that the bird of morning will rise faster , or soar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonies above , by allowing it , in part only , to spread its wings . It is time that this delusion was understood . We speak thus strongly , because we feel strongly . The tendency of restriction here , we believe , is adverse to union . It is producing , as facts plainly show , in those who demand compromise and silence on points not deemed essential to salvation , the feelings of a sectarian , and overbearing arrogance ; while those who yield to this demand , and who allow themselves to be divested of their freedom in Christ , sink tamely into bondage . Its whole tendency , therefore , is ngainst any intelligent , large-hearted union of the people of God . Hence , we can not consent to such restrictions on the freedom of utterance , as a condition of union ; nor are we willing to come under bonds to sail always with reefed sails over life 's ocean . The moral commerce of Christendom ought , we believe , to be free from any such odious exaction ; and the vessels freighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvass wide  --  and to catch every breath they can , of the Spirit which moves upon the deep waters of truth . " There is nothing , " as it has well been remarked , " which a good man values more than his religious belief ' and his freedom in the same . " There are some things , which it may cost him an effort to abandon , // and some things which it may cost him little . He may be called on to part with his money , and may he able to tell it down , and hand it over to a new possessor , without a moment 's pang , or the most secret murmur . He may be constrained to part with some object of endeared affection , and may feel that in its vanishing his better and happier self has gone away ; but when he feels that the Lord bath taken it , he feels also a mournful blessedness , a sublime self-abdication , in letting it go . And he may be forced to surrender some memorial of distant affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrings it from his grasp , he almost feels that there is a sacrilege in not Jetting life go with it . But in all these cases , at the worst , they are the natural feelings which are wounded ; the conscience remains unhurt . It is far otherwise , bowever , when a man is called upon to abandon a truth , which his Savior has taught him to believe , or a duty which his Savior has taught him to practise . The mattbr may be minute , but if he believes it to be his Savior 's will , he can not sacrifice it without a dismal sense of delinquency . " He can not , therefore , surrender one iota of his creed , nor his freedom of utterance in reference to it , without detriment to himself . Nor ought he to be called on to do either . There is no reason , no necessity for it . All the points of difference among evangelical Christians , lie , as we have seen , beyond what is essential to salvation . It is upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of differences not inconsistent with a common experience of the power of the Gospel in renewing the soul , the spirit of exclusiveness has reared the martial and frowning barriers which make those who have one Savior , one hope and one experience of the grace of God , strangers and foreigners to each other . these barriers must be dismantled and demolished ; and , that it may be so , the hateful exclusiveness that has reared them must be banished from the church . And this must be done , by allowing the most perfect freedom of utterance in reference to all points of difference . If this course is pursued , it will soon end the strife of centuries , and bring Christians together , and cultivate in each heart an enlarged and apostolic brotherly kindness towards all that are of the household of faith . On the broad and solid foundation , which makes them one body in Christ , believers may meet in happy , blessed union ; and their differences may be lost , as the separate colors are lost when blended in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may act separately , according to their distinctive vocations , earnestly and heartily , in the several divisions into which varieties of taste and of intellectual development and culture have thrown them ; and if they act under the impulse of this heavenly feeling , they will keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace ; and in the inculcation of their peculiar views , these differences , like the colors displayed and harmonized in the celestial bow which spans the earth as the storm retires , will be so spread out and arranged , as to form once more in the moral heavens a bow of promise  --  the remembrancer of God 's own covenant of peace  --  the sign to the world that the storm is past , and that the Sun of Righteousness , with healing in his wings , is breaking forth again to enlighten and to save .

But the question has been made , on the part of those who have discussed it heretofore-it has been made from the first setting up of the demand  --  a question of morals and of religion . Principles not necessarily involved in the question , have been involved in the discussion of it ; and the demand for the abolition of capital punishment has been set up and urged on grounds , which , if universally accepted and acted upon , would demoralize the universe . It is not unimportant or uninstructive , to observe the extent to which this demand has spread itself in society , and from how many various quarters it now proceeds . Nearly all the political newspapers of one party , and a large portion of the newspapers of the other party , concur in lending themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as opposing it . Thus all those whose impulses and habits put them in opposition to // law , and who not unnaturally feel somewhat as if it were for their interest that the punishments of crime should be abolished , are agitated with the movement . The haunters of dramshops  --  the frequenters of brothels-those whose oaths shock you as you pass along the streetare generally in favor of the abolition of capital punishment . Those who profess to believe that there is no retribution for wickedness in the world to come , and that the murderer dying with all a murderer 's malice in his heart , dies only to enter into perfect bliss ,  --  cry out against the dreadfulness of the death penalty , and demand that the murderer shall have a kinder and less vindictive treatment . Philanthropic projectors of a reconstructed moral universe , who hold that society is all wrong , and that everything existing must be overturned to prepare the way for a imw era of social equality ,  --  utter the same outcry . Those whose religion is mere sentimentalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little else than a low conception of the poetry *f siature ,  --  and who conceive of God chiefly as a great artist that Ias made the world for its beauty , - give in their adhesion . With these various classes are joined " devout men out of every nation tinder heaven " - reli* , iou s , Ch.istian men of almost every evangelical name , whose sensibilities naturally shudder at so dreadful a form of jus tice ; who have become so much interested in what are called " peace principles , " that they doubt , at least , whether the magistrate ought to hear the sword at all ; o who think that inasmuch as the bloody laws of fora er ages have been so greatly mitigated , and inasmuch as impris* onment and hard labor are found to answer the purposes of pu nishnaent in so many cases in which death was once the penalty , the progress of reformation may be fairly and safely consummated by abolishing capital punishment altogether . There must he some influences , widely propagated through society , by which so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some principles and habits of thought , common in various degrees to all these classes ; or classes so various would not have been brought to think and speak so much alike on such a question . If it be asked in what respect all these classes think and speak alike , we may answer by saying , they all use substantially the same arguments , and to a great extent they speak in essentially the same spirit . Not to refer at present to the arguments they use , it will be enough to indicate one mode of speaking , common to them all , which answers instead of argument , and which shows that they all regard the subject , in some respects at least , from the same point of view . How often do we hear from these men-from the best of them and the most candid , as well as from the worst of them  --  the phrase " judicial murder , " or some similar language , as the appropriate description of capital punishment inflicted on a murderer . That there is no argument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every man knows that suph language is simply taking the whole thing for granted . Murder is an unlawful putting to death . Murder is a putting to death with malicious intention . That the putting a convicted murderer to death , in the execution of the law , is malicious or unlawful , is the point to he proved . If all putting to death is murder , why not say that God 's putting men to death is murder ? If this use of language is argument , then God himself when he smote Ananias and Sapphira was a murderer . If alIputting men to death is murder , then God , when he poured down fire on the cities of the plain , much more when he swept the earth with a flood , was a wholesale // murderer . Nay , " death hath passed upon all men for that all have sinned , " - why not say then , wherever you see death taking place , in the providence of God , that there is one of God 's murders ? This use of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men fall so readily who join in the demand for the abolition of capital punishment , shows that it may be worth our while to inquire whether there are not some moral principles widely diffused , and unthinkingly , perhaps unconsciously , received , out of which the demand  --  or at least the peculiar animus of the demand - has arisen . The intrinsic dreadfulness of the punishment , is not enough to explain the phenomenon ; for all punishment is dreadful , and if there is to be any justice in it , it must needs be dreadful in some proportion to the dreadfulness of the crime for which it is inflicted . A little attention will suffice to show that other causes have operated to stimulate and propagate the demand : Foremost among these causes , is an excessive sympathy with the criminal . We say an excessive sympathy , for there is a natural and reasonable sympathy even towards those who suffer the just penalty of their crimes . Who can look in through the grated door upon the felon in his cell-who can see him laboring day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the penitentiary-and not be sorry for him ? We ought to be sorry for him - sorry for the hard necessity by which he suffers . But if , in our sympathy , we forget the crime for which that suffering is inflicted-if , in our sympathy , we cry out against the wickedness of society in putting the poor fellow into prison and treating him so badly-our sympathy has grown excessive , unreasonable , morbid . Such sympathy masters the sense of justice . It would open the prison doors , and let the felons loose upon society . Much has been done of late , in various ways , to promote sympathy with criminals . No small part of the popular fictitious literature of the present century , and especially of the last five and twenty years , has had that tendency . To the mind whose imagination has been stimulated and whose habits of thought and feeling have been formed by familiarity with this Newgate literature  --  to the sensibilities that have been trained by studying these fictitious representations of the morbid anatomy of human nature-to the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charms of poetry and the colors of romance over robbery and murder and piracy-any man who has committed a particularly atrocious crime , becomes immediately an object of special sympathy . So many of the heroes of modern fiction are criminals of this precise grade , that to a mind imbued with the spirit of that literature every criminal seems like a hero , or is at least a most picturesque and interesting character . Seen through such a medium , the criminal is perhaps a man of genius , whose genius has unfortunately taken a wrong direction ; or perhaps a man of high and strong impulses , whose virtues not being happily balanced and harmonized , bring him into trouble and conflict . What a pity that this genius , this man of impulse , this man made for adventure , whose originality and strength of character have led him to break over the restraints of law - this man to whom liberty is so necessary and confinement so irksome-must be shut up in a cell , and fed with the coarse fare of the pris on . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for killing his friend , can not be endured . We may not excuse ourselves from the duty of saying , in this connection , that of the much that has been said and done , of late years with the best of motives , about kindness // to Criminals , not a little seems to have had some tendency towards a morbid sympathy with criminals . Far be it from us to depreciate in the least the labors of such persons as Elizabeth Fry in England , or of those who have labored in any thing of the same spirit on this side of the Atlantic . The work of show . ing kindness to the wicked , and of attempting to infuse the quickening and healing influences of truth into their minds while they are suffering the penalties of crime , is a truly heroic work of the true Christian spirit . And in all respects , the criminal-whatever his crime or his pun . ishment-should be treated with kindness by all concerned , not excepting those who represent the law and administer its justice . The pros . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the jailer-all , from first to last - should treat the criminal with personal kindness . Cruelty , the spirit which rejoices in suffering because it is suffering-cruelty , even in the less fiend-like form of recklessness in regard to suffering inflicted-has nothing to do with justice . The majesty of justice is the more resplendent , and awes the soul to a profounder reverence , when justice is seen in its legitimate alliance with kindness to the criminal . The more the criminal sees of the sentiment of kindness towards himself in those by whom justice is pronounced and administered , the more likely will he be to feel the dreadful necessity of justice . But if we mistake not , there is many a Quixotic philanthropist of these days , whose plans and preachments are the manifestation , and operate for the diffusion-not of that kindness toward the guilty , which when associated with punishment imparts to justice a more venerable majesty  --  but rather of that morbid sympathy which thinks more of the criminal than of his critne , which cares more for the felon than for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer 's remorseful terrors and his looking for of judgement , than for the blood that crieth from the ground against him . Another source of the demand , so widely uttered , for the abolition of capital punishment ,  --  and one which stands in a close connection with that morbid sympathy which we have just described ,  --  is the wide spread habit of referring sin and crime , not to the immediate actor of the sin and the perpetrator of the crime , but to temptation , as an efficient cause . An illustration of this habit , and of the extent to which it has acquired an ascendency over the opinions and reasonings of our countrymen-an illustration which is perhaps more obvious than any other-may be found in the history , tendencies , and present position , of what is called the temperance reformation . The time was , when drunkenness was deemed a dreadful sin , a base and beastly crime on the part of the drunkard , against his own nature and against all his duties to his family , to society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same opinion still . In those days we had laws to punish a man for being drunk-laws which are not yet entirely effaced from our statute books . In those days a man was held responsible not only for the fact of having made himself drunk , but for all the natural consequences of his having done so ; and if an intoxicated man committed theft , arson or murder , the intoxication did not excuse him , but was deemed to be an aggravation rather than a mitigation of his guilt . But for these few years past , a great effort has been in progress , to advance the welfare of society by suppressingall commerce in the means of intoxication . XVe do not here deny or question the legitimacy of the movement . But we ask whether , in connection with this movement , there has not arisen in all quarters a habit // of overlooking the guilt of the drunk . ard , and exaggerating the guilt of the traffic and the trafficker . rrhe drunkard , we have been often told , is less to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the liquorseller , we are sometimes told , is less to blame than his temperance customers , who , if they would combine to lay him under an interdict , might compel him to come into their views ; and in the same style of reasoning those customers are less to blame than the town that permits that vender to have a license ; and the town is less to blame than the State which might prohibit the traffic absolutely ;  --  and why not go straight through with this kind of logic , and say that the State is after all less to blame than God , who might have excluded the principle of fermentation from the universe , and thus have saved us all this trouble ? No ! no ! the drunkard himself , first of all and chief of all , bears the guilt of his own drunkenness . The temptations that surrounded him , he ought to have resisted ; and had he resisted them , he would have gained a blessed victory , but with his destiny in his own hands , he wickedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning which would present that base , guilty , selfdegraded wretch to our sympathies as a poor victim , overcome and borne away by the resistless power of circumstances and temptations , is of the nature of those evil communications that corrupt good morals . This habit of speaking and reasoning as if the wrong doer were a mere victim of circumstances and irresistible external influences , and as if the world must be swept clean of all temptations to vice before men can be fairly blamed for their vices , - is a habit which can not but set the mind against the administration of all Justice . Another illustration of this habit may be seen in the way in which duellists apologize for themselves , and their friends apologize for them , in those parts of the country where duelling is practised . Two men , having become involved in some personal controversy , meet each other , armed with deadly weapons , for a deadly conflict . The ground is deliberately measured , the weapons are prepared ,  --  they fight , each aiming at the other 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be blamed for this , " says the survivor . " I believe that duelling is wrong ,  --  my judgment and conscience are against it  --  but public opinion in my circle brands with dishonor the man who does not fight when the code of honor requires it . It was my misfortune to be placed in a position in which if I had not fought , I should have been excluded from what I call good society . " And the plea is admitted there , and admitted to some extent by multitudes of careless minds even here . But what is the plea ? Just this , " I was under a strong temptation , and I had not the courage to resist it . I was afraid of public opinion-afraid to do wha* my judgment and conscience pro . nounced to be right . You must not blame me , you must blame the public opinion which tempted me . " An usticated moral sense cries out upon such folly . The man is a murderer ; he has taken the life of his fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks us not to blame him because he was tempted . The cowardly murderer with blood upon his hands , and with the curse of Cain upon his head , asks us to transfer all blame from him to the public opinion which he tells us he was afraid to defy . And his request is granted by thousands and tens of thousands , because the habit of referring crime to temptation as its cause , controls so extensively the moral judgment of the community . Take another sort of illustration . The police make an unexpected descent upon a house of ill fame ; and great discoveries are made . Young // men are found there who have had advantages of education-nay , perhaps husbands and fathers are found there . Now for a storm of public indignation ! and upon whom , think you , will it light ? Upon the men who were found resorting to that den for the indulgence of their beastly passions ? Oh no-do not mention them , poor fellows , victims of temptation ; do not expose them to reproach ; do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might embarrass their intercourse with refined and elegant society : but come down in wrath and power upon the outcast negro who keeps there a troop and rendezvous of harlots for the convenience of his customers . Try the law upon himput him into prison-he is the tempter . And so the moral sense of the community is to be satisfied . But is this right ? Most palpably it is all wrong . In the view of an unperverted conscience , the guilt of the ignorant outcast keeper of that den , is as nothing compared with the guilt of his customers . The young man of ordinary common sense , and of an ordinary New England education , who puts his foot into such a place , should take all the blame to himself ; arid for all that may come to him , and all that he may come to , in consequence of that first step , let him curse not the keeper of the brothel , nor the community , but his own wicked will . Yet the ordinary judgment of the public apologizes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no temptation he could not have committed the crime . So if there had been no such thing as temptation in the universe , there had been no possibility of vice . But could there , in such a universe , have been the possibility of any virtue worthy of the name ? God 's wisdom has made the world on a very different plan from that which regards temptation as the only evil . The world as God has made it , and the nature of man as God has made it , are such that no man can shine in the glory and beauty of true goodness but by achieving the victory over temptation . And while the judge of the living and the dead holds the tempter responsible for his sin in tempting , he does not fail to hold the tempted sinner responsible for yielding to the temptation . It is not strange then that the people , having fallen into the habit of referring crime to temptation as the efficient cause , should begin to apply that principle to individual cases of murder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under some manifest ternptation , he must be dealt with very tenderly ; and , on the other hand , if the temptation was not strong enough to account for the crime , then certainly the crime is an unaccountable occurrence , and the murderer who acted so unaccountably must be considered as insane . And in this place we venture to say , that the gross inequalities in the administration of justice under our laws , can not but have the effect of weakening the sense of justice in the public mind . Lawyers , no doubt , will be startled by the audacity of the suggestion ; but we will make our meaning plain by illustrations . A poor man with no friends  --  or perhaps a black man who having been born and trained under patriarchal institutions , can not be expected to have a very delicate moral sense in regard to questions of meum and tuum-is guilty of robbing a hen-roost . Let him be detected ; let there be any reasonable testimony against him ; and beyond all doubt he will suffer whatever penalty the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer finds that the mischief has been done by a party of " young gentlemen , " who have added to the larceny some annoy* ing insult . Suppose he identifies the offenders , and has evidence // against them which would be suffici*nt to condemn an untaught and ragged offender . Will those young men be imprisoned in the county jail " for a term not more than thirty days , " according to the statute in such cases made and provided ? Who thinks of such a thing ? What would have been a crime in a poor and hungry boy , or in a negro newly escaped from slavery , is in these young gentlemen only a frolic . Let the windows of a citizen 's dwelling be broken in the night season , by some low vagabond , and the offender if detected will surely feel the utmost rigor of the law . But let a student at midnight , hurl deadly missiles through the windows into a freshman 's bedroom , or let him at the same hour commit the same violence upon the apartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilance of the college *uthorities he may be detected and expelled , who will think of punishing him " by imprisonment in a common jail not exceeding thirty days ? " What ? put a gentleman 's son into prison for a boyish frolic True , the brickbat or the paving stone might have killed a fellowstudent ; but what of that ? Does not the young man wear broadcloth ; and think you that the law was made for such as he ? The constitution of Connecticut says , and a similar provision exists in every other state , " All prisoners shall before conviction be bailable , by sufficient sureties , except for capital offenses where the proof is evident or the presumption great ; " and by another clause it is provided that " excessive bail shall not be required . " These rules , as frequently , not to say ordinarily , administered , establish a system of pecuniary commutation for all crimes not capital . What is the meaning of the words sufficient and excessive ? Obviously a higher amount than is necessary to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for trial , is excessive . Less than what is necessary for that purpose is not sufficient . But how many crimes are adjusted in our courts simply by the forfeiture of the bail bonds ? Is it too much to say that generally in cases of that class , bail is required and given , not at all with the idea that the prisoner is to stand trial , or if tried will abide the issue , but with a full expectation on all sides that the criminal will escape by the payment of the bond ? In other words , the bail , instead of affording any security that the prisoner will come to trial and if guilty will be punished , is itself the punishment , and , apart from the disgrace attendant upon a virtual confession of ' guilt , is the only punishment . We have not said these things at random . Some of our readers , we doubt not , have already recollected a painful case of which some account was given in a former number of this volumeA* A party of half-drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the night season " -a crime for which a gang of ragged boys would have been punished " by imprisonment in a common jail not exceeding thirty days . " A college officer happening to pass at the moment , pursued them as they fled , seized one of them , and was drawing him toward the light , when he was thrice struck with a deadly weapon . Once the dagger 's point was turned aside , and glanced upon his ribs ; but twice it pierced his thigh-once almost within a hair 's breadth of the femoral artery . By the activity and skill of the college police , the window-breakers were identified , and were visited with appropriate college punishments ; but the state took no more notice of their crime than if it had been committed in Kamschatka . He who had stabbed the tutor , retreated // quietly to his father 's house in Philadelphia , and was with due solernnities expelled from college . That was to have been the last of it . Who thought of sending on a requisition and seizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trial ? Who dreamed of such a thing as sending him to Wetherstield for a ten years term of service ? Phe wounded man was reported to be doing well ; and it was expected that soon he would be able to resume his duties . But suddenly a fever-whether caused by the wounds , or previously latent in the constitution of the patient , is uncertain-supervened ; and he died . rfllen suddenly justice seemed to awake . A requisition from the Governor was hastily procured ; the offender was arrested and brought to the scene of his crime . See now the application of the great law maxim , that circumstances alter cases . If two sailors on one of the wharves had fallen into a scuffle , and if one of them had stabbed the other with the knife which a sailor ordinarily carries about his person , there is no room for doubt that the offender would have been immediately cast into prison to await his trial , and upon trial would have been condemned to the State prison , perhaps for life , certainly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The writer of these remarks was present at a small party of friends , the evening preceding Mr. D 's death . A physician who had just come from the bed side of Mr. D : communicated the astounding intelligence that he would not survive that night . In the conversation which ensued , we stated the supposed case of two sailors , as we have now stated it to our rea ( lers . " Yes , " replied one or the most eminent lawyers in New Haven , " if that ease had occurred instead of this , the sailor would have been tried and sentenced at the court which rose yesterday , and to-day he would have gone to Wetherstield . " We can not refrain from adding , that within four days that lawyer was retained as of counsel for the criminal ; - though he took no active part in the defense . however , the offender was not a sailor , but a gentleman , the son of one of the wealthiest men in Philadelphia . We need not repeat the particulars , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that by the strenuous exertions of the most able counsel ,  --  mainly directed , of course , to the one point of reducing the bail to the lowest possible amount ,  --  the culprit , without having seen for a moment the inside of a prison , was enabled to escape with no other punishment than that his father was obliged to pay a sum of money , which was no more to h*rn than the exaction of a quarter of a dollar would be to a poor man who lives by the labor of his hands or by the labor of his braini* Such are the inequalities in the administration of what is called justice under our laws . The evil that we speak of is not peculiar to any one state . It characterizes the whole country . We do seriously doubt whether there is a country in Christendom , where money alone will go farther in securing exemption from the legitimate penalties of crime , than it will in this country . And what must be the effect of this upon the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of the people ? It is the very essence of justice to be impartial . Justice that lays its hand heavily upon the poor , and lightly upon the rich , is not justice , but a lie offensive alike to God , and to whatever of moral sense remains in man . What better can be expected where justice is displaced by a sham so hideous , than that the ideas of justice , of punishment , and of all things correlate to these , will * We refer to this case , not because there is any thing peculiar in it , but because it is recent and striking , and therefore good for the purpose of illustration . For the evil of which this is an instance , we are not bound to suggest a remedy . We only call attention to the existence of the evil . // gradually be obscured in the minds of men ; that the people generally , instead of looking to the law with reverence , and rejoicing in the protection of its awful egis , will look upon it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when inflicted , will seem more and more like a misfortune lighting on the poor sufferer ; that the feeling of loyalty toward the commonwealth , and of righteous indignation against crime , will die out and be forgotten ; and that hatred against the administration of the law will rankle in the popular mind , till at last , upon the excitement of some fatal occasion , the law itself , in the outbreak of popular fury , shall be like chaff before the whirlwind ? But without pursuing the illustration of this point any farther , we proceed to say that another cause of the extent and the peculiar tone of the demand for the abolition of capital punishment , may be found in the prevailing ignorance of the nature and ends of punishment . We should not have supposed it possible , a priori , that intelligent men , born and educated under a government of law , could be so sophisticated out of their common sense , as to reason on this subject in the way in which we have sometimes heard or seen them reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of the criminal . Punishment , it is said again , is designed to prevent the criminal from repeating his crime . If a criminal is reformed , it is often said ,  --  and the writer of this article heard a judge say it , in a great assembly a few months ago ,  --  he has a right to go free , and the State has no right to punish him , by another year or another day of imprisonment. * When such notions are propagated far and wide among the people , and are received by unthinking minds as axioms , of course a demand for the abolition of capital punishment is the most natural thing in the world . But how unthihking must be the mind that falls into such an error . Punishment , in the administration of justice by civil government , nothing but a reformatory process ! Who does not know better ? Punishment is the sanction of law . It is the expression of the moral sense of the state against the crime . It is the only possible way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of those interests which the law protects , and which if not protected by the law must perish . It is denounced when the law is enacted ,  --  and as it is denounced , so it is to be inflicted when ihe law is broken-in terrorern , that all men may beware , and by seeing the dreadfulness of punishment may be made to know the dreadfulness of crime . The law is indeed benevolent , if it is just ,  --  for the sublimest manifestation of benevolence cisely , from memory , after the lapse of fifteen months . But in respect to the doctrine , we can hardly be mistaken . The writer was tempted to speak out on the spot , arid to ask the learned and honorable gentleman on what ground lie , sitting as a judge , could reconcile to his own conscience the act of sentencing a criminal to the Sing Sing prison for any definite teyin , when for aught he could tell , the prisoner might he reformed before the expiration of that term , or on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreformed ; or how he , holding such a theory of punishment , could consent to have any thing to do with the administration of penal laws , which , if his theory is not ahsu rd , are framed upon a principle utterly unrighteous . What right has the Sttite of New York to say that the man whip commits one crime shall serve in the penitentiary five years , and that the nian who commits another crime shall serve ten years , arid that the man who commits a rrirne stilt more atrocious , shall serve for all his life , if its only right over the criminal is to send him to the penitentiary fur the purpose of reforming him , and to keep him there till his reformation is accomplished ? This doctrine was held forth hy Judge Edmonds of New York , at the anniversary of the Prison Discipline Society in Boston , May , 1845 . Of course , the words used by his Honor can not be given pre // is justice ; but its benevolence looks to interests , in comparison with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance ,  --  the welfare of the state and of all whom it embosoms ,  --  the welfare not of the present only , but of the vast future , . - the welfare of " millions yet to be . " And therefore the law , instead of settling a pension on the criminal and making him easy in his circumstances-instead of reading him a homily , or a chapter out of Paley 's Moral Philosophy-instead of dooming him to a course of Fourierism under the tuition of the philosophical editors of the Tribune and the Evening Post-inflicts upon him PUNISHMENT . It seizes him with an arm of force ; it binds him with fetters ; it shuts him up in shameful and miserable captivity ; it feeds him with the bread of affliction and the water of affliction ; it holds the scourge over him and drives him to a worse than servile toil ; or , on the same principle if need be , it sends his guilty spirit to the bar of God , and casts his carcass into an ignominious grave ; - and all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Another source of the outcry against the infliction of death as the punishment of murder , may be found in the false theories which are almost universally held in respect to the origin of government and of the rights of society over the individual . The theory of a social compact as the origin of society and of all the rights of society to defend itself against crime , leads naturally to a denial of the right of society to inflict the punishment of death in any case whatever . As by that theory the right of the state to punish , is derived only from the supposed consent of the individual members of the state agreeing to be governed by the laws and to be punished for their crimes , the question arises immediately whether the individual can be considered as having given his consent to be put to death , and whether his consent , if he had given it ever so distinctly , can be considered as investing the state with a right to put him to death . The individual , it is said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore the social compact in which the state originated , can not involve his concession of such a right to the state . In the same way it might be argued , the individual in that solitary condition which precedes the formation of the social compact , has no right to inflict upon himself the confinement , the privations , the hardships , the stripes , the manifold wretchedness , of the penitentiary ; and therefore the state , having no rights over him save what were once his rights over himself , and were conceded by him for a consideration at the institution of the social compact , has no right to inflict such misery upon him . The logic would be conclusive , if it were not for the known falsehood of the theory which it assumes as true . Surely it is time for men of common sense to have done with the folly , with which political writers and shallow debaters have so long amused themselves . Away with the nonsense of attempting to deduce great truths , all truths concerning the duty or the safety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie ! But after all , it seems to us that false religious views , more or less distinctly received , are probably the most efficient cause of the demand we are considering . False theories of human nature and of man 's relations to his maker , false theories of God 's government and of human accountability , can not but have a disastrous tendency in respect to legislation and the whole frame and working of civil government . The denial of man 's responsibility to God , whatever form the denial may assume-nay , the mere absence of a firm belief in God 's moral government over men , as a government by // law and penalty-weakens the idea and the sentiment of justice in the soul . Those theories of religion which resolve it into the de*velopmeat and culture of the tnsthetic faculty , which know nothing of God as ruling men and angels by his law and as sustaining that law by sanctions , and which refuse to recognize in man the dignity of a creature made for responsibility to his creator-those theories which find no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to pity and to our natural sympathy with humiliation and sorrow-those theories which pretend to he Christianity , wherever the LAW OF GOD is not held forth in all its strictness and inflexibility , as the key to all the mysteries of the gospel , and where the gospel is not preached as the highest of all testitimonies to the grandeur of God 's law and the dreadfulness of his justice-plausible as they may seem , graceful , poetic , rational , or philanthropic-have an indirectly demoralizing influence upon society . All this " rosewater philanthropy , " as Carlyle calls it ,  --  the morbid , puling sentimentalism that would undermine with tears , and blow away with sighs , the whole fabric of the moral universe ,  --  is the natural product of those false and feeble theories of religion , theories too feeble to bear up the idea of justice . So on the other hand , those theories of human nature and of human action-phrenologic , or mesmeric , or some hybrid mixture of the two -- which resolve all character into material organization or nervous influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar demoralizing tendency , but more gross and palpable , as becomes their nature . They annihilate all the grounds on which punishment can he denounced or executed as punishment . They make all criminal law , and all judicial proceedings against crime , a mere absurdity . Instead of sending the murderer to the gallows , or even to the penitentiary , they would send him to a hospital ;  - -  extreme cases perhaps to a hospital of incurables . Those who believe that God never punishes , must either deny their own theory , or oppose every thing of the nature of punishment or justice in society . The causes then , if we read them aright , from which proceeds at present this demand for the abolition of capital punishment , are for the most part , if not altogether , such as tend to the abolition of all punishment . The question is , Shall punishment be abolished ? Shall justice cease to be administered as justice against crime ? Shall society be disorganized ? And that this is the question , at bottom , will appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis , the arguments commonly used by those who demand the universal abolition of the punishment of death . To that examination we now proceed . Foremost , then , in every appeal on this subject , we find an argument founded on what is called " the inviolability of human life " - an argument which utterly denies the right of government to take away the life of any criminal whatever . This argument , of course , is fundamental . It is to be carefully distinguished from all other arguments . it is not to be mixed up with considerations of the alleged cruelty or maliciousness of capital punisment , or of its inefficiency as a preventive of crime . It is not to be confounded with any of the arguments which may be derived from experience , or from speculation , in regard to the working of laws which denounce the penalty of death . It is an argument by itself . If it is established it absolutely precludes the necessity of any further inquiry . The argument is not that capital punishment is wrong because it is inexpedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary , or mischievous-but that capital punishment // is wrong , a priori , because it is altogether beyond the range of the legitimate powers of government ; because for government or society to assume a power over the life of any criminal whatever , is a mere usurpation utterly without warrant ,  --  as much so as if government were to assume the right of whipping , torturing , imprisoning , or putting to death the innocent , out of mere caprice . The argument must have all this extent , or plainly it means nothing . As we have attempted to grasp this argument , we have found it somewhat variable in its form and texture . The proposition , that society has no right to inflict death on any criminal whatsoever , seems to be drawn sometimes from one , and sometimes from the other , of two general propositions ,  --  sometimes , perhaps , from a confused and hazy glimmering of both , as if they were one . Sometimes it seems to be assumed that life is absolutely and universally inviolable , so that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life under any circumstances or under any conditions . Sometimes the fundamental proposition seems to be , that government may not do any thing which the individual subject of government has not a right to do-that society may not do any thing which the individual in society may not do , by the law of God , at his own discretion . Let the argument , then , take the first form-let it be grounded on the assumpticin that there can be no right any where , to take life , under any circumstances or conditions ; and it becomes , in effect , the doctrine of the Quakers , and of the modern sect of Non-Resistants ,  --  a doctrine utterly repugnant , not only to the Scriptures , but to the instinctive and inalienable common sense of mankind . The right to take life  --  the right to put a human being to death -- so far from being aa absurdity or an impossibility-is a right which may , at any time , emerge into the hands of any one of our readers . You awake in the dead of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your dwelling . He has come , from the penitentiary , to take a terrible revenge upon you , for having , by your testimony , sent him thither . One of your children has already ceased to scream ; and another , in the agony of a death struggle , is calling you to help him . What may you do in such a case ? What ought you to do if you can ? It is not a merely arbitrary and conventional law-it is not the enactment of merely human legislation -- it is the law of God , the God of nature and the Bible , which gives you the right to resist , and if need be , to kill the murderer . Strike ! in God 's name . Strike ! not tremblingly , but so that there shall be needed no second blow . Strike home ! -  --  the paltry sophistry that bids you stay your hand in such a case , is as wicked as it is contemptible . Nor is this the only conceivable case , in which the right to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directly from the hand of God into the hand of an individual . rake another instance among many . A lone woman is assaulted by a ruffian , with intentions not murderous but wicked as murder . in the struggle , she plucks a weapon from his belt , and thrusts it with well directed aim to his heart . Had she no right to do so ? It is not municipal law merely -- it is common sense-it is instinctive reason -- it is the voice of God 's justice speaking in the soulthat pronounces her innocent of all crime in that taking of life . The inviolability , then , of human life , is not absolute . There are circumstances and conditions , under which a human being ceases to have a right to his own life , and his blood may be shed without guilt . The principle of the absolute inviolability of human life , is a prin // ciple which , of course , condemns war in every conceivable case , not merely offensive war , but all warlike attempts to repel invasion or sup . press insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments and arrangements . In this respect , the old Quakers and the modern Non-Resistants deserve credit , at least for their consistency . Undoubtedly war is always wholesale murder , on one side or the other , and sometimes on both sides . Undoubtedly war , as undertaken and carried on , even by civilized and Christian nations , is ordinarily murder on both sides , so far as the responsibility of diplomatists and statesmen is concerned , or the responsibility of those who rouse and keep up the madness of the people . At the same time , whatever may be true of individuals , the common sense of human nature will assert itself , every where , with sufficient distinctness to prevent every nation , every considerable community , from holding that , in all possible circumstances , war is murder on both sides , and that no resistance may , in any case , be offered to invasion or insurrection . Certainly nothing of this kind is held by the great majority of th6se who demand the abolition of capital punishment , on the ground of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " * If this talk about the inviolability of human life , and the attempt to make it the basis of a demand for the abolition of capital punishment , proceeded only from those who hold the doctrine consistently , carrying it out to its legitimate applications , we should have had little occasion to enter into this particular argument . But the fact is , this doctrine , that government has * This is the tanguage of a circular of the " New York State Society for the aholition of capital punishment , " addressed " to the people of the State of New York , " and signed by Vice Chancellor McCoun , as president , and others , as officers of the Society . intrinsically no right to punish a murderer with death-  --  the doctrine that the death of a murderer upon the gallows , is " an outrage upon justice " -  --  the doctrine , in brief , that human life may never be taken in any circumstances-is put forth by men who believe in war , and in armies and navies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of suppressing mobs and insurrections , that is for the very purpose of shooting or bayonetting their fellow citizens , in case of necessity . How often do we see epauletted editors and such like military chieftains enlisting in this movement , and lending their influence to advance the notion that because life is inviolable , therefore society has no right to protect itself against murder by inflicting death on the murderer . It would be interesting to be informed by some of those *ditors who talk about " judicial murders , " and who tell us of the " outrage upon justice " which is committed when a murderer dies by the sentence of the law , why this principle of " the inviolability of human life as the special gift of God , " ought not to shield the Mexican upon his native soil , as well as the murderer here in New Ent*land . If the execution of the law upon the man who , for a trifling pecuniary consideration , murdered his most intimate friend , as coolly and deliberately as a hunter kills a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon justice , " because life being the special gift of God is inviolable ; it would be instructive to be told whether the lives of the hundreds that were slaughtered at Palo Alto and at Resaca de la Palma , were any less the special gift of God to them , than the life of the murderer was to him-whether the life of any one of the twelve hundred men whose death-groans on those fields of horror , mingled with the roar of our artillery and the shouts of charging squadrons , was less inviolable // than the life of the murderer -- and whether , if the government of the Union had a right to destroy the lives of those twelve hundred men , for no other crime than that of " going with their country , right or wrong , " the government of the state may not , peradventure* have a right to protect its peaceable citizens from assassination , even by making the life of the murderer a sacrifice to justice . Besides all this , if life is absolute . ly inviolable because it is the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state may not pun . ish the murderer with death , it deserves to be considered whether liberty-the free air , the glad sunshine , the luxury of unfettered motion-is not also the special gift of God ; whether liberty is not therefore , by the same argument with life , inviolable ; and whether government has any more right to take the man whom God created free as really as he created him at all , and to shut him up for his life time , or for a year , or even for a day , in the gloomy chilly air of a prison cell , than it has to hang him . We are not saying that it is as great an evil to the murderer to be deprived of liberty as to be deprived of life ; but we do say that life and liberty are both alike the special gift of God , and we inquire how government has the right to deprive him of the one , without having the right , if need be , to deprive him of the other . Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the criminal some of those rights , which , if he were innocent , would be inviolable , and the protection of which , as the rights of innocent men , is the one great end of government ? Briefly then , it is a principle of common sense that life may be forfeited . The doctrine that society has no right to put a criminal to death , whatever the crime or whatever the emergency-is a notion which , when fairly stated , reason instantly repudiates . Life may be taken in some cases . The question is , in what cases ? Or , more particularly , the question is , whether the life of a murderer may be taken by the state for the sake of protecting the lives of innocent men . And this question must be determined by considerations altogether distinct from the supposed abstract and absolute inviolability of life in all possible cases . But the argument against the right of society to protect itself against murder by capital punishment , sometimes shifts itself to another position , and stands upon the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual in society may not do at his own discretion . Thus it is sometimes argued , I have indeed a right to resist the murderer who is slaying my son , and to kill him , if it so fall out , in the fight ; but I have no right to waylay him and kill him , for the sake of making an example of him , after he has done the deed and made his escape ; nor have I a right to kill him at my leisure , for the purposes of justice , after having captured him and bound him hand and foot ; and therefore it is inferred that the state , after having seized the murderer and got him into its power , has no right to take his life . But why have you no right to kill The murderer when you have seized him  --  the murderer of your son ? Why have you no right to make an example of him that others may hear and fear ? Simply for the reason that there is a government over you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . The only instance in which you have a right to protect yourself or your dwelling , by any force whatever , is the instance in which , from the nature of the case , the government has no time to interfere . The moment that emergency is past , your duty // and your right of self-protection by force of arms ceases , and the government steps in between you and the criminal , to protect you and to punish him . You have no right to put that murderer to death in the exercise of your own discretion , for the same reason that you have no right to shut him up for life in a private prison of your own , and no right to inflict any other punishment upon him ; and the plain reason is that the administration of justice in society belongs not to the individual but to the magistrate . But this will be more abundantly explained as we proceed in the discussion . Another argument ordinarily used by those who demand the entire abolition of capital punishment-and the one which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for murder is vindictive , and therefore ought never to be inflicted . The due consideration of this argument will lead us to some inquiries respecting the physiology of human emotions , and the nature of law and government . This argument then , like every other argument from the general to the particular , consists of three parts or steps . First , all vindictive punishments are *vrong . Secondly , the infliction of death as a punishment for murder is vindictive . Thirdly , therefore the infliction of death as a punishment for murder is wrong . Obviously then , it is very important to the strength of the argument , that the word vindictive be well defined , and that the meaning of it in the second step of the argument , be exactly the same as in the first . In one sense , all punishment is vindictive ; that is , in the old spelling of the word , vindicative . Punishment is synonymous with the original and true meaning of vengeance . The nature of punishment is that it vindicates the right . It avenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root , the word venge ance  --  to which the words vindictive avenge , and the like , are relatedsignifies neither more nor less than justice done upon the guilty . That is to say , vengeance is punishment , - vindictive is punitive , and to avenge is to punish . In the highest view , punishment , or the infliction of justice on th' guilty , belongs to God ; it is his prerogative , his function , as the ruler and protector of ' the moral universe . " Vengeance is mine , I will repay , saith the Lord . " In another view , punishment , by God 's appointment , as manifested not in the Scriptures only but in the very constitution of the world , belongs to civil government . It is the prerogative and duty of society-the state-  --  to vindicate the right among its subjects , and to avenge the wrong . Thus Paul says , in language which it is difficult to misunderstand or to contradict , " Do that which is good "  - -  live as a peaceful citizen , obedient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God to thee for good . " He will protect thee in God 's behalf , from the violence of wicked men . " But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid , " " for he is the minister of God , a revenger vindicator to execute wrath punishment upon him that doeth evil . " Let it be observed now , that the vengeance forbidden in the Scriptures is not punishment by competent authority , but private vengeance  --  the vengeance of the individual taking the administ ation of justice into his own passionate hands . In all the precepts bearing on this point , man is contemplated both as a subject of God 's government and therefore under his protection , and also as a member of society and therefore under the protection of civil government . The doctrine is , that justice is to be dispensed , not by individuals under the burning and bewildering sense of injury endured , but by God , and by the magistrate as the minister of God . // This is very strikingly illustrated in the passsage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " Avenge not yourselves ; " the explanation is added , " But rather give place to wrath " - *6re 767r0V is 4-wait , let God 's justice have an opportunity to assert itself ; and the reason is offered , " For it is written , vengeance punishment is mine , 1 will repay , saith the Lord . " And having dwelt a moment on the duty of abstaining from all acts of private vengeance , the Apostle proceeds to treat of civil government as an arrangement which God has instituted for the very purpose of administering justice . We can not stop to expound the passage in detail . It is enough to refer to it here , and to say that the prohibition of revenge , as we call it , that is of all self-avenging , is plainly grounded upon the fact , that the individual is not only the subject of God the judge of all , but is also the subject of the subordinate government which God has appointed in Society for the protection of the obedient by the execution of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God has given not a key merely to lock the door upon the criminal if it can catch him , but " the sword " to smite , and if need be , to kill . In one sense of the word  --  and that its primary and truest sense-God is vindictive ; God as ruler of the moral universe avenges wrong . In the same sense , it is the nature , the very end of all law and government over the state to be vindicative ; it is the duty of the magistrate to avenge the wrongs done to society or to individuals in society . For these reasons-because punishment , or the avenging of wrong is thus provided for-the individual is in the same sense forbidden to attempt the dispensation of vindicative justice in his own behalf . " Avenge not your * I/index , the Latin root of all these words , is by some etymologists referred to the Greek * ( *oi , and is represented as a Latin form of *v5isos A more reasonable etymology however is that which refers it to xis , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law or the right . The sindex employs force . The judex must be also vi'odcx , or his decisions and declarations are of no value . Law without sanction-government without force - justice without terror for evil doersevery such combination of words attempting to disjoin ideas that can not be separated-is an absurdity . The Greek word 6x , ,  --  translated ( Judo 7 , see also 2 Thess. i , 9. ) by the English word vengeance , signifies justice ; hence its derivative **xcuos signifies just . In one instance ( 2 Thess. i , 9. ) it is translated to mean punishment , and in another ( Acts xxv , 15 ) it is translated judgment . In one passage ( Acts xxviii , 4 ) it seems to he used as the proper name of the goddess of justice . Although it can not be referred with certainty to any known root , it seems most probable that in the primeval root it means something like a decision  --  the throwing down of a dispute  --  the settling of a pretension or a wrong . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is 6 ( xa . Some idea of this kind seems to be involved in all the varieties of signification which the word assumes . From 6 ( si , are derived ts*odco , is6 ( su*- , m , and i'x6*xos , all used in the passage above referred to , and frequently in the New Testament . The first signifies to vindicate , to punish , to dispense justice . It is the word which the widow is represented as using in her importunity with the unjustjudge , ( Luke xviii , 3 , 5 , ) " Avenge me of my adversary . " It is the word used by Paul in the passage above referred to , " Avenge not yourselves ; " and in the passage ( 2 Cor. xi , 6 ) where our translators make him speak ofhis " readiness to resenge all disobedience . " It is also used by the authorof the Apocalypse in two instances , ( vi , 10 , and xix , 2 , ) in both which our translation reads " avenge .

" It is also used by Paul where he quotes from the Old Testament , " Vengeance is mine saith the Lord ; " where he // And here we are at a point of view , at which we can easily define another common , though somewhat inaccurate use of the words vengeance and vindictive . There is in human nature , not only what we call the moral sense , the inward and eminently spiritual faculty by which we perceive the qualities of right and wrong in moral character-and not only the sense of justice , which perceives right and moral beauty in the retributions awarded by God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award is seen to be according to God 's willbut also an inferior impulsive feeling which naturally accompanies the sense of justice , and sometimes in an emergency anticipates , or even to some extent supersedes the action of the mind in its higher faculties-a feeling which springs up suddenly whenever wrong is endured or even witnessed , and which with impulses speaks ( 2 Thes. i , 8 ) of the Lord Jesus " revealed in flaming fire , taking ( giving ) vengeance , " &amp;c. , and ( 2 Cor. vii , 11 ) where it signifies the act of vindication performed in excluding an offender fiom the church . It is the word used by Peter ( 1 Pet . ii , 14 ) where he speaks of magistrates as commissioned " for the punishment of evit doers . " The remaining word , *5550* , denoting the dispenser of justice , occurs in the passage above icferred to , ( Rum . xiii , 4 , ) where ourtranslation reads " revenger , '  --  and in one other instance , ( 1 Thes. iv , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the avenger of all such " as defraud , &amp;c . Another word in the passage above quoted , xv which teems to be misunderstood , is 3py* , translated wrath . This word seems to denote , literally , that sentiment or impulse which prompts to the infliction of punishment ; and thus it denotes , in a secondary signification , the punishment to which that impulse prompts . The secondary si nification is Ihr more frequent in the New restament , than the primary . When the Bible speaks of God 's wrath ( 6py does it mean to represent God as actuated by malignatit fhelings ? Is the God of the Bible vindictive , in the had sense ? lf not , then the idea that God 's punishments are inflicted in a spirit , and for aims , which would be malicious in the infliction of penalties by human justice , is a calumny against God . violent in proportion to the occasion , prompts to the instant punishment of the wrong . This instinctive emotion , like every other instinct implanted within us by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good purpose , and being necessary to that purpose it is good . To represent it as being necessarily and altogether sinful , the result of human depravity , is only the shallowest kind of philosophy and the most blundering theology . But this , like all other instincts of the class to which it belongs ,  --  namely the instincts which belong to man in common with inferior animals ,  --  is liable to perversion . Like other animal instincts , it is essentially unthinking and unreasoning ; it dwells in a lower region of our complex nature than that which includes our intellectual and moral powers . It was designed to impel to instantaneous action in circumstances in which reason has no time for deliberation , and beyond this it was designed to be not a guide , but rather a memento ; it was designed not to control the judgment but to be controled by it . Accordingly , when this element of our nature is perverted as other instincts are perverted , by depravity ; when instead of being a memento , an impulse that makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function which does not belong to it ; then of course it tends to excess without limit , it acquires a dreadful ascendancy over the soul , it suppresses the kinder and milder emotions , it swells and towers into a consuming passion . The instinct perverted in this way and exaggerated , is as unlike what it was designed to be , as the passion of the drunkard and the gltitton is unlike the simple healthful appetite for food and drink in the man who governs his appetite instead of being governed by it . The human animal , thus governed by what we may call the vindictive instinct , is degraded to the level of other animals // in whom the like instinct is developed in like strength . Against such degradation the rule " Avenge not yourselves , " guards all who ohey it . He who when wronged meekly commits himself to the protecting justice of his country and his God , is in no danger of being carried away by a storm of passion . But he who undertakes to avenge himself ; and presumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over the vindictive instinct , and is mastered by it . Thus it comes to pass , that where society fails to maintain good government  - -  where there is no righteous magistracy to which the individual can look for protection against violence , and to which he can commit himself with the feeling that in those hands there is justice which will not fail to be executed upon wrong doers -- in a word , where men , for the want of government , are compelled to take the function of government into their hands as individuals , and to be their own avengers -- there the people become continually more barbarous and more ferocious ; the human animal , stimulated and controled by the vindictive instinct , becomes not like the . assaulted bird which loses its gentleness for the moment in the defense of its young , nor like the hunted deer that stands at bay and in the sudden fierceness of despair forgetting its own nature gores the pursuing hunter and tosses the dogs on its broad antlers ,  --   --  but rather like the *volf , like the bloodhound , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of barbarism he grows at last into a cannibal . This gives us that other meaning of the word vindictive . The man who yields himself up to the vindictive instinct , to the impulses of an unreasoning feeling against wrong , to the blind appetite that puts him upon avenging himself , is said to be a vindictive man , and the spirit in which he acts , is said to be a vindic tive spirit . And inasmuch as that spirit , long indulged , becomes one of the most fiendish of all human passions , cruelty , malignity , delighting in the infliction of pain , the word vindictive is often used as synonymous with " malignant , " or " cruel . " We return now to the argument against punishment by death , which has led us into this disquisition . First , all vindictive punishments are wrong . Secondly , the infliction of death as a punishment for murder is vindictive . Thirdly , that punishment is therefore wrong . Every thing depends here on the meaning of the word " vindictive , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two propositions from which the conclusion is derived . If by vindictive punishments , we mean such only as are cruel or malignant , or are inflicted without necessity in the spirit of unreasoning passion , then doubtless all vindictive punishments are wrong . But that the infliction of death upon a murderer is in this sense vindictive-that it is prompted by mere passion , and required by no necessity in reference to the public welfare and the will of God-is not proved , and must not be taken for granted . The attempt to prove the infliction of death upon the murderer vindictive , would prove every punishment for every crime vindictive also . True , such punishment is dreadful . The scaffold , the beam , the cord , the dying speech , the military guard , the hush of the assembled multitude* without , the fatal drop ,  --  all are dreadful ; but how can we have punishment that shall not be dreadful in some proportion to the recognized dreadfulness of the crime to be punished ? What is the punishment for crime-if it is punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endurance ? Look in upon the busy area of the penitentiary -- see those wretched men toiling in silence and in fear . Or walk along its corridors at evening , // and peer into each dark narrow cell . These are the men whom the power appointed of God in the State , has seized for their crimes , and here it holds them in its grasp , measuring out to them the appointed recompense . Is not this dreadful ? Why not calithis vindictive ? Plainly the argument m eat against capital punishment on the ground of its alledged vindictiveness , goes against all punishment whatever ; and the real question mooted by these reformers is no less than the comprehensive one , Shall punishment be abolished ? We confess here that we are not altogether satisfied with the manner in which some writers have attempted to assert , in argument , the restrictive nature of punishment . Messrs . Lewis and Cheever , particularly the former , in their recently published volume , * seem to us to find the grounds or ultimate reason of punishment in the vindictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate , to the transcendental trick of writing nonsense about " the absolute ; " but even he , with all his good sense , shows what company he keeps , by the way in which he discourses of retribution , ( chap . xv , ) as if it were an end in itself , instead of being , what every body knows it is , a means to an end . iRetribution is evil paid back upon the bead of him who doth evil . Why is that evil inflicted ? For its own sake , and for no end beyond the gratification of a blind unreasoning emotion ? Then retribution or purlishment , is essentially and simply malicious ; and punitive justice is to be admired and honored , not for the good which it does , but simply for the suffering which it inflicts . Dr. * An Essay on the ground and reason of punishment , with special reference to the penalty of ( teath ; by Tayter Lewis , Esq . And a Defense of capital punishmeut , by Rev. George B. Cheever , D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the death penalty . New York : Wiley &amp; Putnam , 161 Broadway ,   . Cheever seems to run into this kind of absurdity somewhat against his own nature ; his argument generally keeps clear of it . Dr. Le vis , on the contrary , seems to have something like an inward proclivity toward the absolute . He mixes up with his whole argument , which , but for that fatal mixture , might have had great force , the idea of punishing for the mere sake of punishing , as if that were infinitely higher than the idea of punishing for the sake of the good that is to come of punishment . Such reasoning , it seems to us , betrays the cause which it professes to defend . We agree with Dr. Lewis , entirely , that justice in God 's government is the same sort of thing with justice in the government of the state ; and that punishments inflicted by the state are , and ought to be as really retributive -- as truly vengeance -- as the punishments which God inflicts . But we are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing ; or , what is the same thing , from some unreasoning , vengeful impulse , which satisfies itself with the infliction of evil on its object , and looks no farther . We are far from thinking that God estimates punishment as having any value in itself ; or that he punishes for any other end than the good that is to arise to the universe from the maintenance of his law by its appropriate sanctions . God has made hell , and established its awful ordinances , not for its own sake , as if he had any pleasure at all that the sinner should die etemn Ily , but only for the good that is to come of it . And the philosophy which is so afraid of expediency as to esteem hell a good thing in itself , and holds that the utility of that " place of torment " is an altogether secondary consideration in the estimate of its value ,  - -  needs to be " baptized in the pure fountain of eternal love . " And the devotion , if there is any , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us-is a devotion that finds no sympathy in heaven . XVe know nothing of Dr. Lewis , but from his writings , which have taught us to think of him with much respect for his mind and for his heart . We judge however that his theological sympathies , unlike Dr. Cheever 's , are in harmony with that system of orthodoxy which , representing God 's justice as something altogether distinct from his benevolence and hardly to be reconciled with it , frames its exposition of the atonement , and of all the related doctrines , accordingly . If such is the fact , it is not strange that the theory of punishment is mystified in his hands . But be that as it may , we can not refrain from protesting against the attempt , in any quarter , to set up the gratification of an unreasoning instinct or impulse , as the ultimate ground of punishment . In the prescribing of punishment , and in the infliction of it , the unreasoning impulses by which the soul is prompted and enkindled , and which accompany its movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjection to reason ; and reason , in subjection to the law of universal love , must look steadily and only to the utilities of punishment in respect to the xveil being of mankind . It would be as good philosophy , and as good Christianity too , to maintain that the ulterior ground of eating is the gratification of the appetite for food , and not the gross utility of the process in reference to the support and growth of the body ; as it is to maintein that the ultimate ground of punishment is to be found , not in its utility as the sanction of law , but in the gratification of retributive emotions . But we must return from this digressive criticism . Another nra ment against capital punishment is , that human judgments are fallible ; and that where crime has been punished capitally , there remains no possibility of correcting an erroneous verdict . We admit the full weight of this argument . It is a serious one . It is a reason why death should never be inflicted , except where the necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are liable to err in the investigation of facts . There is , and always must be , a possibility that punishment may light upon the innocent instead of the guilty . And that possibility should always be present to the minds of legislators , courts and juries . But notwithstanding this possibility , there must be laws against crime , and those laws must be applied and executed . The possibility , then , of error in the administration of law , is not the only thing to be considered. , The reasons why crime should be punished -- nay , the reasons why murder should be punished with death , may be such as to outweigh this argument altogether . Crime must be punished , if punished at all , with the full admission of the possibility that human testimony may deceive , and that human judgments may be erroneous . Whatever may be the crime against which legislation is to be directed -- whatever the penalty proposed-the great question is , are there reasons which make this punish in ent necessary , notwithstanding the liability to error which must attend the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less fallible in regard to other crimes than in regard to murder ? - any less likely to inflict other punishments upon the innocent , than to inflict the punishment of death ? Or suppose an innocent man , through the perjury of witnesses or through the error of a jury , is sent to the penitentiary . Perhaps he dies there , arid after he is dead it appears by some new discovery that lie was innocent . Is there any remedy in that case-any taking back of the punishment ? Suppose his imprisonment was for a limited time , and that he spent there the ten most precious years of his // life ; and suppose that after that term has expired , he is enabled to establish his innocence by some new discovered evidence . Is there any help for him in that ease ? The stain is indeed taken from his name . The sense of shame no longer depresses his children . The State can even make him a pecuniary compensation . But who can bring back to him those " golden years " which were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore to those gray locks of his , the gloss they wore on the day when he went in at that gloomy portal ? Who can remove from the souls of his children the inward effect of those years of depression and of shame ? Who , now that they have arrived at maturity , can give them back his care , his help , his guiding and cheering love , of which that erring sentence robhed them in their childhood ? Who can carry down into the grave , to which his broken hearted mother sunk in her sorrow , the tidings that the son for whom she mourned is not a criminal ? No , the very nature of punishment -- if the punishment is to be any thing else than a fine-is such that when the punishment has once been inflicted , it can no more be taken back than the dead can be recalled to life . The sentence can be reversed ; the record can be expunged ; the government may attempt to express its penitence by offering to the sufferer or to his heirs , some pecuniary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an actual punishment other than a fine , the fact of that punishment remains unchangeable as eternity . The plain truth is , that under our laws and judicial arrangements , with all the privileges and favorable presumptions accorded to the prisoner in a capital trial ; with all the appeals , upon all sorts of points , hy which every such case is carried from court to court ; with the final applicatioa to the pardoaing power ; and with all the time which thus intervenes , between the arrest and the trial , and between the sentence and its execution ; the chances that an innocent man will be condemned and punished as a murderer , are reduced far nearer to nothing than they could he if murder were punished with any less penalty than death . Where one innocent man is now found guilty of murder , arid being found guilty suffers death , six innocent men , under the law which the reformers propose , would be consigned for life to the horrors of the penitentiary . If , then , the fallibility of human tribunals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , to say the least , no less a reason why all other penalties should be swept away . So that under this argument , as under the others , the discussion concerns not capital punishment only , but all punishment , and we find the question still before us , shall punishment be abolished ? It is another of the arguments against punishment by death , that when such a peiialty is to be inflicted , the probability of convicting the guilty is diminished . This is undoubtedly true . It is the theory of the law , that in consideration of the greatness of the l ) unishment impending , the prisoner , in a capital trial , shall have advantages for his own defense which are conceded in no other case . And it is true , or ought to be , of punishments generally , that in proportion to the dreadfulness of the punishment denounced , will be the difficulty of securing the conviction of the offender . A justice of the peace , or a judge in the police court of a city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to prison for a few days upon a charge of some paltry crime , very expeditiously . But if the question were whether that prisoner should be sent to the penitentiary for life , or even for ten years , it would take a long time to get through the trial , and it might be very dif // ficult to convict him without a great lion of society ,  --  is too much in the deal more evidence . But shall we face of facts to be admitted for a therefore have no penitentiary ? moment . qwq case , the infliction of death is in the bad sense vindictive In any such case , the argument from the f*dlibil. ity of the tribunal , and the argu. ment from the diminished probability of conviction , may be admitted as valid , and even the argument from the occurrence of the crime notwithstanding the penalty , may be not unworthy of attention . For our own part , we place the whole stress of the argument for death as the punishment of murder , upon the one comprehensive consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prove to us that the abolition of capital punishment in all cases , would not in time draw after it infinite evils ; prove to us that law can be sustained without the sword in the hand of the powers that are to administer it ; prove that the state can continue to be a state , after solemnly abrogating its own right to inflict , upon crimes that strike directly at the existence of society , that extreme penalty which is the ultimate sanction of all law , and without which , as a coercive motive to submission , no other penalty can be inflicted ; prove that any inferior penalty is adequate to express with full distinctness and power the abhorrence with which the state ought to regard a crime so horrible as murder ; prove that it is safe to let the murderer live , safe for the innocent , safe for all the interests which it is the duty of civil government to guard ; and when the proof on these points is clearly made out , we will give our influence to secure the abolition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , we can not but regard the proposed abolition of this ultimate and highest sanction of law , as involving in the end the abolition of all punishment , and the complete disorganization of society . Of course we can not here enter into the details of the argument which is ordinarily derived from the precept given to Noah . That ar . gument is well handled by Dr. Cheever in the work already referred to. * But we may say that in that precept , construe it as you will , we see the announcement of a great principle , which , so long as human nature exists in this world , will probably make the punishment of death for murder , indispensable to the safety of society ,  --  not to say , indispensable to the existence of any government . rfranslate it , if you please , as the simple declaration of a fact , " Whosoever sheddeth man 's blood , by man will his blood be shed . " Tell us then which shall we have , the law , the trial , the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpassioned justice ,  --   --  or the wild vengeance of maddened and maddening instincts ? Which shall we have , the public prosecutor , the judge , the jury , the sherif , and the scaffold ,  --   --  or the g6el ,  --   --  the Arab or Indian blood.avenger ,  --  - hunting down his victim , and slaying him wherever lie can find him ? All the ages of the world , and all the nations of mankind have given their testimony , that the punishment of death for murder , a*the highest crime against society , is necessary . Let it be proved that all ages and all nations have been mistaken . What other punishment is there which will sufficiently express the natural and legitimate horror of man against murder ? What other punishment will satisfy , not the lower animal feeling of resentment and wrath ,  --  - but the higher sense of justice demanding that every crime receive its fit reward , so the innocent may dwell in safety and in peace ? What other punishment can give to the law that guards the sacredness of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equally efficient in terrorem , awing the child , the youth , the man , in every condition , with a fit sense of the dreadfulness of this most dreadful crime ? // In thinking of this question , Is capital punishment necessary in any case ? we have remembered the three latest instances of capital punishment in Connecticut ; and each of these instances has seemed to speak as with the conclusiveness of a demonstration . The earliest of these instances was ten or twelve years ago . rpwo criminals , in the state prison , making an attempt to escape by insurrection , killed one of the keepers . Of the two , one was already under sentence for life , and the other for a term longer than the average duration of life in the prison . What shall be done in such a case ? Imprison ment for life , according to the new theory , is to be the ultimate sanction of law , the highest punishment that human justice can inflict . There remains therefore no further possibility of punishment for those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a score or more of murderers into your prison , and by that act proclaim to them that there is nothing more for them to fear , and they may kill their keepers if they will ; the law has already done its utmost upon them , and can not hurt them . Plainly , ifyouabolish capital punishment entirely , you can not maintain government within the walls of your prison . The life of the warden , and the lives of the guard , are completely -- so far as the law is concerned-in the power of the prisoners . Your law , then , for the abolition of capital punishment , must make an exception against such cases as these . The dreadful gallows must still project its dark shadow into the convict 's cell , to make him feel that law has still another and mo*-e awful sanction ; or your abolition of the death penalty will go far towards abolishing punishment altogether . The next instance was in the county of Middlesex , several years later . In a lonely farm house , the more lonely for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , detained by a slight indisposition while all the other members of the family went to the house of God , was keeping her Sabbath at home . Hearing some noise in another apartment , she went to see what was the matter ; and there stood a man well known to her , who had broken open her husband 's desk and was in the act of rifling it " Hall ! " said she , " what are you doing ? " That man had already been in the state prison for some similar crime . He saw , at a flash , that he must go there again , convicted by the testimony of that woman unless her testimony could be silenced . He determined therefore to kill her . And when her husband , her sons , and her daughters , returned at the Sabbath 's close , they found her bruised and bloody corpse lying cold at her own hearth stone . By various slight indications and fragments of testimony , the murderer was at last identified , and in the end , before conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . He killed the woman simply to destroy her testimony . What shall be done with such cases as this ? if the robber who thus adds murder to his robbery , has nothing to fear in case of his conviction but a few more years in the prison than he would have suffered for the robbery alone ; how soon , how naturally , will every plunderer be a murderer . If this is to be law , let every man who hears a burglar in his house , hide himself in a closet , and shut his eyes and stop his ears , lest he become a witness of the crime . We know that in the particular instance we have described , the criminal pretended to be less afraid of death than of imprisonment ; but we know also that he was as much opposed to capital punishment as Burleigh , or Vice Chancellor McCoun , or Vice President Dallas ; and we know that when his hour came , his affected indifference failed utterly , // and never went a murderer to his end with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the question is , how can murder be adequately punished , when murder is thus added to another crime ? If imprisonment is to be the ultimate sanction of law , all law is weakened , and society abdicates that power of protecting life , without which society must ultimately perish . The latest of these instaces is a strong illustration on another point . The facts are too recent not to be familiar to most of our readers . And yet we must briefly state them that the point on which they bear may be clearly indicated . On a cold winter morning , early in 1845 , a peaceful and respectable young man of the town of New Haven , who was not known to have an enemy in the world , was found murdered , frozen to the ground in his own blood , within a stone 's throw of his father 's dwelling . In a few hours , before the first shock of horrot ' at the murder had passed by , the community was yet more astounded with the discovery , that the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other ends than to keep possession of a borrowed watch , and obtain the amount of a forged note at the settlement of his estate . Yet there was no mob-no demonstration of * ) opular excitement-no manifestation of rage and horror . Why ? Was that comrnunity deficient in sensibility ? Did it estimate the life of a peaceful citizen so lightly as not to feel the dreadfulness of the crime ? No , the absence of tumult and popular rage can be ascribed to nothing else than the conviction on all minds that justice would be done by law . had there been no law adequate to all the purposes of justice , or had there been no confidence in the admtntstration of the law , the horror and wrath of the community would have found vent , and having found ver*t would have kindled into fury . Of course , none can tell distinctly what would have been ; but certainly , in the circumstances supposed , it would not have been strange if the murderer , torn from the feeble grasp of the pusillanimous law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak unadvisedly when we say that , fifteen months afterwards , when that murderer 's petition for a commutation of punishment had just been rejected by the legislature , a gentleman who had been concerned in the management of the case was surprised to learn that , had that petition been granted , the criminal would not improbably have died by the hands of individual vengeance on his way to the penitentiary . This is the point which this last case illustrates . Abolish capital punishment altogether , and by that very act you establish either the primeval barbarous rule of bloodrevenge by the next friend of the murdered , or a horrible Lynch court to take cognizance of crimes peculiarly atrocious . In other words , if the magistrate lays down the sword or bears it in vain -- if the state , as such , abdicates its proper function of maintaining justice by penalties adequate to the protection of life , society itself , by an irresistible tendency , begins to be disorganized. it is to be expected that in some at least of the United States , the *ntire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the experiment will be made of laws wit h no ultimate sanction beyond imprisonment . Such an experiment may continue for a while , it may continue for a whole generation , or even longer . But sooner or later it will be seen that law has lost its majesty ; that the state has lost its hold upon the love , the confidence , and the reverence of the individual citizen ; and that the people have lost their loyalty . ht* will be seen that the idea // of punishment by the administration of law has passed away ; and the vindictive impulses of individuals and of masses , no longer repressed by the majestic presence of protecting and avenging law , will break out in bloody violence . One act of violence will provoke another ; and blood will answer to blood . By the practice of individual vengeance , and by the dreadful dispensations of Lynch court justice , the people will New Haven . be trained more and more to habits of ferocity . Thus the progress of demoralization and barbarism will go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state disorganized , shall restore to law its majesty , by restoring to government its power of protection and of punishment . Happy will it be , if the people shall be wise enough to learn the lesson by a brief experience.
