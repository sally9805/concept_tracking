txt WE heartily rejoice in all movements which promise either the removal or the amelioration of slavery in our country . And as the ultimate power to effect this desirable end is with the citizens of the slave states , and , as discussion or action by northern citizens is useful only as it influences southern citizens to use that power , we especially rejoice to hear of such movements in the slaveholding communities . It is therefore with joy and gratitude , that we have read the pamphlets concerning the religious instruction of the slaves , which we place at the head of this article . We feel bound to speak plainly ( as we did in our last number ) of the sinfulness and atrocities of the system of slavery . But it is not a pleasant work . We greatly prefer to improve any opportunity which facts afford us to record any effort , however slight , among slaveholders , to mitigate the horrible evils of that odious system . The first of these publications is the report for the year 1843-the ninth annual report-of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Liberty County , Georgia . The second of these pub- * 1 .

Jones , missionary of that Association , who deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denying labors to promote , the moral and religious instruction of the slaves , particularly in his native state and county . Possessed of talents and learning which would command positions of distinction in the southern church , he has , from the time of completing his theological education , with fhe exception of a short interval , during which he occupied a professorship of ecclesiastical history in a southern theological seminary , devoted himself to the work of a missionary among his fellow men , oppressed and degraded by the slavery of his native state . By his private influence ; by his publications , revealing the deplorable moral condition of that portion of the southern population , and appealing to the humanity and piety of his fellow citizens and Christian brethren ; and by his personal and gratuitous missionary labors ,  --  he has done more than any other man within our knowledge , to awaken interest and effort for the evangelization of those heathen in a Christian land . To the first of these reports is appended the address of the President of the Association , Rev. Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings " of a Convention in Charleston , S. C. , May 13-15 , 1845 , respecting the religious instruction of the slaves , " together with the report of the Committee , and the address to the public . " This Convention was called by a circular issued at a preliminary conference , by a few persons interested in the subject , and addressed to " a considerable number of gentlemen interested // in planting in the state of South Carolina . " It was attended by a respectable number of those invited , among whom were some men of distinction in the South . We particularly noticed , that the Hon. Daniel E. Huger , at present a Sen. ator of the United States , was President of the Convention . The members of the Convention were from five religious denominationsthe Baptist , Methodist , Presbyterian , Episcopal , and Lutheran ; and act . ed harmoniously for their common object . They were in session three days , and committed the matter brought before them by written and verbal statements , to five gentlemen , with instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the pamphlet before us , together with an address from a standing committee of ten , who were " ap . pointed to carry out the resolutions of the meeting . " The report contains , say the standing commit . tee , " " 1st , extracts from forty four letters received in reply to the circular , from twenty different districts and parishes of this state , all from persons of high respectability ; to which are added communications from two gentlemen of Georgia , who , on account of their known interest in the subject , and their lone continued personal exertions in this department of benevolence , were invited to take part in our deliberations and to furnish their views . 2dly , extracts from seventeen letters received by a member of the committee from persons resident in eight of the other slaveholding states ; and 3dly , notices of the action of ecclesiastical bodies . The letters under the first head are , for the most part , details of the personal experience and observation of the writers , given with all the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second head afford less of detail , but manifest a common feeling on the subject gratifying and encouraging . The statements under the third head present a general view of plans and operations , destined , we trust , to be more effective , with some results that will arrest and reward attention . Notwithstanding a want of statistics , to be regretted , they still show the system of which the enterprise is susceptible , and will suggest facilities to those who may find it necessary or useful to afford their people the aids of missionary labor . " We quote the following summary of what has been done by the different Christian denominations . " 1 . The Episcopal Church-The committee have no information from the diocese of Maryland , and know not what attention is paid to the religious instruction of the negroes by the clergy and laity of that diocese . " It is well known that the venerable Bishop Meade , of the diocese of Virginia , has for very many years , been a zealous , and able , and untiring advocate of this good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . He has several times brought the great duty of evangelizing the negroes before his diocese ; and in his efforts he is now ably supported by the assistant Bishop , Dr. Johns . The attention of the clergy , is from year to year , more and more directed to the systematic and constant instruction of the colored portion of their charges . Of the memorial of the presbytery of Georgia to the southern preshyte. ries , on the religious instruction of the negroes , Bishop Meade remarks , I am rejoiced to see the different denominations of Christians in our southern country taking up this subject in a more decisive manner than ever before ; and hope that they may stimulate each other , by such addresses , to immediate and zealous action . ' " Bishop ives , of the diocese of North Carolina , has prepared a catechism and put it in circulation , intended for the benefit of the colored charges of his clergy , and for the domestic instruction of the laity at home . Several clergymen of this diocese are much engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is no diocese more engaged , and doing more for the negroes , than that of South Carolina . There are several clergymen acting as missionaries , who are wholly given to the work , and some catechists : while almost the entire body of the clergy are , in their respective parishes , to a greater or less extent , engaged in it The laity also of this diocese , embracing many of the most distinguished and wealthy citizens , are supporters of the work ; contributing not only of their substance , but giving their own personal attention to it . " Bishop Elliott , of the diocese ofGeorgia , continues to give importance and encouragement to the religious instruction of the*negroes . His effort is to incorporate the negroes with the whites , as one charge , in the parish churches , and to bring the children and youth into efficient Sabbath schools . In three parishes the ministers are almost exclusively devoted to the negroes . " Of efforts made in the diocese of Kentucky , Tennessee , Mississippi and Arkan 46 Jan. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . " 2 . The Methodist Episcopal Church. - This branch of the church of Christ , has advanced beyond all others in direct and well sustained efforts in the colored field . It is the only denomination which furnishes statistical information respecting its colored membership and missionary efforts for that class of our population . The present number of colored communicants can not be less than 160,000 in the slaveholding states . Besides the attention paid by the traveling and local preachers to the negroes in their regular ministrations , there are between 80 and 90 missionaries to them , who have under their charge over 18,000 church members , and 100 ,  - -  000 attendants on their services . Over 1,000 negroes are in connection with the Methodist church in Texas . The South Carolina Conference has sixteen missions to the negroes ; the Georgia Conferencetwelve ; Tennessee-five ; Alabamaseven ; Memphis-nine ; Arkansas-one ; Mississippi-seven ; North Carolinatwo ; Virginia-two . The catechising of the children and youth is a prominent part of their labor . Dr. Capers ' catechism , prepared expressly for the purpose , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the S. C. Conference , and the expense of those missions is over $11,000 , annually . " 3 . The Baptist Church. - XVe regret that we can not furnish any general information of the feeling and efforts of this denomination . The proportion ofeolored to white members is greater in this church than it is in the Methodist , although the Methodist may have in the aggregate a greater number . By a late return , the estimate of members is 700,000 ; of this number we set down one seventh as colored , that is , 100,000 . There are many ministers who devote part of their time to the negroes : we do not know the number of missionaries exclusively devoted to them . Some associations are actively engaged in the work . There are more colored licensed preachers and more colored churches regularly organized , of this denomination , than any , or all the other denomoinations put together . The Sunhury Association , for example , on the sea-board of Georgia , employs two white missionaries to the negroes ; has 4,444 colored to 495 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers ; and one or more licensed to preach . Of the 60,000 members in the state of Georgia , 45,000 are negr ( ies . The Alahama state convention of Baptists , at its meeting in Tuscaloosa , Nov. 1844 , took up the subject of the religious instruction of the negroes , with touch solemnity and zeal . A committee on the religious instruction of the negroes , presented resolutions , expressive of the obligations of the convention toimpart the Gospel to the negroes , and their determination to do so by every means in their power . The convention recommended both pastors and private members to engage in the work immediately and efficiently . We feel assured that the example of this convention will be followed by the conventions of the other states . At the late convention in Augusta , Georgia , made up of delegates from all the slave-holding states , for the purpose of separating from the northern portion ofthat church , very special mention was made of the negroes in the South , as a field for missionary labor , and claiming the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for the negroes in the Baptist church , South . " 4 . The Presbyterian Church. - The movement in this church , in favor of the religious instruction ofthe negroes , for the last ten years , has been gradual , and for two years past , rapid and extensive : more so than in any previous years within our recollection : and , as a consequence , ministers and churches are doing more than ever towards the evangelization of this people . We have not space to set down at large the notices of labor among the negroes , in the narratives on the state of religion of the presbyteries and synods , and the General Assembly : nor the resolutions and recommendations ofpresbyteries and synods on the subject . We notice a growing interest and increasing efforts in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , South Carolina , North Carolina , and Virginia , and Kentucky , and Tennessee . In all these states there are numbers of ministers who devote a considerable portion of their time to the negroes , some acting almost as missionaries ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very many presbyteries in different parts of the statesjust mentioned , every member of which is more or less engaged in the work . There are three grand features which the Presbyterian church is endeavoring to make prominent in the religious instruction of the negroes : first  --  to unite the masters and servants in one charge , that each class may receive its just proportion of ministerial labor : second  --  to establish in all the churches Sabbath schools , and classes of instruction for children and youth especially , and for adults also ; and to encourage such schools privately in households : and , third  --  to open the field as fast , and as far as possible , to missionaries duly qualified and employed . " We quote also the conclusion of the report . " Conclusion-The committee have now complied with the wishes of the meeting . Their report might have been 1846. 47 // much more extended and much more minute in its detail , but they did not think it necessary . Brevity is desirable , and it was sought . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states of South Carolina and Georgia , breathe a spirit of true devotion to the cause , and diverse from the spirit of the world ; and they reveal an amount ofindividual and long continued activity which has affected us with surprise . We discover also from the letters from other states , ( which might have been multiplied , ) that there exists much of the same devotion and activity in them . We feel confident that if the voices of all the friends of the religious instruction of the negroes could be heard , even as fully , from every slave-holding state , as has been from South Carolina , and the amount of their labors told , their voices would be as the sound of many waters , and their multitude and their labors would exceed our most sanguine expectations . " In looking back for fifteen years , we rejoice with gratitude at the progress which the work has made . The truth is not to be disguised . The leaven hid in three measures of meal has been silently and powerfully pervading the mass . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , the subject is spoken of ; the great duty is urged and acknowledged ; and feeling lives in action . What is peculiarly a subject of gratitude is , that all denominations of Christians are entering the field . It is wide enough for all . It lies at our own doors , and God in his providence and holy word , has laid the duty upon us to cultivate it . We can anticipate nothing but his displeasure , if we neglect it . Indeed , we look upon the religious instruction of the negroes , as the great duty , and in the truest and best sense , the fixed , the settled policy of the South . We believe God has so moved ( and will continue so to move ) upon the understandings and consciences of our Christian citizens , and so opened the door of access to the negroes , and so demonstrated by his blessing his regard for the work , that we can never go back . The flood has fairly set in . Difficulties and obstructions we may encounter , hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a current that must sweep every thing away before it . The work must go on . Let us look humbly and believingly to the sustaining grace , wisdom and power of the great God and our Redeemer , and all will be well . The two annual reports of the Liberty County Association , give an account of the labor performed under its direction , which has been chiefly the missionary labor of Mr. Jones . They both contain many important facts , valuable suggestions , and earnest exhortations , on the general subject of the religious instruction of the slaves ; and manifest in their author , Mr. Jones , a high degree of true benevolence and self-denial . The tenth report contains a history of the religious instruction of the slaves in the county , from the first settlement of the county to the formation of the Association ; and also of " the formation of the Association , and of the progress of the work to the present hour . " It is on this account a document specially valuable . We quote the following brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st . This Association has been in existence fourteen years : and with the exception of three years , putting the whole time of my absence from the county together , in active operation near eleven years . " During this time it has accomplished much . Through its missionary , it has furnished to the negroes of the fifteenth district , embracing a population of over four thousand , regular preaching on the Sabbath at stations , so conveniently situated , as to bring the Gospel very nearly in reach of all who chose to avail themselves of the privilege of hearing it-Tenth ann . Rep. , p. 36 . This seems to us a stronger statement as to " regular preaching , " than the reported facts warrant . The ninth annual report says respecting preaching , " our regular stations at Newport , Midway , Sunbury , and Pleasant Grove , have been supplied with preaching in the proportion of one Sabbath in three , with the exception of Sunbury , which , in consequence of the greater destitution of the people around that station , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a greater amount of preaching and of instruction than the negroes have ever before enjoyed in any one year , owing to the fact that the Rev. Mr. Law has devoted one half of his time to this work . " We think that preaching // one Sabbath in three , at four stations , to a population of four thousand scattered over a county , can hardly be called a supply of regular preaching on the Sahbath- We call such a supply scanty , and such regular preaching rather irregular . But we proceed with our quotation . " It has established and kept in operation three , and for a part of the time four large Sabbath schools for children and youth , in the instruction of which , adults , also , in considerable numbers have shared . " It has maintained inquiry meetings for the aid of those who were in spiritual darkness or distress , and some hundreds have been assisted by them . " It has pursued a system of plantation meetings , essential to the perfection of the work . These meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restrained the vicious , promoted the ohservance of the Lord 's day , and induced the attendance of old and young at the house of God . " It has published eight annual reports and three addresses which have been circulated throughout the United States , and conducted through its missionary , an extensive correspondence . " Members of the . lssociation , with a few brief interruptions , have kept in operation for the sum mer , year by year , at the summer retreats , three Sabbath schools for adults and children , numbering in the whole from two hundred and thirty to two hundred and fifty attendants . Memhers also have made efforts to instruct their own people on their plantations , by means of evening prayers and scliools. " - Tenth ann . Rep. , pp. 36,7 . We heartily rejoice in the indications which these documents furnish , that Christians of all denominations are beginning to awake to the imperative and dreadfully neglected duty of evangelizing their fellowmen , in their own communities , whom the slave system has sunk into acknowledged heathenism . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all Christian denominations , freely reporting facts , discussing measures , and publishingto the slaveholdina communi-a ties their conclusions and their exhortations , is full of encouragement . It is an evidence that the gentlemen convened , and , to some extent , the communities and Christian denom inations of which they are members , have an interest in the subject . And this interest , once awakened , will not be permitted by Christian men to die or decrease . The Liberty County Association deserve especial credit . Their actual labor and its results within their own county are of less importance than the influence of their example , their correspondence , and their publications , on the whole South . We assure the Christian brethren , of whatever name , who are engaged in this humane and benevolent work , of our sympathy and prayers . We commend them to the sympathy and prayers of all who love our Lord Jesus Christ and the souls for whom he died . Having given this general outline of these labors , we invite distinct attention to several points . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made , during the last ten or fifteen years , a gradual and gratifying progress . This may be seen by comparing the statements which we quoted in our last number , in the review of Gov . Hammond 's letters , from the address of the Presbyterian Synod of Kentucky in 1831 , the report of the Presbyterian Synod of South Carolina and Georgia in 1834 , and the essay of Rev. C. C. Jones . See pp. 584 , 5 , 6 . In 1834 the Synod of South Carolina and Georgia testify thus " In the vast field extending from an entire state beyond the Potomac to the Sabine river , and from the Atlantic to the Ohio , there are , to the best of our knowledge , not twelve men exclusively devoted to the instruction of the negroes . " Now , the Methodist Episcopal church alone has between eighty and ninety missionaries to the negroes , on that same field . In 1834 , the Synod , to which we have referred , " venture the assertion fhat , of the whole number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion pay any attention to them ( the negroes ) . " But now , accord- // ing to the report of the Charleston Convention , the ecclesiastical bodies and authorities of the various Christian denominations pay especial regard to the subject of their religious instruction . Mr. Jones says that when he began his work in December , 1832 , as missionary of the Liberty County Association , " there were no precedents in our country , to which I could look for encouragement and instruction . " The report of the Charleston Convention testifies , directly and emphatically , to this fact of progress . " The movement in this church , ( the Presbyterian , ) in favor of the religious instruction of the negroes , for the last ten years , has been gradual , arid for two years past rapid and extensive . " " In looking back for fifteen years , we rejoice with gratitude at the progress which the work has made What is peculiarly a subject of gratitude is , that all denominations of Christians are entering the field . " The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in that county , says : " Thus has this work been for years gradually advancing . - - - Turning our eyes backwards some ten years , and contrasting the then existing state of things among this class of people with what it now is , who is not sensible of a great and important change in their moral and religious character ? " This progress , in a work second to none other in its influence to ameliorate and improve the condition of the slaves , this progress , so positively and amply evinced , is worthy of our gratitude and joy . It also proves , 2 . That the very common assertion , that the anti-slavery discussion at the North has rendered the condition of the slaves worse than before , is wholly gratuitous and groundless . We invite distinct attention to this remark . We make it , not because it vindicates this , or condemns that , class of men ; but because it vitidi Jan. cates the utility of free discussion , and condemns lack of faith in the salutary efficacy of out-spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency , during the last ten or fifteen years , of observations like these : " Better let the South alone . This anti-slavery discussion at the North has a disastrous effect on the southern mind . It greatly aggravates the already intolerable condition of the slaves . It is putting back for years the amelioration and removal of slavery . Especially does it prevent the religious instruction of the slaves , and shut them from the fountain of life . " So frequent , so loud , and from so influential sources , were these assertions , that , at one time , they commanded , not universal , but quite general , assent . With mortification we acknowledge that , at one period , we were among those who assented , and lost our faith in truth , even when fairly spoken ; though our assent was ever very reluctant and rather suspicious . We remember , that about half a dozen years since , we asked a very intelligent and candid clergyman , a native and resident of the South , though educated at the North , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than good at the South ? - whether it had aggravated the unhappy condition of the slaves ? And we well remember the joy with which we heard his answer , which was virtually this : " It has done more good than harm . It has on the whole benefited the slaves . Some , who were not strongly predisposed to the amelioration of their condition , particularly by religious instruction , have withheld their aid from measures adopted for that end . But the truly benevolent have had their minds stirred up to new exertion ; and , indeed , the whole South , sensitive to public opinion , have felt that the eye of the world is upon them , and that they are put upon their good behavior . " Our unbelief in the beneficence of // northern discussion on this subject gladly fled , and has kept flying , till now it is quite out of sight , and we wonder at our former slowness of heart to believe . We rejoice in the vindication of free anti-slavery discussion , and in the condemnation of the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaredin these southern reports unequivocally furnish . tATe call distinct attention to the fact , which these southern brethren state , that , the last ten or fifteen years , the very years of the origin and progress of the modern antislavery discussion at the North , have been the years of the origin and gradual progress of organized and efficient efforts for the religious instruction of slaves . We call distinct attention to this fact , as a positive and unimpeachable denial of the assertion , that the northern anti-slavery discussion has made the condition of the slaves worse than before . We say to all conscientious doubters of the utility of anti-slavery discussion , Look at this fact ; we say , especially , to all ultra-conservative and lugubrious grumblers at antislavery discussion , Look at this fact , and throw away your unbelief in the force of truth . Have faith in truth , and in the God of truth . Believe in the beneficence of free discussion , and in the utility of truth out-spoken with kindness and fidelity . In saying this , we by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , much of imprudence , much of error , much of indiscriminate severity , much of the wrath that worketh not the righteousness of God . low much of this is to be ascribed to the ultra conservatives , who have denounced antislavery discussion , who have seemed to lack anti-slavery feeling , and have had more to say against abolitionists , than against slavery ; how much is to be ascribed to that agency which makes men fanatics by calling them fanatics , is a ques tion worthy of consideration  --  a question , the right answer to which may give wisdom for the future . Still , we fully admit the fact . XVe lament the fact . We admit also that whatever there has been of imprudence and error and wrath in the discussion , has donv , not good , but harm . Yet we unhesitatingly assert that the northern anti-slavery discussion as a whole , mingled as it may have been with imprudence , and error , and wrath , has done good both at the North and at the South ; and we point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by southern testimony , vindicate the assertion . 3 . While we hail with gratitude and pleasure the beginning of the religious instruction of the slaves , we should remember that it is only a beginning ; that the great body of the slaves are yet , virtually , heathen . We should give our sympathy , and prayers , and , i*'hen practicable , our efforts to their evangelization , as to a work which is , mainly , yet to be done . On this point Mr. Jones observes " While the duty of the religious inStrtCtiOfl of the negroes is more distinctly and generally recognized in the South than it ever has been , and while a greater amount of instruction is communicated than in any previous time in the history of our country , and while we recognize with gratitude , a gradual advance in the whole country on the subject , yet let not the friends of tho cause abate their interest or their efforts , but remember that compared with what ought to be done , and as we trust in the good Providence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing only the day of small things-we are only seeing the cloud as large as a mans hand rising up from the sea . There are immense districts of country in the southern states , in which no light has penetrated on this subject , and the negroes are living and dying in utter neglect and destitution of the means of grace* Their owners are little interested in the Gospel , hear it but seldom , and have yet to learn thttt the spiritutd interests of the negroes are to he cared for , protected and cherished- They have yet to learn or at leastfeel their own great responsibility to God in this matter , and come up t&amp;the improvements in treatment , in labor and in discipline which Christianity requires , // and which their own interest , to rise no higher , will approve-Ni ntk*nnual Report , p. 16 . Rev .. Robert Quarterman , President of ' the Liberty County Association , says- " Christians are but just awaking from their Long sleep of inactivity to their solemn responsibilities in regard to this class of men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christian effort , which , it is time they were at least beginning to discharge We ourselves , ( in this Association , ) are scarcely under way in this good work  --  the tug of labor is still before us . " In the New Orleans Protestant of 23d of May last there is a " Report on the Religious Instruction of the Colored People , published by order of the New Orleans Presbytery2 ' This report states , that " There are , within the hounds of that Presbytery , at least 100,000 persons of color , all of ' whom are slaves . It is a lamentable fact , too evident to he denied , that by far the greater part of them are famishing and perishing for want of the twead of life Of the 100,000 ofthisclass of people within our bounds , it may be safely asserted that 75,000 never hear the doctrine of salvation through a crucified Redeemer preached , and have none to tell them what they must do to he saved . ' And of the remaining 25,000 , who occasionally hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy its regular and constant ministrations* ' But , passing these general statements on this point , let us analyze briefly the more l ) articular statements in the documents before us . The Charleston report informs us that there are , in all the slaveholdang states , not far from 160,000 communicants in the Methodist church , and not far from 100,000 in the Baptist church . The number in the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches is not stated ; but judging from the small . relative size of those denominations , and from the fact that the negroes generally prefer the Methodist and Baptist churches , we are safe in saying , that the addition of the colored communicants in the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches would not increase the number above 300,000 . Now 300,000 communicants , even could we hope well concerning them all , is a very small proportion of Christians in a population of nearly 3,000,000 . But , alas ! we can not hope that all , nor even the larger part of these communicants are Christians ; such is their igm*rance , and such mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Mr. Jones , speaking of a protracted meeting , held under his direction , in Liberty county , says ,  --  " Some of the negroes expected that the ministers would cell them up to be prayed for , ' but that was not done . The ministers might have done so , and created literally an excitement , ' and what would have been the end of it ? Perfect delusion I A substitution of forms and acts end kneelings and prayers , for religion itself ! Opening the door for disorders , for spurious conversions , for periodical religion , and a contempt for the ordinary and divinely constituted means of grace ! . . - To use such means with ignorant people like our colored population , is madness . The tendency and the final result will be evil and evil only . Whereever the negroes in the southern country are trained up to shouting and groaning , and kneeling to be prayed for , and such like things , there is confusion and fanaticism and spurious religion . The last end of many is worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense and piety of this community would tolerate any such irregularities and excesses , and it is surprising thatthey should be tolerated any where . ' - Ninth dnn . Rep. , p. 13 . Now the vast majority of these colored communicants , 260,000 out of 300,000 , belong to the Baptist and Methodist churches , which , as is well known , resort abundantly , especially among the slaves ; to the very means to which Mr. Jones refers , and the use of which , among such " an ignorant people , " he declares to be madness . Judging , then , by his rule , which we consider a just one , we are compelled to believe that the religion of a large proportion of these ignorant colored communicants is a mere delusion . Thus a comparison of the number // of the truly pious with the whole number , proves the religious condition of the slaves deplorable indeed . The same conclusion is unavoidable , if we consider the meager amount of missionary or ministerial labor expended on the slaves . The Methodist church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well sustained efforts in the colored field , " has on that field , between eighty and ninety missionaries . The Baptists have done comparatively little of that kind of missionary labor . We make a large estimate when we say that all other denominations have as many missionaries as the Methodists . We have then 160 for the 3,000,000 slaves . " But what are these among so many ? " Nor is this awful deficiency of missionary labor supplied , to any great extent , by the pastors of the whites , or by the masters , if we may judge from the remarks of Mr. Jones on this subject . tie says ,  --  " But perhaps the most serious obstacle in our way , has been the want of pastoral supervision over the negroes he regular instruction of the negroes does not fall within their ( the pastor 's ) efforts . The baptizing of the children , the examination of candidates , and the settlement of cases of discipline , is all well enough as far as it goes . But it does not go far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied with the duties of their station , and I do not mean that they should perform what may properly be called missionary labor among the negroes at the present time , but that they should be allowed by the churches to devote a reasonable portion of their time to the negrocs , at least so much as to make the negroes feel that they are a part of their charge , and to know and to look up to them as their pastors-Tenth ann . Rep. , pp. 38 , 9 . " Nor have the efforts of the Association been seconded by the planters in the domestic instruction and training of their servants . A greater amount of plantation instruction by evening prayers and schools , was given by planters themselves or their families , the first years of our existence , than has been since ; and at the present time there are very few plantations upon which any thing is done for the people by their owners , in the way of religious instruction . And what is most surprising , the great majority of planters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , to have the children and youth from their plantations , atte d our public Sabbath schools at the stations . They are in favor of the schools , and knowing their utility , wish the children to attend , but do nothing to effect the object ! Many a Sabbath have we looked for the children of plantations in the immediate vicinity of the stations , and out often , fifteen , twenty or more , who should be there , we have not seen five , , sometimes not one The Sabbath schools have been kept up by the interest which the negroes themselves have felt in them ! Nor have planters who have the means and can well afford it , assisted their people by putting up for them on their plantations , a house of prayer , or by fitting up a room for the purpose . Some few only have done so-Tenth ann . Rep. , pp. 37,8 . This , in Liberty county , which , in the words of a letter published in this report , " has obtained celebrity for taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same point , we quote the following from a letter to Mr. Jones , published in his report . " From a Theological Seminary-DEAR SIR : There is in this institution an organization called The Society of Inquiry on Missions , which has for its object the obtaining of information as accurate and extensive as possible , concerning the state of religion in the world , in order that we may be able to select our fields of labor advisedly , and also that we may be incited to inure fervent prayer and more diligent exertion for the salvation of our fellow men . Among other things , our attention has been directed to the religious condition of the negro population of our own country ; and we find that with us , as well as the church at large , there exists a deplorable ignorance , and , of course , great apathy concerning the religious condition and prospects of the negroes . Knowing that you have devoted much of your time to this subject , the committee of the Society , to whom this subject is intrusted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as your engagements will permit , in obtaining the information which we need . Our ignorance is extreme as to what has been done , what ought to be done , what can be done , and what hind of men are best adapted to the work-Ninth . tlnn . Rep. , pp. 22 , 3 . It is on good evidence , therefore , that we say , this work of evangelizing the slaves of this country demands 1846j 53 // our sympathy , our prayers and our libors , as a work which is only be*cun . The great body of the slaves are still heathen . And , as to the obstacles to the success of missionary labor among them , they are in many respects in a worse condition than the heathen . 4 . To some of these obstacles we call distinct attention . The most important perhaps is , that the laws of the slave states forbid , by severe penalties , that the slaves should be taught to read . What an obstacle is this to their religious instruction ! The missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first thing which he does ? He gathers the people , children and adults , especially children , into schools and teaches them to read , and gives them , to be studied , portions of the Bible and religious tracts . He relies more , for their evangelization , upon teaching them in this manner , than he does upon preaching . In this important feature , the slaves are in a worse condition than the heathen . They cnn not be taught to read . The jealous laws of slavery forbid . They can not have the Bible . They can not , according to the divine command , " search the Scriptures . " Between them and this divine comiriand , stands slave law with its penalties . They can not exercise the right of private judgment in religion : for they are forbidden to search the Scriptures , like the noble minded Bereans , to see whether the things preached to them are so . The slave laws keep them , in this respect , just where the oppressive rules of the Roman Catholic church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is , that the work of religious instruction is greatly embarrassed and hindered . The missionary or instructor has to get the slaves together , adults and children , and repeat , and repeat , and repeat a passage , till they have committed it to memory . Says Mr. Jones " As the children could not make use of books , and being the only teacher , I was compelled to throw the whole school into one ( lass , and to teach them all together on the inthnt schoot plan . I'he questions were asked arid the answers repeated , until they were committed to memory : and the lesson was accompanied with repaatcd explanations and an application . " - Tent/i dnn . Rep. , p. 21 . So Bishop Elliot , thinking it " a mistake to suppose that ( our ) church repels , by her liturgical forms , this class of population , " recommends that they should be taught " to repeat , and understand , and appreciate the liturgy : " for , says he , " they must be taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be given line upon line , and precept upon precept . " Really , what an up-hill and arduous work is this ! To collect into classes an ignorant people , who cnn not and must not read , and repeat to them the whole liturgy , and repeat it , and repeat it , and repeat it , till they have learned it by heart ! - an accomplishmentin " liturgical forms " which , we presune , the greatest adept therein , who can read , never attains . Truly , we sympathize with this evangelical and excellent Bishop in this arduous work , and fully agree with him , that " it requires persevering effort , assiduous attention , indefatigable patience . " Patience ! We have no patience with this slave law , which withholds God 's pure bread of life from his famishing creatures . It is an atrocious interference with God 's law , which , every mnan who professes ( as does every Christian ) to " obey God rather than man , " is bound , in consistency as well as duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian men do disregard it . " The most important law , " says Rev. Dr. Richard Fuller , in his published letters to Rev. Dr. Wayland , speaking of " those laws which prohibit a discharge of the master 's duty , " " the most important law is that forbidding slaves being taught to read ; yet how many are taught . " And , speaking // of the statute " forbidding slaves to assemble without the presence of so many white persons , " he says , " I violate this statute most industriously . " We honor Dr. Fuller for this industrious violation of human laws which impiously contravene the laws of God , and forbid men to discharge their duty . The Christians of the South have it in their power , by a united disobedience to this law forbidding slaves to be taught to read , to render it a dead letter , and that without doing any harm . We think that they are bound to do it . We hope that ere long they will do it . We would suggest however to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he " industriously violates " the statute of sovereign South Carolina , viz , that he may rightfully disobey a human law , when it contravenes , in his opinion , a divine law by prohibiting a discharge of duty , is one , which , if fully carried out , would lead him further , in violation of the slave laws and in opposition to slavery , than he perhaps is aware . And we would also suggest to him the inquiry , whether , if other men choose to carry out his own principle further than he does , even to its full and legitimate conclusions , he ought very seriously to blame them , or to denounce them as fanatics ? There are many other obstacles peculiar to missionary labor among slaves , such as the extreme delicacy of the work , opposition of noisy demagogues , the interference of wicked and worthless whites , the jealousy and objections of masterstheir fears that large assemblages on the Sabbath , and especially at night , will be seized upon by the slaves as occasions of insubordination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaves tends to make them presumptuous , unruly and unprofitable ; and particularly that the instruction of slaves tends to the ultimate overthrow of slaveryall these are serious and peculiar ob Obstacles to the Work . 55 stacles . But , we pass over them , and will dwell for a moment on another . The slaves are deeply and inevitably conscious , whatever may be the mild treatment of individuals among them , that the bondage in which they are held is a grievous and unjust system of oppression . This leads them to receive with expressed or latent suspicion the instruction of white missionaries and ministers , thinking , and often , perhaps generally , with good reason , that they agree with their masters a upholding this system of oppression , and that they are inclined to give a disproportioned amount , and an unscriptural quality , of instruction respecting their duty to their masters . This is illustrated in the reports before us , and even in the case of so excellent and judicious a man as Mr. Jones . He says in his Tenth Annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of this year , illustrative of the character and knowledge of the negroes at this time . I was preaching to a large congregation on the Epistle of P/ideman : and when I insisted upon fidelity and obedience as Christian virtues in servants , and , upon the authority ofPaul , eondeinned the practice of running away , one half of my audience deliberatety rose up and walked off with themselves , and those that remained looked any thing but satisfied , either with the preacher or his doctrine . After disrnission , there was no small stir among them : some solemnly declared that there was no such an epistle in the Bible : others , that it was not the Gospel : ' others , that 1 preached to please the masters : others , that they did not care if they ever heard me preach again . ' I took no notice of the frrmertt , but went forward as thotigh nothing had happened . It died away and they all came quietly hack aga*n . There were some too , who had strong objections against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said , his people have to work as well as we . ' " - pp. 24,5 . Now we would observe on this instructive passage , first , that if Mr. Jones had not been bred under the influence of slavery , ( and if he had not , he would not probably be allowed to be a missionary to the slaves ; ) S // he would , in these days , in all probability , have taken the view of the Epistle to Philemon , which Rev. Albert Barnes has published in his notes on that epistle ; and secondly , if he had presented that view to the slaves , they would doubtless have retained their seats . The following passage from a letter of one of Mr. Jones ' correspondents , published in his Ninth Report , is instructive " A minister told me the other day , it is no use to preach to the negroes , they will pay no regard to a white man ; I V tried it a few weeks ago , but one went to sleep and some went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What did you preach to them about ? ' said I. He answered , their duty to their masters . ' This without showing them the principles on which such duties were to be performed , seemed to me , for an only discourse , first and last , like mustard without beef , ' as they say in England . " - Ninth Ann . Rep. , p. 25 . Now it is very plain that ministers and missionaries , educated amid slavery , and laboring amid the jealousies of slaveholders , will be very likely to believe in , and administer , a great deal of " mustard without beef " And it is also very plain , that the slaves , conscious as they are of the injustice of their bondage , will not relish the ministration ; and will regard the administrators with suspicion . And even if the preachers or instructors should not give them " mustard without beef , " they will be likely to regard them with a latent distrust , as those who have no sympathy with them in their oppression . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc6uraging this good work , or our brethren who are engaged in it , but to call out sympathy and prayer in their behalf . But we have said more than we intended when we began . In conclusion , we repeat the expression of our satisfaction in this beginning of good things The remark of the Charleston committee , " We look upon the religious instruction of the negroes as the GREAT nurv of the South , " we adopt as our own , with this qualification  --  the great duty , second only to the duty of emancipation . We exhort our southern brethren , who alone can efficiently labor in this good work , to go forward . We believe that it promises the amelioration , and indeed the ultimate removal of slavery.
