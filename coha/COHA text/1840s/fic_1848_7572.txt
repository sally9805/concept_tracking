Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : TO  --   --  , ON RECEIVING FROM HER A SPRAY OF LILIES OF THE VALLEY . from Poems of early and after years ( 1848 ) Small lily , that the careless overlook , Though , to the finder , sweeter than the rose  --  Pure , unobtrusive , fragrant-hearted flower  --  How truthful is its portraiture of thee ! I 've known thee until now , as floats the mist Over the valley , silently aware That sweetness known in heaven lay hid near by ; But , as the same mist , heavy with the night , Falls in a dark tear to the lily 's cup , And finds it sweetest at the darkest hour , So , thou pure girl , thy tender presence only Has an unconscious ministry to me , And near thee , in the night that shrouds me still , My darkness is forgotten . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : TO  --  . from Poems of early and after years ( 1848 ) Thy love is like the thread of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clouds :  --  The thunder of a storm not surely o'er Murmurs beneath it , and the lightning gleams Brokenly still , in one mass dark and near , As if it would close turbulently o'er And make all black again . But , motionless , As ' t were an angel 's shallop in a calm , The bent moon floats , and its round freight of hope Lies in its breast  --  to unbelieving eyes A shadow that can never grow more fair ,  --  But , to the clearer-sighted stars , a promise Of brightness that will wax to fill a heaven .
