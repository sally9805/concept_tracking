txt IN a preceding number* we gave some historical notices of English metrical versions of the Psalms . It remains for us now , as was proposed , to consider more particularly the change introduced by Dr. Watts , early in the last century , in the use of the Psalms in public worship . The discussion it has occasioned at various times is not unimportant , nor yet obsolete ; and some of our readers will enter into it only the more readily , because it is remote from the hackneyed and exciting topics of the day . The distinguishing character of the Psalms , as versified by Dr. Watts , is clearly indicated by the title which he gave them : " The Psalms of David , imitated in the language of the New Testament , and applied to the Christian State and Worship . " According to his design , they are generally evangelical imitations , or New Testament paraphrases , rather than literal versions . The metrical Psalms that were in general use before the time of Dr. Watts , and are still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the English and Scotch establishments , and some other ecclesiastical connections , ) were intended to be translations , as faithful to the original Psalms as the restraints of measure and rhyme would allow . There had been partial exceptions , as in Patrick 's version , which , says Watts , was " by no means a translation , but a paraphrase , " and had the advan * This vol. pp. 72-86. tage of substituting evangelical sentiment in many places , for such as was appropriate only to the Jewish Psalmist ; yet the principle of adaptation was not fully carried out in that work , and was not at all regarded in the versions more generally adopted . Modern Christian assemblies sung in English , as nearly as possible , what the Jewish writers and worshipers sung before them , adopting not only the same spirit , but the same imagery , the same allusions , the same shadowy and obscure revelations of the Christian scheme afterwards fully unfolded , and even the same confessions , complaints and curses . Such was the theory of psalmody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , for every judicious minister sought a necessary relief by giving out only the more eligible portions of the book ; ho " waled a portion with judicious care , " and thus the theory itself was virtually acknowledged to be unsuitable . But even with the liberty of disusing some whole psalms and parts of others , still of necessity worshipers would oft*en find themselves employing , as their own , sentiments and expressions that were either foreign to Christianity , or foreign to their condition . Watts felt , as others had felt before himn , the evil of confining Christians , in a chief part of the public worship of God , to the precise forms of the Jewish service , and the absolute impropriety of their adopting some things contained in them . // Knowing the opposition that any considerable change would meet with , he discussed the subject in a separate tract , which we have seen only in the complete collection of his works , and also in the preface to his Psalms , ( dated 1718* ) concisely , but with much vivacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shows here the same combination of fervor and simplicity , that same unction , which characterises his verse . Vindicating the rights of Christian worship , he says : - " Moses , Deborah , and the princes of Israel , David , Asaph , and Habakkuk , and all the saints under the Jewish state , sung their own joys and victories , their own hopes and fears and deliverances , as I hinted before ; and why must we , under the gospel , sing nothing else but the joys , hopes and fears of Asaph and David ? Why must Christians be forbid all other melody , but what arises from the victories and deliverances of the Jews ? David would have thought it very hard to have been confined to the words of Moses , and sung nothing else on all his rejoicing days but the drowning of Pharaoh , in the fifteenth of Exodus . He might have supposed it a little unreasonable , when he had peculiar occasions of mournful music , if he had been forced to keep close to Moses ' prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortness of human life , especially if he was not permitted the liberty of a paraphrase . And yet the special concerns of David and Moses were much more akin to each other than ours are to either of them ; and they were both of the same religion , but ours is very different . " He urges the fact that many things in the Psalms are too glaringly inappropriate , to an assembly of modern worshipers , to be employed by them as their language . " I could never persuade myself , " he says , " that the best way to raise a devout frame in plain Christians , was to bring a king or a captain into their churches , and let him lead and dictate the worship in his own style of royalty , or in the language of a field of battle . Does every menial servant in the assembly know how to use these words devoutly-namely , when I shall receive the congregation , I will judge uprightly ' - a bow of steel is broken by mine arms - as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " He appeals " to the heart and conscience of many pious and observing Christians " as to the difference they have felt in singing successive portions of the Psalms : " Have not your spirits taken wing , and mounted up near to God and glory , with the song of David on your tongue ? But , on a sudden , the clerk has proposed the next line to your lips with dark sayings and prophecies , with burnt offerings or hyssop , with new moons and trumpets and timbrels in itwith confessions of sins which you never committed-with complaints of sorrows which you never feltcursing such enemies as you never had-giving thanks for such victories as you never obtained  --  or leading you to speak , in your own persons , of things , places and actions which you never knew . And how have all your souls been discomposed at once , and the strings of harmony all untuned ! You could not proceed in the song with your hearts , and your lips have sunk their joy and faltered in the tune . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearness and brightness , with the older dispensation , he asks with his own natural eloquence , " what need is there that I should wrap up the shining honors of my Redeemer in the dark and shadowy language of a religion that is now forever abolished ? " In the same preface , Watts explains and vindicates his own design , to the satisfaction , we think , of unprejudiced readers , and it is made still clearer and more interesting by his own notes appended to several // of the Psalms . He proposed " to accommodate the book of Psalms to Christian worship ; " " and in order to do this , " he says , " it is necessary to divest David and Asaph , &amp;c. of every other character hut that of a psalmist and a saint , and to make them always speak the common sense of a Christian . " He would retain their sentiment and spirit , and their language also , as far as Christian use and edification require or allow , yet change the costume of their thoughts , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . When ordinary Christians sing the Psalms of David , he would have them substitute Christianity for Judaism , and their own condition , experience and emotions for such as were peculiar to the Hebrew king . " I have rather expressed myself , " he says , " as I may suppose David would have done had he lived in the days of Christianity . " Accordingly , he " omitted some whole psalms , * and large pieces of many others ; " choosing " such parts only as might easily and naturally he accommodated to the various occasions of the Christian life , or , at least , might afford us some beautiful allusion to Christian affairs ; " and these he " copied and explained in the general style of the Gospel , " without restricting himself " to any particular party or opinion " among " sincere Christians . " The psalmist 's " invectives against his personal enemies , " he turns " against our spiritual adversaries . " Where the expressions were pertinent to the sacred writer only , the paraphrase uses language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prophecies concerning Christ , long since accomplished , are put into an historical form . Where Christ or his Apostles have " cited or alluded to any part of the Psalms , " what they have said , which " surely may * Twelve , viz. : Ps. 28 , 43 , 52 , 54 , 59 , 64 , 70 , 79 , *8 , 108 , 137 , 140. be esteemed the word of God still , though borrowed from several parts of the holy Scripture , " is substantially incorporated with the paraphrase . " Where the psalmist , " says Watts , " describes religion by the fear of God , I have often joined faith and love to it . Where he speaks of the pardon of sin through the mercies of God , I have added the blood or merits of a Savior ; where he talks of sacrificing goats or bullocks , I rather choose to mention the sacrifice of Christ , the Lamb of God . Where he attends the ark with shouting in Zion , I sing the ascension of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth . Where he promises abundance of wealth , honor and long life , I have changed some of these typical blessings for grace , glory and life eternal , which are brought to light by the Gospel and promised in the New Testament . And I am fully satisfied that more honor is done to our blessed Savior by speaking his name , his graces and actions in his own language , according to the brighter discoveries he bath now made , than by going hack again to the Jewish forms of worship , and the language of types and figures . " " All men , " he adds , " will confess this is just and necessary in preaching and praying ; and I can not find a reason why we should not sing praises also in a manner agreeable to the present and more glorious dispensation . " This last argument he enforces with pertinent illustrations , and goes on to urge the unreasonableness of requiring modern Christians to sing only the same matter which they would have sung , if they had been Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of losing , in this part of public worship , all the peculiar light and warmth of the New Testament . Indeed , the folly and the harm of singing nothing but prophecy after it has become history , and celebrating only types instead of the substantial // realities which distinguish evangelical prayer and preaching , have become so evident , that in the lapse of time most churches have been obliged to add to their psalms , hymns founded on other passages of the Bible . But Watts ' argument goes further , showing the impropriety of Christians singing many of the Psalms themselves , in their original and literal application . lie , of course , contends for the most faithful translation of the whole book , as a part of the word of God , to be studied and regarded accordingly by all believers ; but he would not have the whole of such a translation sung , because singing , like prayer , must be supposed to represent the condition and feelings of the worshipers , who can not thus , in their own persons , adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience as Christians and as men . He does not allow , and it certainly can not be shown , " that the whole book of Psalms ( even in the original ) was appointed by God for the ordinary and constant worship of the Jewish sanctuary or the synagogues , though several of them might be often sung ; much less are they all proper for a Christian church . " And while no man is more ravished with the strains of the Hebrew psalmist , he yet asks , very properly , " how can we assume to ourselves all his words in our personal or public addresses to God , when our condition of life , our time , place and religion are so vastly different from those of David ? " We need not say that , in common with the multitudes who have used Dr. XVatts ' work , we are persuaded that his views are just , and that his method of adapting the Psalms to Christian use and worship , by paraphrases or imitations , according to the language of the New Testament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors would now approve , and which worshipers must find most satisfactory and profitable . We have given the more space here to his argument because his own preface and notes are not now generally printed in the common edition of his Psalms , and the important questions to which they refer are still matters of debate . Even those who did not fall in with his design readily , acknowledged his success in its execution . In the naturalness and fluency of his verse , in genuine fervor of emotion , itt vivacity of conception , along with the most chastened simplicity of language , * he is above all comparison with the authors of other popular versions . Availing himself of his freer method , he excels them still more in richness of evangelical sentiment . And so far as his main design allowed , he also transfuses the peculiar spirit of the 1-lebrew poets more fully into his own compositions-an excellence for which he was qualified by the objective habit of mind that distinguishes him among our sacred poets . Thus , in the 114th Psalm , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invisible power introduce , and , as it were , compel the sublime recognition.t This and other instances are enough to show , * His notes show the most anxious care to make his phraseology intelligihie to common worshipers , and to preserve a gravity becoming the occasion and the themes : as on Ps. 139 , in acknowledging the aid he derived from Tate and Brady , he vindicates his own plainer language " My own design constrained me to leave out the words of a more poetic sound , such as " infernal plains , morning 's wings , western main , sable wings of night , shapeless embryo , maze of life , xc . " " If I had introduced , " he says in his note , " the presence of God into the camp of Israel removing from Egypt , as all my predecessors have done , I had lost the divine beauty of the Psalm . " This version was contributed hy him to Addison s Spectator , No. 461 , ( more than six years before it appeared in his own collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea is more fully presented . The same faa. tore of this Psalm is essentially preserved in the2d version , in the new Connecticut Collection , which is froni Rev. George Burgess 's volume . // that had he attempted a proper version , instead of an evangelical imitation of the whole book , he must have surpassed all his predecessors . In the execution of his more desirable undertaking , he has had imitators , yet he is confessedly without a rival . He has the merit of originality , too , in the design , if not to the same extent as in his hymns ; for though the evangelical interpretation of the Psalms is as old as the New Testament , and though some of them had been paraphrased in verse , with a degree of the same liberty , he was the first to apply that method fully and consistently to metrical psalmody , and thus to supply the wants of Christian congregations . In a work so novel and responsible , he had the good sense to avail himself , in some instances , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the candor to acknowledge it in his notes . We are surprised to find that Mr. Holland , ( though an admirer of Watts , ) and also Tattersall , whom he quotes on the subject , take notice of occasional resemblances , particularly to Patrick 's version , as if they had not been pointed out by the writer himself . The notes which Watts appended to several of his Psalms ought still to be printed along with them , not only as showing his willingness to acknowledge every literary obligation , but because they often enhance the interest of his paraphrases , and throw light on the inspired original . It was a matter of course that such a change in Psalmody as Watts proposed , met with opposition and provoked discussion . The strict metrical versions already in use , had enlisted the force of habit and prejudice in their behalf . Besides the blind and stubborn prepossessions that are always in the way of reform , particularly in respect to public religious usages , there was a common impression that in the public worship of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of the Bible  --  the very Psalms of David , or of other inspired saints-as nearly as they could be had in our language . Sermons might be human compositions ; public prayers might be forms prescribed by uninspired men , or even extemporaneous ; * but public praise could be properly offered only in the divine forms that were used under the old dispensation ! Unreasonable as was the notion , unwarranted in the Bible , and even in the usages of the church , it was not therefore the less obstinate . There was argument enough , especially for the more ignorant , in saying that David was inspired , and Dr. Watts was not.t Indeed the most enlightened advocates of the old versions could say no more . The obligation or the propriety of singing only the words of the Bible , and of singing every thing contained in the Psalms , was a mere assumption . Many passages were in fact left out of every public service at the minister 's discretion , though printed with the rest , and thus in practice * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminently inconsistent in those persons that scruple to address God in prose in any piecomposed forms whatsoever ; and they give this reason , because they can not be fitted to all our present occasions ; and yet in verse they confine their addresses to such forms as were fitted chiefly for Jewish worshipers , and for the special occasions of David the Kin*r " it is said that a clergyman who wished to introduce Watts ' Psalms into his congregation instead of an old version , exchanged with a neighboring minister , whom he requested to propose the shbject , and who gave notice in the rooming , that as Dr. Watts ' book would be used in the afternoon , if any brother had objections he might now state them . A brother rose accordingly , and said he " would like to inquire if Dr. Watts was expired as David was . " " I am happy , " answered the minister , " to inform the brother that lee is . " Another objector , of a similar stamp , was quieted as easily , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it was not in the Bible . " Why , " said another , " we read of David being delivered from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear-and there you find paws . " // were confessed to be unsuitable . Still by the force of this prejudice , " the old version " of Sternhold and Hopkins is still retained to some extent in England , as for nearly three centuries past ; the Scotch version , as it is called , or Rouse 's , still reigns in Scotland , and in this usage the " auld kirk " and the new , and most of the dissenting bodies in Scotland , harmonize , notwithstanding their discordant notions in other matters ; and it must be for no better reason , that the later version of Tate and Brady is still retained as a whole in most of the congregations in the English establishment , where there is not however as much uniformity on this subject as in Scotland . Still , even within those bounds , material changes have been effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch church , where the old prejudice was the strongest , a considerable collection of paraphrases of select portions of the Psalms and other scriptures , is now appended to Rouse 's version , and can not fail by use to gain the popular preference . Goode 's version , which we have before noticed , represents the views of not a few in the English Episcopal church , and the author , " the rector of St. Antholine 's " in London , avowedly aims " to express with clearness the typical intent of the Psalms in the corresponding view of the New Testament dispensation , convinced that the only method of rendering the Psalms acceptable to a Christian congregation , is to make them Christian . " His conviction , as he tells us , had been strengthened by observing the obvious advantage which the dissenters had obtained from this method as employed by Dr. Watts . As it has passed through several editions , his work must have been popular , and perhaps has been sung in some congregations . The collection by Rev. Josiah Pratt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Hymns , the former taken chiefly from Watts and Goode , and is in popular use. * So much latitude is allowed in metrical singing in the established churches of various districts , that evangelical paraphrases of the Psalms are receiving in some degree the trial which always puts them above the literal versions in general esteem . But in other and growing denominations of Christians , Dr. Watts has long since supplanted all the earlier British psalmists , and still holds a place , and we might safely say will hold it , above all his successors . The Congregational or Independent , and the Baptist churches , in England and in this country , and the Presbyterian churches also , except a few which were connected with the Scotch establishment or were made up of Scotch families , gradually relinquished the prejudices which they in common with others once held so tenaciously , and for many years have sung the Psalms as adapted by Watts with growing esteem for his method and for its execution . In these numerous bodies , abroad and at home , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other congregations which have not confined themselves to any one version , have drawn liberally from Watts in their compilations. if his Psalms are not used as extensively as his hymns , according to his design , that is , as substit*ites for more literal versions , yet many of them are not less generally admired as the most successful examples of the method he proposed , and they hold a higher place than those literal versions can have in the intelligent regard of the multitudes who use them . The effect of his sacred songs , both the paraphrases and the hymns , has conspired with the general progress of public taste , to banish from all Chris- * One of the copies we have seen is numbered as belonging to the " thirty ninth thousand . " The book is called , " Three hundred and fifty portions of the book of Psalms , " &amp;c. // tian assemblies the narrow prejudice that would once have excluded every thing but David 's Psalms from the worship of God . Prejudice has even changed ground , and passed over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression his works have made , that some are now almost as jealous in behalf of Watts ' Psalms , against all mutilation or addition , as their ancestors were against them and in behalf of David 's . Now that the error of the fathers in one direction is clearly seen , let the children beware of their own fallibility in the other . The notion that nothing should be sung in public worship but the sentiments , and as nearly as possible the words of inspiration , may still be traced in the practice which prevails in the foreign hymn-books , of referring almost every piece to some chapter or verse of the Bible , even when it was not composed with any such reference ; as if at least a scriptural motto were required , like a key note , for every sacred song. * Yet few persons at this day would limit the sentiment of a hymn to the passages thus indicated , and since paraphrases of other scriptures arc now used , even in the Scotch kirk , we suppose none would restrict singing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translations of the Psalms on the one hand , and paraphrases or imitations on the other , remains open so long as large and respectable bodies of Christians differ concerning it . The old versions evidently do not satisfy the wants of modern assemblies , and are retained chiefly in deference to the principle * An English Baptist collection prefixes two such references to every hymn . Condor , in his " Congregational Hymn Book , " puis some scripiural senience or phrase before every piece , insiead of a iitIe ; and as many hymns are not founded on any particular passage , it often cost him much care , as he tells us , to select one-though in such cases we think he labored with more pains than profit . of adhering to the original in singing as well as in reading the Psalms . From time to time new authors repeat the old experiment ; yet they have not been able to combine that principle with such poetical merit as is felt to be desirable . We learn from Mr. Holland 's book , that as late as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " Literary Hours , " and other works , issued " A Metrical Translation of the Psalms , constructed from the most beautiful parts of the English versions ; in which , by laying all his predecessors under contribution , taking every passage from the writer who had versifled it in all respects most happily , and making alterations and additions where they seemed necessary , the compiler aimed to produce a more perfect whole than could have been expected from one author . In the specimen given , most of the stanzas appear to be a new translation from his own hand , and the others are from Watts . We do not learn , however , that his version , notwithstanding the obvious advantages allowed by his method , has been any where adopted in public worship . Like other modern attempts , probably it has not that degree of unquestionable superiority over the old metrical translations , which compensates for a change . It labors under the same difficulty , that attends all the literal versions . And now that so many experiments of that nature have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems if not as translations , we are warranted in pronouncing the thing attempted impracticable . The Psalms literally rendered into English metre and rhyme , have been , and we think must be , inferior to the same Psalms in prose , and to the acknowledged standard of English poetry . Nor can they , as a whole , answer the purposes of public worship *atifactorily , without that freedom of adaptation for which Dr. Watts contended , and which has ob // tamed for his paraphrases a higher place than any other metrical Psalms in popular esteem . It is easy to se&amp; that in the discussions which have arisen on this subject , things properly distinct have been confused , and unwarrantable assumptions have been held sacred . These points ought certainly to be the better undcrstood now that so lines deleted // but only to be read by her priests , monks and nuns every week . We find no trace of any divine authority enjoining the whole book as necessary to be even read in public assemblies . With still less propriety could all be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in song . If indeed there be any such obligation , we have only to select the most faithful translation whether in prose or verse , dispensing with the restraints of rhyme , however , for the sake of fidelity to the original ; and sing the whole in course as decently as the case allows , omitting no Psalm nor part . Every private peaceable citizen will then aflirm , as intelligently as he can , " They that hate me without a cause , are more than the hairs of my head , " ( Ps. 69 : 4 , ) or with Tate and Brady " My hairs though numerous are but few , Compared with foes that me pursue . But since no such obligation can be made out , such portions of the book of Psalms are to be retained for worship as the advantage and the choice of Christian assemblies require ; and they are to be retained , not of course because they belong to an inspired hook , but because they are appropriate to such a service . As to all those Psalms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian worship , or which the common people may at all times intelligently employ as the language of their own devotions , the only question among British psalmists has been , who should render them into English verse on the tam " Selections " are allowed to be used instead of the Psalms for the day , at the minister 's discretion . A month is allow . ed for the course . * As our readers have observed , it is no part of our object in this article to disparage the old versions , hut rather to honor them , and hence we have purposely abstained from the most ludicrous citations often made for amusement . whole most happily . The general freedom however of Dr. Watts ' method , gave him some advantage over his predecessors in these instances . The English Psalms in his hands have more of the spirit of the Hebrew , because he does not sacrifice the spirit to the letter . All critics agree that the translator of a poem can never do justice to his original by following it with a literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resemblance in the details incompatible with a higher resemblance in the effect . The same rule is applicahle to the Psalms as to uninspired compositions . Here certainly our older versitlers erred . The method which they prescribed to themselves might have furnished fair proof-texts , but certainly it spoil* ed their poetry . On the other hand , Watts ' versions of . the Psalms referred to , while faithful enough to the originals to be esteemed as versions , are popular , and will continue to be so , as English hymns . They are such sacred lyrics as the Hebrew psalmists would acknowledge to be more like their own than the earlier more literal versions . The twenty third Psalm may be taken as one example . We see no good reason why those Psalms which we have now in view , should not be sung in prose , as well as in verse . Metrical singing found favor among the reformers especially because it could be performed by a whole congregation , while many of the chants used in the Romish church could be sung only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made , as to public worship , between difficult music performed by a few men and women in the gallery , and more simple music sung by the congregation generally , we have no hesitation in preferring the latter as far more appropriate and effective . But we may have congregational singing either in a hymn-tune or a chant . // All our Congregational churches , and most of the churches in other denominations , now make use of choirs , and wherever they are employed , the singing comes to depend on them mainly , rather than on the congregations . Hymn-tunes have been changed and new ones introduced , till metrical singing has itself become too difficult to be strictly popular , as the reformers intended it should be . Let our metrical psalmody be more simple , in order that choirs may only aid instead of supplanting the people in their worship . But a chant may be simple enough for the same purpose . It has the advantage of making the words more distinctly heard , and of preserving their accent and quantity more perfectly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the version most familiar and approved among all English readers of the Psalms . We love to hear Dr. Watts 's versions of the twenty third and the eighty fourth Psalms read or sung , but we are not therefore the less impressed when we hear them chanted with simplicity as they stand in our Bibles . This kind of church music is recommended by ancient usage . As being less artificial it prevailed before other modes , and for aught that appears , was the only style of singing employed in the Hebrew worship and in the primitive Christian assemblies . It has continued in use , along with metrical singing , in most of the protestant churches , not only in England , but on the continent . The church of Scotland , and many of the English Puritans , associated chanting , as well as some other unexceptionable things , with the mummeries of the Romish service ; but we do not of course inherit their prejudices , which were the accidents , not the essence , of that puritanism which we revere . Nor can the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those of their descen dants who employ choirs , and also what John Knox called the " kist fit ' o whistles . " The same persons who originally opposed chants , opposed also organs and even choirs. * But the thing which they chiefly sought in their sacred music , and which is now scarcely attempted-the participation of the people generally in the exercise-may be more easily secured in a plain chant than in most of the hymn-tunes now in use . And on the score of taste , this style of singing is found to be acceptable wherever it has been tried , not only among the performers , but to the lovers of sacred music generally , and at the same time interesting to other hearers , as prose anthems always have been , on account of its distinct utterance of sacred language . It has been introduced into a considerable number of our churches , and finds growing favor ; though many of the most intelligent and esteemed worshipers , especially in those congregations that have no organs , still confine their preferences on this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In agreement with the view here taken , a large selection of portions of the Psalms and other scriptures , in our received prose versions , is appended to the hymns in the new Connecticut Collection . As to those portions of the Psalms which , as Dr. Watts maintained , require adaptation , in order to he properly used in the worship of Christian assemblies , his argument and method appear to us on examination * As late as 1771 , the White Haven society ( since joined with the Fair Haven , in the " United Society " ) " voted , That those persons who are singers in this congregation , he desired to sit in the gallery together , " which " prohahly was the first formation of a regular choir " in that congregation . In the same year the church hy vote selected the tunes to he sung , limiting the number to thirty , and afterwards to twenty five . See Rev. Mr. Dutton 's Hist. of North Church in New Haven , p. 66 , note . // only the more satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt as our own , either their personal or national peculiarities . That which David sung as a king or as a Jew , rather than as a saint , can not be appropriately sung by Christians as the expression of their homage . There is no more reason why they should address God in his language , any further than the same condition and experience are common to him and them , than why they should thus adopt the language of any other inspired man . That many things in the Psalms relate to the peculiar history or circumstances of their authors , can not be questioned . It is equally certain that when ordinary Christian worshipers now use such passages intelligently , they modify them , as far as they are able , in reference to such a use . Why then should not this work of adaptation be performed in their behalf , more satisfactorily , by competent writers bestowing time and care on the subject , instead of being left to every individual to be done hastily and imperfectly as he finds occasion ? this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be claimed for any other writer . Indeed , so far as David or the other Psalmists were themselves concerned , either as Jews or as individuals , in the meaning of their own sacred hymns , we suppose the propriety . of thus adapting such passages , if they were to be used at all , would hardly have been questioned . But in that view , the Psalms would not have had the importance now attached to them , and hence , the method of using them would not bave been a subject of so much solicitude on either side . The evangelical significance couched within or under their personal , local or temporary meaning , has ever invested them with their most sacred interest . Some passages being thus interpreted , under an obvious warrant from the New Testament , as relating to Christ and the Gospel , many readers have discovered or imagined similar allusions in every passage , and Christians generally have agreed in thus understanding , perhaps , the greater part of the book . When , therefore , the Psalms seem to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their countrymen , rather than to those of Christian worshipers , they are understood not only of David , but of David 's Lord-not only of " the blood of bulls and of goats , " but of " the blood of Christ " - not only of the chief city in Judea , but of * the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . " Hence , such Psalms have been cherished as of perpetual and vital significance . For the same reason , as Watts maintained , they ought to be in such a form , or so modified and adapted , that ordinary worshipers may employ them intelligently . Their Christian sentiment should be available for common Christian use . As originally composed , they but obscurely intimated that truth with which we are chiefly concerned , and which is revealed to us distinctly in the New Testament . When we employ them as our own in addressing God , why should we retaintheir obscurity , just as if we had received no light ? They anticipated certain facts recorded in the gospels ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prophecy , when to us they have become history ? Why should we express ourselves in the typical and shadowy language of the Old Testament , as if we were not acquainted with the New ? And why should we employ such representations of the truth in singing , any more than in prayer and preaching ? The advocates of the older versions maintain the evangelical meaning of the Psalms , and its preeminent worth , as earnestly as Dr. Watts ; and probably they suppose the worshipers to ascertain it for // themselves . The supposition , however , is contrary to the fact ; for though a mind constituted and trained like bishop Home 's , could fancy such a meaning , even where it was not to be found , ordinary worshipers , whose wants ought to be chiefly regarded in all that pertains to prayer and praise , rest in the more obvious sense of the words employed , nor can they be expected , where this sense appears foreign or unsatisfactory , to penetrate beyond it , nor to discriminate between real and imaginary allusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some such reference by the Apostles . And when a Psalm , which , on the face of it , relates only to David , is still sung by Christian assemblies because it may be understood of the Savior , why should it not be in such a form that they will thus understand it , and may therefore employ it with propriety ? The song itself , in which they are supposed to celebrate the Savior , instead of being to them virtually an " unknown tongue , " as it is confessedly in many instances , should at least suggest its own interpretation . This was Dr. Watts 's design . One objection , however , against the literal versions , he does not seem to have noticed , and it is urged against some of his own versions . If we can not properly adopt the language of David any farther than the same condition is common to him and ourselves , how can we properly adopt the Savior 's language except so far as our cundition resembles his ? If when common Christians praise God , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a king , still less should they personate the suffering or the exalted Messiah . The 69th Psalm , for example , on account of the incident and reference in John xix , 28 , 29 , is interpreted as spoken by the Psalmist , not only in his own person , but in that of Christ . The 4th verse , ( to which we have already referred , ) and several others , manifestly can not be truly uttered by worshipers generally , as relating to themselves ; they must be sung , if adopted in the letter , in the name either of the Psalmist or of the Savior . Is there not incongruity , or even irreverence , in a congregation 's praising God by enacting the part of another , even of him whom they worship ? A divine promise or invitation may be interwoven with the song , as its theme or burden ; but if the song itself be the language of God to man , rather than of man to God , it better befits an orchestra than a choir-it belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other kinds of poetry and music , the boldest personations have their , place ; but in worship , they are dramatic rather than devout . In the instance cited , our readers may observe that Dr. Watts , while in every version he refers the Psalm explicitly to the sufferings of Christ , in the first and second parts of the common metre retains the form of the sufferer speaking , except in one or two stanzas ; but in the third part , and in the long metre , makes the worshipers speak in their own persons concerning him , which is one reason why the latter versions have been used almost to the exclusion of the former . On the other hand , the chief argume mit against the adaptation in question has always been , that the double sense of the Psalms is a part of their divine method ; and that since their author , through the inspired writers , impressed on them this twofold character , of an obvious or literal meaning , and an evangeli. cal significance partially . hidden , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . comes us to copy the same charact*r as exactly as possible in every use we make of them . Thus Mr. Keble , in the preface to his version , which we have mentioned , feeling himself required to show why " the evangelical meaning of the Psalms // is not " there " so much brought out as it might have been , " presents the old argument in language characteristic of his school . " it seemed the more dutiful and correct , " he says , " and therefore , in the end , surely the more edifying way , to represent in this respect also , as nearly as possible , the tenor of the Hebrew verity : to observe the rule which he who spake by the prophets has ( if it may be so said ) appointed for himself in all his communications to mankind ; to disclose , rather than exhibit , his dealings and his will ; to keep himself , to the generality , under a veil of reserve , " &amp;c . All this would be pertinent , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be translated , for the devout study of all Christians ; or rather it would be superfluous , since no one has pr6posed to supplant them by any gloss or paraphrase ; and perhaps Keble 's version was designed only to be read as a translation , in verse . But as to the subject before us , his argument can only amount to this-that in all ages after the coming of the Savior , that event should be celebrated with the same obscurity of language in which the wisdom of God saw fit to predict it a thousand years before !  --  or that Christians ought to employ , as the language of their worship , the very representations of truth which God once gave to the Jews , instead of accommodating them to the more perfect representations he has since given to themselves ! As well might we be required to resume the Mosaic ritual , and grope our way to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ through all the shadows which his Gospel has dissipated . The statement needs rio comment . The same writer remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems , this surely ( this reserve , or partial obscurity ) is a quality which we should expect to find in them : a certain combination of reserve with openness being of the very essence of poetry . " rrhe latter clause is just in criticism , as well as happily phrased . It would be absurd to turn the Psalms , or other poems , into didactic essays in verse , or to dilute them in prosaic commentaries , for lyric purposes . But this is as far from the method proposed by Dr. Watts , as from Mr. Keble 's ; and as to the effect , it can not be pretended that his paraphrases , in the judgment of modern worshipers , have less of " the essence of poetry " in them than the more literal versions . He only desired to make the evan gelical Psalms as those who use them , as hymns . " Re serve , " as a quality of composition , is of course relative , depending partly on the capacity of readers . So far as it lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Psalms must have had less of this character to the Jews than to us ; but more of it to them , so far as it lay in evangelical sentiment ;  --  and for us to express such sentiment in their language , without modification , would seem to be the affectation of reserve , throwing a veil over what we have been able to see clearly . And in respect to all poetry , the question , how far such a quality is proper or allowable , must depend on the people for whom it is intended , and the use they are to make of it . An epic may be none the worse , if many passages require a patient perusal in order to be felt ; but a ballad , that is to be sung at all times by a whole nation , must make itself understood instantly and universally . No compositions are more strictly popular in their design than metrical Psalms ; and they are obviously unfitted for the use and benefit of the common people , so far as they fail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such compositions , because the occasions of their use , besides recurring frequently , are chiefly religious rather than intellectual-not // stimulating nor tasking the understanding for its own sake , but employing it as a channel to the heart . For other purposes , it may be well that the unlearned reader should " study out " if he can , the most obscure examples of the double sense to be found in the Psalms , and such men as Prof. Keble might always prefer to detect the reserved meaning for themselves ; but the forms in which Christians generally are to express evangelical truths and emotions in the worship of God , ought to be plain and unequivocal . We will only add , on this general subject , that the evangelical paraphrase or imitation of a Psalm , though it can not claim the authority of a literal version , will generally have some advantage over a mere hymn on the same topic , from the relation it bears to the divine original . It expresses one of the two senses which are supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence it has a value above a merely human composition , for all who allow such an interpretation . The evangelic sense is , indeed , taken out of its mystical connection ; it is seen palpably by itself , instead of being detected , as through a veil , unfolded within the Jewish or personal sense : yet it is , at least , a part of the inspired thought , as certainly as the interpretation is correct . As to the principle of interpretation itself , or the doctrine of the double sense , we need not enter into it here , since the question before us lies between parties who agree cordially in such an understanding of many portions of the Psalms . But to those who reject this method of interpretation , the imitation of a psalm still has a character and value of its own . It stands related to the original as its model . If not of the same material , it is cast in the same mould ; if it does not coincide , it runs parallel with the psalm . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be governed by the same rules , as the imitations of classic authors , which were so common with the English poets of the last century . The author is at least assisted and guided by the inspired poet , and may thus produce a better sacred lyric than if he wrote wholly from himself , though with inferior credit for originality . His model is a guaranty against extravaga ace , or sheer inanity . The imitation of Hebrew poetry will not be a vague conceit , beaten out to a prescribed compass , with clinking syllables . Accordingly , paraphrases and imitations of the Psalms are often better than the hymns of the same author , in every quality of a good poem , and still more frequently in the qualities proper to a sacred lyric , or in suitableness to public worship . Even in respect to Dr. Watts , who is acknowledged to have excelled any other writer in both kinds of composition , we believe that more of his hymns could be left out of new compilations than of his Psalms ; * and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to his familiar acquaintance with the inspired models of the latter . If we consult the true idea of worship , we must often complain of modern hymns for their morbidly subjective tone , whereas Psalms , whether versions or imitations , are objective rather ; the hymns , analyze emotions , when the Psalms express them . The difference is often overlooked ; or what we have indicated as the merit of the Psalms may have been hastily reckoned a deficiency ; for which reason , and also from the want of * We refer to the number ofhis Psalms , or parts of Psalms , rather than to the whole number of his pieces under that name , as one is oftea only a repetition of another in a different metre ; for example , Ps. 93 , L. M. and P. M. , Ps. 148 , P. M. and S. M. His book is most judiciously abridged , by omitting not only occasional stanzas in a long series , but whole pieces , wherever the same matter is better wrought out in another metre . // 326 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit-selections , especially with young ministers . We commend this point to the attention of those who conduct the devotions of assemblies with more regard to the subject of their discourse than to the true idea of worship . Notwithstanding the differences of opinion , and opposition of feeling , which any considerable change in religious us ages always occasions , Watts 's Psalms soon made their way , as we have seen , to the place they were intended to occupy in various respectable and xvide spread bodies of Christian worshipers. in some congregations , his Psalms were for a time probably the only book employed , hut generally his hymns were added , and the whole collection , without abridgment or revision , was used to the exclusion of all other similar compositions . To this day , besides being the chief source from which all compilations are drawn , it is retained , as he left it , in most of the English churches in which it was once adopted ; and their later most popular collections , such as Rippon 's , Russel 's and Conder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congregational and Presbyterian churches in this country still sine no Psalms but his , allowing no changes in these , or in his three books of hymns , ( excepting in national allusions , ) and only adding Worcester 's selection . the Baptist churches , too , have had their " Winchel 's Watts . " These supplernents have even added to his three books other hymns of his own , found in his " Lyric Poems , " which he was too fastidious to propose for public worship . Thus , his original work has been left by itself , as if it were so far canonical that whatever might be appended to it , nothing could properly be mixed with it , and some anathema might light upon the churches that should " take away from the words of the book . " hay ing overcome a superstitious opposition , it became the object of a superstitious veneration . Time , however , serves to correct the one error as it did the other . In Connecticut for nearly sixty years , the Congregational churches have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hooks ; * but all of his Psalms , with cert in modifications and additions , down to a recent date . " After the American revolution , " says Dr. Dwight , in the preface to his collection , " it became early the general wish of the churches and congregations in this country , that such passages in Dr. Watts 's version of the Psalms as were local , and inapplicable to our own circumstances , might be altered and made to accord with those circumstances . " lie adds , " In several succeeding instances , such an alteration has been made . " We are not informed , however , of more than one formal or authorized undertaking of this kind before his own . As early as the year 1787 , the General Association of Connecticut entrusted this work to Joel Barlow , then somewhat famous as a poet , and since notorious at least for his " Vision of Columbus , " which grew into " The Columbiad . " Besirles adapting those passages that were local or national , to the new condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often really amended , the phraseology of other passages , and also versified the Psalms which Watts had omitted .

For example , by a slight change ( perhaps not needed yet extensively followed ) he avoids a form now nearly or quite obsolete , in Ps. 89 , beginning , " With reverence let , " &amp;c. , in 2d stanza , putting " rise " for " be " in 1st line , and transposing in the 3d thn*- " with thee that ries . " His change of Watts 's 2d piece on the // pily executed , especially his modification of Watts 's 75th Psalm , which may be found in the latest Connecticut collection , applying it to the American revolution , instead of the English of 1688 .

P. 1W , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and of the 137th , " Along the banks , " &amp;c. , which have been much admired , and a few others . Generally , however , his pieces were neither close versions nor spirited imitations , and though smooth and correct , had little positive merit . In the revision of Dr. Watts , he seems to have gone beyond the design of his employers , making so many verbal changes , which were needless or trivial , and sometimes worse , that his readers must have been offended by the violence done to their sacred associations. * To the Psalms he added a selection of seventy hymns taken from Dr. Watts . We know not how generally the book was at first adopted , but the compiler soon gave it an ill odor among the good people of Connecticut . As a licensed preacher , he had been a chaplain in the army , and was at this time a lawyer , but presently went abroad , became active in French revolutionary politics , and was supposed to have imbibed French irreligion . Such a mans s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and probably it was on account of the unhappy notoriety which his foreign career gave him at home , that no trace of him , no version nor verbal amendment from his edition of the Psalms , found its way into the work afterwards 100th Ps. , by omitting 1st stanza , and beginning the 2d , " Before Jehovah 's awful throne , ye nations bow " - has been generally adopted , and partly in Worcester 's *Vatts. * We observe that a Presbyterian Assembly , which has been jealous of New England innovations , has yet retained in the last collection of Psalms put forth under its s*nction , many or most of Barlow 's alterations , which were long since eschewed in the region where they originated . prefaced for the same purpose and at the request of the same ecclesiastical body , by the tutor and friend of his youth , Dr. Dwight . The name of Dwight has become familiar on the Psalm-book to many thousands who could not so well estimate his higher and wider fame . He was requested by the General Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work anew , " the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church concurring with them " in this important business . " His " alterations and additions " were examined and recommended by a joint committee of the two bodies , and the book was published , according to the date of the preface , in the year 1800 . The account there given of the origin and the design of the work , and the person chosen to execute it , show that the utmost care was taken in this matter . The selection of hymns , from various authors , was perhaps no part of the original design , or it was a subordinate part ; * but though smaller than is now desired , it has always been esteemed a most judicious and valuable compilation . The chief object was " to accommodate " Watts 's Psalms " to the state of the American churches , and to supply the deficiency of those Psalms which Dr. Watts had omitted .

Other compilers may learn a lesson from the modesty and forbearance of so competent a critic . " I should have ventured farther , " he says , " had I not been originally cautioned to make no alterations , except those which appear to be either absolutely necessary or plainly important . " His own versions , which are thirty three in number , make us regret that he did not attempt other hymns . He is now more favorably known as a poet by these , than by the longer and more ambitious productions of his earlier days . Some of them keep their place in the memory and the heart , by the side of Watts 's best . Besides the affluence of language , the clear and comprehensive thought ahd the lofty solemnity of feeling which characterize his sermons , these pieces have the simplicity and directness which are the most indispensable qualities of a sacred lyric . We need only refer to Psalm 88th , L. M. . and S. M. and 137th , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether Watts was not wiser in omitting some of the Psalms , than our General Association in attempting to supply the deficiency . His design being to apply the Psalms " to the Christian state and worship , " for that reason , as he tells us , he " entirely omitted some whole Psalms , and large pieces of many others , " * in the new Conn. collection , a part of the 88th Ps . S. M. , by Dwight , on account of the length of the whole , is in Hy. 668 ; and part of his 137th , pt. 2 , L. M. in Hy. 569 . His 28th Ps. , C. M. , though less known , is scarcely less impressive than the above mentioned . and chose such parts only as seemed to him susceptible of such a modification . Now if others have written good poems , and even admirable hymns , on the passages he omitted , still they do not seem to have succeeded in what he shrunk from undertaking ; they have not carried out his idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paraphrase , which , as Watts apprehended , is not in those cases suited to ordinary worship , or they have departed from the Psalm so far as to give us not even an imitation , but rather a hymn partially related to it . Thus on the 88th Psalm , Dwight 's C. M. , which comes the nearest to a paraphrase or imitation , is seldom if ever used , being made the complaint of the Savior , or of a worshiper in extraordinary circumstances ; while his two admirable pieces in L. M. have no other relation to the Psalm than as founded on one interpretation of three verses . And on the 137th Psalm , his piece beginning " 1 love thy kingdom , Lord , " is one of the most beautiful hymns ever written , but not an imitation of the Psalm , except as it breathes the same general sentiment , and borrows the imagery of two verses ; and Barlow 's piece , which is a well executed version , for that very reason can not be appropriately employed in worship , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The original Psalm , pathetic and affecting as any thing in the Bible or out of it , has been versifled by other still more eminent poets , but with inferior success. * Dr. Watts has sometimes exposed himself to similar criticism , according to his own principles , as in the 69th Psalm , where some of his pieces follow the original so closely , upon one interpretation , as to be seldom used , * Our readers will find a choice and finished piece ( from an unknown author , ) which stands related to this Psalm as a Christian response , in the new Conn. collection , Hy. 597. // and the others , which are justly popular , are more properly hymns than either paraphrases or imitations . In the case of those Psalms which he omitted , allowance must be made to other writers who have attempted them , for difficulties which he knew not how to overcome . " When the reader is informed , " says Dwight , " that Dr. Watts was discouraged from attempting these , I am persuaded that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nor are his sacred lyrics to which we have referred , really the less valuable for being rather hymns than Psalms . Dr. Dwight 's volume kept its place " for more than thirty years . " His selection of hymns , however , was felt to be too limited , * and singers complained that it had none of the new meters required by the modern tune-books . To obviate the same objections against Watts 's hymns , Dr. Worcester had published his supplement , which was enlarged by his son Prof. Worcester , in 1834 ; and for the same purpose in 1833 a supplemeat to Dwight 's selection was edited by Rev , Dr. Bacon , containing 227 additional hymns from various authors . But to make all later hymns an appendix to Watts 's three books , ( especially as his first is not conveniently distinguished from his second , ) or to the other more methodical compilation , subjects the whole work to a radical defect of arrangement , as Prof. Worcester acknowledges in his preface , and every new enlargement , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no good reason why other hymns and other Psalms also , if worthy of being sung at all , should not be intermingled and incorporated with those of Watts , instead of being merely appended . Partly on this * " tad I followed my own judgment only , ' he says , " the collectiun would have been somewhat larger , but I found several judicious divines of opinion that it would be expedient to make it still less . " account , the books we have named have failed to satisfy many congregations . In the changes thus far noticed , Watts 's Psalms , which at first had been more jealously received as a more questionable innovation than his hymns , were more sacredly regarded , being all scrupulously retained in those books which omitted many of the latter . But as prejudice wore away with the lapse of time , it came to be understood that even under this head , some of his pieces and a larger number of his stanzas , which were seldom read and perhaps never sung , might be dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , and that the space they occupy is needed for other pieces of higher acknowledged merit in the same department . That there were also inaccuracies and blemishes in his work was too obvious to be questioned . To say these things is no impeachment of his predminent skill in this kind of composition , but only of his absolute perfection . The wonder is not that the most gifted author of sacred lyrics in our language should have written unequally , or that after more than a century his few inferior poems should give way 10 the best selections from later authors ; but that the contrary should have been expected or claimed for any writer - that. every thing written by any uninspired man can be thought worthy of a perpetual and almost exclusive place in public worship . Watts never stood higher in discriminating public esteem than now , and never received higher enconiums from accomplished critics than of late years . At the same time , the imperfections that could not but attend sucl* a work as his have been more readily acknowledged , and the conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of this nature , both his hymns and Psalms require abridgment and correction . There are those now who // stand up for every thing from his pen , with the same dogged pertinacity with which their fathers stood out against it ; * but there are always persons of this sort whom every advance of public opinion must leave behind . As long ago as the year 1815 , Dr. Worcester published his " Christian Psalmody , " in which he ventured to omit some of Watts 's Psalms , but the churches were not then prepared for such an innovation even under his auspices.t the plan of incorporating the best versions , paraphrases or imitations , from Watts , with those of other authors , in one body of Psalms , was first adopted , so far as we can learn , by the Reformed Dutch Church in this country , in the collection edited by Rev. Dr. Livingston , in the year 1813 . But the first innovation of this kind among the churches that had used only Watts or Dwight before , was in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By rejecting much inferior matter , and filling its place with brief selections suitable for singing , from various authors , with special reference to musical expression , this work found favor particularly with choirs , and has supplanted the older books in many congregations . On the other hand it has been complained of for omissions and alterations that were needless or worse , and especially for regarding musical adaptation rather than poetic merit . Without further comparative criticism on this and more recent compilations , we must say that though the Church Psalmody omitted some things that we would have retained and altered others that we would have let alone , it gives many proofs of the taste and skill of the editors in amending really exceptionable passages ; and to this source one or two later compilers have allowed themselves to be too much indebted without apology or acknowledgment . In respect to the Psalms particularly , it was novel in design , except as it may have been modeled after the English work we have before mentioned , " Pratt 's Collection , " from which many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom of its selections prepared the churches for other books every way better fitted for the uses of public worship than any single author 's collected versions . This experiment stimulated competition . We are acquainted with at least six compilations , * that have been since issued , and are now used to some extent , among the Congregational , Presbyterian and Baptist churches of this country . We have not room here , and the undertaking might seem too invidious , to compare these books particularly . In extent and variety they are greatly in advance of those with which " our fathers worshiped . " With one exception they all keep the Psalms and hymns apart , and all incorporate those of Dr. Watts with others from various sources . None of them include all his hymns , and only one retains all his Psalms , while still his pieces , in * We have heard of a man who admitted that some stanzas of Watts might be properly erased , but protested he would not allow any man to erase for him That is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us it " was very favorably received , " but on account ofthe strong " predilection of the community for Watts entire , " his father virtually abandoned it , and edited the work known as " Watts and Select Hymnns " - in which the Psalms enclosed in brackets we understand to have been the ones before omitted . * The General A ssembly shook , ( issued or revised ; ) the Christian Psalmist ( at N. Y. by Hastings &amp; Patton ) ; and within the last five years , the Church Psalmist ( Dr. Beman 's ) ; the Psalmist ( Baptist ) ; Parish Psalmody , ( at Philadelphia , ) and the Congregational , or Cortuecticut General Association 's Collection . The Parish Psalmody retains all of Watts 's Psalms , though interspersing others . Did the compilers confbrmn it to what they could not but consider an unreasonable prejudice ? The Baptist collection intermingles psaltnis arid hymns without distinction . // both kinds , far exceed in number as in quality , those of any other writer , and every new compiler thus honors him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent of these collections , prepared hy the Connecticut General Association , is noticed more at large in another article . The fact that within a few years so many works of this kind have been issued with so much care and expense , indicates the lively interest felt by the Christian community in that department of worship to which they belong . And the more we all acquaint ourselves with the materials of lyric devotion now accumulated in our language , the more may we enter into the experience and reverence the memory , not only of the Hebrew , but of the English Psalmist , who taught us to sing " The hill of ' Zion yields A thousand sacred sweets , Before we reach the heavenly fields , Or walk the golden streets . " Then let our songs abound , And every tear he dry ; We 're marching through Immanuel 's groun d To fairer world 's on high . "
