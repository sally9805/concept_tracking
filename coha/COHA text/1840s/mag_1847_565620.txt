txt OUR associated enterprises for the propagation of Christianity , at home and abroad , have become almost the greatest of the material and visible interests of the Christian commonwealth . So the world changes . When the London Missionary Society and the Baptist Missionary Society were formed , it was little imagined , even by the most enthusiastic , that in those movements there was the first indication , the first visible stage-we will not say the cause or source-of a new order of things , which in half a century would affect all Christendom , and which would act irresistibly on all the relations of churches to each other , on the development and culture of piety , on the administration of the gospel in the pulpit , and even on theological dogmas . But so it is . The Church Missionary Society in England is the manifestation and the organ of a movement in the Church of England , which Canterbury can not con4 trol , and against which Oxford , in her counter-movement , struggles with only a limited success . We are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic . We have no sighs to breathe for the good old days , as some esteem them , when the spirit of aggression against the empire of darkness , slumbered in the church . There are dangers , no doubt , in an age of activity and of religious enterprises . There is danger , especially , that important truths may be forgotten or undervalued in the zeal and hurry of the movement . But in our view there is more danger on the whole-more danger even to theology , in an age of stagnation . The church awakened to an active sympathy with the design of the gospel , and entering earnestly into the work of the world 's conversion , is not more likely to fall into error , than the church inactive and guided by doctors who can only dogmatize and argue . We would have it understood then that when we speak of the change which has come upon Christendom within the last half century , and which is still in progress-the change which has made our great voluntary associations for propagating the gospel so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God grant that the churches may never go back to their " old ways " in respect to effort for the diffusion of the gospel around them , and its extension through the world . Not only is the magnitude to which some of our leading benevolent societies have attained , far beyond what could have been anticipated by the most sagacious or the most sanguine when the system was originated ; but the relations which they hold to churches and pastors by their agencies and publications , and the multiplicity of the interests which they indirectly but powerfully affect , are of such moment as to require constant vigilance against that tendency to perversion which is inseparable from all things human . A vague feeling of the importance of guarding against such perversion  --  a half suppressed uneasiness about the power which is supposed to be accumulating in the hands of secretaries and executive committeesexists to an extent which makes some inquiry and discussion necessary . In the progress of new enterprises and movements , it is a thing of course that new problems will present themselves for solution - questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trust committed to the executive department of a great benevolent society is a trust in many respects peculiar . Though in most cases it is chiefly in the hands of // ministers of the gospel , it is altogether distinct from the appropriate and higher work of the ministry . It is for the most part that " service of tables " from which the apostles , as ministers of the word of God , desired to be relieved . It requires therefore different gifts from those which are employed in the work of proclaim . ing and teaching the gospel . This we say not by any means in disparagement of the office , or as de . siring to detract from its dignity . On the contrary we hold that it requires , for the full discharge of its duties , not merely the ordinary capacity and integrity of upright business men , but the highest degree of diligence , wisdom , disinterestedness and devotedness . The men who in the providence of God are called to exercise such*a " ministry , " not of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Christian community , and who in that service " disburse with simplicity , " " rule with diligence , " and " perform their ministry of beneficence with cheerfulness , " are to be esteemed very highly in love for their work 's sake ; not less than those who being called to serve the church in the way of preaching op/Trhx perform that functions each in the proportion of his gifts , the teacher earnestly intent upon his teaching , and he who has the high faculty of persuasion and excitement employing that faculty to the utmost . The special work which Jeremiah Evarts was privileged to do for the church , though it falls into entirely another category from the work of those who labor in word and doctrine , was not on that account necessarily inferior , either in dignity or in usefulness , to the work of the most learned teacher , or of the most eloquent and persuasive preacher , of the age to which he belonged . Those who are now standing in places analogous to that which he occupied in his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity and the freedom as well as the progress and outward advancement of the church . Their office is one which , considered merely as an office , and without reference to the personal endowments of those who happen to hold it , is an office of the highest moment in the religious world . There are men whom God sends into the world to be leaders in the highest sense ; men who form and sway opinion , and who control the thoughts and aspirations of their fellow men . The influence of such men is personal rather than official . God gives them endowments by which they make themselves felt in almost any station . To such men , the mechanical advantages of offi. cial rank and position , so necessary to men whose endowments however great are of another order , are an encumbrance rather than a help . The stately warrior may need all his equipments , helmet and buckler , sword and spear ; and not these only , but the marshaled host and all the art and pomp of war . But God 's anointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he needs no other weapon than his shepherd 's sling and the smooth pebble from the brook . If then it is easy to name men whose influence in the religious world is greater than that of those invested with official power in the greatest and most extended of our voluntary associations , it is equally easy to perceive , the moment they are named , that their influence is personal and not official . It is with a view not of producing controversy but of forestalling it by timely and amicable discussion , that we have determined to utter , in all Christian freedom , a few thoughts on a question to which the foregoing considerations naturally conduct us . Our question is none other than this ,  --  Ought the executive department of a great voluntary society , for missions or for any similar enterprise , to be really and formally responsible to anybody ? *-if so , to whom , and how ? What we have to // say on this subject is not unconsidered ; nor is it inconsiderately uttered . We have observed , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the action or policy of this or that great society , discussion is apt to grow confused because another question underlying the whole debate , has not been duly and clearly adjusted . That other question is , Who are the society ? - *- where is the control ? Shall the officers in the executive department govern the whole movement , responsible only to God ? Or shall they be under the government of some constituency ? And this is the question which we propose for consideration . For the sake of convenience , and that we may have to do with tangible instances , we will speak of two societies in particular ,  --  the American Board of Foreign Missions , and the American Tract Society . We speak of these two rather than of some others , because these are perhaps the most conspicuous of all our voluntary societies ; because they are entirely unlike in the form of their constitutions , and because by the very great diligence and skill with which their affairs have been conducted the " Prudential Committee " and secretaries of the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , have earned , and have obtained , to an indefinite extent , the confidence of the religious public . Our question divides itself into two . First , Ought the executive administration of these and other like societies to be responsible to anybody ? And the responsibility which we are inquiring about , is , on the one hand , not virtual only but formal , and on the other hand , not nominal only but real . As the groundwork of an answer to this branch of the question , let us recollect a few dry but comprehensive facts . The revenue passing through the treasury of the Amencan Board of Foreign Missions dur ing the last financial year ( ending July 31 ) was $264,807 93 , including the interest of $73,098 40 of permanent funds , and not including the rent of $22,613 61 of the same funds vested in the house occupied by the Board for the transaction of its business at Boston . The revenues of the American Tract Society for the financial year ending April 15 , 1846 , were $153,916 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rents of the very valuable property owned by the Society at the corner of Nassau and Spruce streets , New York . The question relates to the responsibility of those to whom all this money is entrusted , and under whose immediate direction it is collected and expended . But the office of those who expend this money by their votes of appropriation , would be entirely dishonored if it were considered in no higher view than as a merely pecuniary trust . It is important then to recollect for what uses these funds are appropriated , and to what extent the operations which they sustain affect the welfare of our country and of the world . The Prudential Committee of the American Board has under its control , a mission in South Africa , one in West Africa , one in Greece , one in Turkey , one in Syria , one in Persia , five in British India , one in Siam , two in China , one in Borneo and one in the Sandwich Islands ; besides nine planted among the Indians of this continent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Choctaws beyond the Mississippi , and from the remnants of the Six Nations in New York , to the intractable and nameless tribes of Oregon . At the ninety.three stations included in these twenty-six missions , there are employed one hundred and thirtyfour ordained missionaries , ten of whom are also physicians ; five physicians not ordained ; twenty-eight assistant missionaries , laboring as // schoolmasters or printers , or in other more secular works connected with the missions ; and , including the wives of the missionaries , who are all considered as in the service of the Board and under the direction of the committee , one hundred and seventy-five " female assistant missionaries . " All these are Americans ; but these are not the only laborers in the missionary field . Twenty-five native preachers , in the various countries occupied by the missions , and one hundred and thirtytwo other native helpers ( not counting an indefinite number of native teachers of free schools ) swell the aggregate of the laborers at the missions , who are principally and directly dependent on the Board for support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without repeating the details of the number of churches and church members ,  --  the number of schools and seminaries and colleges with their pupils ,  --  The number of printing establishments , the presses and fonts of type , and the type and stereotype foundries ,  - -  and the number of languages in which printing is executed at the various missions-will sufficiently refresh the reader 's recollections in regard to the extent of the foreign operations of the Board . At the same time , it should be rememl ) ered that the domestic operations of the Board must needs be in some proportion to the extent of its operations abroad . During the last year , the expenses in the home department , including agencies for the collection of funds ,  --  publ ications designed to diffuse missionary intelligence , and to guide the public mind ,  --  the support of three secretaries and a treasurer , all of whom devote their whole time to the business of the institution ,  --  and a variety of miscellaneous expenditures incidental to the work-amounted to $25,798 84 , without including the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Tract Society expend a portion of their revenues in foreign countries ; though as yet they have sent abroadno missionaries , " colporteurs , " or other agents , from this country . Thus their report for the last year , shows appropriations to various evangelical missions in heathen and Mohammedan countries , and to various kindred societies and committees in Europe , amounting in all to $15,000 . I3ut to the Tract Society , the great field for its beneficence and power is in ' our own country . According to the Report before us , one hundredandseventy. five men were in the service of the committee , as " colporteurs , " " superintendents of colportage , " and " volume agents , " for the whole or for various portions of the last year . Some of these men are ministers of the gospel ; others are theological students or candidates for the ministry ; others are laymen , represented as men of good sense , good information and active religious zeal . But though these men are called by the undignified name of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to those who know not what it means  --  the itinerant vending of books is by no means their exclusive or their highest function . They might rather be called lay evangelists ; for it is their business to preach not only conversationally and from house to house , but in the way of continuous discourse wherever they can gather an assembly . It appears from the treasurer 's report , that the expenditures in the " colportage " department , for the last year , including the compensation of one of the secretaries and a clerk , and excluding the cost of books given away ,  --  arnount. ed to $31,043 50 . The same report shows that the aggregate expenditure of the year for the manufacture of books and other publications , including what was paid to authors and translators and for revision , was $90,603 91 . Another // comprehensive charge is for " services and expenses of general agents , " the amount of which is $5,709 45 . These general agents , seven in number , devote themselves , each in his own field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans and operations of the society before the churches and securing their cooperation ; " - in a word , their business is to collect money by preaching and personal solicitation . The extent of the Society 's business is indicated by the fact that aside from all that is done in the department of " colportage , " which , as we have already seen , gives full employment to one secretary assisted by a clerk , the charge for the services of two other corresponding secretaries , an assistant secretary and assistant treasurer , a depositary , and seven clerks and assistants in the various offices of the Society 's house in Nassau street , amounts to $7,884 61 ; and no man who knows those secretaries can doubt either that they are hardworking men , giving their strength to their business in a self-sacrificing spirit ,  --  or that the assistants and clerks that work under them , are obliged to earn their wages . 1-lere then we see a yearly revenue of $*264,00O controlled by one committee at Boston , and a yearly revenue of $154,000 controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pecuniary trust , we see under the control of each committee a great system of arrangements for acting on public opinion ,  --  secretaries , agents , anniversaries , presses , and the affection and enthusiasm connected with a great evangelical movement . Our question is , Ought these committees to be , formally and really , responsible to some constituency ? We can not doubt that our readers are prepared , nay were quite ready at the outset , to answer our question in the affirmative . But we would have them distinctly conscious of the reasons why the men that hold such trusts ought to be thus responsible . We do not find those reasons , and we presume our readers will not find them , in any distrust of the individuals who at the present time happen to hold this power ; for we have all the confidence in their integrity , their . devotedness , and their experience , that can be demanded . Our reasons , on the contrary , are such as these : 1 . A true responsibility of the executive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mismanagement and the gradual perversion of the trust . Security against fraudulent mismanagement is not what we speak of* So far as strict business fidelity is concerned , we do not think that any thing would be lost if the Prudential Committee of the American Board , and the Executive Committee of the American Tract Society , as now existing , were formally authorized to fill all their own vacancies henceforward , and to manage matters at their own discretion , giving only suph reports to the public , through the press , and at anniversary meetings , as shall to them seem expedient . As to mere honesty , the members of each committee-seven in one instance and fifteen in the other-may safely enough be left to watch one another as well as their secretaries and the other agents under their control . The danger against which we would guard , is altogether of a different sort . Men acting in any great executive trust , if they are required at stated periods to give a full account of their proceedings , and if they know that their policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eclat of its success , but is to be continually reviewed in its details by other minds , will be more likely to act wisely than if they act simply at their own discretion . And should they err , as they easily may , in consequence of devoting their minds too engrossingly to the one // particular interest which they have in hand , their errors are more likely to be immediately discovered and corrected . Great perversions of trusts like these , whenever they occur , are made for the most part unconsciously , gradually , and with the best intentions . 2 . We come then to another reason for making the executive administration of these societies , truly and formally responsible to some definite constituency . Such resporisibility is a security against the dangerous accumulation of power in a few hands . The grand palladium of political liberty is that there shall be no power , and especially no administrative power , without responsibility . Power , and especially executive power , if placed in irresponsible hands , grows and accumulates till nothing but the violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power which is necessarily involved in the administration of these great societies , and of others like them , and which must necessarily be entrusted to a few hands , should be carefully guarded and bounded by corresponding responsibility . But we need not spend time in the illustration of this point . 3 . There is another argument , more pressing if not more important . An irresponsible executive at the head of one of these great movements , is constantly liable to suspicion and assault , and has no legitimate protection . There are men , and in this country of ours they are not insignificant in numbers or in the faculty of making themselves felt , whose instinctive jealousies are kindled at the sight of power , and who can not rest till they have ascertained that there is some adequate security against the possible abuse of it . But it is not from these men only that jealousies may spring up , against an irresponsible executive at the head of an institution like those of which we are speaking . Suppose for example , that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee at Boston , could find no " Board " properly constituted for such business , to hear his complaint or appeal and to decide between him and the committee . Or suppose that when dissatisfaction arises in any quarter respecting the policy pursued by the committee at the Tract House in New York , the dissatisfied party could find no constituent body before which the grounds of its discontent could be fairly and freely discussed , and by which the errors of the committee could be overruled and corrected . How plain is it that in such a case the committee is placed in a most disadvantageous position . It is exposed to jealousy and misrepresentation on every side ; but it has no opportunity of meeting its accusers face to face , and defending itself openly and manfully against their erroneoi*is constructions or their unfriendly imputations. it is sensitive to every attack ; but it can not reply without some compro*. mise of dignity . And yet that official silence operates at once to irritate the jealousy that ought to be conciliated , and to put new weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation in such circumstances-and how unconsciously may it operate  --  to form a harsh judgment of the motives from which opposition proceeds , and then to act accordingly . How gradually , and in a sense unintentionally , may the whole apparatus of an extended organization , be employed to counteract the efforts , by destroying the influence and reputation , of the refractory individuals who in their selfconceit , or for some bye ends , have dared to embarrass the great and blessed cause . That these secretaries , then , and these administrative committees , ought to be responsible to somebody , is plain ; and the reasons are plain . But to whom , and how ? XVhat is the best arrangement for . effecting and maintaining the re*ponsibility // that is so desirable ? This is the second branch of our inquiry . And here our first position is , that a responsibility to the public at large , or to that portion of the public to which the enterprise looks for support , is not sufficient . Such a responsibility undoubtedly exists in every instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go along any faster , or any further , than it is sustained by public confidence in the quarters to which it looks for pecuniary contributions . In this view , the Board of Missions and the Tract Society , and all similar organizations , are responsible to the Christian community , and it is well in every respect that they are so . Such responsibility , however , is a responsibility of the society itself , as a whole ; it is a responsibility which exists in the necessity which the society is under , of commending its object and its methods to the largest possible number of individuals , in order to enlist the largest possible number of supporters and friends . But what we are inquiring after is not the responsibility of the society as a whole , to the public . Our inquiry is rather , who shall be the society ? Shall the executive administration , to wit , the secretaries and the committee , be the society , and be responsible in that capacity , directly and solely , to the public ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , to whom the committee shall be responsible , and who shall therefore be , within certain limits , responsible for the committee ? To make the committee responsible only to the public , is as much as to require that all the proceedings of the committee shall be publicly discussed , and that every man who feels himself in any manner aggrieved by their action in any case , or whose judgment differs from theirs on any serious question , shall appeal at once to the tribunal of the public , and shall prosecute his appeal by popular agitation . But in this idea of responsibility to the public , there is something of a fallacy which it may be worth the while to expose . Doubtless the Executive Committee of the American Tract Society are responsible to the public ; that is , whenever the public shall refuse to buy their books or to give them money , the committee will be obliged to abdicate . So is the emperor of Austria responsible to the people whom he governs . Whenever the people in all the pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their heads to overturn the government , and to run all the risks and make all the sacrifices involved in such a revolution , they can do it . And the emperor , or rather Metternich in his behalf , must needs conduct his administration with that possibility in view , and must consider well what the people will bear and what they will not bear . But he knows very well , and every body knows , that the people will bear a great deal before they will run all the hazards involved in a revolution . And besides all that , he has the means of influencing public opinion , to an unlimited degree , in favor of submission to his measures ; and he has the means of making the people submit to many things which they would soon reform if they could utter their thoughts freely and peacefully in a properly constituted representative assembly . Not altogether unlike to this , is the sense in which the executive administration of a great and popular institution , is responsible to the public . The object for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of intel. * ligent men , and tens of thousands of good people less intelligent , are not willing to give up because of any slight dissatisfaction with the manner in which the institution is conducted . The withholding of contributions is a desperate remedy and // will not be employed in respect to so great an enterprise , save in extreme cases . And not only so , but the administration of a great and popular society , instead of being passively governed by public opinion , is itself , to an indefinite extent , the creator of public opinion in respect to its own policy ; or more exactly , the creator of that public opinion on which it depends for its supplies . The entire system of agencies , correspondence , publications , and anniversary meetings , is a mighty machinery for forming and guiding public opinion . And many a man there is , not particularly deficient in moral courage , nor deficient in wisdom and conscientiousness , who , in any other than an absolutely desperate case , would not dare resist that machinery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw away his efforts and sacrifice himself to no purpose . But are not these societies responsible to the churches ?  --  to individual churches , and to those ecclesiastical bodies which may be considered as , in one sense or another , representing the churches ? Undoubtedly they are , and undoubtedly this relation between them and the churches is greatly for the welfare of both . But churches and ecclesiastical bodies , considered in reference to any control which they exert over our great societies , are only organs through which public opinion may manifest itself . Responsibility to the churches , then , is only one form of that responsibility to the public , of which we have already spoken ; just as responsibility to the press is another form of the same thing . The man who would bring the administrative committee of some great society to account , may write what he would say , and publish it in the uewspapers , or in a pamphlet ; or , he may set forth his views in a church meeting , or a presbytery , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general assem bly ; and the struggle which will ensue may serve at least to show whether his personal influence , or the official influence of the committee is the greater in that quarter . There are those who would make this responsibility to the churches more explicit , more methodical , and more complete . Instead of voluntary societies as we call them , they would have ecclesiastical boards to manage all benevolent enterprises . This is the system of the Methodists , and it has been adopted by the Episcopalians , and by the Presbyterians of the Annual Assembly . We have no admiration for such arrangements , and no confidence in them . Some of our " Old School " Presbyterian friends , we believe , are already beginning to suspect that the executive committee of an ecclesiastical board is in no vise better than the executive committee of a voluntary society ; and , indeed , that under the new arrangem entsby which the church , " as such , " and " in its distinctive character , " was to be a missionary society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and tracts ,  --  the " church , as such , " instead of governing the various executive committees is itself , even " in its ecclesiastical capacity , " likely to be governed by them . rfhat the executive committee of the Assembly 's Board of Publication is any more really under the control of their churches than the Executive Committee of the American Tract Society , may be doubted without incurring the guilt of temerity ; and that it is much more likely to make itself felt as a power in the General Assembly , and in subordinate judicatures , is too plain to be argued . When the churches of New England , having grown weary of Congregationalism , shall desire to establish a strong central government , let them set up at Boston a complete system of ecclesiastical boards fo* the conduct of all benevolent enterprises ; // and they will be as well provided for as the nature of the case will admit . Some of our readers may possibly entertain the notion that the anniversary public assembly , in the Broadway Tabernacle , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accepts it by a vote , and orders it to be printed , is the very constituency which we are inquiring for , and that here is a true and sufficient responsibility . Yet we hardly need to say that such meetings are not for business , but for exhibition-far more like a college commencement than like a deliberative assembly . The speeches made are so many orations , salutatory , valedictory , and the like , pronounced for the edification and gratification of the audience , rather than a free inquiry and debate touching the conduct of the committee . The candidate for a bachelor 's degree , who should dare , upon the commencement platform , to enter into a free examination of the doings of the college government , would hardly miss the mark more widely than the anniversary orator , who should venture to find fault with the proceedings of the committee by whose favor he was allowed to speak . And if any man whose name was not on the printed schedule , should be so " clean daft " as to rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his own private judgment , the huge columns of the Tabernacle would hardly endure the disorder . The conduct of Drs . Smith and Anthon , when , at the bishop 's call , they rose in the simplicity of their souls and protested against Mr. Carey 's ordination , was not more unrubrical . The best thing that the unlucky wight could do after offering such a speech or motion , would be to follow the example of the two doctors on the occasion referred to , who , when they saw that they had protested to no purpose , took their hats and walked out of the house . One other form of responsibility remains to be considered . rphe executive of any such institution may be made responsible to a board of managers . Such an arrangement , properly carried into effect , would leave nothing to be desired which the imperfection of all things human will permit . But in order that it may be properly carried into effect , several things are necessary , which are often disregarded . 1 . The board must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be constituted for that end . The society itself , considered as consisting of all who contribute to the enterprise , can not deliberatecannot be assembled for the transaction of any business , otherwise than in the fictitious manner of an anniversary meeting . The society , thus considered , can not be appealed to or argued with , otherwise than through the press . And its approbation or disapprobation of particular measures , can in no way be fairly and indisputably ascertained . The society is the public , and its opinion is public opinion . We say then , that the proper function of a board is that of trustees for the contributors , the living and the dead . 2. rf he board , then , should be a deliberative body . Its function should not begin and end with electing an executive committee . The annual reports of the administration should be examined by them , and should go forth to the public with their intelligent and deliberate approval . Plainly , then , the board should be so constituted , and its meetings should be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be a select body ; not too numerous for the transaction of business , not so numerous as to diminish the sense of individual responsibility in the members , not so numerous , nor so scattered , as to make it likely that those who are present at one meeting will all , or // nearly all , be absent from the next , and that there will be no corporate identity from one meeting to another . 4 . Its business must be supervision , not administration . Its relation to the executive department of the institution should be not unlike that of the corporation to the faculty in a well constituted and well conducted college . Its meetings therefore should be unfrequent , ordinarily not more than one in a year ; and each annual meeting should be long enough for a deliberate and faithful review of the administration of the year , and for the expression of a careful opinion on whatever questions may legitimately come before it . 5 . From these principles it follows that the members of such a board should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound of " aye , " in a great promiscuous assembly where nobody knows who votes or who has a right to vote . On the contrary they should be deliberately selected , and called to participate in the trust , by those who are most likely to act wisely and disinterestedly . Above all they should not be appointed directly or indirectly by the executive officers whom it is their duty to supervise . Let the board of managers be thus constituted ; let the executive committee be their committee appointed by them and giving account to them ; and a real and effective responsibility is secured . Such an arrangement is manifestly safer in respect to the great interests concerned , pecuniary and moral , ecclesiastical and religious , than any other that we can conceive . Such an arrangement , we doubt riot , will be more effectual than any other in obtaining public confidence , and in retaining it through all agitations and changes . An arrangement of this kind is provided for theoretically , in all the great societies . Yet practically , in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rea son that some or all of the obvious principles of the case are disregarded . The tendency of the trust to slide into the hands of the executive , and to rest there without any real responsibility , seems almost irresistible . We will illustrate this by referring once more to the two great institutions which we have already named so often , and then our word will have been spoken . The theory of the Tract Society is plain enough . There is an " Executive Committee , " elected by a " Board of Directors , " and therefore immediately responsible to that board . The Directors are a deliberative body with powers to " direct " the system and policy of the institution , part of them annually appointed to that trust by the members of the society , the others constituted for life by the payment of fifty dollar subscriptions . The Society itself includes all donors of not less than twenty dollars at one time . And what is the practice ? Such a thing as a deliberate election of thirty-six Directors by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the appointed stage in the celebration of the anniversary solemnities , when all other ceremonies have been duly performed , some one , generally a member of the Executive Committee , moves that certain persons whom he names , or whom without naming he designates as the officers of the last year , be elected officers for the year ensuing . The motion is immediately put to the confused assembly , and declared to be a vote . In a word , the thirtysix elective Directors are practically appointed by the Executive Committee . The anniversary celebration is then closed with the doxology and the benediction ; and the meeting of the Directors , for the choice of an Executive Committee , follows on the spot . A dozen'individuals , perhaps , are gathered in a // huddle around the President 's chair on the platform , while the congregation is retiring ; as many ballots prepared and printed beforehand at the Tract House are passed through their hands , and the business is finished . If the Board of Directors has ever held any other sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  except in one peculiar instance which has since been pronounced entirely out of order in the judgment of some of the executive officers  --  the knowledge of such a meeting has never come to us . The whole story then is , the Executive Committee virtually appoint not only the Directors but themselves also , and are really responsible to nobody , while yet they control more than $150,000 annually . We have long regarded the constitution of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , as incomparably the wisest and safest of all constitutions for a great missionary organization . In theory , it is an incorporated board of " commissioners " or trustees , acting as almoners for all who are disposed to entrust them with funds to be expended in foreign missions . As incorporated by the Legislature of Massachusetts , in 1812 , the commissioners , then eleven in number , were authorized at any annual meet . ing to " elect by ballot any suitable persons to be members of said Board , either to supply vacancies , or in addition to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that not less than one-third of the commissioners should always be " respectable laymen , " and not less than one third " respectable clergymen , " the remaining third to be " characters of the same description , whether clergymen or laymen . " The charter authorizes the commissioners to elect all necessary officers from among theri*selves ; it names particularly a " Prudential Committee , " and pro . vides that the signatures of the chairman and clerk of that committee , together with the seal of the corporation , shall give validity to deeds and contracts in behalf of the Board . The system , in its original conception , is as wise and safe as it is simple . The self-perpetuating character of the corporation , which is its most obvious peculiarity , is its most obvious excellency , as an institution for an extended system of operations . And this peculiarity is most completely in accordance with Congregational institutions . this board of trust for foreign missions , is constituted precisely like the board of trust for a Congregational college , or theological seminary-a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate wisdom , and regarding that as one of the highest portions of its high trust . The unparalleled degree of public confidence which the American Board obtained so early , and has held so long , is a testimony in behalf of this arrangement , which can not well be disputed . What better arrangement than this , for the supervision of the Prudential Committee , could be contrived ? Yet with all our confidence in this constitution , we see dangers arising at no very great distance . The great danger is that the secretaries and Prudential Committee , instead of being the mere executive , and as such strictly and continually responsible , will become themselves the Board , and that what ought to be the Board will become a mere appendage to the committee . Whenever such a change shall have come to pass , the institution will soon lose the strength of its hold upon the confidence of the public . We consider ourselves , therefore , as doing the very best of work for the great missionary cause , while we point out what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 was not definitely limited in regard to the increase of its members . The consequence is , that the number of members has been inadvertently increased , till the last report shows us a catalocrue of one dred and huntimes as eighty-six ,  --  full three many as there ought to be , and the number is still increasing every year . In this way the sense of individual responsibility on the part of the Commissioners is necessarily weakened . The individual who esteems others better than himself , and therefore esteems himself much less than the one-hundred-and. eighty-sixth part of the corporation , is not half so likely to feel an obligation to attend the meetings , and when attending is not half so likely to exercise his own free judgment , or to bend his powers earnestly to the business in hand , as he would be if the corporation were only half as numerous . Thus , the larger the number of individuals to whom this great trust is committed , the more is the responsibility divided , and the more probable is it that the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee . We would have the number of Commissioners reduced as soon as practicable , to not more than sixty . Forty would be still better . 2 . Simultaneously with this great increase in the number of Commissioners , has been another change , equally unfavorable to the character of the institution as a board of trust . Twenty-five years ago , a rule was established by which clergymen , on the payment of fifty dollars at one time , and laymen , on the payment of one hundred dollars , become " honorary members , " and as such , have a stipulated right to be present at all meetings , to participate in all debates , and , in a word , to do every thing but vote . Of these honorary members there are already some thousands , and every month increases the number . The Board of Cornmissioners , as it was contrived and instituted by its founders , as it was chartered by the state of Massachusetts , as it was endowed by the munificence of Norris , has well nigh lost its identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by themselves for the transaction of the business of their trust , every one of the thousands of honorary members might sue the corporation and recover the money which he paid for his membership . flow entirely would the Corporation of Yale College , or that of the Andover Seminary , disqualify itself for its duties as a board of trust , and forfeit the confidence of the public , if it should place itself in a similar position . 3 . As a matter of course , the character of the annual meetings has been greatly changed . Formerly , they were strictly meetings of trustees , coming together to attend to the business of their trust . According to the almost universal usage in the administration of public trusts , the traveling expenses of the Commissioners in going to the place of meeting , and returning to their homes , were a charge upon the treasury. * The business sessions of each annual meeting were distingu ished from the public assemblies for popular addresses and religious services , and were held in some room adapted , in size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators were not excluded from those sessions , they did not resort to them , for the reason that there were no performances there particularly designed for their enjoyment or for their ediification. if there was debate , nobody spoke for display , or for pop- * There is a reason for this usage , aside from its obvious fitness . The man who works for nothing and pays his own expenses , is not likely to do his work quite so well , be he ever so conscientious , as the man , equally conscientious , who feels that his expenses at least , are a charge upon those for whom he is working . // ular effect , or for the reporters , or otherwise than in a business fashion ; and if there were differences of opinion , they could be freely uttered , and nobody was wounded . But how great has been the change within the last ten years . Now , what ought to be business sessions , are held in a church , the largest that can be had . Seats and tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers of the institution , hut for the reporters of newspapers , both religious and secular . From the galleries , bright eyes that are there not to pierce into the intricacies of business , but to glitter with emotion and to be suffused with pleasurable tears , look down upon the crowds below . The meeting is , in short , very much like an anniversary of three days ' duration , and is necessarily becoming more and more so . In such an assembly , a business discussion , and particularly a free examination of what has been done by the c6mmittee , as if the committee were amenable to that assembly , is felt to be out of place ; it does not edify . The exercises of the meeting are necessarily conducted with reference to popular effect , and all the forms of business , therefore , must be despatched , as forms , without debate or difference of opinion . While this is so , the meeting must of course be an exceedingly difficult thing to manage ; and yet it must he managed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the proceedings must be planned out beforehand , by the officers , like the proceedings of any other massmeeting . But with all the skill employed from year to year in the getting up , and with all the new excitements attendant on the progress of the work , is there not * danger that these protracted mass-meetings will soon be less attractive than they have been ; and that whenever they begin to decline , the effect on the public will he discouraging , and therefore disastrous to the cause The reader will observe that we have imputed no sinister design , no love of power , no dislike of responsibility , to any of the highly respected men who in these , or in other like societies , are entrusted with the duty of administration . On the contrary , we have taken it for granted that they see this matter as we see it , and will rejoice heartily that the suggestions which we have made proceed from friends to whom no personal jealousy can be imputed , and whose motives can in no manner he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have proposed no revolutionary changes , no new constitutions , no rash experiments . On the contrary , we have not supposed that any constitutional change will be necessary in either of the two great societies which have been taken to illustrate our remarks . Should we undertake to propose a remedy for the dangers we have pointed out , we should propose nothing violent , nothing revolutionary . Some very simple changes in each of those great establishments , putting in force rather than setting aside the constitution as it is , are all that we conceive to he necessary . Our views are simply and heartily conservative . But we will not pursue the subject any farther at present ; for the discussion which we have opened is one which is likely to he taken up in other quarters , and which we may therefore have occasion to resume hereafter . L. B. // THE TRUE SPIRIT OF DEVOTION , AND THE BEST METHOD OF ITS BEING ALIVE IN THE MIND . IT is with some diffidence , that we venture to enter upon a theme so copious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is announced in the heading of this article . And yet the intrinsic importance of this subject to every man 's highest welfare , together with the prevalence ( as is thought ) of some obscure or false views respecting it , in many minds , at the present day , seems to commend it as a proper subject for serious and careful examination . What we chiefly propose , in the following remarks , is to call attention to this deeply interesting theme , rather than to discuss it fully . Many schemes of proposed reform are afloat at the present day , founded as we think , on erroneous or very confused opinions in ethics and theology ; and from these schemes of reform , results are confidently anticipated , by their authors and propagators , in respect to which they will , by and by , find themselves sadly disappointed . And then , as in all similar cases of projected reform and ultimate disappointment that have preceded them , there will come on a reaction of doubt and despondency in the minds of their authors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of mankind , both the sound and the practicable , as well as the unsound and the Utopian . In respect to the particular subject of consideration now before us , namely , What is the true spirit of devotion , and how may it best be upheld and kept alive in the Christian 's mind-it seems to us , that in any thing like a full and clear analysis of the case in hand , the following things are of vital importance , or at least , are worthy of very serious reflection.
