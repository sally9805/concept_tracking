txt MR . LYELL 'S book , to borrow a term from his favorite science , may be likened to a puddiig-stone , in which the geological plums are thickly set in a thin paste of travel . As the latter is seasoned with praise nearly to the American taste , the whole will be devoured by the omnivorous general reader , although much of it will be somewhat beyond his comprehension . We may try , perhaps , to extract the kernel from some of the geological speculations , for the unprofessional reader 's benefit ; but we must first entertain him with more generally palatable , not to say more substantial fare . Although , as we have already intimated , only a small part of these volumes is made up from the materk*Is of an ordinary book of travels , yet as such it is none the worse because the author came to inspect American rocks , rather than American manners . The remarks he does offer are so sensible and discriminating , so evidently thrown out by one who possesses that rare knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we only regret they are so few and cursory , and are a little provoked when he cuts short his observations upon the current topics of the day , and falls to " napping the chuckie stanes " again . Arriving at Boston in midsummer , when nearly deserted of fashionable society , our author hastens at once to Nahant , speaks with delight of the polished - rocks he found there , and falls to comparing , not the society and manners , but the shells , with those of Brighton and Margate . The reader will be gratified to learn " the curious and very unexpected fact , " that they were very much alike , " only a fraction of the whole affording characteristic or peculiar forms . " As to his dinner , and the cuisine at the hotels , over which his countrymen commonly delight to grumble , we are left in utmost ignorance , save an incidental observation , that " the Tremont merits its reputation as one of the best hotels in the world " ; but he speaks with evident satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be - which he met with in the environs of the city . At Bunker Hill , the peculiar reminiscences of the place are all unnoticed , - indeed , the monument is only obliquely mentioned , - but an ambiguous allusion is made to some terribly hard scratches on the rocks . Excepting Niagara , which falls unavoidably in his way , he passes with a cold and casual glance all the objects most attractive to the common tourist ; but he talks volubly about marl-pits , examines heaps of gravel and all sorts of rubbish , digs about the floors of coal mines , and expatiates with manifest delight upon Big-bone Lick and the Dismal Swamp . Mr. Lyell 's first departure from the ordinary route of travel occurred in an excursion from Geneseo to the northern border of the great coal region at Blossberg , Pennsylvania . " On this occasion we left the main road , and entered , for the first time , an American stage.coach , having been warned not to raise our expectations too high in regard to the ease or speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fatigue , we had only accomplished a journey of 46 miles in 12 hours , between Geneseo and Dansville . We had four horses ; and when I complained at one of the inns that our coachman seemed to take pleasure in driving rapidly over deep ruts and the rougfr. est ground , it was explained to me that this was the first time in his life he had ever attempted to drive any vehicle , whether two or four.wheeled . The coolness and confidence with which every one here is ready to try his hand at any craft is truly amusing . " - Vol. i. , p. 46 . This is a genuine American characteristic . The English laborer or artisan confines himself to one task , which he makes a business of , and learns to do it well . The coachman , who drives inimitably , has perhaps only a remote conception of the mode in which his horses are harnessed ; and , when any part of the apparatus gives way , finds himself literally " in a fix . " The Yankee is capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to perfection , he can do passably well more diverse things than any other mortal . In one particular , we venture to say , our author was misinformed , or else the stage-driver spoken of was a recent importation . We doubt if there can he found in all that region a native lad , seven years breeched , who has not tried his hand at driving every kind of vehicle that has fallen in his way . // We have next an " infant phenomenon , " in more senses than one ; for it seems that he had accumulated a fortune as an editor . " A few days afterwards I engaged a young man to drive me in a gig from Tioga to Blossberg . On the way , he pointed out , first , his father 's property , and then a fttrm of his own , which he had lately purchased . As he was not yet twenty years of age , I expressed surprise that he had got on so well in the world , when he told me that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now sold his share of the newspaper . " - Vol. i. , p. 46 . It was in Alabama , if we rightly remember , that the Duke of Saxe Weimar was inquired of on this wise " Are you the man that wants to go to - ? Then I am the gentleman that is going to drive you . " As the following happened in the State of New-York , at the other extremity of the long range of the Alleghanies , we are compelled to accept this mode of speech as a national characteristic . " I asked the landlord of the inn at Corning , who was very attentive to his guests , to find my coachman . He immediately called out in his bar-room , Where is the gentleman that brought this man here V A few days before , a farmer in New York had styled my wife the woman , ' though he called his own daughters ladies , and would , I believe , have freely extended that title to their maid-servant. " - Vol. i. , p. 49 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the sensible manner in which Mr. Lyell treats such topics . Still more painful scenes have since been enacted but we have not the heart to continue the narrative down to the present day . TJntil the laws of the State are fully enforced , and the recent murderers brought to the gallows , our author , on revisiting the country , will be fairly entitled to wave this tone of forbearance , and draw those unfavorable conclusions which it will not be easy for us to gainsay or resist . " On our way back from Schoharie to Albany , we found the country people in a ferment , a sheriff 's officer having been seriously wounded when in the act of distraining for rent , this being the third year of the Helderberg war , ' or a successful resistance by an armed tenantry to the legal demands of their landlord , Mr. Van Rensselaer . It appears that a large amount of // territory on both sides of the river Hudson , now supporting , according to some estimates , a population of 100,000 souls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , the tenants paying a small ground rent . This system of things is regarded by many as not only injurious , because it imposes grievous restraints upon alienation , but as unconstitutional , or contrary to the genius of their political institUtions , and tending to create a sort of feudal perpetuity . Some of the leases have already been turned into fees , but many of the tenants were unable to unwilling to pay the prices asked for such conveyances , and declared that they had paid rent long enough , and that it was high time that they should be owners of the land . " A few years ago , when the estates descended from the late General Van Rensselaer to his sons , the attempt to enforce the landlord 's rights met with open opposition . The courts of law gave judgment , and the sheriff of Albany having failed to exe* cute his process , at length took military force in 1839 , but with no better success . The governor of New York was then compelled to back him with the military array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign at a day 's notice in a severe snow-storm . The tenants are said to have mustered against them 1,500 strong , and the rents were still unpaid , when , in the following year , 1840 , the governor , courting popularity , as it should seem , while condemning the recusants in his message , virtually encouraged them by recommending their case to the favorable consideration of the state , hinting at the same time at legislative remedies . Thcir legislature , however , to their credit , refused to enact these , leaving the case to the ordinary courts of law . " The whole affair is curious , as demonstrating the impossibility of creating at present in this country a class of landed proprietors deriving their income from the letting of lands upon lease . Every man must occupy his own acres . He who has capital enough to stock a farm can obtain land of his own so cheap as naturally to prefer being his own landlord . " - Vol. i. , pp. 55-57 . The next paragraph introduces a topic more creditable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the female sex is held by the mass of the people shall be acknowledged to constitute the best criterion of civilization and refinement , our national character is saved from utter perdition . It was Charles Lamb , we believe , who refused to believe in the existence of any such thing as deference to the fair sex , as a principle , until he should see a gentleman hold his umbrella 43 * // over his latindress , or help a lone woman across a gutter . The English are in a bad way in this respect , past all doubt ; our author , therefore , establishes a comparIson between us and the soi-disant polite nation across the channel . Mr. Lyell has been a great traveller , and ought to know . " One of the first peculiarities that must strike a foreigner in the United States is the deference paid universally to the sex , without regard to station . Women may travel alone here in stage-coaches , steamboats , and railways , with less risk of encountering disagreeable behaviour , and of hearing coarse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited . The contrast in this respect between the Americans and the French is quite remarkable . There is a spirit of true gallantry in all this ; but the publicity of the railway car , where all are in one long room , and of the large ordinaries , whether on land or water , is a great protection , the want of which has been felt by many a female traveller without escort in England . As the Americans address no conversation to strangers , we soon became tolerably reconciled to living so much in public . Our fellow-passengers consisted for the most part of shopkeepers , artisans , and mechanics , with their families , all well-dressed , and , so far as we had intercourse with them , polite and desirous to please . A large part of them were on pleasure excursions , in which they delight to spend their spare cash . " On one or two occasions during our late tour in the newlysettled districts of New York , it was intimated to us that we were expected to sit down to dinner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer who owned our vehicle . We were invariably struck with the propriety of their manners , in which there was self-respect without forwardness. " - Vol. i. , pp. 57,58 . There is , however , a trifling mistake into which less discriminating travellers than Mr. Lyell are apt to fall , which is faidy pointed out in the following paragraph . " Travellers must make up their minds , in this as in other countries , to fall in now and then with free and easy people . I am bound , however , to say that in the two most glaring instances of vulgar familiarity which we have experienced here , we found out that both the offenders had crossed the Atlantic only ten years before , and had risen rapidly from a humble station . Whatever good breeding exists here in the middle classes is certainly not of foreign importation ; and John Bull , in particular , when out of humor with the manners of the Americans , is often unconsciously beholding his own image in the mirror , or com // paring one class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , which ought , from superior affluence and leisure , to exhibit a higher standard of refinement and intelligence . " - Vol. i. , pp. 58 , 59 . How many a lecture on American rudeness and the debasing influence of democratic institutions might have been spared us , were English tourists generally as ready to acknowledge their countrymen ! The manners they bring , like the allegiance they owe , appear to be inalienable . Our chief danger , therefore , lies in over-importation- If , in one instance , even our author failed to recognize his countrymen , and wondered what sort of barbarians he had encountered , it was for the sufficient reason , that he was unable to comprehend a word of their language . This was in Canada , when , benighted on his return from a geological excursion , he applied at a log-house , where " the inmates , though eager to serve us , could not comprehend a syllable of our language . I tried English , French , and German , all in vain . Tired and disappointed , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading our weary horses , and then to others , but with no better success . rphough not among Indians , we were as foreigners in a strange land . At last we stumbled , by good luck , upon our inn , and the next day were told , that the poor settlers with whom we had fallen in the night before had all come from the British Isles in the course of the five preceding years . Some of them could speak Gaelic , others Welsh , and others Irish ; and the farmers were most eloquent in descanting on their misfortune in having no alternative but that of employing laborers with whom they were unable to communicate , or remaining in want of hands while so many were out of work , and in great distress . For the first time I became fully aware how much the success and progress of a new colony depend on the state of schools in the mother country . " - Vol. ii. , p. 95 . We may now cross Mason and Dixon 's line , and hear our author s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day . It is true that Mr. Lyell made no long stay in the Southern States . Yet , owing to the facilities he enjoyed , and the nature of his pursuits , which led him away from the great lines of rapid conveyance , and brought him into immediate intercourse with the slave population , he must be allowed to have had better opportunities for observ // ing their condition than fall to the lot of most travellers . His opinions are therefore entitled to great consideration . He can have no inducement , certainly , to paint slavery in colors less dark than the facts will justify . Indeed , truthful as his general portraiture is , as respects the districts he visited , we suspect that no portion of Mr. Lyell 's volumes will be received by his countrymen with so much incredulity and so little satisfaction , as that which relates to the physical condition of the colored race in the Southern Atlantic States . As our object is to present Mr. Lyell 's views , not our own , we give the following series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as I have yet seen them , whether in domestic service or on the farms , appear very cheerful and free from care , better fed than a large part of the laboring class of Europe ; and , though meanly dressed , and often in patched garments , never scantily clothed for the climate . We asked a woman in Georgia , whether she was the slave of a family of our acquaintance . She replied , merrily , Yes , I belong to them , and they belong to me . ' She was , in fact , born and brought up on the estate . " On another occasion we were proceeding in a well-appointed carriage with a planter , when we came unexpectedly to a dead halt . Inquiring the cause , the black coachman said he had dropped one of his white gloves on the road , and must drive back and try to find it . He could not recollect within a mile where he had last seen it we remonstrated , but in vain . As time pressed , the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a second pair , gave them to him . When our charioteer had deliberately put them on , we started again . - Vol. i. , p. 135 . " Arriving often at a late hour at our quarters in the evening , we heard the negroes singing loudly and joyously in chorus after their day 's work was over . On one estate , about forty black children were brought up daily before the windows of the planter 's house , and fed in sight of the family ; otherwise , we were told , the old women who have charge of them might , in the absence of the parents , appropriate part of their allowance to themselves . All the slaves have some animal food daily . When they are ill , they sometimes refuse to take medicine , except from the hands of the master or mistress ; and it is of all tasks the most delicate for the owners to decide when they are really sick , and when only shamming from indolence. // " After the accounts I had read of the sufferings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general , so remarkably cheerful and light-hearted . It is true that I saw no gangs working under overseers on sugar-plantations , but out of two millions and a half of slaves in the United States , the larger proportion are engaged in such farming occupations and domestic services as I witnessed in Georgia and South Carolina- I was often for days together with negroes who served me as guides , and found them as talkative and chatty as children , usually boasting of their master 's wealth , and their own peculiar merits . At an inn in Virginia , a female slave asked us to guess for how many dollars a year she was let out by her owner . We named a small sum , hut she told us exultingly , that we were much under the mark , for the landlord paid fifty dollars , or ten guineas a year for her hire . A good-humored butler , at another inn in the same State , took care to tell me that his owner got 301. a year for him . The colored stewardess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , and how she came by the name of Queen Victoria . When we recollect that the dollars are not their own , we can hardly refrain from smiling at the childlike simplicity with which they express their satisfaction at the high price set on them . That price , however , is a fair test of their intelligence and moral worth , of which they have just reason to feel proud , and their pride is at least free from all sordid and mercenary considerations . We might even say that they labor with higher motives than the whites , - a disinterested love of doing their duty . I am aware that we may reflect and philosophize on this peculiar and amusing form of vanity , until we perceive in it the evidence of extreme social degradation ; but the first impression which it made upon my mind was very consolatory , as I found it impossible to feel a painful degree of commiseration for persons so exceedingly well satisfied with themselves . " - Vol. i , pp. 144 , 145 . " I talked with several slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had finished by the middle of the day . They never appeared to be overworked ; and the rapidity with which they increase beyond the whites in the United States shows that they are not in a state of discomfort , oppression , and misery . Doubtless , in the same manner as in Ireland and parts of Great Britain , the want of education , mental culture , and respect for themselves , favors improvident marriages among the poor ; so the state of mere animal existence of the slave , and his low moral and intellectual condition , coupled with kind treatment and all freedom from care , promote their multiplication . The effect of the institution on the progress of the whites is most injurious , // and , after travelling in the northern States , and admiring their rapid advance , it is most depressing to the spirits . Their appears to he no place in society for poor whites . If they are rich , their slaves multiply , and from motives of kindly feeling towards retainers , and often from false pride , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly tempted to maintain a larger establishment than is warranted by the amount of their capital , and they often become involved in their circumstances and finally bankrupt . The prudence , temper , and decision of character required to manage a plantation successfully are very great . It is notorious , that the hardest taskmasters to the slaves are those who come from the northern free States . " I often asked myself , when in the midst of a large plantation , what steps I would take if I had inherited such a property from British ancestors . I thought , first , of immediately emancipating all the slaves ; hut I was reminded that the law humanely provides , in that case , that I should still support them , so that I might ruin myself and family ; and it would still be a question whether those whom I had released from bondage would he happier , or would be prepared for freedom . I then proposed to begin with education as a preliminary step . Here I was met with the objection that , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutes had been enacted , making it penal to teach slaves to read and write . I must first , therefore , endeavour to persuade my fellow slaveholders to repeal these laws against improving the moral and intellectual condition of the slaves . I remarked that , in order to overcome the apathy and reluctance of the planters , the same kind of agitation , the same pressure from without , ' might be indispensable , which had brought about our West Indian emancipation . To this my American friends replied , that the small number of our slaves , so insignificant in comparison to their two and a half millions , had made an indemnity to the owner possible ; also , that the free negroes , in small islands , could always be held in subjection by the British fleets ; and , lastly , that England had a right to interfere and legislate for her own colonies , whereas the northern States of the Union , and foreigners , had no constitutional right to intermeddle with the domestic concerns of the slave States . Such intervention , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded , and must always be expected to retard , the progress of the cause . - Vol. i. , pp. 147 , 148 . To show that our author is not , like some travellers , determined to see only one side of a question , we will cite a // few sentences in which he speaks of the injurious consequences of ' " the peculiar institution " on the prosperity of the country . " On entering the station-house of a railway which was to carry us to our place of embarkation , we found a room with only two chairs in it . One of these was occupied by a respectable-looking woman , who immediately rose , intending to give it up to me , an act betraying that she was English , and newly-arrived , as an American gentleman , even if already seated , would have felt it necessary to rise and offer the chair to any woman , whether mistress or maid , and she , as a matter of course , would have accepted the proffered seat . After I had gone out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a few months before from Hertfordshire , hoping to get work in Virginia , but she had discovered that there was no room here for poor white people , who were despised by the very negroes if they labored with their own hands . She had found herself looked down upon , even for carrying her own child , for they said she ought to hire a black nurse . These poor emigrants were now anxious to settle in some free State . " As another exemplification of the impediments to improvement existing here , I was told that a New England agriculturist had bought a farm on the south side of the James river , sold off all the slaves , and introduced Irish laborers , being persuaded that their services would prove more economical than slave labor . The scheme was answering well , till , by the end of the third year , the Irish became very much dissatisfied with their position , feeling degraded by losing the respect of the whites , and being exposed to the contempt of the surrounding negroes . They had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices which , south of the Potomac , are assigned to hereditary bondsmen. " - Vol. i. , pp. 104 , 105 . " On several of the small plantations here in North Carolina , I found the proprietors by no means in a thriving state , evidently losing ground from year to year , and some of them talking of abandoning the exhausted soil , and migrating with their slaves to the southwestern States . If , while large numbers of the negroes were thus carried to the South , slavery had been abolished in North Carolina , the black population might ere this have been reduced considerably in numbers , without suffering those privations to which a free competition with white laborers must expose them , wherever great facilities for emigration are not afforded . // " From the deck of our steamboat on the Potomac , we saw Mount Vernon , formerly the plantation of General Washington . Instead of exhibiting , like the farms in the northern States , a lively picture of progress and improvement , this property was described to me by all as worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of its illustrious owner . The bears and wolves , they say , are actually reëntering their ancient haunts , which would scarcely have happened if slavery had been abolished in Virginia . The subject of Pennsylvanian incipient repudiation is very discreetly , and even tenderly , handled . Mr. Lyell 's remarks contain much that may tend to enlighten the English reader . The topic , fortunately , does not at present demand any comment on our part . The long episode on education in the English Universities , which closes the first volume , will doubtless , as the author observes , prove equally interesting to his readers on both sides of the Atlantic ; for it is almost the only succinct and intelligible account of that anomalous system which is to be met with . It will be recollected , that Mr. Lyell came to this country partly for the purpose of fulfilling an engagement to deliver a course of lectures on his favorite science before the Lowell Institute . His observations upon that noble endowment will be read with interest ; and the topic which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precious funds in brick and mortar , is worthy of especial note . This seems to be the besetting sin in England as well as in this country , although it was left to the New World to perpetrate so signal an enormity as that of the Girard College for Orphans . " To obtain the services of eminent men engaged in original researches , for the delivery of systematic courses of lectures , is impossible without the command of much larger funds than are usually devoted to this object . When it is stated that the fees at the Lowell Institute at Boston are on a scale more than three times higher than the remuneration awarded to the best literary and scientific public lecturers in London , it will at first be thought hopeless to endeavour to carry similar plans into execution in other large cities , whether at home or in the United States . In reality , however , the sum bequeathed by the late Mr. John Low . ell for his foundation , though munificent , was by no means enor. mous , not much exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations for educational objects , would have been all swallowed up in the erection of costly buildings , after // which the learned would be invited to share the scanty leavings of the Committee of Taste , ' and the merciless architect , reliquins DanaLim atque immitis Achillel . ' But in the present case , the testator provided in his will that not a single dollar should be spent in brick and mortar , in consequence of which proviso , a spacious room was at once hired , and the intentions of the donor carried immediately into effect , without a year 's delay . " If there be any who imagine that a donation might be so splendid as to reader an anti-building clause superfluous , let them remember the history of the Girard bequest in Philadelphia . Half a million sterling , with the express desire of the testator that the expenditure on architectural ornament should be moderate ! Yet this vast sum is so nearly consumed , that it is doubtful whether the remaining funds will suffice for the completion of the palace - splendid , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that when a passion so strong as that for building is to be resisted , total abstinence alone , as in the case of spirituous liquors , will prove an adequate safeguard . In the old country , ' the same fatal propensity has stood in the way of all the most spirited efforts of modern times to establish and endow new institutions for the diffusion of knowledge . It is well known that the sum expended in the purchase of the ground , and in the erection of that part of University College , London , the exterior of which is nearly complete , exceeded 100,0001. , one third of which was spent on the portico and dome , or the purely ornamental , the rooms under the dome having remained useless , and not even fitted up at the expiration of fifteen years . When the professor of chemistry inquired for the chimney of his laboratory , he was informed that there was none , and to remove the defect , a flue was run up which encroached on a handsome staircase , and destroyed the symmetry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anatomical professor on learning that his lecture room was to conform to the classical model of an ancient theatre , designed for the recitation of Greek plays . Sir Charles Bell remarked that an anatomical theatre , to be perfect , should approach as nearly as possible to the shape of a well , that every student might look down and see distinctly the subject under demonstration . At a considerable cost the room was altered , so as to serve the ends for which it was wanted . " The liberal sums contributed by the public for the foundation of a rival college were expended in like manner long before the academical body came into existence . When the professor of chemistry at King 's College asked for his laboratory , he was told it had been entirely forgotten in the plan , but that he might take the kitchen on the floor below , and by ingenious machinery carry up // his apparatus for illustrating experiments , through a trap door into an upper story , where his lecture room was placed . " Still these collegiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so liberally , were left , like the Girard College , half finished ; whereas , if the same funds had been devoted to the securing of teachers of high acquirements , station , character , and celebrity ; and if rooms of moderate dimensions had been at first hired , while the classes of pupils remained small , a genera . tion would not have been lost , the new Institutions would have risen more rapidly to that high rank which they are one day destined to attain , and testamentary bequests would have flowed in more copiously for buildings well adapted to the known and ascertained wants of the establishment . None would then grudge the fluted column , the swelling dome , and the stately portico ; and literature and science would continue to be the patrons of architecture , without being its victims . " Prescott , in his admirable work on the Conquest of Mexico , remarks , when discussing the extent of the ancient Aztec civilization , that the progress made by the Mexicans in astronomy , and especially the fact of their having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves more in favor of their advancement , than the noble architectural monuments which they and their kindred tribes erected . Architecture , ' he observes , is a sensual gratification , and addresses itself to the eye ; it is the form in which the resources of a semi-civilized people are most likely to be lavished . ' * * - Vol. i. , pp. 89- 92 . The most popular of the geological questions upon which Mr. Lyell discourses is , naturally , that which relntes to the Falls of Niagara . It is , no doubt , the common opinion , that the Niagara once quietly flowed in a shallow be ( l from Lake Erie to the brow of the precipice at Queenston , much as it now flows from its commencement up to the rapids just above the present site of the cataract ; and , consequently , that the deep chasm through which the pent waters now rush for seven miles to reach the plain below is entirely the work of the river itself , which has been slowly eating its way backwards for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found , as he supposes , traces of the ancient bed of the river at a higher level , where it must have flown before the chasm existed , - these traces being principally the remains of fluviatile shells that occur abundantly in deposits of // sand and gravel in the position which the bed of the stream must have occupied , had the river extended farther northward at nearly its present level above the cataract . These , indeed , had been already detected by Mr. Hall , one of the geologists of the New York State survey . As the fossil shells are identical in species and in relative numbers with those now deposited from year to year in the ooze of the stream , it is concluded that the excavation is quite a modern affair , speaking after the mode in which the geologists take note of time . Our author confirms , consequently , these corollaries ; - that the cataract was of nearly twice its present height , long before there were any men to enjoy the view or use the water-power for paper-mills ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing itself out from age to age ; and finally , that the time must arrive , if the world last long enough , when there will be no cataract at all . In regard to its future retrocession , there are grounds of encouragement . The rock upon which this huge water-saw now exerts its direct power is made of firmer stuff than any through which it has already cut its way ; and the changes which are now going on , and which have produced very perceptible effects within the memory of the present generation , are entirely owing to the rapid disintegration of the soft slaty strata at the base of the falls , leaving the superincumbent limestone without support . But when they have travelled back a mile or two further , the hard limestone will he at the base also , and will effectually arrest their present progress . Further up , they will have a still more stubborn lime-rock to contend with ; so that , on the whole , the drainage of lake Erie may be considered as indefinitely postponed . Big-bone Lick lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whose eyes it would possess as little attraction as an ordinary quagmire ; but in our author 's hands it becomes a subject of no small interest . It is a hog in Kentucky , near the Ohio river , more or less impregnated with saline matter from salt springs , and which , like all similar places , was frequented by deer , buffaloes , and other wild cattle , to drink the water , or , in default thereof , to lick the mud or soft soil greedily for the sake of the salt ; whence the name , so common in the Western States . This was a favorite watering-place , - the Saratoga of the bisons of former days , and of the mastodons of the old time before them . // Even within the memory of surviving settlers , buffaloes thronged to these springs in great numbers , coming and going by two principal highways or beaten trails , that are still plainly discernible for several miles in the woods . One of them , " three or four yards wide , only partially overgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , and well trodden as a high road . " Delightful times they must have had at the springs , and yet , like all pleasant dissipation , not unattended with danger . For now and then one , gambolling too venturously on the treacherous surface of the tremulous bog , broke through the thin crust , and was blandly absorbed in the slime beneath . The elephants , for they were at least occasional visimers , and especially the mastodons , which seem to have almost monopolized the springs until they became the resort of ignobler herds , had of course a marvellous alacrity in sinking ; and many a portly mammoth was thus ingloriously swamped , ingulphed in the morass , until , after the Lord knows how many ages , some grubbing savant " knocks him about the sconce with a dirty shovel , " and bis huge bones are raised from their long rest to adorn the wondrous tale of the modern geologist . " Here s a fine revolution , if we had the trick to see t . " We are informed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have belonged to less than one hundred distinct individuals , those of the fossil elephant to twenty , besides which a few bones of a stag , horse , megalonyx , and bison are stated to have been obtained . " The remains of the mammoth and other extinct animals are found buried to a greater depth than those of the common bison , which in vast numbers fill the superficial stratum , showing that the former were the first commiers . It is interesting to observe , though Mr. Lyell does not allude to the fact , that all the nearly entire skeletons that have been exhumed in the Atlantic States were found in bogs , with the bones in a vertical position , as if these land-leviathans had merely sunk in the mud . This was the case with the well known skeleton in Peale 's Museum , taken from a marsh in Orange County , New York , as well as the very large one disinterred during the last summer in the same region . " He had evidently become mired , and had settled down upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this posture he was found . " A skeleton some years ago disinterred in New Jersey was found standing upon all fours on // the gravel at the bottom of the shallow morass , the shoulderbones and hips still resting on the limbs , and the whole trunk in its natural position . Cuvier states , on the authority of General Collaud , that the bones of mastodons formerly discovered near the Great Osage river were almost all in an upright position , as if the animal had been thus bemired. * As to the time which has elapsed since these huge beasts roamed in our forests , Mr. Lycli gives us no estimate in years or centuries ; but he remarks , that the shells which are mingled with the fossil bones at Big-bone Lick belong to species that are still living , perhaps even in the immediate neighbourhood ; and it is impossible to view the plain without at once concluding that it has remained unchanged in all its principal features from that period to the present . No part of Mr. Lyell 's book has interested us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swamp . " Instead of occupying a depression below the general level , it seems that this great morass , which is some forty miles long , and about twenty-five miles wide , is actually more elevated than the surrounding country , and , in spite of its semi-fluid character , is twelve feet higher in the centre than at the margin . It is , in fact , a huge sponge laid on the surface of the soil ; receiving a few streams , indeed , along a short distance on one side , but giving rise to many others which flow from it in every direction . Our author 's account is partly drawn from personal observation , and partly from an article on the subject published a few years ago by Mr. Ruffin of Virginia , the editor of the " Farmer 's Register . " We were curious to know , while the Alleghany mountains were under consideration , whether Mr. Lyell would adopt the hypothesis so ingeniously devised and eloquently expounded by Professor Rogers to account for the formation and configuration of the long rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the theory of the Professors Rogers , the wavelike fiexures , above alluded to , are explained by supposing the strata , when in a plastic state , to have rested on a widely-extended surface of fluid lava , and elastic vapors and gases . The billowy movement of this subterranean sea of melted matter imparted its undulations to the elastic overlying crust , * Ossemens Fssiles , Ed. 2 , Tom . I. , pp. 217 and 222. 44 * // which was enabled to retain the new shapes thus given to it by the consolidation of the liquid matter injected into fissures . - Vol. i. , pp. 77 , 78 . We find , however , that lVlr . Lyell , true to the views he so early adopted , of taking plenty of time and leaving every thing to the slow action of existing causes , seems to discountenance this more prompt and off-hand mode of creating mountain chains . " For my own part , I can not imagine any real connection be . tween the great parallel undulations of the rocks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the bent and broken crust may once have rested . That there were great lakes , or seas of lava , retained by volcanic heat for ages , in a liquid state , beneath the Alleghanies , is highly probable , for the simultaneous eruptions of distaat vents in the Andes leave no doubt of the wide subterranean areas permanently occupied by sheets of fluid lava in our own times . It is also consistent with what we know of the laws governing volcanic action to assume that the force operated in a linear direction , for we see trains of volcanic vents breaking out for hundreds of miles along a straight line , and we behold long parallel fissures , often filled with trap or consolidated lava , holding a straight course for great distances through rocks of all ages . The causes of this peculiar mode of development are as yet obscure and unexplained ; but the existence , of long narrow ranges of mountains , and of great faults and vertical shifts in the strata prolonged for great distances in certain directions , may all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accords well with established facts to assume that the solid crust overlying a region where the subterranean heat is increasing in intensity , becomes gradually upheaved , fractured , and distended , the lower part of the newly opened fissures becoming filled with fused matter , which soon consolidates and crystallizes . These uplifting movements may be propagated along narrow belts , placed side by side , and may have been in progress simultaneously , or in succession , in one narrow zone after another . " When the expansive force has been locally in operation for a long period , in a given district , there is a tendency in the subterranean heat to diminish ; - the volcanic energy is spent , and its position is transferred to some new region . Subsidence then begins , in consequence of the cooling and shrinking of subterranean seas of lava and gaseous matter : and the solid strata collapse in obedience to gravity . If this contraction take place along narrow and parallel zones of country , the incumbent flexible // strata would be forced , in proportion as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they conformed to the circumference of a smaller arc . The manner in which undulations may be gradually produced in pliant strata by subsidence is illustrated on a small scale by the creeps in coalmines ; there both the overlying and underlying shales and clays sink down from the ceiling , or rise up from the floor , and fill the galleries which have been left vacant by the abstraction of the fuel . " - Vol. i. , pp. 78 , 79 . Our extracts have been so copious , that we must not meddle with the complicated questions relating to drift , boulders , and the parallel scratches or furrows on the rocks , so frequent in the northern section of the country , - questions , upon which the opinions of geologists are still greatly at variance . We may merely state , that Mr. Lyell adopts that modification of the " glacial theory , " which attributes these scratches to the action of icebergs and islands of floating ice coming down from the north , " which , as they grounded on the coast or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pebbles , broke off all angular and projecting points of rock , and when fragments of hard stone were frozen into their lower surface , scooped out grooves in the subjacent solid stratra . " There is little difficulty as respects the existence of icebergs of sufficient size and weight for the purpose ; since many of those measured in the Antarctic sea by the officers of the French and American exploring expeditions rose to the height of more than two hundred feet above the surface of the water , and were from two to five miles in length . Indeed , the late Captain D'Urville , the ill-fated commander of the French expedition , ascertained one of these ice-islands , floating at large in the South* em Ocean , to be thirteen miles long and a hundred feet high , the submerged portion being of course six or eight times greater than the part which is visible ; so that the mechanical power they may exert , when once set in motion , must be truly prodigious . It is only requisite that they should run aground where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the sea or depressing the land is so perfect and in such constant operation , that there can seldom be any failure in that respect . Still it would be desirable to show that a body of ice , impelled over a rocky surface , is actually capable of producing such scratches // on a small scale , in our own days . On this point our author made a fortunate observation . We give the account in his own words , merely leaving out the references to the wood-cuts that illustrate it . " As I was strolling along the beach at the base of these basaltic cliffs at Cape Blornidon , Nova Scotia , collecting minerals , and occasionally recent shells at low tide , I stopped short at the sight of an unexpected phenomenon . The solitary inhabitant of a desert island could scarcely have been more startled by a human foot-print in the sand , than I was on beholding some recent furrows on a ledge of sandstone under my feet , the exact counterpart of those grooves of ancient date which I have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . After having searched in vain at Quebec for such indications of a modern date , I had despaired of witnessing any in this part of the world . I was now satisfied that , whatever might be their origin , those before me were quite recent . " The inferior beds of soft sandstone , which are exposed at low water at the base of the cliff at Cape Blomidon , form a broad ledge of bare rock to the surface of which no sea-weed or barnacles can attach themselves , as the stone is always wearing away slowly by the continual passage of sand and gravel , washed over it from the talus of fallen fragments , which lies at the foot of the cliff on the beach above . The slow but constant undermining of the perpendicular cliff forming this promontory , round which the powerful currents caused by the tide sweep backwards and forwards with prodigious velocity , must satisfy every geologist that the denudation by which the ledge in question has been exposed to view is of modern date . Whether the rocks forming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , 50 , or 100 years ago , I have no means of estimating ; but the exact date and rate of destruction are immaterial . On this recently formed ledge , I saw several straight furrows half an inch broad , some of them very nearly parallel , others diverging , the direction being N. 350 E. , or corresponding to that of the shore at this point . After walking about a quarter of a mile , I found another set of similar furrows , having the same general direction within five degrees ; and I made up my mind that if these grooves could not be referred to the modern instrumentality of ice , it would throw no small doubt on the glacial hypothesis . When I asked my guide , a peasant of the neighbourhood , whether he had ever seen much ice on the spot , where we stood , the heat was so excessive ( for we were in the latitude of the south of France , 450 N. ) that I seemed to be putting a // strange question . He replied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , in spite of the tide , which ran at the rate of 10 miles an hour , extending in one uninterrupted mass from the shore where we stood to the opposite coast at Parrsborough , and that the icy blocks , heaped on each other , and frozen together or packed , ' at the foot of Cape Blomidon , were often fifteen feet thick , and were pushed along when the tide rose , over the sandstone ledges . He also stated that fragments of the black stone ' which fell from the summit of the cliff , a pile of which lay at its base , were often frozen into the ice , and moved along with it . I then examined these fallen blocks of amygdaloid scattered round me , and observed in them numerous geodes coated with quartz crystals . I have no doubt that the hardness of these gravers , firmly fixed in masses of ice , which , although only fifteen feet thick , are often of considerable horizontal extent , have furnished sufficient pressure and mechanical powerto groove the ledge of soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have touched only upon some of the simpler of the geological matters which make up the greater part of Mr. Lyeli 's book ; we have explored the mere shallows , taking some care not to venture beyond our depth , lest we should be swept out to sea with only a slippery geological hypothesis to cling to . All the deeper questions , " in which are some things hard to be understood , " and harder to believe , we must leave our scientific friends to manage by themselves . We were pleased to meet with frequent evidences of that harmonious intercourse which generally does and always ought to prevail among the votaries of the same science , without distinction of country or name . Whenever a scholar or scientific man of this country visits the Old World , nothing so much gladdens his heart as the cordial welcome he is sure to receive from his transatlantic brethren , and the readiness with which all the stores of information , whether public or private , and every thing calculated to facilitate his inquiries , are laid open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Lyell 's pages abound with acknowledgments for information received from , and facilities courteously rendered by , our numerous geologists , especially those who have conducted State surveys , and whose official publications and other works do so much credit to themselves and to the country . Without such assistance , indeed , Mr. Lyell could by no means have turned his limited time to such good account . On the other hand , our own geologists must have // deemed it no small advantage thus to compare notes , directly upon the field , with one so deeply versed in European geology as Mr. Lyell . It is this freedom from sectional jealousies and local interests which makes the commonwealth of science " one and indivisible . " It is this spirit which ever distinguishes the naturalist who is worthy of the name . We do , indeed , remember something of an anonymous newspaper article , in which the engagement of an eminent foreign geologist to lecture before a popular audience was seriously complained of , as a positive wrong and discouragement to native talent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their preserves . But this narrow spirit , peculiarly ungenerous under the circumstances , is , we trust , entirely dispelled . There is a single paragraph in Mr. Lyell 's book which we strongly desire to see erased . We can not pass by this blemish in silence , and we have no desire to render it more prominent by quotation . Yet we can not open that page without wondering how such a piece of bad taste could have found admission . The sentence to which we refer is to be found on page 163 of the first volume . The gratuitous sneer at the " young ladies , filled with an exceeding sense of their own wickedness , " is bad enough in itself ; but it is unfortunately aggravated , surely without Mr. Lyell being aware of it , by the context , which almost irresistibly points its application to the families of his own friends and acquaintance.
