txt " Kind things , however trivial , reach the heart , And through the heart the head , clearing away The narrow notions that grow tip at home . And in their place grafting good-will to all . " ROGERS . OUR tunes might not inaptly be designated as the age of travelling . Its records form no insignificant branch of the literature of the day . Irving 's most graphic ability is displayed in his pictures of Spain and England , and all the poetry of Lamartine 's mind has been lavished on his sketches of the Holy Land . Steam is annihilating space , and even the devotee of business begins to find it more expeditious to transact his foreign affairs in person than by letter . The ocean , once a forrnidable barrier , not to be traversed without long preparation and from urgent necessity , now seems to inspire no more consideration than a goodly lake , admirably adapted to summer excursions . Travelling is changed from an isolated pilgrimage to a kind of triumphal procession . Anciently the sage made lonely journeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do battle , the apostle to spread truth , and the knight to seek adventures . Caravans of voyagers are now winding as it were , on the wings of the wind , round the habitable globe . Here they glide over cultivated acres on rods of iron , and there they rise and fall on the bosom of the deep , leaving behind them a foaming wheel-track like the chariotpath of a sea-god . To-day the traveller may be discussing stocks or politics in a rail-road car of New England , and in two weeks he is asleep in the corner of a French Diligence . There is one very obvious reason for the increase of travel in modern times . It is one of the few adventurous resources that remain to a prosaic epoch . It seems peculiarly desirable that a period should be set apart between youth and the time when life 's serious business absorbs every active impulse , for a breathing season to the spirit . It seetais right to secure in the springtime of being , an interval during which youth shall be free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all * the grandeur and beauty of the universe ; mingle freely with his kind and weave ties of affection with all the trophies that antiquity has hallowed , humanity consecrated and art adorned . There is a strong and innate repugnance to routine in the young heart . It is a sad thought to the aspiring soul that its whole experience shall occur upon one scene and be made up of unvarying events . " He took great content , " says old Burton , " exceeding delight in that his voyage , as who doth not as shall attempt the like I For peregrination charms our senses with such unspeakable and sweet variety , that some count him unhappy that never travelled , a kind of prisoner , and pity his case , that from his cradle to his old age , he beholds the same still ; still , still , the same , the same ! " The increasing facilities of travel are , indeed , rapidly diminishing its interest and excitement . The multitude are rushing over the hallowed ground of the earth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peculiarities of costume , interesting ob // servances , all that is picturesque and striking in national character wear gradually away in the whirl of promiscuous intercourse . Still the novelties of art , the contrasting features of nature , and much that is absolutely indigenous in the different races of men , are sufficiently alluring to beguile us from the monotonous experience of borne . And we enjoy an especial privilege in visiting Europe . To no civilized people is the contrast greater or the points of interest more striking . From the old tower built in the reign of Francis I. at the entrance of the dock of Havre de Grace to the Pyramids of Egypt , the American traveller enjoys an uninterrul ) tf3d series of fresh and powerful impressions . The very advancement in knowledge which this age has achieved , quickens curiosity . The broad light which popular education has spread abroad , has revealed to human eyes and hearts such glimpses of the beauty and interest of the world , that where there is a particle of soul there springs up an earnest desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for travel is , then , to a certain extent at least , an evidence of mental activity . So , also , in no small degree , it may be traced to a benevolent spirit . There has been a union of mind effected by literature and philanthropic enterprise of late years unparalleled in human history . And the natural consequence is that our sympathies are more extended . Common objects of pursuit and congeniality of tastes now unite men of different countries , and we feel in departing for distant lands that attractions there await the affections as well as the intellect . We hail , then , this display of the travelling propensity as an auspicious sign . In this view , it is , as yet , not sufficiently estimated . The mere pursuit of pleasure or the spur of necessity enter too largely into the motives of modern travellers , to make their pilgrimage either dignified in aspect or fertile in results . A worthy object and a true spirit are essential to render travel what it should be , and when thus inspired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human experience . The lives of eminent men furnish abundant evidence of the peculiar benefits of travel . Milton was evidently indebted to his sojourn in Italy for much of his imagery and largeness of views . The dense foliage of Vallambrosa , the beautiful view from Fiesole , the arts , the music and literary intercourse with the Italians of his age , left lasting and invaluable impressions . He mentions among the requisites for the great work he so long meditated , " a steady observation and insight into all seemly and generous arts and affairs ; " and was contented to live with great economy to atone for his expensive " voyaging about . " It has even been conjectured that Shakspeare in early life , visited the same classic scenes . lie betrays a familiarity with the characteristics of cities , the furniture of palaces , local manners and especially with the old law of betrothment in Katherine and Petrecin , rather too intimate , it has been thought , to have been gleaned wholly from hooks . He speaks with the fondness of an old resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " fruitful Lombardy , the pleasant garden of all Italy , " and " Pisa renowned for grave citizens . " There are , at all events , strong reasons to believe that he experienced a sea-voyage . But his imagination was so vivid and universal that the records of travellers furnished him with pictures little short of reality ; he became the companion of their wanderings by virtue of the rare and quick sympathy which opened to him all the treasures of nature , and made every roan a brother . lIe had small need of travel who could conjure up at will so lovely an Island and such niarvellous people as compose the Tempest . Petrareb was a constant wanderer , and Dante 's poem abounds with local reminiscences . Adventure and novel scenes feed the poetic soul . Cervantes gathered the materials of his works during years of foreign service . We can trace the noble public spirit of Evelyn to whom England is indebted for her forest trees , to the influence of his early journeyings . The love of travel was a distinguishing trait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great Alfred employed people to travel to satisfy his curiosity respecting distant countries . Individual taste is strikingly manifested in travel . Scott cared little for the Roman remains , but was instantly attracted by every feudal tower . Dr. Johnson said , if he were to travel , convents would interest him more than // palaces . Manners and scenery , arts and literature , statistics and localities attract men of different fancies . But there is one common altar at which the sympathies of all noble travellers are kindled . They soon become converts to the opinion that " a beautiful face is the finest of spectacles . " They learn more highly to appreciate that sex whose condition in every land forms the standard by which they estimate its degree of civilisation . They insensibly acquire , if they never before possessed , something of that chivalric estimate of woman which breathed in the lay of the troubadour and nerved the arm of knighthood . This sentiment may , indeed , be vivified by the novel circumstances under which she is revealed to the wanderer-as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cathedral , beneath the awning of a gondola , or in the balmy atmosphere of an orange-grove . His romantic dreams may be buoyed up and irradiated by unaccustomed scenes or novel manners ; but they are oftener nurtured by that genial kindness which prompts the cheering salutation of the passing peasant girl , which sustains the almost maternal vigil of the hostess by the sick couch of the wanderer , and leads the refined and lovely to smile so charitably upon his colloquial blunders . It is the sweet prerogative of woman to throw around the traveller 's sojourn , the endearing associations of home ; to lift from his heart all consciousness of isolation and brighten every link of his " lengthening chain " with golden memories . The acquisitions of no man are largely available until in some measure realized by experiment . Knowledge acquired by the slow and artificial process of reading is not only often a mere isolated benefit , but sometimes an absolute injury to its possessor . It is happy for men of an inquiring turn that life is so ordered that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continual plodders " have won little but " base authority . " Pedantry is one of the most unloveable of human qualities . How often may be applied to the merely learned , the sad reproach in Wallen-stein : " Thy wisdom bath been proved a thriftless friend To thine ownself . See , it has made thee early A superannuated man and ( but That my munificent stars should intervene ) Would let thee in some miserable corner , Go out like an untended lamb . " Health , too , often perishes in chasing the " weary honors . " Buoyancy departs from the spirit , and bloom from the cheek . The ambition of scholarship when it absolutely possesses the mind , is often a gloomy barrier , dividing its votary from the tender humanities and cheerful haunts of his race . But the wisdom horn of observation , the love gleaned in conversation , in contemplating the phases of society , in noting die phenomena of life , neither bows the frame nor indurates the heart . No man can garner such fruits except by social activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better sympathies in constant exercise . They are gleaned in an atmosphere of love and opinion . The process employs the whole nature instead of tasking the mind alone . And this experimental knowledge leavens the dead lump of mere erudition . Life is imparted to what was before inert ; and the most valuable of abstract ideas are enlivened by the interest of personal experience . Of this valuable wisdom travel is the prolific source . It is the cant ofthe day to reverence abstractions . But if there is any self-evident truth , it is that we are created to be moved within by impressions from without . There is , indeed , an " electric chain , " but it must be struck . We read , for instance , of feudal times , when art , chivalry , and commerce blended their agency in impressing the face of society ; and the elements of civilized life were but rudely organized . Our vague ideas of this epoch become , as it were , real and definite , after an observing sojourn in such a city as Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence and a distinction , the massive architecture and grated windows that render the dwelling a fortified castle , the stone seats beside the palace gates , where the retainers sat , and the very rings to which the standards of faction or the banners of families were attached . In the salutations and domestic intercourse of the people we trace , as we never can in books , the old familiar and friendly intercourse of different classes , and recognize not a little of the ancient spirit of allegiance and " the heart of courtesy . " We read , too , of the Inquisition , // but how is our impression of its influence deepened by tracing its effects in the grave bcaring of the Spaniards . Titian 's portraits have been well called true history , an ( l the Ducal palace at Venice embodies and illustrates the peculiarities of her ancient government . If much of the true sense and meaning of the past is undefined in our minds , by thus communing with its monuments , we attain not a little of its essence and sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth . Were the facts and fables gathered in those early studies the same to him after his visit to Greece and Italy as before Did not the scenery , the climate , the touching ruins , the glorious arts that there appealed to his senses , awaken dormant memories , and brighten into a glorious reality the meinorable scenes of the past Was C*sar the same in the poet 's imaaination , after he had wandered over the palace-ruins on the Palatine Were the combats of the amphitheatre as dream-like when he looked from the weedy corridors of the Coliseum or mused beside the statue of the dying gladiator l Was Sappho brought no nearer to his fancy by a visit to the " Isles of Greece l " Childe Harold 's pilgrimage furnishes the best reply . Many of the most striking circumstances recorded in the Chronicle of Granada , might have been written out of Spain , but could Irving have woven so picturesque and charming a narrative without those romantic reveries and quiet adventures that blest his sojourn at the Albambra Madame de Stael could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-like and comprehensive the whole subject became when she had mingled with the literati of Weimar , and grown familiar with the scenery of the Rhine . Travel gives a character of experience to our knowledge , and brings the figures upon the tablet of memory into strong relief . To fully understand Petrarch , one should have breathed the air of an Italian spring . We may have often wondered at the vain-glorious autobiography of Cellini , but the acquaintance of one Italian , with a large organ of selfesteem , illustrates the character at once . A northern reader of Shakspeare attributes wholly to the poet 's fancy the extravagant similes of Romeo and the irrepressible passion of Juliet . A single observation of youthful love in Southern Europe , will transfer the characters from the domain of imagination to that of real life ; and we know that in the age of Elizabeth , a frankness and heartiness prevailed analogous to what we at present denominate southern manners . Tue inhabitants of cold latitudes arc astonished that the peasantry about Vesuvius and Etna should contentedly build their huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few summer days passed in those regions would induce a placidity of mood , a repose upon destiny , and a dalliance with the passing moment that might explain the delusion . Not only from the life it imparts to previous knowledge , hut on account of the actual teaching it affords , the experience of travel is invaluable . I speak not so much of detached facts as regards population , manufactures , and the statistics of political economy ; these may often be learned from the pages of an Encyclopedia . There is a species of information scarcely to be gathered in the study , or if so attained , but inadequately realized , and therefore without effect . It is that series of facts and impressions , those general ideas which go to form what may be called a philosophy of life . The standard by which the untravelled measure their destiny is generally local . With them , the world of books and the real world are totally unconnected . It is only by throwing ourselves as it were , into the ocean-tide of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of life . When we have wandered into distant lands , and seen the same mysterious destiny shared by millions of similar beings , when we have heard the prayers , joined the festivities , witnessed the loves , and shuddered at the crimes of different nations , we gain , as it were , a new conviction of the universality of the system of things under which we live . We perceive that our lot is not peculiar . We recognize with new sensibility , a power sustaining and guiding this immense community of spirits , and we fall back upon this primitive truth with an unwonted trust and a profounder reverence . Those who surround a man in his own country are , as it were , but repetitions of himself . Familiarity renders him blind to the characteristics of his nature which they teach him . In strange // communities , however , the traits of ' character are so modified as to be striking . And thus it often happens that a traveller is indebted to his absence for his most valuable self-knowledge . Abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He feels , perhaps , for the first time , that " he is a stranger and a pilgrim on the earth . " And in this experience there is permanent advantage . Jhe will acquires new force , for its exercise is nece*sary to maintain his position and prosecute his purposes . The perceptive powers are called into more intense action , for he is required to observe where novelty excites , and information must be rapidly acquired . The great lesson of sclt*dependenee is learned in travel if it is learned at all for however friendless a man 's position may be in his own country , the very faniiliarity of things will yield him no little support . But when all accustomed props are withdrawn and the scene is changed to a far-off land , to his own mind must the traveller look for his means of success , to his own capacities of self-government and social influence , for those aids and appliances essential to rational enjoyment . What latent energy and heroic perseverance did travel call forth in such men as Mnngo Park , Bruce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education has been neglected , his energies previously untasked , travel will surely make the misfortune felt . The lessons spread before hint in an unexplored volume of nature and man , will present but a confused or blank page , if there is no reflective habit to unlock its stores , no generous sympathies to give interest to its details , no well-considered principles to illumine its obscurity . As the unfortunate Casper Hauser was incapable of motion or speech when released from his long imprisonment , so the uninformed and weak can neither enjoy personal progress nor elevating communion , when ushered unattended upon the highway of the world . The phrenologists tell us of an organ of locality , and there is no respect in which men differ more widely than in what may be called a sensibility to place . Upon some , local change makes little impression . They seem incapable of exhausting the interest of their native spot , or rather , are wholly indifferent to place as such . Others are so constituted as to find the greatest delight in exploring new scenes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will make astonishing sacrifices to obtain the refreshment of a change . Hence the pleasure which so many shiftless *vanderers have derived , a delight quite inexplicable to those who are too enamored ( if the comfortable and familiar to move from their chimney-nooks . By virtue of this native interest in localities , the memory is *stonisliingly vivid . Places visited years by-gone are recalled in all their features by an effort of the will . In the weary nightwatches which accompany a slow convalescence , the mind , when too prostrate to grapple with abstract ideas , easily invokes the scenes of its past experience . The very flavor of fruits or wine peculiar to a province , the odors , the sights , the sounds of a country come back upon the senses with a marvellous freshness . In this manner , the traveller with a large organ of locality and sufficient imagination , as he lies feeble and impatient amid the silence and shadows of a sick room , revisits in fancy the lands he once traversed with delight . The scenery , the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappear to cheat confinement of its weariness and feebleness of its gloom . Among the pleasures of the traveller is to be reckoned the consideration he enjoys . If the persons with whom he comes in contact interest him from their novel manners or opinions , he presents to them a similar attraction . He is a specimen of a different race . His per sonal experience , the institutions under which he has lived , the views in which he has been educated , have modified his merely human characteristics . In some point of knowledge or character he presents an aspect of superiority ; and then , too , he is a stranger , one who will bear from these new scenes permanent impressions . Hence by the kindly and intelligent he is regarded with interest , and if of a cordial disposition , can not fail to realize the charms of hospitality , and to win esteem and love . He may thus be enabled to speak with an authority never before granted him . His claims to regard are recognized as they never were among his familiars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // edged among men as it never was at home . " A prophet is not without honor save in his own country , " is a saying of holy origin . The traveller soon feels its truth , and it may cheer him through life to have thus had his legitimate claims cordially recognized . There is often a disposition to sneer at the pretensions , however humble , which a man makes in his native place . There his influence is seldom great . He passes not for what he is worth . Thrown among his kind , away from the influence of familiarity and prejudice , free scope is afforded him , asd the true man is , perhaps , for the first time , fairly revealed to his fellows . A learned friend of Boccacio was accustomed in Italy to call himself a Greek , and in Greece , an Italian , being persuaded that in both countries it was honorable to pass for a stranger . Even Milton was first appreciated abroad . When a youth , unknown to fame , his genius was warmly acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England until long after the appearance of his Paradise Lost . Who shall say that it was not among strangers that he conceived the idea of a work which the world should " not willingly let die * " There are few more touching instances of the fragility of delight than that afforded by an ardent traveller , too ill to enjoy the charms which surround him . To gaze on the richest scenery and breathe the balmiest air , yet be prevented by pain from realizing their blessedness ; to stand amid beautiful ruins , with a mind so unnerved by physical weakness as not to luxuriate in their associations ; to climb the volcano , only to sink breathless on its summit ; wander to where the greenest hills are canopied by the most azure skies , only to die when life is arrayed in new beauty ; to pause with a throbbing brow before a miracle of art , or tread with a quivering pulse the magnificent aisle of a church-is to know by experience the sufferings of Tantalus . Yet thus daily do the grandeur of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the loveliness of the Bay of Naples , fall , with a melancholy contrast , upon the heart of suffering . Thus mingling the glory of nature with the weakness of humanity did the Last Minstrel traverse the land of song thus breathing his last sigh in the regions of poetry , died the gifted Keats . The necessity of economy in travelling , as in other arrangements of life , often proves a blessing ; for much comfort and independence may contravene the most desirable influences of journeying . I have often noted with compassion the eqoipage of a rich Englishman on the continent . Day after day he proceeds rapidly through a new and picturesque country , of which he takes no note save by an occasional glance from the window . Occupied with a book , or half asleep on his rich cushions , he suffers himself to be whirled from place to place , holding communion only with his servant , seeking in silence a solitary apartment at the inns , and ever carrying with him the associations and customs of home . On the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist or invalid student , is ensconced in a lumbering old coach , with half-a-dozen natives , who point ont to him the interesting localities , afford him specimens of the people , and by their conversation and manners unfold continually striking features of national character . It is well to be thus forced into contact with men and things . If one so situated has a teachable disposition , he can not but improve . At all events , the pedestrian and the traveller by public conveyance gains art insi , ht which the luxurious egotist seldom acquires . He imbibes a foreign atmosphere , and feels himself in a new position . The desired experiment is fairly tried . To " cast ourselves into the rushing of time , into the rolling of accident , " is one of the true objects of travel . We wander in order to subject ourselves to new agencies . We roam to enlarge our experience , to commune with what is foreign , and not obstinately to entrench ourselves in home peculiarities , or rather be dragged onward , while in thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the thrall of habit . Much is said of the pertness and prejudice of travellers . Upon weak minds , " voyaging about , " doubtless , has as ill an effect as shallow draughts of learning . But such form the exception , not the rule . Characters of this order are as likely to be spoiled at home as abroad . They are finely // Batirized in " As you Like it . " " Farewell , monsieur traveller , " said Rosalind , " look you lisp , and wear strange suits ; disable all the benefits of your own country ; be out of love with your nativity , or I will searee think you have swam in a gondola . " There is , however , a certain narrow spirit sometimes indulged towards returned travellers , especially if they are of an enthusiastic turn , and prone to dwell upon their experiences . Such converse is at once set down by these cavillers to conceit and assurance , whereas it not infrequently springs from an honest adiniration and tasteful ardor . To men of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the impressions derived from travel . Far from ridiculing , they encourage the ardent reminiscences of one fresh from foreign scenes , delight in his conversation and sympathize in his feelings , as being both natural and worthy . Next to visiting interesting places , is the pleasure of hearing a friend describe and discuss them . When a man talks ostentatiously of the illustrious acquaintances he has formed abroad , or boasts of his achievements , he is fairly exposed to ridicule . But when one speaks from a full heart of the aspects of nature , of glorious productions of art , of social traits and stirring associations ; when one in kindness and honesty , endeavors to make others share the impressions of a pilgrimage , whoever listens with an illconcealed sneer , convicts himself of gross illiberality , and should become a traveller himself to acquire more generous sentiments . There is no small discipline involved in travel . In no experience of life are the trials of patience more severe . He whose serenity is not proof against petty vexations , who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at occasional imposition , had better not quit the regulated circle of his own sphere . To be a good traveller , argues one no ordinary philosopher . A sweet landscape must sometimes be allowed to atone for an indifferent supper , and an interesting ruin charm away the remembrance of a hard bed . Entrance to a large city is not infrequently purchased at the expense of provoking delays at custom houses and passport offices , and glimpses of a classic stream , purling along in the moonlight , is often the only circumstance which alleviates the chill weariness of a night-jaunt . We must sometimes allow the bland face of a peasant saluting the passing carriage , to mitigate the annoyance of disagreeable companionship , and invoke cheerful memories to brighten a dreary prospect . In a word , a good-natured spirit , a determination not to be annoyed , and an urbanity of soul , quick to recognize the agreeable and dwell upon the " silver lining of every cloud " - must be the prevailing mood of the traveller . With this , he may defy quarantines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an admirable remedy for over-fastidiousness and sickly refinement . Happy for the traveller , if he have something of Goldsmith 's humor , and Lamb 's sensibility to the amusing . Then shall the very mishaps of his wayfaring provoke a smile , and not a face or incident cross his path without yielding a moral or furnishing a picture . Besides these minor troubles , travel gives occasion for graver disquietudes . There are times when the lot of a stranger weighs heavily upon the heart , when an unwonted yearning for the familiar takes possession of the mind . Sitting in the silent chamber of his inn , before seeking the solace of society or sight-seeing , the newly-arrived traveller is often conscious of a solitude more profound than that of the desert . There is sometimes a sense of loneliness inspired by the eager multitudes of strange cities , almost sublime in its desolation . The mighty tide of human life seems rushing by , and the lone pilgrim is like an " ocean-weed east on the shore . " Not an eye meets his with familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone salutes his ear . Not a heart beats responsive to his own . He is alone in the midst of his kind . Hirelings only betray a selfish interest in his person . He wanders amid the hum of business ; he hears the converse of friendship ; he sees the tokens of domestic enjoyment , but he is a stranger ; and if death should then overtake him , not a tear will there moisten his grave-not a sigh be wafted to his memory . This detached feeling-this consciousness of isolation , may , indeed , be rarely experienced , and is usually put to flight with ease ; but it may be fairly accounted among the // trials of travel , and when health an d resources fail , is susceptible of terrible aggravation . Another and more common drawback to the traveller 's enjoyment , is the necessity of breaking away from delightful scenes just as association has endeared them , and yielding up congenial society and cherished friends , when habit had made them almost necessary to happiness . Where the temper is sanguine , abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him have been too long familiar to his fancy , not to make the first impression painful . Anticipation has perhaps absolutely precluded the zest of enjoyment . " Distance has lent " so great an " enchantment to the view , " that the illusion is not dispelled without a rending of the most valued associations . Disgust too often nsurps the place of delight . And then , it is well to consider how much the traveller 's pleasure depends upon circumstances , which it is impossible to foresee or contravene . The face of a wo-begone beggar may poison the most exquisite meal . The market near the Pantheon may prevent the spectator from admiring its architecture ; a misty day spoil the finest view on the Rhine ; a head-ache prevent all laughing at the carnival ; a ciceroni 's gabble annihilate the quiet eloquence of a Madonna 's smile , and a hard mule preclude wrapt devotion to the scenery of the Alps . Travel is the great teacher of liberality . A limited sphere of observation is unfavorable to the attainment of generous views . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is requisite to counteract the narrowing influences of local prejudice . For this and similar defects of character , the extended prospect which travel opens is the readiest remedy . Can a man of taste and sensibility mingle at large with the world , and not insensibly acquire more liberal habits of thought ! When he has sojourned for weeks amid the solemn loneliness of " old ocean 's grey and melancholy waste , " threaded the motley crowds of a hundred towns , and gazed upon a long procession of princes and peasants - will he not lose all sense of petty distinctions , and look upon his race with " an infinite pity , an infinite love 3 " Will the sacred shrines of genius , and the mighty fields of history , inspire no new interest in man ! When he discovers that " stranger is a holy name " in every clime , will not the conviction awaken and confirm the feeling of human brotherhood ! It is next to impossible to be brought into contact with a vast number of individuals , to enter into the peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large sphere , without mental expansion . How many of Dr. Johnson 's prejudiees would have faded away , had he grown familiar with other lands , and modified his partiality for Fleet street ! How much of the stationary civilisation of the Chinese is attributable to their obstinate habits of nonintercourse . The Venetians were among the earliest European travellers , and they were long celebrated for their respect for strangers . There is a comprehensiveness of view , a superiority to the trifling and the mean , and an enlarged intelligence , which is one of the most valuable results of travel . The happy disposition and culture , or social circumstances of some , may enable them to arrive at the same end by different means ; but they form exceptions to a general rule . The confined walls of a faniiliar sphere fall before the traveller 's eyes , and he looks forth to the far horizon . He recognizes the whole world of Nature as his inheritance , and hails every man as his brother . Intolerance , contempt , unfounded judgments , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , fly away as night-birds at the approach of dawn . He has learned to behold the signatures of truth , to appreciate the influence of circumstances , to overlook the boundaries of sect , and pierce the veil of condition . A thoughtful inspection of life on a large scale , has reduced the exaggerated aspect of his selfish aims to their due proportion . Memorials of the past have taught him more calmly to estimate an existence whose duration is so transitory , and to cherish those brave and elevated sentiments which alone can redeem it to a noble nature . His vain confidence vanishes before the majestic evidences of infinite wisdom . The mystery of life comes home to his mind . The limits of knowledge grow painfully obvious to his wider vision , and he comes to look habitually around him with an inquiring mind , ever open to conviction , and a heart // touched with veneration and love . Truth is nearer such a spirit : progression certainly is its destiny . Literature and society are henceforth liberally interpreted . A humane eclecticism takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and arbitrary discipline had riveted upon the young mind , are riven asunder , and it goes forth with a lofty independence , a freedom of thought , a catholic spirit . The dread of mere human opinion is conquered . Reverence turns freely to congenial objects , to the truly great in humanity , to the benignant authority of Heaven . The pilgrim , emancipated from social tyranny , yields only to the impulse of personal conviction , and follows no luminary but the star of Truth . We are all seekers . In every human breast there are strong and various desires , more or less defined , and all forbidding repose . To action we naturally turn to allay this restlessness of spirit , and there seems , in such cases , an almost instinctive disposition to seek in change of place the refreshrnent we crave . Hence that beautiful adjuration of the Psalmist , " 0 that I had the wings of a dove , that I might fly away and be at rest . " We know that wherever we go our consciousness remains : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own felicity we make or find . " But the perceptive faculties are so exercised in travel , novelty is so sweet an excitement , and the very sense of progress from place to place so soothing , that we can not wonder that so many ardent and sensitive men have been wanderers . " In travelling , " says the poet Rogers , " we multiply events , and innocently . " " I have discovered , " says the bard of Laura , " that change of place is the only thing which can long keep us from that weariness which is inseparable from a sedentary life ; " and we know how often he loved to exchange the quiet solitude of Vaucluse for the excitement of an embassy . Until he became a tragic writer , the earnest soul of Alfieri found its chief solace in travel . Byron obeyed a poetical impulse when he turned to foreign scenes as the associations of home became painful or vapid . Dante , wrapt in the mantle of stern endurance , found some relief for his poignant sense of injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliment to the poetic soul . It has been well said that " a genius for poetry is nothing but a finer liability to impressions , but what matters the liability if we do not put ourselves in the way of thoughts and feelings that are to impress us 3 " Travel deepens the sense of nationality . We hear much of the foreign tastes acquired abroad , and are apt to deduct from a traveller 's patriotism in the ratio of his enthusiasm for distant countries . This is a great error . Perhaps no man is fully aware of the reality of his love of country , until he knows the lot of a stranger . His local and political partialitics , may have warmed him , at home , into a partizan orator ; but when the sea once divides him from his country , he clings to his citizenship with unwonted pride ; he feels , as never before , a high and delicate sense ( if national honor ; the fame of his country becomes a matter of individual concernment . He walks amid the throngs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nativity . I shall never forget how strongly these emotions were awakened , at the close of a long , balmy day in spring , when I approached the ancient city of Syracuse . My tired mule was slowly descending a declivity bordered with broken ranges of tombs . The long , pencilled lines ofan Italian sunset-rose and saffron and amber , were glowing in the west . A few peasants were driving their goats through the grassgrown area within the gates . The silence and decay of a scene so renowned in history , were doubly affecting at that pensive hour . I looked upon the crumbling mounds of the adjacent plain , up to the grey and moss-grown walls of the impoverished town , and then over the beautiful bay so often furrowed by the keels of opposing squadrons , btit now lonely and placid as one of our mountain lakes . Anchored in the midst of the calm waters , lay a beautiful yacht , and at the masthead the " star-spangled banner " was fluttering in the breeze . Then , as if by magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glory and grandeur of Syracuse vanished from my mind , and gave place to visions of mighty forests , broad rivers , and bustling cities ; the visible tokens of decay were forgotten in thoughts of the fresh // energies and triumphant activity of my native land ; and the sepulchre of Archimedes , who boasted that had he whereon to stand , he could move the world , grew dim at the thought of him whose simple tomb is shadowed by the groves of Mount Vernon . Let me refer , in this connection , to the singular advantages , in a national point of view , possessed by the American traveller . The names of older nations are associated with degrading facts in their history , or prejudices induced by real or supposed aggressions . Their course , either in arms or diplomacy , towards each other , has given rise to national prejudices which time will scarcely heal . But among the people of continental Europe , the name of American is a most honorable passport . It is a fresh and hopeful name . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and those who hear it must be singularly false to its claims , if they do not find it the occasion of frequent and flattering consideration . Our national existence has been too brief to allow the formation of those inveterate antipathies which often obstruct the path of other travellers . We have been called the head of the popular party of the world . The ploughman at Marathon , we are told , blesses the wanderer from a country which sent her tribute for the relief of struggling Greece , and reared the standard of popular education at Athens . The proudest frigate of the Turkish fleet is the offspring of American skill and enterprise . The Italian gazes with affectionate enthusiasm upon one of a nation whose struggle for liberty has been made familiar to him by the graphic pen of Botta . France , notwithstanding our little variances , can never forget the name of Lafayette ; and even ( usmembered Poland has a vital graft of nationality upon our country 's tree in the memories of Kosciusko and Pulaski . The physical benefits of travel are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances where disease is aggravated by the ex - posure and irregularities incident to a tour . But in numerous cases , the change of air an ( l diet , the exercise and pleasing excitement , renew the tone of the system when other remedies have been vainly resorted to . In travelling especially , does " good digestion wait on appetite , and health on both . " In proof of this , witness the zest with which travellers record their good dinners , and the cordial tribute they ever pay to places and persons , which have thus ministered to their pleasure . The district where they first taste a rare wine , the waters beside which they have feasted upon some delicious fish , or the road-side inn where they have unexpectedly fallen upon a hearty meal , often figure in their pages to the detriment of the magnificent ruin , or the exquisite landscape . Something of Falstaff s zealous relish colors such reminiscences . In approaching Naples , the traveller anticipates a legitimate feast of maccaroni , and a bottle of lachrymachristi , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon certain unsentimental voyagers , the sausages of Bologna leave a more vivid impression than her pictures ; and on the shores of Greece , classical references are often neglected in favor of a more recent authority which bids us " fill high the bowl with Samian wine . " The romance of travel is rapidly disappearing . Steam , in the train of its many blessings , brings a counterpoise of disadvantages . What we gain in time we often lose in enjoyment . As the conveniences of travel multiply , we are apt to grow more selfish . The necessity of mutual forbearance and mutual support is greatly diminished , and the traveller 's position is often isolated and mechanical . What have become of the delightful stage-coach adventures which used to make a day's. journey so rich an experience l When the Atlantic was ploughed only by sailing vessels , fellow-passengers felt the necessity of being mutually agreeable , but few deem it worth their while so to enliven a fortnight in a steam-ship , . half of which , perhaps , is passed in seasickness . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Knickerbocker , the voyagers became quite like a family party before they reached Albany ; but on board the gay and rapid steamboats that now ply on that glorious river , you see ladies wholly absorbed in the scenery , and gentlemen reading newspapers . There is no hope of speaking a homewardbound craft , or lying to in some picturesque inlet for the night . Mandeville , the author of the first English book of travels , was thirty years exploring // countries that may now be satisfactorily visited in three . The very deserts are to be intersected by rail-roads . Venice will soon be joined to the main land by a bridge , and an omnibus has been several years established at Athens . It must be confessed that the true zest of a tour is seldom realized in the United States . The absence of time-hallowed associations is one obvious cause . Another may be found in the fact that we travel chiefly for purposes of business or with a view to pleasure , when the jaunt is ended . The rapidity of movement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which throng our public conveyances , and the utilitarian objects in view , make travelling with us oftener a toil than a pleasure ; so that the experienced traveller might ask upon his return from an American trip , in the same tone with which the excuisite in Pelbam , speaks of an illcut-coat , " do you call this thing a journey * " In cars and steamboats we often feel like victims rather than voluntary agents , an idea which the recklessness and terrible accidents so often occurring , is not calculated to dispel . Natural scenery is the grand resource of the American traveller . In this respect , his pleasures are unsnrpassed . Niagara , the lakes , the various magnificent mountains and lovely shores , are the shrines of our pilgrimages ; and fit altars are they to kindle the worship of a free people , and inspire with elevated enthusiasm , the poets of liberty . We can easily fancy what a rare and romantic delight an inhabitant of the old world must experience in ranging the primeval forests , tracing the majestic rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genial activity and free exposure to nature in all her bold magnificence , the delicious repast of the hunter , the woodland encampment , the mighty groves , the clear sky , and the brilliant wild flower , as if " fresh from the hand of God , " must strike his senses and his soul with something of the glory of a new creation . And the volumes of De Tocqueville and Chevalier , indicate how much there is in our social condition to attract the philosophic eye , and interest the philanthropic heart . In placing so high an estimate upon the advantages of travel , we would not be understood as in the slightest degree undervaluing those sacred feelings that bind a human being to the place of his nativity , and identify all his dearest hopes and interests with home . Abundant are the consolations of the untravelled . They " hurry not to arrive where none expect them , " nor " drag at each remove a lengthening chain . " They are exempt from the evils of absence , and need not find " life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel at will in their library chairs , unannoyed by the visitations of that passion , which the organ of locality , when once indulged in , will not let sleep . For them has been kept sacred a green spot for the affections to take root ; their love does not " run to waste and water but the desert , " and they can use the sublime words of a gifted spirit ; - " I die without having seen Switzerland , and the ocean , and many fine sights , but the scenes of eternity I shall in no case fail to see . " Happy is the being whose views are bounded only to be blessed , who is unvisited by " chance desires , " who finds in the immediate and familiar all that is genial and requisite , and who can say with an amiable and quaint essayist , " 1 would set up my tabernacle here . My household gods plant a terrible fixed foot , and are not removed without blood . " There is no purer and more lasting enjoyment of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man 's best things are nearest him , Lie close about his feet ; " who feel , amid the vicissitudes of time , that they are environed by associations and objects rendered dear by unbroken sympathies ; who are ever greeted by " familiar faces , " rove , through life , beside the same river that witnessed the dreams of boyhood , sit in age beneath the same tree that sheltered their infancy , and sleep at last in the shadow of the same spire that guided them to heaven . To a true spirit , no scene of natural beauty is ever exhausted , and the most limited social intercourse is rich in meaning . We have only to remember what London was to Charles Lamb , and " Our Village , " is to Miss Mitford , to perceive how many of the best fruits of travel may be realized without its deprivations . To reap the best fruits of travel , a // certain degree of enthusiasm , and something of an ideal temperament , is essential . Without them , the pains of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed . " Does he , " asks an earnest writer , " who is not endowed with an enthusiastic imagination , flatter himself that he is , in any degree , acquainted with the earth on which he lives , or that he has travelled through any of its various countries Does his heart beat at the echo of the mountains , or has the air of the South lulled his senses in its voluptuous softness l " It is chiefly through associations that travel interests , and their vividness evidently depends upon the ardor and imagination of the traveller . If these obtain , he will forget fatigue and inconvenience , lose himself at every hallowed spot , and keenly relish the least inkling of an adventure . To him a moonlight night at Venice , a sunrise from Mount Etna , a morning in the Florence Gallery or Westminster Abbey , a spartito of Rubini , an excursion on the Lake of Geneva , or a promenade in the Tuileries , will be fondly remembered long after the trials of his tour are utterly forgotten . lie will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without vexing himself with doubts as to the authenticity of the lovers ' tomb . He will conjure up the fables of antiquity while viewing the shattered temples at Agrigentum , rising with venerable grace in the twilight , and cease to grumble because the fleas disturbed his siesta . He will enjoy the picturesque street as he is whirled over its noisy pavement by lamp-light , and chat pleasantly with the Tuscan peasant by the river side . He will kneel in the Cathedral of Milan , and suffer his soul to rise on the wings of a Catholic anthem . He will linger at a Swiss village for the sake of growing familiar with a fine prospect , and frequent the Forum at Rome , by moonlight , to overcome the disappointment its appearance awakens by day . He will cultivate the society of artists notwithstanding their habiliments are grotesque , and explore a palace that attracts him , although it is not specified in the guide-book . He will tremble with joy over the good tidings from home , and gratefully receive the boon of friendship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival , the tearful excitement of the departure , the teeming language of new scenes and unaccustomed society , the sights , the sounds , the sensations , the thoughts and emotions-all the phenomena of a pilgrimage , will be to him a stirring and memorable experience . To hint every new locality will prove an inspiration . The tomb of genius will be as a holy shrine , the mountain-top as an altar of God . The battle-ground will vibrate with the murderous pageantry of war , and the fertile valley breathe the peacefulness of Eden . He will bless Guido for renewing to his fancy the pensive countenance of Beatrice , and Salvator for instructing his eye in the wild combinations of forest scenery . He will meet Shylock on the Rialto , and hear the echoes of Tully 's voice beside the temple of Jupiter . He will recognize Dr. Bellario in the darkrobed student of Padna , and the fetters of Columbus will clank in his ears amid the narrow thoroughfares of Genoa . Chivalric legends will beguile him upon the rimparts of Malta , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scattered grey of Mary Stuart 's auburn locks will gleam before his fancy at Holyrood , and Byron 's melancholy story haunt his walks at Venice . Every windmill in Spain reminds him of Don Quixote , and he will think of Cleopatra 's pearl as he quaffs wine in Egypt . To him it is no mystery that the Moor drew from Desdemona " a prayer of earnest heart " that he " would all his pilgrimage dilate , " nor that the story won her . All that history has chronicled , and poetry consecrated , will mingle and glow in the mind of the enthusiastic traveller .. And without this warmth of fancy and moral sensibility , the experience of travel is cold and unredeemed . It is through sympathy with characters of renown or ideal beauty that their forms are invoked , and without these radiant images to people the lonely dungeon and the silent shore , the wild glen and the modernized edifice , how unattractive would they often be . " The beings of the mind are not of clay , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned to reverence Nature and genius , and be a lover of his race ; he who would realize its best results , must be an ar // dent votary of improvement , and open that elicits social delight , must proceed his heart to its teachings .
