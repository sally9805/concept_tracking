Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : BOOKS . from Poems , in The opal ( 1848 ) A blessing on the Printer 's art ! Books are the Mentors of the heart . The burning soul , the burdened mind , In books alone companions find . We never speak our deepest feelings , Our holiest hopes have no revealings , Save in the gleams that light the face , Or fancies that the pen may trace . And hence to books the heart must turn , When with unspoken thoughts we yearn , And gather from the silent page The just reproof , the counsel sage , The consolation kind and true , That soothes and heals the wounded heart , As on the broken plant the dew Calls forth fresh leaves and buds to view , More lovely as the old depart . And when , with gloomy fears oppressed , The trembling-hearted fain would rest , No opiate like a book that charms , With its deep spell , the mind 's alarm Opening , as Genius has the key , Some haunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender love , As vista to the heaven above ; Where the lone wandering one may come , Refreshed and glad as though at home ; And feel the soul has wells of joy , Like springs that gush in cavern 's gloom , And hopes like gold without alloy , Or diamonds buried in a tomb . Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : FOREST WORSHIP . from Poems , in The opal ( 1848 ) What numbers , when the Sabbath comes , Are trooping from their forest homes ! The maiden , pure as prairie rose , Beside her bending grandsire goes ; The fawn-eyed children bound at large , The mother brings her nursling charge ,  --  And , bearing some pale , sickly child , Stalks the strong hunter of the wild . And he may see , through copse-wood near , The antlers of the browsing deer ; Or , as his path through prairie goes , Hear the dull tramp of buffaloes ; Or savage foe , or beast of prey , May haunt his steps , or bar his way , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , his friends to guard : The rifle in his ready hand Proclaims the forester 's command ,  --  And as his glance is onward cast , Or wild-wood sounds go rustling past , His flashing eye and flushing cheek Betray the wish he may not speak ;  --  But soon these fancies fade away , Checked by the thought  --  ' t is Sabbath Day ! And when he gains the House of Prayer , Heart , soul and mind are centered there . That House of Prayer  --  how mean beside The grand Cathedral 's sculptured pride ! Yet He who in a manger slept , And in the wilds his vigils kept , Will breathe a holy charm around , Where his true followers are found . Oh ! never dream it low and rude , Though fashioned by the settler 's axe , The sap still weeping from the wood , As loath to leave its brother trees , That wave above it in the breeze , No pomp it needs , no glory lacks ;  --  The holy angels are its guard , And pious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Lord , The Temple of the living God ! But when the Sabbath gatherings press , Like armies , from the wilderness , ' T is then the dim , old woods afford The Sanctuary of the Lord ! The Holy Spirit breathes around  --  That forest glade is sacred ground , Nor temple built with hands could vie In glory with its majesty . Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE GATHERED LILY-BUD. from Poems , in The opal ( 1848 ) BY THE EDITOR A cloud has darkened o'er a home Where happiness like sunshine lay ,  --  The angel of the Lord has come And taken their lily-bud away ! As falls the blight of early frost And seals the world for winter 's doom , One gone  --  the household band has lost The charm that gives to life its bloom . One gone  --  whose sweet caressing kiss Could cheer the father 's heaviest care , And fill the mother 's heart with bliss A seraph might have wished to share ! And yet to heaven the more we give , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all of life to live ,  --  It is not here God 's lilies blow . The buds withdrawn from human care Are set where crystal waters move , And there they open  --  O ! how fair  --  Watched by the Saviour 's tender love . Then , sorrowing parents , look above , And there behold your Lily-bud , And while earth 's emptiness ye prove , Rejoice your treasures are with God .
