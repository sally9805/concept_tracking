Story , William Wetmore , 1819-1895 : SONNET. from Poems , in The liberty bell ( 1843 ) Slavery is wrong , most deeply , foully wrong : Yet shame to those who madly plead its cause , Trampling on duties , charities and laws ! Do they not know that Truth alone is strong ? That temperance doth at her side belong , And lofty Justice ? that this world 's applause , And this world 's blame , but mark , like idle straws , Which way the popular current sets along ? Truth hath stepped down from off her lofty seat , And her white robes of Justice are defiled , When she in angry factions sets her feet , And fires the pyre that Bigotry has piled . Still let her words be calm , her action high ; Thus will she surely stab the heart of Slavery . Story , William Wetmore , 1819-1895 : SONNET. from Poems , in The liberty bell ( 1843 ) Freedom ! august and spirit-cheering name ! When will thy blessed light encircle all ? How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begot of shame ? How long in grovelling sense , debased and tame , Shall man 's aspiring spirit cringe and crawl , And , with crushed hopes , hug round that moral pall , Where life is reft of will and noble aim ? Such questions ask I of the swelling sea ; Such of the roaring winds , and boundless sky ; And , like a trumpet-blast , I hear their cry , ' He who is true unto himself is free ! When to the Truth man 's spirit shall be wed , Freedom shall be his law , and Peace his bed . '
