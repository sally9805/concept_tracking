Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : THE REAPER . from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) How still Earth lies !  --  behind the pines The summer clouds sink slowly down . The sunset gilds the higher hills And distant steeples of the town . Refreshed and moist the meadow spreads , Birds sing from out the dripping leaves , And standing in the breast-high corn I see the farmer bind his sheaves . It was when on the fallow fields The heavy frosts of winter lay , A rustic with unsparing hand Strewed seed along the furrowed way . And I too , walking through the waste And wintry hours of the past , Have in the furrows made by griefs The seeds of future harvests cast . Rewarded well , if when the world Grows dimmer in the ebbing light , And all the valley lies in shade , But sunset glimmers on the height . Down in the meadows of the heart The birds sing out a last refrain , And ready garnered for the mart I see the ripe and golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : TO MY VERY DEAR SISTER . from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) No need is there of being wise To read the love within thine eyes ; Thy love thou canst not all disguise . Thy hair is brown , thy eyes are gray , And many tender things they say ; ( Sweet eyes , thus speak to me alway ! ) Thy forehead white beneath its veins Soft throbbing , secret wealth contains , Fair fruit of fertilizing rains . For often , lying in the shade , Thy tresses loosened from their braid , An open book before thee laid ; Thou readest many wondrous things That give unto thy spirit wings ; And dreamy old imaginings . But more than tress or witching eyes , Or all that therein hidden lies , Thy love I infinitely prize . Thy love is like a joyous rill That rippling down life 's rugged hill , The crevices with gold-dust fill .

She hears the night-bird from the wood Mourn in his sable feather hood , She hears her own heart beating . The dull watch ticking ' gainst the wall , The leaves that rustle as they fall Across the window fleeting . The shadows waving to and fro , Across the bedclothes noiseless go , Across the face of Death . The bloodless cheeks their life regain , And part the pallid lips again , Yet part without a breath . The golden locks , the waveless breast , The silken lashes soft that rest Upon the marble face : All that was pure , beloved , and bright , All that is chill and clothed in night , Sleeps in the shroud 's embrace .

Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : AMY . from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) This is the pathway where she walked , The tender grass pressed by her feet . The laurel boughs laced overhead , Shut out the noonday heat . The sunshine gladly stole between The softly undulating limbs . From every blade and leaf arose The myriad insect hymns . A brook ran murmuring beneath The grateful twilight of the trees , Where from the dripping pebbles swelled A beech 's mossy knees . And there her robe of spotless white , ( Pure white such purity beseemed ! ) Her angel face and tresses bright Within the basin gleamed . The coy sweetbriers half detained Her light hem as we moved along ! To hear the music of her voice The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still , Her lips the Everlasting seal ; The hideous secrets of the grave The weeping eyes reveal .

Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : TO A LILY . from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) Go bow thy head in gentle spite , Thou lily white . For she who spies thee waving here , With thee in beauty can compare As day with night . Soft are thy leaves and white : Her arms Boast whiter charms . Thy stem prone bent with loveliness Of maiden grace possesseth less : Therein she charms . Thou in thy lake dost see Thyself : So she Beholds her image in her eyes Reflected . Thus did Venus rise From out the sea . Inconsolate , bloom not again Thou rival vain Of her whose charms have thine outdone : Whose purity might spot the sun , And make thy leaf a stain . 1845 .

Ye who would wealthy live and die , Go seek a love like this : Quis pudor desiderio Tam cari capitis ? Footnote : 1Kb The eyes , the locks , the lips , the smile , Not these my love retain . A Venus trusting in her charms Assails my breast in vain . The soul serene that taper-like Burns quietly within ; The gentle kindliness of heart And purity from sin . The blood that flushes in her cheek , Flows in my every vein ; The good old blood of ancient times Without reproach or stain ! Right loth am I to own our Sires , Stout Huguenots of yore , From Anjou , Maine , or Languedoc , So bright a jewel bore .

Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : GEORGIA . from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) Thou , like a dove , dost make thy moan , Although thou utterest no tone , Nor pleadest with thy voice alone . The pallid brow beneath thy hair , Thy gentle uncomplaining air , Make captives of us unaware . Why art thou armd otherwise Than Nature made thee , since thine eyes An host within themselves comprise ?

And like that sea , a tide will wake In thy young heart , no more to make The truant blood thy cheek forsake . No longer wilt thou drooping stand , With thy poor , pale , blue-veind hand , ( The costliest gift in all the land ! ) Sun warmed thy cheek will grow , and brown . Health will become thee as a crown , And light will smile where night did frown . And thou shalt clearly then perceive That God did only make thee grieve More elevated faith to leave . As costly diamonds in their lees , Washed from beneath the roots of trees By torrents , find the Bengalese. 1845 .

The calmas and golden-rods , And tender blossoms of the haw , Like maidens seated in the wood , Demure , I saw . The recent drops upon their leaves Shone brighter than the bluest eyes And filled the little sheltered dell Their fragrant sighs . Their pliant arms they interlaced , As pleasant canopies they were : Their blossoms swung against my cheek Like braids of hair . And when I put their boughs aside And stooped to pass , from overhead Sweet flowers . Life is to the young A shady wood . And therein some like golden-rods , For grosser purposes designed , A gay existence lead , but leave No germ behind . And others like the calmas , On cliff-sides inaccessible , Bloom paramount , the vale with sweets Yet never fill . But underneath the glossy leaves , When , working out the perfect law , The blossoms white and fragrant still Drop from the haw ; Like worthy deeds in silence wrought And secret , through the lapse of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters pale and delicate But waxing heavier each day , Until the many-colored leaves Drift from the spray . Then pendulous , like amethysts And rubies , purple ripe and red , Wherewith God 's feathered pensioners In flocks are fed . Therefore , sweet reader of this rhyme , Be unto thee examples high Not calmas and golden-rods That scentless die : But the meek blossoms of the haw , That fragrant are wherever wind The forest paths , and perishing Leave fruits behind . 1846 . Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : AHAB-MOHAMMED. from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) A peasant stood before a king and said ; ' My children starve , I come to thee for bread . ' On cushions soft and silken sat enthroned The king , and looked on him that prayed and moaned . Who cried again ;  --  ' for bread I come to thee . ' For grief , like wine , the tongue will render free . Then said the prince with simple truth ; ' Behold I sit on cushions silken-soft , of gold And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace the banquet of a king . But at my gate the Mede triumphant beats , And die for food my people in the streets . Yet no good father hears his child complain And gives him stones for bread , for alms disdain . Come , thou and I will sup together  --  come . ' The wondering courtiers saw  --  saw , and were dumb : Then followed with their eyes Ahab led With grace the humble guest , amazed , to share his bread . Him half abashed the royal host withdrew Into a room , the curtained doorway through . Silent behind the folds of purple closed , In marble life the statues stood disposed : From the high ceiling , perfume breathing , hung Lamps rich , pomegranate-shaped , and golden-swung . Gorgeous the board with massive metal shone , Gorgeous with gems arose in front a throne : These through the Orient lattice saw the sun . If gold there was , of meat and bread was none Save one small loaf ; this stretched his hand and took Ahab Mahommed , prayed to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him crave , The other gladly to his guest he gave . ' I have no more to give '  --  he cheerly said ; ' With thee I share my only loaf of bread . ' Humbly the stranger took the offered crumb Yet ate not of it , standing meek and dumb : Then lifts his eyes ,  --  the wondering Ahab saw His rags fall from him as the snow in thaw . Resplendent , blue , those orbs upon him turned : All Ahab 's soul within him throbbed and burned . Ahab Mahommed , spoke the vision then ; From this thou shalt be blessd among men . Go forth  --  thy gates the Mede bewildered flees , And Allah thank thy people on their knees . He who gives somewhat does a worthy deed , Of him the recording angel shall take heed . But he that halves all that his house doth hold , His deeds are more to God , yea more than finest gold . 1846 .

But the lover has hope , And the poet a crown For the queen of his bosom .

No longer , tall nodding , His love-lifted plume , Floats fleet as a meteor Through battle and gloom , In the front of the tempest . Lo , spacious and wide Are the lists of the world , Though corslet be rusted , And battle-flag furled : As matchless the glances Of beauty  --  as proud The chaplet  --  the voice Of the clarion as loud , As at Bayard 's command . We earn not these laurels Through rage and turmoil : No blood-stain the wreath Of the scholar doth soil : No tear of the anguished Can blister that leaf Whose winning hath cost not One doating heart grief , Through the breadth of the land .

Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : WOMAN OF CANAAN. from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) Once there came a woman weeping , Weeping to the Savior 's feet , She had left her daughter sleeping Grievously consumed by heat . Through the crowd the troubled mother Striving anxiously to see , Cried unto the wondrous stranger ; Xristos , eleeson me . When she saw the Lord had passed her Heeding not , she worshipped near , Saying ;  --  Heal her , gentle Master : Saying ;  --  Holy Master , hear . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet to give Unto dogs the bread of children , Bread whereby the children live ? But this woman full of sorrow , Full of woman 's hope and love , Trusting earnestly , did borrow Wisdom from a source above . Truth ,  --  she meekly answered , Master , Yet they have their own award ; For the dogs are fed with fragments From the table of their Lord . Marvelled much our Lord 's disciples , Such exalted faith to find In the kneeling Canaanitess . Unto her no longer blind , Then said Jesus ; As thou willest Be it to thee even now . Rise and go unto thy daughter ; Megale e pistis sou . Quick she rose and went rejoicing , Went rejoicing on her way ; Flew unto the little chamber Where her child had lain the day .

Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : ORNITHOLOGOI. from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) Thou , sitting on the hill-top bare , Dost see the far hills disappear In Autumn smoke , and all the air Filled with bright leaves . Below thee spread Are breast-high harvests , and the red Wide fallow fields : while overhead The jays to one another call , And through the stilly woods there fall Ripe nuts at intervals , where'er The squirrel perched in upper air , From tree-top barks at thee his fear : His cunning eyes mistrustingly Do spy at thee around the tree , Then prompted by a sudden whim , Down leaping on the quivering limb Gains the smooth hickory , from whence He nimbly scours along the fence To secret haunts . But thou , where roar The pine woods in long corridor , Sonorously and evermore , When through the budding shrubs descried Green slope the fields on every side ; When jasmines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill Turbid no more descends the rill , The wonder of thy hazel eyes Soft opening on the misty skies , Dost smile within thyself to see Things uncontained in , seemingly , The open book upon thy knee : And through the quiet woodlands hear Sounds full of mystery to ear Of grosser mould ; bird-voices , deer Bleets , the innumerable cries That from the teeming world arise ; Which we , self-confidently wise , Pass by unheeding . Thou did'st yearn From thy weak babyhood to learn Arcana of creation ; turn Thy eyes on things intangible To mortals ; when the earth was still , Hear dreamy voices on the hill In wavy woods , that sent a thrill Of joyousness through thy young veins . Ah , happy thou , whose seeking gains All that thou lovest , man disdains ; A sympathy in joys and pains With dwellers in the long green lanes , With wings that shady groves explore , With watchers at the torrent 's roar , And waders by the reedy shore . For Nature , through thy purity , Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Who croaketh overhead So hoarsely , with his pinion spread Dabbled in blood and dripping red . Croak , croak :  --  a RAVEN 'S curse on him The giver of this shattered limb . Albeit young , ( a hundred years , When next the forest leaved appears ! ) Will Duskywing behold this breast Shot-riddled , or divide my nest With wearer of so tattered vest ? I see myself with wing awry Approaching ; Duskywing will spy My altered air , and shun my eye . With laughter bursting , through the wood The birds will scream ;  --  ' she 's quite too good For thee . ' And yonder meddling Jay , I hear him chatter all the day ; ' He 's crippled ,  --  send the thief away . '  --  At every hop  --  ' do n't let him stay ! ' I 'll catch thee yet , despite my wing , For all thy fine blue plumes thou'lt sing Another song ! Is't not enough The carrion in the swamp we snuff , And gathering down upon the breeze , Release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal , Around the tender flock we wheel , A marksman doth some bush conceal . This very morn I heard an ewe Bleat in the thicket ; there I flew With lazy wing slow circling round , Until I spied unto the ground A lamb by tangled briers bound . The ewe meanwhile from hillock-side Bleat to her young  --  so loudly cried She heard it not when it replied . Ho , ho  --  a feast !  --  I ' gan to croak , Alighting straightway on an oak ; Whence gloatingly I eyed aslant The little trembler lie and pant : Leaped nimbly thence upon its head ; Down its white nostril bubbled red A gush of blood . Ere life had fled My beak was buried in its eyes Turned tearfully upon the skies , Strong grew my voice and weak its cries  --  No longer could'st thou sit and hear This demon prate in open air Deeds horrible to maiden ear . Begone !  --  thou spokest . Overhead The startled fiend his pinion spread , And croaking maledictions , fled . But hark : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evermore . Thou sest how around the tree , With scarlet head for hammer , he Probes where the haunts of insects be . The worn in labyrinthian hole Begins his sluggard length to roll : But crafty Rufus spies the prey , And with his mallet beats away The loose bark crumbling with decay . Then chirping loud , with wing elate He bears the morsel to his mate . His mate , she sitteth on her nest , In sober feather garments dressed , A matron underneath whose breast Three little tender heads appear . With bills distent from ear to ear , Each clamors for the larger share : And whilst they clamor , climb , and lo Upon the margin to and fro , Unsteady poised , one wavers slow . Stay , stay ;  --  the parents anguished , shriek  --  Too late : For venturesome yet weak , His frail legs falter under him , He falls ,  --  but from a lower limb A moment dangles ; thence again Launched out upon the air : in vain He spreads his little plumeless wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou , who all did'st see and hear , Young , active , wast already there And caught the flutterer , in air . Then up the tree to topmost limb , A vine for ladder , borest him . Against thy cheek his little heart Beat soft . Ah , trembler that thou art ; Thou spokest smiling ; comfort thee . With joyous cries , the parents flee Thy presence none ; confidingly Pour out their earnest hearts to thee . The Mockbird sees thy tenderness Of deed ; doth with melodiousness In many tongues thy praise express . And all the while , his dappled wings He claps his sides with as he sings , From perch to perch his body flings . A poet he , to ecstasy Wrought by the sweets his tongue doth say . Who shouts so loud ?  --  Hallo , hallo ! Who in the pine-top to and fro Rocks gallantly ? Ha , brother Crow , Why cawest thou so loud , below ? Caw  --  caw : Last spring good Roger came And sowed his corn : a tenth we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue-black and monkish , reason good For taking tithe of all we would According to the good old law . Caw  --  caw ! quoth I. ' I 'll stop your " caw " Quoth Roger ; Ever mortal saw Such a lean , lazy lizzard thing ! No longer will I tatters bring To fright him off , his neck I 'll wring . ' Since then has Roger soon and late , With rusty barrel lain in wait . I 'm twice as old and thrice as wise As Roger , therefore while he lies , I dig his corn before his eyes . This morning Roger came once more , And sowed a furrow as before . Hey !  --  muttered I  --  Here 's something strange ; The seasons all ha ' made a change , Unless a bad account I keep ! The fellow 's certainly asleep , He sows in Autumn , when ' ill he reap ? Off Roger goes : A feast  --  I cry , A feast ! From every furrow nigh The brotherhood their pinions fly , Now while we single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger stealthily again . Look to yourselves !  --  our sentries shriek . With wings grown wonderously weak To rise into mid air we seek ; But reeling back , some lie as dead , While others with their pinions spread Flap in the dust . Amid the din Of cawing , Roger runneth in : In either hand around he slings An anguished trunk with panting wings , Then off the headless carcass flings . I who had played the host , and fed But sparingly , in season fled To pine-top . Never farmer reaped So cursd crop ; in spirits steeped , His maize a hideous harvest yields , A malediction on his fields . No green and waving blade appears , In place of sweet and golden ears , Blood soppd fruit his furrow bears . Although a crafty profligate , Thou heardest him his grief relate , With sympathy . Will man abate , ( Thou saidest ) , nevermore his hate To these , nor with the helpless share That which without diviner care Unrecompense of labor were . Ah , let him give , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from his presence flee , And he will smiling harvests see Where indigence was wont to be . For God loves all , and does not give Life only , but the means to live . Stay , stay  --  what small wings flutter now Beneath yon flowering alder bough ? Therefrom a little plaintive voice , That did at early morn rejoice , Makes a most sad yet sweet complaint , Saying ; ' My heart is very faint With its unutterable wo . What shall I do , where shall I go , My cruel anguish to abate ? Oh , my poor desolated mate ! Dear Cherry , will our hawbush seek Joyful , and beaming in her beak Fresh seeds , and such like dainties won By patient search : But they are gone Whom she did brood and dote upon . Oh , if there be a mortal ear My sorrowful complaint to hear ; If manly breast is ever stirred By wrong done to a helpless bird ; To them for quick redress I cry . ' Moved by the prayer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting lonely and forlorn , His breast was pressed upon a thorn , Unknowing that he leaned thereon . Then bidding him take heart again , Thou rannest down into the lane To seek the doer of this wrong . Nor under hedgerow hunted long , When , sturdy , rude and sun-embrowned , A child thy earnest seeking found . To him in sweet and modest tone Thou madest straight thy errand known ; With gentle eloquence did'st show ( Things erst he surely did not know , ) How great an evil he had done : How , when next year the mild May sun Renewed its warmth , this shady lane No timid birds would haunt again ; And how around his mother 's door The robins , yearly guests before He knew their names , would come no more . But if his prisoners he released Before their little bosoms ceased To palpitate , each coming year Would find them gladly reppear To sing his praises everywhere , The sweetest , dearest songs to hear . And afterwards , when came the term Of ripened corn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Impatient thus his smile to earn . At first , flushed , angrily , and proud , He answered thee with laughter loud And brief retort . But thou did'st speak So mild , so earnestly did'st seek To change his mood , in wonder first He eyed thee , then no longer durst Raise his bold glances to thy face ; But looking down , began to trace , With little naked foot and hand , Thoughtful devices in the sand . And when at last thou did'st relate The sad affliction of the mate When to the well known spot she came , He hung his head for very shame . His penitential tears to hide , His face averted , while he cried ; ' Here take them all , I 've no more pride In climbing up to rob a nest : I 've better feelings in my breast . ' Then thanking him with heart and eyes , Thou tookest from his grasp the prize , And bid the little freedmen rise .

Beholding thee , they understand ( These Minnesingers of the land ) How thou apart from all dost stand Full of great love and tenderness For all God 's creatures : these express Thy hazel eyes . With life instinct All things that are , to thee are linked By subtle ties ; and none so mean , Or loathsome , hast thou ever seen , But wonderous in make hath been . Compassionate , thou knowest none Of insect tribes beneath the sun That thou can'st set thy heel upon . A sympathy thou hast with wings In groves , and with all living things .

But she that owns a quiet mind To good or evil fate resigned , No great unhappiness can find In any lot . A child in years , Already have maturer cares Oppressed thee , and thy eyes to tears No strangers are . Fair , fresh , and young , Thrice bitterly thy heart was wrung . For what had they to do with thee , In thy spring days , despondency , Or any woful mysteries ? Yet when thy eyes were no more blind With weeping , self-possessed , resigned , Preminent arose thy mind . And resolute in doing well , Didst henceforth teach thy breast to swell With nought that maiden will could quell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clay : How feeble in Almighty ken The most omnipotent of men Appears : And how the longest life Is one short struggle in the strife That rocks the world from age to age . What worthy hand may write the page Whose Alexandrine words unbind Thy upwardly directed mind ? One beat triumphant of the wings , And dust no more about thee clings , And all the galaxy of things Intangible and vast , expand , So that thou mayest safely stand On hitherto a quaking sand . Yet must this excellence be wrought Not by companionship with thought Alone : By tracing down the stream Of life , the glitter of a dream : By repetition vain of creeds : No ,  --  it is by thy deeds  --  THY DEEDS , The flowers will o'ertop the weeds In thy God's-garden . Cheerfully Do that allotted is to thee , And fashion out thy destiny ; So that the tomb-doors may not be Dreaded and dark , but ope to thee A heaven far as thou can'st see . 1846 .

There it is , we nightly linger , Gazing down into the stream ; It is like a nightly vision , It is like a pleasant dream . For we see , in silence standing With thy fingers locked in mine , In the waters darkly flowing All the greater planets shine . From the bridge and from the barges On the river , redder lights Gleam : Beyond the sleeping village Others show along the heights . All the city lies behind us , Like a hive with busy cells ; And it warns how time is flying , By the chiming of its bells . All the city lies behind us , And the toil of human hands : But the better God-creation Visible before us stands .

And with stronger gratitude Thank the Universal Giver , For the cool and quiet evening , For the woods and flowing river . Grateful most that he hath planted Pleasure in these hearts of ours , Not in works and world endeavors , But the sight and scent of flowers . 1846 . Legare , James Matthews , 1823-1859 : WHY SHE LOVES ME. from Orta-undis , and other poems ( 1848 ) It is happiness to be Loved by one so good as she , Loved , and that so tenderly .

Outwardly she sees me rough : That my heart of better stuff Is ,  --  she knoweth well enough . What is it to her or me , If of all ill-judged I be , So that understandeth she . Well , if she can trust me so , When the winds begin to blow , Place of shelter shall she know . During Winters long and drear , When the fruits all disappear , Snow and sorrow everywhere , She shall in my arms remain , Comforted and quit of pain , Till the Summers come again . 1846 .

Now must she stay , Since heaven itself gives reasons for delay ; The long black road and canopy of gray . She loves me so , It would be misery for her to go Uncomforted by me , I dare to know . With mournful eyes She anxiously regards the sullen skies , And for the dread of going , not of staying , sighs . Whene'er she sees The beating drops , they are the swarming bees That fetch us honey ; so her heart decrees . When I beheld At dawn the driving clouds , my bosom swelled With bitter thoughts and inwardly rebelled . For then I thought That I a hateful patience should be taught , And she would sit expectant and unsought ; But now I know , How over sodden graves meek blossoms blow , Luxuriant the more for what 's below . Henceforth , no rain To bear , will I ungratefully complain , If it this once my Love , my Life , detain . 1846 . Legare , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other poems ( 1848 ) My temples on my arm I lean , While glides Diana through the screen Of tall and overhanging trees , Until my lifted face she sees , And book spread idly on my knees . High overheard the leaves are stirred : From tree to tree , remotely heard The katydid 's incessant call : Still through the boughs and over all , The silver shafts of Dian fall . Oh Dian , thou who from thy skies Dost nightly look into her eyes , ( Her brown eyes unto thee upturned ) Say if her heart hath ever burned As mine for her hath yearned ? Remembers she each summer night When we beheld thee , from the height , The silent woods of gloom deliver : And saw in eddies of the river Thy arrows fall and shiver . Caressingly I held in mine Her little hands : No joys of wine , Or gold , or books in mortal ken , Can yield such happiness again .  --  Ah , Dian , why repeat them then ?

With waters flowing broad and red , The level lands were overspread ; Their early bloom All withered in a common tomb . The path so often trod of yore No longer traced along the shore , Before my eyes The gloomy stream , the murky skies . Oh heart , ( I groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept from thee , Which should have been As rooted forests , firm and green .

And when , oh Love , serene and fair The heavens are , and reppear On every lea , The fragrant bloom , the steadfast tree ; Then richer for these beating rains When harvest comes , in golden grains That heart will be , That trusted in its God and thee . 1847 .

Behind thee slopes the pleasant shore , The tumult of the town before , And thou , who standest in the stern , hast in thy hand an oar . Oh son of toil , whose poet 's heart Grieves from thy quiet woods to part , And yet whose birthright high it is , to labor in the mart , To thee , a child , the bloom was sweet ; But manhood loves the crowded street , And where in closes , loud and clear , the forging hammers beat . But even there may bloom for thee The blossoms childhood loved to see ; And in the cinders of thy toil , God 's fairest flowers be . 1847 .
