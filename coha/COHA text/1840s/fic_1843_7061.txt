NEW-YORK : HARPER &; BROTHERS , 82 CLIFF-STREET. 1843 . Section Acknowledgment Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1843 , by Harper &; Brothers , In the Clerk 's Office of the Southern District of New-York . Main text CHAPTER I. " Glendenning , " said White , when they were alone , " you are in an extremely awkward position , and so am I. I bore your message last evening to Lieutenant Breckenbridge . He declined receiving it on the plea that you are not a gentleman . " " Go on , " said Glendenning , who had gradually , since the appearance of White , reassumed a manner perfectly composed , and who listened , without gesture and without passion , to the startling commencement of his friend 's narration . " I asked an explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immediately determined to call him out on my own account . On seeking a friend , I learned for the first time the whole affair , which I presume you know . " " I have heard it indirectly . " " The person to whom I applied was Captain Gresham ; and what do you suppose he told me ? That , until I had explained a charge against my own honour , which had been some days current in society , he must decline bearing a message for me . Your affair with Lennox , as you have already learned , is considered to have been prematurely arranged . The originator and circulator of this opinion is Colonel Nicholson . He has so managed it as to set the matter in the light in which he desired it to be seen , and certain of his intimates , tools and toad-eaters , have worked for him with a success undeniable and incredible . For two days I had felt , I could not distinctly say what or why , a certain coolness and stiffness in the manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it grew too unequivocal to be mistaken . In short , we are both cut . We are fairly in Coventry ; I think most unjustly , and altogether in consequence of the bilious views adopted by that great potentate , Colonel Nicholson . Still that is his view , and it has produced this effect . You have now my story . " He paused , but Glendenning made no reply . " What do you propose ? " said White . " There is but one thing I can propose  --  " " There is ! and that is to  --  " " To give up my commission , and force Nicholson to meet me . " " Ah ! " said White , coolly , " that 's an alternative which , I confess , had not struck me . " " Nicholson , " said Glendenning , " is a malignant coward ! The course he has adopted in this affair is not the result of candid conviction , but of secret vengeance . I have not been able to conceal from him the contempt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temerity to detect his meanness , without the imprudence to put myself within his reach . I allude to the challenge I proposed to send him , and his characteristic manner of backing out of the scrape . Afraid ( for I shall hereafter speak openly of him ) to meet me himself , he has hit upon this way to gratify his passion without personal danger , safely sheltered , as he has the folly to suppose , behind his rank . " " You have read his heart , I believe , " said White , " as if you held it in your hand ; but to what practical purpose I can not pretend to discover . What particular course do you propose to pursue ? I do not quite understand you . " " Immediately call him to account for the opinion he has expressed . I will write him this night . " " Give me one of those cigars , will you ? " said White . " Your suggestion is not practicable . Nicholson is what you represent him ; he has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt not , you have correctly construed ; but he is your commanding officer . You have not the power to escape from his supervision in anything occurring while under his command ; nor can you , with propriety , address him but respectfully and as your superior . Were you to do otherwise , you would do exactly what he would like the most . He could ruin you forever , and he would , too , I can tell you . " " What do you advise ? " said Glendenning . " I know Nicholson is as base as he is cunning , and as revengeful as he is cowardly . Oh how my arm aches to horsewhip him ! " " Stop , stop . Take me with you , my young friend ! " said White , knocking the ashes off his cigar with his little finger nail . " It is not at all certain that Nicholson is a coward . Perhaps he would meet you gladly if he had no better way of compassing his ends . He will destroy your prospects ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you do n't take the greatest care . But he wo n't now  --  he never will meet you . " " And what , then , do you advise ? " " You have conceived accurately many features of his character . But you are irritated ; you hate him , and I think you exaggerate his bad qualities . I suspect he 's a better fellow than you think him ! " " Oh ! " said Glendenning , " I can bear anything but hearing him defended . Pray go on . " " I hope I have judged him more justly . He is , at least , born and bred a gentleman ; he must have some gentlemanly feeling . " " Well , perhaps I am heated , " said Glendenning , who began to be overmastered by an awful thought which sometimes darkly crossed his mind , and which he had thus far succeeded in avoiding any allusion to , yet which cowed and silenced him as a fiery horse is often stilled in the crisis of a storm or battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , " calmly and courteously , like a gentleman and a brother officer , request him , as your friend , to state his opinions and wishes , rectify his misconceptions , represent the matter right ( for perhaps he do n't really understand it ) , and appeal to his reason  --  his justice . " He paused and added , " If you please , to his mercy . " Glendenning rose and paced impatiently across the floor . " It is , I know , " said White , " not an agreeable duty ; it is , in fact , a humiliation . But we must all swallow some nasty doses on our way through life . He is a peculiar fellow ; but I fancy I can manage him . His understanding is weak , his heart cold , his idea of his own self-importance exaggerated . These are constitutional defects . We must get over them as we can . On the other hand , in proportion to his vindictiveness where he fancies himself not sufficiently respected , will be , perhaps , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his power . " " But to bend to him , " said Glendenning . " You must not forget , my young friend , " continued White , in a still graver tone , " that you owe your present dilemma partly to your own imprudence . You came here in a subordinate station , and ( excuse me ) with a reputation for wildness , quarrelsomeness , and contempt of authority , which foreran you . Your commanding officer happened to be a gentleman peculiarly susceptible upon such points  --  vain , pompous , arbitrary , and unforgiving  --  equally powerful in his connexions , his position , and his rank . You knew him and you bearded him . You did not conceal your consciousness of his weakness , your contempt for his vices , and your scornful indifference to his resentment . You even took pains to wound his vanity , without pausing to reflect that , by such a heart , that offence is rarely forgiven . A great and noble soul would have raised him above your follies and led him to pardon your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections by showing that he deserved them . But , my dear fellow , few men have great and noble souls . They are generally inspired with mean and selfish motives ; he in a peculiar degree ; and you have not only , in some measure , impaired his standing with others , but you have lowered him in his own eyes . Do you expect him to forgive you ? Do you expect him now to refrain from revenge , when he thinks you have placed yourself in his power ? and do you expect him to do this unasked ? " " There are truth and reason in what you say , " said Glendenning , singularly docile . " I have been rash . But what advice can he give ? How can he unsay what he has said ? A fool like him may set a house on fire , but he ca n't extinguish the flames . Besides , another objection strikes me . If we ask this man 's advice , shall we not be obliged to follow it ? " " My friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . You must let me manage this matter for you . " " But  --  " said Glendenning . " The necessity is not a pleasant one , " interrupted White , in a low voice , " but it is one of two alternatives . If  --  " " Go ! for God 's sake ! " said Glendenning . " Then leave all to me . Say no more of it ; think no more of it . What , man ! we 've been in a gale of wind before ! Smoke a cigar ; drink a bottle of wine ; go to bed , and to-morrow morning be here to learn the result . " Glendenning was at length alone ! What spell had fallen on him ? He shunned all company , even that of Southard , and throwing himself on his bed , endeavoured to sleep . For some hours he succeeded ; but at two he woke from a frightful dream  --  cold , trembling , oppressed with horror . He endeavoured with deep draughts of wine to steady his nerves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lost himself in thought . Oh , could he but bring back the past ! That was impossible . But the future was in his power . Yet he had not the true courage to think so . He felt like some one , bound and alone , on the deck of a ship , which steadily and silently , with a slow but increasing motion , is borne on and on along a resistless current , to the black maelstrom , whose fatal roar is faintly heard in the distance . Only one power could save him ! Kneel , man , and ask its aid . CHAPTER II . When he left Glendenning , White 's mind was at ease , because his resolution was fixed . He was disturbed by no moral views or conscientious scruples , no new-born beams of dim religious light , and , truth to say , very little keenness of sympathy or warmth of heart . He was a man of the world and a gentleman , but nothing more . The idea of troubling himself about a hereafter never entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in some respects , warm-hearted sensualist . An infidel , of course . He had picked up some smart arguments against Christianity , and they sufficed him . Without literary tastes , love of art or of nature , he squared his thoughts and actions upon the rules of the highest classes of society , and perhaps the thing which he considered of paramount importance in life was his standing as a man of honour and of ton  --  his name in the most exclusive circles  --  the influence he had at his club among the leaders of fashion . His idea of vice was anything " odd . " His character , manners , and rank made him a welcome and rather a caressed guest at the tables of the great , and he was a professed , and one might almost say a professional diner out . If he ever studied , it was to display his knowledge in this arena . Horses , wine , the opera , the ballet , beauty , and women , the last new novel , the passing event in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these his favourite subjects , he was here considered an amusing and even a brilliant talker . This was his aim and ambition . He did not think . He had long frittered away his capacity to feel except when seriously aroused ( which did not happen often ) . He admired nothing but from a fashionable point of view . Quite destitute of the moral sense , which an habitual worshipper of mere worldly things and an habitual liver among mere worldly influences can scarcely fail to be , he judged in all cases by his interest or by merely adventitious standards . Neither a coarse nor an ungenerous man , he was , when tested , cold and selfish . His mind was as much above mediocrity as his manners were ; and their effect was aided by a fine military person , a certain cool , self-possessed energy ; nerves which nothing disturbed , and the instinctive courage of a gentleman . He piqued himself upon being a firm friend and a bitter enemy . Although selfish , he noted down with equal care both kindnesses and offences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never forgot a favour or forgave a wrong . Vengeance in him was not malignant and mean , as it was in the pompous Nicholson . It could be aroused only by what he imagined a just cause : and when it was aroused , it never slept , never flagged . It was pursued as a duty through years with patient determination , tempered on no moral principle and checked by no religious fear . He was , in short , wholly " of the earth , earthy , " without a disinterested impulse which he would gratify at any self-sacrifice , or a tender or holy susceptibility to truth , humanity , or nature . " A primrose by a river 's brim , A yellow primrose was to him , And it was nothing more ! " Such was the companion and friend whom Glendenning had allowed to manage the " little matter " for him in which he now found himself engaged . On his way to his lodgings , after his interview with Glendenning , he also passed Nicholson 's house , and saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing crowd , and heard the gay music . The annoyance of being cut by his commander was not lost upon him , and he determined to bring the thing to a speedy termination one way or the other . To be excluded from such circles did not at all suit his tastes . On reaching home , he immediately wrote a note to Colonel Nicholson , couched in the most respectful terms , and begging the honour of half an hour 's private conversation on a subject of interest . After a short delay , the servant came back with an answer . " Lieutenant-colonel Nicholson has to acknowledge the note of Captain White , and begs the honour of Captain White 's company to breakfast at nine o'clock tomorrow morning , etc. , etc . Nicholson . " " Breakfast at nine ! yes , certainly ! " muttered White . " What could be more civil ? Perhaps we have n't done him justice . I rather fancy he 's a pretty good fellow , after all , if you take him right . If I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much the better . But if not  --  " He walked once or twice across the room . " Why not  --  that 's all ! " Penning a hasty , but most ostentatiously respectful acceptance , such as he thought suited the peculiar calibre of the grand personage he addressed , he smoked another cigar , and with the fragrant blue wreaths , which he quietly blew out of the open window , floated away all fear of the result . At nine the next morning he was in the anteroom of his commanding officer , whose opulence and love of display were sufficiently visible in the expensive and luxurious style in which his house was furnished , the suite of elegant rooms , and the number of richly-liveried servants . After a few minutes ' delay ( the great man loved those manifestations of power ) , he was ushered into a small , rich , eastern boudoir , opening upon a balcony and lovely garden , and in which he found Colonel Nicholson and his lady . The latter was a sweet , girlish-looking person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had often excited his admiration , and who , despite the most guarded air of general cheerfulness , sometimes betrayed , by a shade across her face , or an unconscious sigh , that she was ( as she could scarcely fail of being ) far from happy with the personage with whom the pecuniary interests of her family had recently united her . Another man might have been somewhat abashed under the circumstances of his present visit , but White felt nothing of the sort . Had he manifested anything like embarrassment , he would have probably found his host more haughty and forbidding . He was at first received with a certain dignity and grandeur , which it was Colonel Nicholson 's peculiar pleasure to put on and put off at various times and to various persons , and which the young officers under his command had found so offensive . But White had seen the world , and , highly born and connected himself , was not dazzled by the splendour of the great . He made his salutations , therefore , with that ease and self-possession which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence , presently felt quite at home , chatting familiarly with the amiable and pretty young creature , with whom his previous acquaintance had been on a favourable footing , and placed , in regard to the great man himself , on the perfect level which marks the communion of real gentlemen , without respect to difference of rank . Even Nicholson was sometimes ashamed of the pettiness of endeavouring to keep up his official grandeur in a private room , and suffered it to soften down into a bland and courtly importance . The conversation was gay and general . The unfortunate last night 's ball was carefully unmentioned . Various things , persons , and events were canvassed , which brought out the charming qualities of Mrs. Nicholson 's mind and heart . Nicholson , his stilts once laid aside , appeared in a favourable light , with the exception of one or two sharp insinuations and abrupt reproofs , which seemed to have for their sole intention to distress his wife , although her patient and good-natured manner of receiving them was admirable . The conjugal despot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having insulted a helpless and beautiful being wholly in his power , and thus displayed his unresisted , irresistible authority ; and White was elated and more brilliant than ever at the certainty of arranging , with a few words , a matter of life and death to his friend , to say nothing of the injury to his own reputation , which he hoped , on the present occasion , to do away . At length , resolved not to shy the subject , and not perceiving that Nicholson made any move towards a private interview , White boldly touched the chord by asking Mrs. Nicholson " how she enjoyed herself at the ball last evening . " " Why , but for the painful circumstance  --  " " My love ! " said her husband , cuttingly . " I meant  --  very much  --  only  --  " " Perhaps , my dear , you had better confine your remarks to subjects which you understand . " " Oh ! " said White , feeling that a certain hardihood would be more effective with his amiable host than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull is more likely to attack you if you fly , " the circumstance to which , I presume , you allude , will , I hope , be found susceptible of a most favourable issue . " " Thank Heaven ! " said Mrs. Nicholson : " I shall be relieved from a dreadful anxiety if your hopes prove true . " " Ladies who wish , they know not what , " said Nicholson , " and express opinions without any knowledge of the subject , are very likely to do their judgment little credit . " " Well , my dear husband , " said she , rising with graceful submission , " I confess my ignorance , but I shall not abandon my hopes . I will leave you and Captain White to discuss the matter at your leisure . " Had she expressed a desire to stay , she would not have been allowed to do so . But her lord and master had a characteristic delight in arbitrary decisions . " Pray oblige us by remaining , " said Nicholson , determined to punish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . " As you have delivered your ideas , perhaps it would not be asking too much of you to hear mine . " " Oh , I have heard them , " said she , still going , and evidently only with an effort restraining her tears . " Did you hear me request you to remain , my love ? " said Nicholson , fixing his eyes on her and pointing his hand to her seat . She sat down without a word . Nicholson was now in a position the most delightful to him in the world . He had an opportunity of acting the tyrant ; of annoying and insulting a gentleman who had placed himself in the attitude of a suppliant ; of distressing the timid and tender feelings of his wife , and of showing his full power ( whether or not he chose to exert it against him ) over Glendenning , whose lofty spirit and high-wrought temper had dared to place themselves in opposition to him . " I can scarcely , I presume , be expected to apologize , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably in the air , " for the circumstance which my wife has deemed it proper to call a painful one . " " Oh , you mean my absence from your ball ? " " I do , sir . " " It is probably occasioned by an error , which I shall be able , I trust , to explain , " said White . " I had already formed the conclusion that your request last evening referred to this point , " said Nicholson , still farther receding from familiarity . There was a moment 's pause . Even White felt the awkwardness of his position , and fully shared Glendenning 's yearning to horsewhip such a conceited ass . " It is from a high and imperative sense of duty that I have deemed it proper to hear you , " said Nicholson . " What have you to urge ? " " I will first ask you to state explicitly , " said White , " why I am so unfortunate as to rest under the disapprobation of one whose good opinion it has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding officer of this regiment , sir , " said Nicholson , " it is , of course , my duty to watch over the honour of the individuals composing it . " " Certainly . " " You were the friend of Captain Glendenning in an affair with a Yankee officer , which , under your directions , was suffered to terminate in an equivocal manner ; at least , so it has been related to me , and the evidence which has come under my notice confirms the account . As you have taken the extraordinary measure of a personal interview with me , I presume , of course , you have testimony of a contrary nature . I need not say that , although the weak mind and light and trivial character of Captain Glendenning have not allowed him to be so fortunate as to obtain my respect , the father wrote me , and took the precaution to claim my forbearance in favour of his son . Having promised it , I shall extend it as far as his own conduct will allow . Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear your account of the matter . " " Why , the mere fact is , we were at the theatre together . Captain Glendenning had been supping , and had taken too much wine . On the bosom of a young lady who sat before us , a rose had become nearly displaced . Not knowing well what he did , he took it , and was , of course , engaged in a sort of row with the young lady 's companion . Blows were interchanged . They met at daybreak . Glendenning received a shot in his hat and discharged his in the air , which , you must allow , was a magnanimous sort of thing . He was , of course , reluctant to take the life of a noble young fellow whom he had originally and wantonly offended . I thought the matter had gone far enough , and so thought all the world . This is the simple story . " " All the world , sir , is a very comprehensive phrase . Will you have the goodness to touch the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant entered . " John ! " said Colonel Nicholson , " open the third drawer of my secretary on the right , and bring me the first packet of papers . " " The affair happily stopped where it did , " said White . " The two boys , for they are nothing more , became subsequently the best friends in the world . We spent a week or two in the country with them at the villa of Mr. Lennox on the Hudson , and I assure you , " continued he , turning to Mrs. Nicholson , " I could not but feel sincere gratification at seeing so fine a youth returned to so interesting a family . " " Oh , I am sure Colonel Nicholson will see , from this statement , that no reproach at all rests upon you , and none on your friend , except in having originated such a quarrel and proceeded too far in it . " " My love ! you know women always appear best when they confine themselves to their proper sphere . The name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is . " " And the young fellow is in the army ? " " A lieutenant just graduated from West Point . " " Captain Glendenning received a blow ? " " He was struck , I believe , in the scuffle . " " You saw the blow ? " " Given and returned . " " You are interested in Captain Glendenning , I believe ? " " Yes . His father also begged me to look to him , as he was , although he is now greatly improved , rather wild . He has recently entirely changed his character in this respect , and is likely to become a different sort of man altogether . The friendship between him and Lieutenant Lennox is really remarkable . They are , indeed , all extremely fond of him . " " It seems to me , Captain White , " said Nicholson , when the servant placed in his hands the packet he required , " that your friendship for Captain Glendenning has strangely blinded you in this matter . My view of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . You have brought a very disgraceful affair to a  --  I wish to spare you , sir  --  but I must say , an extraordinary and most premature termination . " " My opinion , sir  --  " said White , who now saw the dark , deliberate intention of his host . " Your opinion was one which I should not have expected from a gentleman and a soldier , unless he had been misled by private feeling . " " You are severe . " " I deem it a high duty to be so . Your explanation throws a still darker shade over an affair too dark before , and I can not regret that I have , in common with others , expressed my dissatisfaction in the most marked manner . " " I am extremely sorry , Colonel Nicholson , " said White , coldly and firmly , " that my opinions have not the good fortune to coincide with yours . But , really , I can not change them . " " Every man 's opinions are his own , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , inasmuch as they compromise the honour of those with whom he associates . A blow , Captain White , a public blow , given before thousands of people , is anywhere , under any circumstances , one of those insults which , if I have been properly educated , a gentleman , to say nothing of an officer , can not submit to . But , in this case  --  good God ! only think of it ! a British officer , in a foreign country , struck  --  struck in a theatre ! and by whom ? an officer in the American army ! " " The blow was returned . " " The American officer , sir , is the guardian of his own honour , and of his country 's . If he choose to bear the brand on his forehead , let him . Perhaps the low standard of honour which must reign in a mobocracy may find in it nothing derogatory ; but a British officer , if my humble and insignificant opinion can be supposed to have any weight , if my feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not take a blow . " " I must confess my inability to see my way out of the affair , then , " said White . " You are fortunate in an opinion which your superiors have not the happiness either to share or to admire , sir . " " What can I do ? the thing is already past and forgotten ! " " Past , not forgotten . What ! an officer in his majesty 's service walking about society with a blow on his forehead ! the offending party an American officer , boasting to all the world of his feat ? If your friend and you choose to swallow such an insult , you may , perhaps , have the right to do so , but the regiment to which you have the honour to belong , his majesty 's whole army , his majesty  --  I  --  I myself  --  are greatly insulted . The affair can not drop here . I shall institute a Court of Inquiry . " " You will reflect , " said White , his composure no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly heightening in his cheek , " that such a measure , or even the suggestion of it , must lead to another meeting between these two young men . They are very , very young . The matter originated in an unpardonable act of folly on the part of Glendenning ; committed , to be plain , while drunk , and met , as I must say , most properly , by a high spirited youth , who did exactly what I should have done on the occasion , or any other officer in his majesty 's service . The meeting was prompt , fair , and in earnest . Both parties are excellent shots , and their courage was tested beyond the faintest shadow of doubt . The world , the public press spoke loudly respecting it , and blame was universally and justly attached to Glendenning for the original offence , but none for his subsequent course , and the redeeming feature in the part he bore in it was his discharging his fire in the air , and arranging the matter frankly and magnanimously . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I am correctly informed , who has chosen to adopt a new , and , you will permit me to add , a most unnecessarily severe view of the circumstance . Notwithstanding the attachment now existing between the parties , your perseverance in the views you have been so obliging as to lay before me this morning , must create the necessity for another meeting . Such another meeting can only result in the death of one or both . Their families and friends will be plunged in grief , and they themselves ( bear in mind that they are friends ) will be reluctantly forced into a contest inevitably fatal , actually horrible . I have come , sir , respectfully , but earnestly to address your reason , and if I fail in convincing that , to appeal to your mercy . I stand here as the defender , the friend , the adviser of Glendenning , whose tokens of reform promise him hereafter a distinguished and honourable career . I place myself at your disposal . I throw myself upon your generosity . I am even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicit from your humanity , from your mercy , a reconsideration of the opinions you have expressed in the matter , and which have materially affected both his and my reputation . " An expression of mean , selfish triumph lighted the yellow face of Nicholson , but unsoftened by any gentle beam of mercy . " I have heard you through , patiently and attentively , sir , " replied he , coldly and grandly , " hoping to be able to find something in support of your opinions , and calculated to diminish the just odium which rests on your unfortunate friend . My consenting to receive you at all will , I presume , be sufficiently indicative to the world of my desire to yield to the impulses of my personal feelings ; but I find nothing in your representations to alter my impressions . Your appeal to my sensibility is painful , but the world , I trust , has known me as one superior to such influences ; and a high regard to my own character , and a proud consciousness that my station demands I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to disregard all private considerations . I pity your friend from the bottom of my soul . But affairs of this nature must be settled like gentlemen and public officers , not like school girls . The families of these persons are nothing to me . The parties should have considered the matter in that sentimental light before they brought themselves into their present position . The honour of the regiment I command is what I must look to ; and I presume my worst enemies will not deny that I am the proper guardian of it , and that it is not likely to suffer in my hands . There must be a Court of Inquiry . God forbid that I should advise such a second meeting as you have described ; but my own character requires that I should institute a Court of Inquiry . " " Good God ! sir , " said White , rising in disgust . " My dear , dear husband ! consider that life and death hang on your determination , " interrupted Mrs. Nicholson , her eyes full of tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued Nicholson , haughtily , " that I am the lieutenant-colonel of this regiment ; and it is not presumable I should have the honour to be so if not competent to form opinions and able to carry them into execution , and that without offensive remarks from officers under my command . " " Certainly , sir , " said White . " I have nothing more to say . I shall advise my friend accordingly . Only let me repeat  --  " " Repeat nothing  --  act , sir , " said Nicholson . " Poor  --  poor Captain Glendenning ! " said Mrs. Nicholson , weeping . " I will , sir  --  at your suggestion : good-morning . " " Stop , sir . Do not understand me to have made any suggestion . I will have none of the responsibility of your friend 's follies cast upon my shoulders . I suggest nothing but the necessity of a Court of Inquiry . Have the goodness to favour me with your company a little longer . " White stood with his tall form proudly and sternly drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed , though tranquil indignation . Nicholson , still seated , with the air of a sovereign giving audience to a subject , took up the package of papers the servant had brought , slowly untied the tape , drew forth a newspaper , and carefully unfolded it . It was the very one which the triumphant Mr. Lennox had read to the delighted family circle on the morning of the duel . Nicholson ran it over once himself , leaving White still standing . While in the act of doing so , his features , at the first sight handsome and noble , grew contracted and mean . His always colourless complexion assumed a paler hue . To White , at the moment , perhaps , not a very indulgent observer , he appeared absolutely ugly , and he wondered he could have ever thought a handsome man , one whose countenance was so expressive of cunning and malignity . The soul was at this moment painted there ; the workings of all his worst qualities were visible while he fairly gloated on anticipations of vengeance . Having finished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of White fixed full and sternly upon him , and for a moment he quailed , conscious that his hatred of Glendenning had been betrayed by his countenance to his keen and fearless observer . He felt the cold , undisguised displeasure , perhaps contempt , with which White regarded him , and the sense of inferiority , which he could not but be conscious of , notwithstanding his general pompous egotism , to one who , however far himself from being a good man , was destitute of any inhuman tendencies , and was peculiarly gifted with manly firmness and quiet , determined independence of opinion . He was thus suddenly checked and awed in the full career of his malicious triumph , and his manner visibly changed beneath the strong eye and guarded , but deeply-marked manner of the person he had so many times , in the course of the conversation , shown his wish to insult , and yet who evidently neither feared nor respected him . " God bless me ! you are standing all this while , my dear White , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting off his grandeur . " Pray be seated . There is n't the slightest doubt that you have acted perfectly like a gentleman , bating the unavoidable error of a too kind and amiable heart . Sit down . I beg your pardon for my warmth . I am most favourably inclined towards you . But do me the favour to hear me read this article . " White bowed stiffly and sat down . " It is the principal reason why I deem it proper to call a Court of Inquiry . You have appealed to my generosity ; I now appeal to yours . Hear this , and say what can I do ? It is an American newspaper , remember . And what is in one American newspaper , thanks to the licentious freedom of the press , both in the United States and England , is everywhere as common as the steps that mount the Capitol . ' Nay , more ; it is certain this article has already appeared in every English , French , German , and Russian journal . This insult to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over every sea and every land . It is read by every sovereign ; it is laughed at in every club and reading-room , discussed in every salon , and sneered at in every diplomatic circle of Europe . I fear your too benevolent heart has overlooked these obvious considerations , my dear White . Now listen . " Affair of Honour .  --  We stop the press to announce that a meeting took place this morning at daybreak between Lieutenant Francis Lennox , son of the distinguished lawyer of this city , and Captain Charles Glendenning , of his majesty 's  --  , at the duelling-ground , Hoboken . The dispute arose at the theatre , Captain Glendenning having offered a rudeness to a lady in the presence of Lieutenant Lennox , which the latter punished by a blow . The parties repaired almost instantly to the ground , and , after one fire , which , on the part of Captain Glendenning , was discharged in the air , the matter was terminated amicably by the mediation of the seconds . The most ample apologies were offered by Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , and with mutual protestations of friendship . Captain White , of the British army , acted as the friend of his countryman in this rather peculiar affair , and Mr. Sussex , of this city , for Lieutenant Lennox . Nothing could exceed the coolness and courage manifested on the occasion by both the gentlemen , and a ball , it is said , took effect in the hat of Captain Glendenning , who received the awkward indication of skill with immovable composure . " We must be permitted to remark , however , that , if we have heard the matter correctly represented , it has been reserved for our chivalric young townsman to teach to his opponent a valuable lesson , which , we trust , will not be wholly thrown away upon him , or upon the country to which he belongs . Impertinent English travellers may write slanderous books with impunity , but there are insults which can never fail to meet their just reward ! ' " Be good enough , Captain White , to remark that the last words are in italics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admiration . " " Oh , I have seen the article before , " said White , coldly . " But I should scarcely think of sacrificing the life of one , or perhaps two men , in consequence of a note of admiration . " " Of the life of your friends I know nothing , " said Nicholson , stung by this sarcasm . " Permit me to add , I care less . Their future course they are at liberty to choose . I shall not be denied , I presume , the right to select mine . It is my opinion that Captain Glendenning has disgraced himself and his regiment . How far the position in which he has placed himself is shared by his advisers , the world may judge . My personal feelings towards the unfortunate , weak-minded youth are of the kindest nature ; but I deem it proper to make higher and loftier principles the guide of my conduct . I have condescended to hear you somewhat more at length than I originally intended , or than my various avocations permitted without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion is unchanged ; I may add that I never change my opinions . I have heard your views ; you have heard mine . Other important duties call me . So , sir , I wish you good-morning . " " I regret , " said White , " that I should have trespassed so far upon your patience . " " As for your friend  --  oh , do nothing rashly , " said Mrs. Nicholson , in terror and grief . " My love ! " said Nicholson , with a fixed regard and an expressive wave of the hand , " your presence was requested to listen , not to advise ! " White made his salutations with composure and dignity , and left the presence , mortified , disgusted , and inwardly resolved to write Nicholson 's name down in his books as a man to be remembered . " If he cross my path , or I cross his again , " said he , " no matter where  --  no matter when  --  I 'll teach that man a lesson ! " CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? you look grave ! " said White , gayly , as he entered the room of Glendenning . " Do I ? That 's strange ; but the result of your embassy will enliven me . " " Ah ! if you are grave before , you 'll not be more cheerful after hearing it . " " Let us have it , however . " " Glendenning , you must arouse yourself and act like a man . If I feign gayety , it is to hide serious reflections . Keep cool . Sit down : I ca n't talk to any one walking backward and forward in that way . " " Go on , " said Glendenning , gloomily , folding his arms . " I have breakfasted with Colonel Nicholson . He 's going to call a Court of Inquiry for the investigation of our affair with Lennox . " " Well , let him ! " said Glendenning ; " I 'll stand it . " " It can not but be unfavourable to us . " " The I 'll resign my commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could , myself , " said White , " but he has too much of what the world would call right on his side to meet me , and I must not subject myself to another refusal . The story I told him , but he grew rather yellow than otherwise under it , and said it deepened the shade of the affair . It certainly deepened his . He 's an ass  --  but , egad , he 's got us in his power , and very coldly assured me the affair should not stop here . " " Should not ? " " Should not ! " " I see the man 's object , " said Glendenning . " He wishes to drive you to another meeting with Lennox  --  but he does not , of course , say so . He held over me , like a birch over a naughty schoolboy , his Court of Inquiry . ' The Court of Inquiry ' is his nominal object . He talked of nothing but a blow , ' and the disgrace of the regiment , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " But were I to meet Frank Lennox again , it could only be with the determination either to kill or be killed . " " Of course . " " But the man must suppose me insane  --  a ruffian  --  a dupe  --  a fool . " White was silent . " I had rather be broken on the wheel  --  rather die on the scaffold  --  rather feel the finger of every officer in the regiment pointed at me , and hear nothing but yells and hisses as I walk through the world , than hurt a hair of Frank Lennox 's head , or wound one heart in that family . I would blow my brains out first . " White was silent . " I will go to Nicholson myself . " " You shall not . " " I will write him this moment . " " No . Be cool  --  you are beside yourself . Trust all to me . " " I am not beside myself . I am cool , calm , and master of myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make his coward , malignant , shuffling heart quail in his breast . I can go to him as calm as  --  as  --  " " As you are to me , " said White , coldly , glancing at the ashy , compressed lips , the white cheeks , the eyes glistening with fury , and the drops of perspiration that stood upon his forehead . " No , Glendenning , no more speaking , no more interviews , no more humiliation ! You can not touch his heart or convince his reason . He cringes to his superiors , but repays himself by trampling on all beneath him . You he hates beyond my worst apprehensions . You have drawn it on yourself wilfully  --  recklessly . He is a curious  --  a remarkable character . He will never forget  --  never forgive . The luscious triumph now in his hands  --  oh , he would not forego it for his commission , which , in my opinion , he stands a fair chance of losing before we 've done with him . Do n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he has done me . " " I 'll take him by the throat on the parade ground . " " You will be cashiered . " " Then I will throw up my commission  --  leave the service and the country . " " Pardon me , Captain Glendenning , " said White , firmly and gravely ; " you will not do any such thing ; you must not  --  you shall not ! " " Shall not ? " " Shall not , because you can not as a man , an officer , a gentleman , a friend . " " And why not ? " " Because you will not adopt any measure contrary to the advice and demand of your friends , and which , in staining your own honour , must compromise theirs . " " The demand , Captain White ? " " The demand , Captain Glendenning . Be cool and hear me . Your character as a gentleman , and your whole prospects in life , depend upon your conduct now . Had you resigned your commission before learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different thing . This you did not do . Were you to do so now , it would be received as a proof of your desire to avoid another meeting with Lieutenant Lennox . " " You take upon yourself the character of an adviser , " said Glendenning ; " yet you advise nothing . " " I can advise nothing , " said White , " because there is no choice . You have but one thing to do . " " And that is to  --  " " Call out Lenox again instantly . " Glendenning fixed his eyes on him without saying anything . " You are in the lion 's den  --  in the lion 's jaws ! " continued White . " Stir , and you are gone . Let me rescue you from this dilemma . It is like performing a surgical operation ; it 's a horrid thing ; the patient shrinks under it . But it 's necessary . A moment 's pain , the leg is off ! and the patient is well and happy again . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never consent : never  --  never ! Perish my commission ! perish my name ! perish the name of regiment and my country ! perish this black world and all the friends that walk on it , rather than take one step in the bloody path you point to ! " " Well , well ! " said White , soothingly , as one would speak to an affrighted horse . " So ! so ! so ! so ! let it be for the present . There is no immediate hurry  --  to-morrow  --  the next day . I 'll see you again before long . In the mean time , when you 're cooller , think it over like a man . " He took his leave , really sorry for his friend , but determined to make all the necessary arrangements for a sudden departure , including those requisite for leave of absence . He sent the assistant surgeon of the regiment to see him , that he might give a certificate and put him on the sick list , as he really was not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had everything arranged , and waited only the moment , which he was pretty sure would speedily arrive , when Glendenning 's light and impressionable mind would change , and he might get him off at once ; for , whatever happened or might happen , Captain White was determined not to suffer any stain to rest on his own character as a gentleman , and that , if the duel were considered prematurely terminated , it should be repeated . To the cold-blooded selfishness of this determination he was entirely blind . Looking on duelling as a necessary and proper institution , he took it , of course , with all its consequences . " Poor fellow , " thought he ; " it comes hard . It is like having an old tooth out , but , once over , he wo n't mind it . " Thus bent in bringing about an encounter , which could scarcely fail to terminate in the death of one , if not two human beings , he put not a whit less zest in each petty enjoyment and studied luxury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader to imagine , we can not paint the desperation and agony which harrowed the feelings of Glendenning for the two or three days subsequent to this interview . A certificate from the surgeon , placing him on the sick list , at least enabled him to keep his room , and hide himself from every eye . He did not go out ; he saw no one . He scarcely slept at night . His appetite , his spirits , his buoyant energy and strength of mind deserted him . Even Southard absented himself from some unaccountable cause . His face had grown pale and haggard . He was like a man haunted with a horrible spectre . In the nights he had lain for hours stretched passively on his back , writhing beneath images of shame , scorn , and insult , and striving to form plans for his future life , what he should do , and where he should hide his dishonoured head . From the society of gentlemen he felt he was banished forever . Sleep and exhaustion would sometimes come together after these dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cold and contemptuous face , would flash upon him with " You ! meet you ? " The scene with Breckenbridge had made a vivid impression on his brain . There was something in it marked , striking , and dramatic . Himself , the lofty , the proud , the scarcely condescending , haughtily disentangling himself from an offensive , derogatory , too familiar intimacy , throned , as it were king-like , on his own character and the world 's opinion , and then , with a word , a look , hurled headlong down , a fallen angel , with the object of his fastidious dislike pointing at him with derision , spurning him with his foot , his derisive laugh , the laugh of the by-standers , magnified , in his disturbed imagination , into the hideous leers and yells of the whole world to pursue him forever and forever . From these insupportable dreams he would start up , gasping , shrieking , or striving to shriek , and , abandoning his bed , would pace the room , or read , or smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of Shakspeare , and he found in him power to divert his thoughts , but when he laid the volume down , the dark waters of wretchedness closed over him again . The third morning , he had started long before daybreak from his bed , and sat , gloomy and miserable , smoking a cigar , with a half-emptied bottle of wine on the table , and a volume of the " Three Spaniards " in his hand , when a low knock at the door startled him . He was surprised to find , by the effect it had on him , how shattered his nerves were . It was Southard , who gently opened the door . " What 's the matter , my dear fellow ? " said Glendenning . " I heard you up . I know you are distressed , and I determined to come to you . " " Sit down . " " You look ill . " " Yes , I am . This Nicholson affair is annoying me terribly . I can not make up my mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not in a mood to deny it . Your position demands all your presence of mind . But if you have read the Book of Life aright , you will seek His approbation , and His alone . " " I hope I shall , " said Glendenning , " though it is easier to advise than to act . " " In advising submission to His will , " said Southard , who , Glendenning now , for the first time , perceived , was unusually agitated , " I advise only what I am called upon to set an example in . " " What do you mean ? " " My little Catharine . " " What 's the matter with her ? " " You know she 's been ill several days . " " I remember I heard something of it ; she 's not worse , I hope ? " " She 's dead " said Southard . " Dead ! " " She died last evening at nine . " " Almighty Heaven ! " cried Glendenning . " She yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " repeated Southard . " My poor friend ! " Southard threw himself into his arms , and wept for a few moments on his bosom in uncontrolled agony . " I did not come to thrust my weakness on you , but to speak to you of yourself . You are more unhappy than I or her mother . You are debating with yourself a second meeting with Lieutenant Lennox . If you were a Christian , you would know how to act . But you are not . Julia and I both fear your facility of character , and the influence of the world and of White . You may fancy her feelings over the yet warm body of her child . But even now she has requested me to bring you this volume . It is a Bible , with passages marked for you . On the table , where lies our little Catharine , she has written your name in it , and begs you to read it , and make it the guide of your conduct in this painful affair . Her religion teaches her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own distress she feels a sincere anxiety for you . " " Dear Southard , " said Glendenning , much touched , " my heart bleeds for you and her . How can I ever be sufficiently grateful for such true , such noble friendship ? " " By giving your serious attention to the advice of my poor Julia . Since the last evening you were with us , notwithstanding the illness of our little one , she has frequently thought of you , and of the danger you are in of fancying yourself obliged to rush upon self-murder , or the butchery of a friend , in compliance with the ideas of a portion of society . Be a man  --  be more  --  be a Christian . Dare to act right . No one doubts your courage to meet personal danger . Show yourself , also , morally brave . Break away , at once and forever , from the damning net they are throwing around you . Do your duty ; leave the rest to Him . He knows  --  He watches you . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " I wish I had your undoubting faith , " said Glendenning . " Pray for it , and He will help your evil spirit of unbelief . Seek here , in this book , light for your guidance . We have tried it . We have found it sufficient to soothe us , even in this sad extremity . What calamity can be more insupportable than the loss of our little Catharine ? You can not know the happiness she has been to us ; the dreams we have woven of her future character and mind , and our own delight in beholding her grow up from a child to woman , in preparing an humble independence for her , in becoming old and decrepit with her to aid me , to smooth my white hair , support my tottering steps , and scatter the path to the grave with the flowers of filial love . Now all this is over ; all this bright , universal sunshine is quenched . The earth is dark to me , and life has lost its charm , and yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation  --  nay , more , peace and happiness . Take it , my friend ; try it  --  read it ; do n't reject it without examination . " " My dear Southard ! " said Glendenning , " you are unconsciously using the words of a beloved friend . I really feel to my very heart the strength and disinterestedness of your friendship . " " Come down , then , with me , and see my poor wife . Tell her you will resist all endeavours to make you meet Lieutenant Lennox ; tell her you will seek advice , not of White , or Colonel Nicholson , or of the world , but here , in the volume she has given you , and I assure you , in this way you will greatly alleviate her grief . Come ! she asked me to bring you down . " Southard led the way , and Glendenning followed him down stairs into the very room where , a few evenings before , he had seen the little Catharine in perfect health , and been struck with her remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the broken nine-pins , the noseless dog , and tin carriage , had been carefully placed by the fond mother upon a stand . The little body lay on a table . Mrs. Southard sat by its side , pale almost as the being she mourned , but perfectly composed . " See ! " said she , with a smile that made Glendenning 's heart ache , " my poor little Kate ! God has taken her . Oh , never more shall I hear that beloved voice , that light , quick step ! never behold the long , golden hair waving on her forehead as she runs , or see the light dancing in those deep blue eyes . God has taken her where she is happy . He will not let her forget her mother . I shall meet her again , and He will teach me to be patient . " " My dearest Mrs. Southard ! " said Glendenning . But at the sound of his voice , both she and her husband covered their faces , and wept in silence such tears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies of their children . And tears , also , came freely into Glendenning 's eyes , partly for them , partly for himself , partly from the heavy , crushing sense of the mockery of life , to all but the high , philosophical , aspiring Christian . " Now ! " said Southard , with a bright smile , " these are things man was born to meet . Whom he loveth he chasteneth . Has he not said , suffer little children to come unto me , for of such is the kingdom of heaven ? Look at her , Glendenning . " The young man , awe-struck , approached , and gazed on the angel face and form of his little radiant friend . The mother stood on one side of him , the father on the other , and as they gazed they murmured , " Thy will be done . " " Amen ! " cried Glendenning , so fervently that Southard felt his friend was again and really touched with a beam of faith . Kneeling down with his wife , a short prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his profound grief strangely eloquent . Yet there was in it less of grief than of hope , joy , and calm , spiritual triumph , a peace above the world , and the fervour of a spirit blessed . He bade adieu to the soul of his infant , which he seemed to see floating up to heaven . He poured forth his grateful thanks for the resignation and strength which , in this trying moment , had been vouchsafed , and prayed it might be continued when mother and father should kiss , for the last time , the cold , unanswering lips , whose music was stilled , and the icy forehead , from whose sweet tenement the habitant had fled . Then , with a sudden allusion to Glendenning , he prayed that the scene might not be lost upon the young and wavering heart which was called upon now , also , to meet its trials . He implored that this wavering soul might be led to see , might not grope at noonday , but seek and find strength and light from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redeemer , and give up things temporal for things eternal . Glendenning , also , knelt for the first time in his life , and each word of his friend 's invocation went through his heart like a ray of celestial light . He not only knelt ; he prayed , and , strange enchantment ! ( for thus it seemed to him ) , he did feel , as he raised his soul to God , new light to judge , new courage to act . " You will no longer waver , dear Captain Glendenning ? " said Mrs. Southard . " My resolution is taken , " said Glendenning . " Do n't fear for me . I here make a vow to bear any evil rather than commit the crime they are trying to drive me to . This pure angel may bear my oath to the throne of Heaven , and if , from weakness or passion , I yield my sense of right , may all the curse of vice fall on my head ! " He once more approached to look on the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An almost unearthly beauty rested on the face  --  a smile , a light , as if it knew and rejoiced in the holy mission he had confided to it . The mother clasped her hands silently , and , as Glendenning withdrew , he heard a sob and a convulsive kiss , and then all again was still . CHAPTER V. Section It was yet night when he regained his room . He sat down , however , unable to sleep , by his solitary lamp , and opened the volume Mrs. Southard had given to him . Several leaves were turned down , and various passages were marked with a pencil . The example  --  the contagious piety of his friends  --  their grief , and their resignation under it  --  the sight of his little favourite , dead , had completely touched his heart , weakened the grasp on him of mere worldly feelings , and made him conscious , for the moment , of the vanity and evanescence of life . The silence was profound and unearthly , unbroken even by the barking of the distant dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any token of human beings , or of the city that lay wrapped as in death around ; only ever and anon the sound of some warping panel , or , perhaps , a wall settling more heavily into its foundation  --  into its decay . The shadows of the furniture were thrown grotesquely on the floor and ceiling , wearing a strange , impressive aspect  --  unearthly almost , as if unreal beings were looking from them . There was something startling and preternatural in it . He looked from the window . The broken moon was palely emerging from a pile of silver clouds , gathered in motionless fragments about her . Her ragged edge looked strangely near and worldlike , and on its disk he thought he could distinctly trace deserts , vales , and mountains . For the first time , he felt the sight sink into his soul as a stupendous wonder  --  a present , visible miracle  --  for years before his eyes , unseen , uncomprehended . " Like this thrilling story , " he murmured , as he sat down and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John , and he read it through . The emotion of a lover perusing a letter from his mistress was far less keen than that awakened in him by the holy page , now that , for the first time , the scales had fallen from his eyes , and he conceived it as it was . His understanding was no more darkened . He had eyes , and he saw ; he had ears , and he heard . In that sacred hour , whatever was prejudiced , scornful , selfish , or unbelieving in his nature disappeared , and the found himself as if ministered unto by angels . It is at such moments , when all other books cease to possess any power or attraction , that the Sacred Volume manifests its inspired nature by performing its promises even here on the earth , filling the soul with divine light , speaking to it with spiritual voices , raising it above the shock , delirium , and blinding smoke of mortal passions and interests , and bestowing a foretaste of that calm bliss which it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any two-edged sword , " and the young convert felt its piercing influence . He read that part of the wonderful story here related by the favourite apostle and friend . The betrayal by Judas , the falling of the officers to the ground , the smiting of Malchus 's ear , the taking of Jesus , Peter 's denial , the arraignment of the Son of man before the cold , worldly Roman , and the cry of the Jews ( groping at noonday ) for " Barabbas ! Barabbas ! " He read on to the end of the book . It was the first time in his life he had read the chapters consecutively . He had heard parts from the pulpit as a dull lesson  --  associated only with weariness , restraint , long faces , and hypocrisy . The eloquence , the deep meaning , the tender , immortal beauty of the simple narration , startled and overwhelmed him . He felt himself in the presence of the Holy Spirit of God . He thrilled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued , his proud man 's heart was melted . The image of Mrs. Lennox and Frank rose before him , and , kneeling , he raised his hands to Heaven , about to offer up a prayer to the throne of Mercy , for the light which had been shed upon him to guide his steps , and hold his rash arm from the damning deed he had so nearly perpetrated , when  --  the door burst open , and White entered abruptly . He had not time to rise . He was caught on his knees . A man , a gentleman , an officer  --  on his knees ! And now he stands in the crisis of his fate . If he have moral courage to acknowledge his change of opinion , he need care little for White or the world . If he blush to confess that he has discovered his weakness as a mortal , without the sustaining hand of his Creator , he will be hurled once more adrift upon the dark waters of life , to float where the storms and waves of chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Glendenning , " said White , folding his arms in an attitude of calm , incredulous , ludicrous astonishment , " you do n't mean to say you 're praying ? " " And if I were , Captain White ? " " And the volume before you is  --  ' " The Bible . " White pressed his lips closely together , and walked two or three times backward and forward through the room , turning his face carefully away , so that Glendenning could not catch a glimpse of it . " Well ! this , " said he , at length , " I confess I did not expect . What in the name of the devil 's got into you now ? Are you going to turn priest or monk ? " " Captain White , " said Glendenning , " spare me your ridicule , while I give you the reply briefly which , I presume , you have come to seek . I did not know how late it was , or you should have found me more prepared to receive you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea  --  it 's perfectly inconceivable . " " Spare me , and hear , once for all , my irrevocable decision respecting the Nicholson affair : I am going to pass it over , to treat it with silent contempt . I forgive Nicholson , though I despise him . Meeting Lennox is an act so diabolical that I shall not think of it , be the consequences what they may . I shall sell out of the army or resign . I am older and wiser than I was last year . If my friends cut me , let them . " During this harangue , which was uttered rapidly , White stood , with folded arms , gazing steadily at the speaker , as if curious to hear all he had to say , and resolved not to interrupt him till he had done . " Well ! upon my word , " said he , at length ; " do you know , my dear Glendenning , you 're a  --  ha ! ha ! ha !  --  you 're a devilish odd fellow ! Just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallop ! Your hand is burning . Your pulse goes like a horse run away . I tell you what , you 're ill . " " I know I am . " " I could have sworn it . Your mind has disordered your body , which , in return , has disturbed your mind . This is the secret of your extraordinary ideas on the Nicholson affair . " " Extraordinary they may be , " said Glendenning , " but they are unchangeable . " " I 'm sorry to hear it , " said White , " and reluctant to believe it . " " I see no cause for sorrow . " " I do . " " You are different ; you are a man of the world . " " And what are you ? " " I am  --  I am beginning to be  --  you need not smile nor lift your eyebrow  --  why should I deny it ?  --  a Christian  --  a believer in Christianity . If I believe in it , I shall act up to my belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad as a March hare , " said White . " But you do n't mean to abandon the position , and lay aside the character of a gentleman , I hope ? " " I do n't know what exact meaning you and others may attach to the word gentleman , but the name shall never make me act contrary to my sense of right . " " Why , Glendenning , I do n't know you , " said White . " Are you the same clear-headed , sensible fellow that was wont to keep the table in a roar ? ' Are you really going to turn into a canting , whining , weak-minded dreamer ? Well , I am nonplused . You of all persons . Knock a man into a crockery shop , kick up a row in the theatre that rings through the whole world ( if Nicholson speaks truth ) , and then go home and talk of your sense of right , ' read the Bible , and make it your code of honour . " " If it is true , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true . Hand it to me . " He took it up , opened it , and read over the heads of several of the chapters . " Moses ' rod is turned into a serpent . The sorcerers do the like . The river is turned into blood , and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments . ' My dear fellow , is this your religion ? The wise men of the East are directed to Christ by a star . Stilleth the tempest on the sea ! Driveth the devils out of two men possessed , and suffereth them to go into the swine . Feedeth five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes . Walketh on the sea , ' and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth ! As a man of sense , now , my dear fellow , I put it to you  --  " He paused , and his listener blushed . " It 's all very well , my good friend , for women and children  --  and weak-minded people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped or duped along the way of right by fears of a hell and hopes of a heaven , but  --  men  --  of education  --  gentlemen  --  and soldiers  --  I put it to you  --  is this credible ? Will you  --  can you  --  seriously and permanently give in to this nonsense ? " Glendenning was silent , chilled , ashamed . " Why , if it is true , did not Pilate believe it ? He was there . Egad ! he could have seen  --  a Roman gentleman , on the spot . Why did n't the Jews believe it ? or , if they did , why did they crucify him ? Did you never read Gibbon ? I tell you what , you 're ill and nervous . Religious melancholy is one of the most obstinate of maladies , and as much a physical disease as the gout . Take care what you do . Do n't let this get abroad , or you 'll be a by-word before you know it . What would Nicholson say ? One of his charges against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious old book out of the window  --  take a dose of salts , and let me tell you , religious responsibilities or not , all earth  --  all heaven , ca n't keep you from calling out Lennox . " " Never ! " said Glendenning , rather faintly . " You must  --  you shall . Hear what I 've heard this moment , and what brought me to you so early . Breckenbridge is going down to New-York to-morrow to challenge Lennox on behalf of the regiment , to vindicate its honour and damn yours forever . This I can not permit . If you do n't anticipate him , I must . So the matter , in fact , lies between you and me . Should I kill him , of course , Captain Glendenning , the acquaintance between you and me is at an end forever . Should I fall  --  " Glendenning turned deadly pale , rose , took the Bible from the table , and , with a mingled impulse of horror and despair , threw it as far as he could out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and come hell and all hell 's fiends , and light me on my path ! Will you go down with me to New-York ? " " Certainly . " " See to everything , then : what you do , do at once . " " Spoken like yourself , " said White . " It 's awkward , but we have nothing to do with causes or consequences . Do n't look to the right or left , but strait before you . " " Go  --  go , and get all ready . " " We are agreed , then ? Do n't think ! no wavering ! we start to-day . " " You have my word of honour . " " A la bonne heure ! " Glendenning bent his forehead down upon the table as his friend left him , and remained in the same attitude an hour , with the coldness of death creeping more and more into his heart as he strove to look steadfastly forward into the dark and bloody path before him . " Not think , " muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me rather steep myself in burning thoughts ; let me rather feel in advance all the fangs of hell fastened , festering in my soul . " " A letter , sir , " said the maid , coming in with his breakfast . He tore it open . It was from Mrs. Lennox . Letter - New-York August 1st , 18  --  . " My dear Captain Glendenning : " Your last , most gratifying favour reached us in due course of mail . Need I say how the spirit which inspired it delighted me , and how much we are all charmed with the friendship which has risen from such a strange cause ? We have left Rose Hill at last . Harry has gone to Europe , and Mr. Lennox 's business requires his presence in New-York . We all thought and talked of you yesterday , and drank health and happiness to you , at Mr. Lennox 's suggestion , in Champagne . I added water to mine , but it did not diminish the ardour of my wishes for your continued prosperity , or of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end the noble path of reformation you have adopted . You will have long since learned that all the reasonings and inferences which seem to militate against the truth of religion are erroneous , and , though they may tend to excite doubts , are not sufficient to create unbelief . " Frank expects every day to be ordered to his post at Prairie du Chien , whence , he says , he means to keep up a brisk correspondence with you . My daughter is well , and begs to be remembered . Your favourite saddle-horse , Fancy , ' ran away the other day with Frank , and threw him into a ditch , but without any serious consequences , which has furnished Mary a new means of tormenting him , by comparing his riding with yours . The Eltons are well , and often speak of you . Frank 's departure affects me strangely . But all my gay family laugh at me and my foolish mother 's heart . We hope to see you one day again ; perhaps in England . How deeply happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble instrument of aiding in the change in your opinions . There is no security or happiness in the world like that of having every doubt of Christianity removed . You are brought out of the land of Egypt .

But you must cling to it , for the bad world will be always striving to wrest it from you . The Lord will prove Israel ! ' When once you have examined , you will never surrender it . Search the Scriptures : ' prove all things , and hold fast that which is good .

" I can fall : I can sacrifice myself . Nothing shall tempt me to fire at Frank Lennox . My doom is sealed . " CHAPTER VI . Section " Is Captain White here ? " said Frank Lennox to the barkeeper of the City Hotel . " There he is , sir . " " My dear White ! " " Good-day to you , " said White , gravely laying down the newspaper he had been reading , not accepting the proffered hand , and not taking the cigar from his mouth . " But  --  I 'm delighted to see you  --  and  --  " " A word with you ! " " What 's the matter ? " " Waiter ! the room is ready ? " " Yes , sir ! " " Lead the way ! " They followed in an awkward silence , which greatly perplexed Frank . " You need not wait , " said White to the waiter . " Yes , sir ! " When they were alone , Captain White walked forward , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all this , Captain White ? " " Captain Glendenning  --  " " Has anything happened to him ? " " Yes . " " What is it ? " " I have accompanied him from Montreal . " " Glendenning in town ? " " In this hotel  --  in the adjoining room ! " " He is ill  --  he is dying , " said Frank , hastening to the door . " Pardon me . I have a painful commission . Let me proceed to it at once . In short , Captain Glendenning is not satisfied with the termination of the late affair with you . His friends think it prematurely settled . He has returned to repeat the meeting . " " You are jesting , Captain White . " " I never jest , sir ; I am directed to hand you this note . " He went on smoking gravely and quietly , while Frank read : Letter - City Hotel August , 18  --  . " Sir ! " Circumstances not necessary to be explained render me apprehensive that the affair which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly arranged . The meeting must be renewed . When acquainted with my opinion , I feel certain you will require no other inducement to afford me the satisfaction I have not yet received , and to name a friend who will immediately make the necessary arrangements . " Yours , etc. , Charles Glendenning . " Section The blood flowed from the cheeks and lips of Frank as he read this note . " The meeting must be renewed ? " repeated he ; " why , that can mean only one thing . " White was silent . " I must see Glendenning ! " " Impossible . " " But it is infatuation . Twenty words would  --  " " We have come here , sir , not to talk , but to act , " said White , coldly . " Lieutenant Lennox need not be twice told that the meeting is unavoidable , and must be immediate . " Frank collected his stunned and scattered senses . " I 'm sorry , " said White , " but  --  " " Oh , sir , sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an hour . Good-day . " " A la bonne heure , " said White . He rang as soon as he was alone . " Waiter ! wine , cigars , and the newspaper I was reading . " Frank left the steps of the City Hotel as one in a dream . An unavoidable , immediate , and fatal meeting ! His mother  --  his father  --  Miss Elton . From the friend he loved , too  --  and White 's cold , insulting manner , and the greatness of his danger , which seemed to render the death of one , at least , certain . What to do ? whither to turn ? whom to choose for a friend ? While lost in these reflections the clock struck six . He had promised to send a friend in an hour . He ran over in his mind all the persons of his acquaintance who lived near enough to allow him to call on them ; but when he came to select from among them one proper for such a duty , he found it difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every one in this emergency , for he felt that , shocked , stunned as he was , he wanted not only assistance , but advice . He looked up , and perceived he was passing a fashionable boarding-house , which Mr. Earnest honoured by making it his residence . Urged by the necessity of the moment , he was about to call upon him , but he recoiled from the flimsy , conceited character of this person , and , remembering their conversation at the theatre , he passed the door . As he did so , he met a Mr. Bayard , who politely saluted him . He was an old acquaintance , but he had in him nothing to command respect , far less confidence and attachment . He was a fop , devoting himself to dress  --  a mere ladies ' man  --  and as they passed each other a waft of perfume filled the air . He strolled down the Battery to think farther . At the gate stood a Mr. Carr ; he was a gentleman , but a man of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who mingled with the sober duties of a merchant ideas of European luxury and sensuality ; for he had travelled and seen the aristocratic society of England , with a desire to imitate its costly peculiarities as far as his means and the usages of his native city would permit . He would , doubtless , have gladly accepted the office of second in this affair , but it would only have been in order to carry it through as a mode of brilliant notoriety for himself . He had no heart , no high moral sense . They bowed and passed each other . Sussex lived a mile distant . Besides , he could not forget ( what he had never yet mentioned ) that , in his last meeting with Glendenning , Sussex had leaned towards the necessity of a second fire . He was a duellist , as some one had remarked of him , " dyed in the wool . " " How are you ? " said a well-known voice . It was a Mr. Woodbury , a man of the highest worth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity , large and correct views of life . But he was married , and had several children . Had he asked him , he would have been sure of wise counsel , and , if necessary , he thought , prompt aid ; but his nobleness of nature would not permit him to bring into a desperate duel , clearly predestined to a fatal termination one way or the other , a husband and a father . Brigham , the painter , lived just round the corner . He was the very man . He instantly sought his house , rang , and was admitted . The servant showed him into the artist 's painting room , but no one was there . " I will call him immediately , " said the man . Left alone , Frank cast his eyes around upon the various productions , finished and unfinished , with which the apartment was crowded . Among others , what was his astonishment to behold on the easel , and so far advanced as to be most striking in its beauty and the resemblance of the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company assembled at dinner as they had been on Glendenning 's first visit . There were his father and his mother , Mary , Harry , and himself , living , actually living before him . There were Mrs. Elton and Mr. Elton , Emmerson , Glendenning , and poor little Seth . " Admirable ! admirable ! " he murmured . There was brought prominently and exquisitely out , Fanny Elton , her lovely self , and all the rest who had formed a part of the company . Mr. Henderson 's dry , hard face , was strangely real , and the envious , repelling countenance of Mrs. Henderson , with an expression just as if she were in the act of tearing to pieces the reputation of some dear , absent friend , " who had always been excessively kind to her , " but whose " odd peculiarities " she pointed out with compassionate , benevolent regret . The tears gushed into his eyes . He could not but reflect on the probability that he might never , in reality , behold one of those beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the irrevocable past , and , overmastered by a singular emotion , he covered his face with his hands , and felt the blood almost freezing in his veins . And they were impatiently waiting for him this moment at home . And White was waiting at the City Hotel . And he had yet done nothing , and time was flying . The servant again entered . " Mr. Brigham has gone out ; but he will doubtless return presently . Will Lieutenant Lennox be good enough to wait ? " " Oh , no , no matter ; I will call to-morrow . " To-morrow ! He hurried on . His thoughts now began to return to him , and to become more under his control . He looked steadily at his situation . Called abruptly to an instantaneous meeting , which , from the remarkable circumstances , was deliberately and mercilessly intended to end in death , the equal chance was that he was on the point of being shot . He had but a few more hours to live . He hastened along , again bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oranges , sir ? " said a man . " Come along , my dear ! " said a mother to a little girl ; " it is getting late , and you will be ill to-morrow if you take cold . " " To-morrow ! " again . " Will you be good enough , sir , to tell me the hour ? " said a boy . " Half past six , " said Frank . " How are you , Lennox ? " " How are you ? " " Charming weather ! " " Delightful . " " You are going off , then ? " " Yes  --  to-morrow ! " " Success to you . Good-by , and God bless you ! " " Stop ! " said Frank ; " I want to speak to you . " " I beg your pardon , but I have an appointment , and I am ten minutes too late . It 's with a lady . " " Oh ! " said Frank , " a lady ! do n't let me detain you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce knew why , hastened on to the Battery . And he now found himself in that delightful promenade , a sky all radiant with the glory of a golden sunset bending over him ; the heavy verdure of the trees and grass around , full of fragrance and freshness ; the birds singing as if gratefully enjoying the delicious coolness of the hour , and the limpid floods , which stretch so magnificently around the town , sleeping in lucid and waveless splendour , all painted with the reflected hues of the glowing heavens . Several sloops lay off here and there , becalmed , their snowy sails hanging useless against the mast . Various vessels of a larger description were at anchor , all bright in the peaceful flush of golden fire  --  all steeped in the spirit of deep repose . Among them , and not far from the shore , was a magnificent ship-of-war getting ready to weigh anchor , from whose decks came faintly and musically the voices of the seamen as they cheered their labour with a sailor 's song . The star of evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern point of the Battery , a superb barge , filled with young men , the members of a boat-club , with all of whom Frank knew he must be acquainted , floated onward , rowed with a slow and equal stroke , the chorus of a well-known song floating , softened by the distance , and keeping time to the regular plash of the oars . The sun  --  his huge orb of unquenchable fire , now almost supportable to the eye  --  red and magnified , lay on the edge of the horizon , as if to enable him to gaze on it for the last time , then slowly , majestically , solemnly sinking behind the dark , blue shore , disappeared . A thrilling ense of life sunk into his soul , and he felt that he was not called upon to plunge into a bloody grave , and thus to break the hearts of his family and friends . " I will decline this meeting , " said he , " firmly , calmly decline it . " And as he came to this conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My character for courage I have already established . I will have the magnanimity to refuse this challenge . Perhaps Glendenning in his heart will thank me for doing so . Perhaps some heartless villain , with whom he has quarrelled , has stung him to this by some insolent remark . In a desperate moment , urged by brutal advisers , he has adopted this course , from which he can not now retract . I am not stung . I will refuse . I will go back to the hotel , and demand to see him . " He turned and retraced his steps towards the hotel . Suddenly he felt a hand upon his shoulder . It was Emmerson , who , in his usual silent and stealthy manner , had approached him before he knew he was near . " What are you doing here , my dear Frank ? " said he , affectionately . " I have watched you for several minutes . You have looked at your watch four times . " " Did I ? I really was not aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes  --  that is  --  I hope so . " " Is it not certain ? your father told me  --  that  --  " " Yes  --  he thinks  --  I presume  --  where are you going ? " And he looked again at the watch . " I am going to the theatre . " " Shall you see my father ? " " Why , no . You are to spend the evening with him  --  are you not ? " " Yes  --  no . The fact is , something has occurred . Should you see my father  --  " He stopped in inexpressible agitation . " But what is the matter ? You do n't seem to know what you are going to do . " During this colloquy Frank was , in fact , paying little attention to what he was saying . He was running over in his mind the propriety of disclosing his situation to Emmerson . But that keen gentleman had already surmised , by his hesitation and emotion , his contradictory answers , and his looking so frequently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost any other man would have , under such circumstances , endeavoured to ascertain the cause of his distress , and striven to prevent any catastrophe . To do him justice , that was Emmerson 's first natural impulse ; but it was checked by various characteristic considerations . He was himself alarmed . He opposed himself habitually to all impulses of nature , distrusted everything and everybody , thought twice before he acted once , and had a dislike to trouble , odium , or meddling in the business of others without a motive of self-interest . " After all , " he thought , " it is his affair . " And the prudent friend , therefore , pretended not to remark farther anything extraordinary in Frank 's demeanour , and took his leave abruptly . As he receded from Frank , who , irresolute , suffered him to depart without farther resistance , he looked back . " He 's certainly in some new scrape , " said Emmerson to himself . " That a child may see . Poor fellow ! It may be a duel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he 's too far . I could overtake him . But , after all , why should I put myself to trouble for him or any one else ? I do n't wish to mingle myself with such matters . Besides , I 've to see Green about that new purchase at seven  --  and it only wants ten minutes . He did not ask my advice ! He 's old enough to take care of himself It 's his affair ! Every man for himself in this world ! " And so he turned his steps , not towards the theatre , where he had no idea of going , but to Mr. Green 's , to consult on a promising speculation . Frank had nearly reached the City Hotel , when he met his very man  --  Colonel Randolph . " I 'm delighted to see you ! " cried Frank . " You 're not engaged this evening ? " " Not in the least , nor to-morrow  --  nor the next day after , if I can be of the least service to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm in that of his friend , and , in hasty words , he related his present position . " The devil ! " was Colonel Randolph 's only remark , when he had heard the narration to an end . " Now I 'll tell you at once what my views are , " said Frank ; " but , of course , I put myself unconditionally in your hands . I propose to decline this invitation . I love Glendenning . I have no sympathy , or passion , or interest here , except on the side of reconciliation . I fear nothing for my reputation . If any one attacks it with a whisper , I am here , and ready to make him answer even a look . But a meeting with Glendenning , so cold-blooded , so deadly , so causeless , so absurd : I confess I recoil from it with horror and disgust . You are an officer , known in such affairs . Your advice will always protect me from a shadow of blame . " " Lennox , I must think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank 's bright , warm heart grew black and cold at the tone of his voice . They walked on in silence . " Lennox , " resumed Randolph , after two or three minutes ' reflection , " there is no doubt of it . You must meet this fellow . " " I 'm in your hands , " said Frank , in a low , but firm voice . " There can be no question of it . It 's a peculiar and most unrefusable challenge , and , do n't you see ? it 's obviously getting to be invested with the character of a national affair . He 's been back to Montreal , and the feeling there among his brother officers has obliged him to return and renew the thing , The honour of the American army is in your hands . It 's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard in my life . Accept it . " " If you think so ? " " Certainly ! and that at once . Read this communication over again . Why , here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When a man threatens  --  by G  --  d ! there 's an end of it . Where are these gentlemen ? " " Here , in the hotel . " The clock struck seven . " Go in , then , " said Frank ; " I 'm in your hands . " " And I 'll tell you what  --  can you handle a rifle ? " " Can I ? " said Frank . " William Tell was n't more used to his bow and arrow . I never miss . " " So ! meet him ? good God ! that you shall , and kill him too . What ! are we to be browbeaten in this way by an insolent English officer ? why , we should be the laughingstock of both countries . We 'll not only meet him , but in such a way as to show him and those who send him what stuff the Yankees are made of . Meet him ! meet him with rifles at the earliest moment  --  to-morrow morning . This is no child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they shall have one ! Step down on the Battery ; I 'll be after you in a quarter of an hour . " And they parted . Stunned by the suddenness and seriousness of all this , Frank continued his walk towards the appointed place . Strange , oppressive thoughts flew through his mind  --  loved images , sweet voices , bright things  --  but he could not well pursue any regular train of reflection . He could not yet quite realize it ; he seemed lost in a terrible , ghastly dream . One determination , however , possessed his mind . " Whatever happen to me , I will not , in this way , murder my friend . I will die . I am gone . Oh God , forgive and receive me ! Oh nature , light , life , farewell ! " He was aroused by a touch on the shoulder . " All right , " said Colonel Randolph , in a gay , business-like voice . " To-morrow at daybreak , at Hoboken ; but since we 've chosen rifles , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the parties to fire together , at a given signal . " " Good ! " said Frank . " I really thank you very much . " " Pooh , pooh ! it 's nothing . We cross at half past three in separate boats ; I am to bring a surgeon . What are you to do with yourself in the mean time ? " " Why , really , " said Frank , " I scarcely know . Had n't I better write some letters , and  --  " " Pooh ! no ; leave all that . Do n't go at anything to make you brood or think . These things must be gone through with at a dash . Do nothing to soften your heart with unmanly impressions ; it 'll make your hand unsteady , when you require the most perfect coolness . " " Oh , as to that , " said Frank , " it is an unimportant consideration , for I 'm determined not to fire at my friend . " " The devil you are ! Then where 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill a man I love ? He is obviously forced into this . He knows nothing of the rifle ; I once heard him say so . If I fire at him , he dies , just as sure as fate . I could never forgive myself for his blood ; I had rather be shot myself . " " Why , if you do n't kill him , he 'll kill you , for let me tell you they are in earnest . Let us suppose a case : you fire one round ; he finds you have wasted your shot ; he ca n't then very well proceed . Wo n't he , wo n't his friends , wo n't his whole regiment say you showed the white feather and backed out ? Why , you might as well refuse to meet him at all , as meet him in this way . " " Then you advise me to take his life if I can ? " " Most indubitably  --  most unquestionably . It is not only your right , but your duty . Any other course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties to society , duties to the profession to which you belong , duties to yourself , to me , and to your country . You have no right to throw away your life . Consider your family . Indeed , I am responsible for it . Good God ! self-defence is the instinct of the meanest brute . Shall it be denied to a gentleman and an officer ? " " But blood ! " said Frank , as a feeling of sickness came over him . " Murder , and of my friend ! I know so well he is unacquainted with the use of the rifle  --  I am such a perfect master of it  --  to slaughter in this way a human being whom really I love , I confess  --  " " Fiddlesticks ! " said Colonel Randolph ; " you 're young , that 's all . When you shall have been a few more years in the world  --  ha ! ha ! ha !  --  you 'll learn to view things differently . I 'm devilish glad , though , you 're such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor dupe ! to come so far to bully an American officer , and then to be met in this way  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! It 's capital . " " It is a piece of bullying , and a most cold-hearted one , " said Frank , catching by degrees the tone of his companion , " and I do n't know why I should hesitate . " " Certainly ; and if you are going to be such a Don Quixote as to throw your life into the hands which are so fiercely and resolutely grasping at it , why , really , I must decline going any farther in the business . Hesitate ? why it 's ridiculous ! it 's imbecile ! Did n't the fellow insult you first ? Was n't it one of the most gratuitous insults ever offered to a gentleman and a soldier ? A rose from the bosom of a young girl under your protection ! and then , when you magnanimously forgave him  --  when you received him into your family  --  into your friendship  --  after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person you are , and what misery your death would cause your parents and friends , to come back here , on some d  --  d , cold-blooded , insolent caprice ( he 's a dead shot himself , remember  --  with the pistol ) , to call you out with the undisguised determination to slaughter you , like an ox in the shambles ? When you choose rifles , do n't you see they take a short distance , and you hesitate ! My dear fellow ! if you saw a snake in your path  --  in the act of springing upon you , would n't you put your foot upon him ? Hesitate ? no , indeed . Be bullied by no one ; take the best weapon you can find , and use it in the best way . Shoot the fellow through the heart , and there is not a man breathing who wo n't say you served him right ! " " His blood be on his own head , then , " said Frank . " Certainly ! We must go through this affair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any accident to yourself . We shall have to go off somewhere ; that 's to be thought of . Have you cash handy ? " " Yes ; I was to set out in the morning for Prairie du Chien . " " Admirable . " " But , in the mean time , they are waiting for me at home . " " Well , go there . Pretend fatigue and retire early . Come , then , down to me , say at twelve . We 'll have a supper at the B  --  House , which is near to the river . I 'll order everything , and then look in at the theatre ; at one we 'll sup . You would n't sleep if you went to bed . At three we 'll go over , and at ten , my boy , you shall be on your way to Prairie du Chien . " " Good-night ! " said Frank , thoughtfully . " Good-night , my boy ! Remember  --  twelve ! and mind , do n't let your old woman suspect anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found company there  --  a few chance visiters . He had resolved to act on Randolph 's advice , and he called up all his force of character to go through with it . Some dark thoughts would flash through his mind ever and anon ; but he felt it useless to resist or to think , and he abandoned himself to the stream . He had a stern task to perform , but a necessary one . He had not sought it . It had been thrust upon him , and when he did , at intervals , turn the affair over in his mind , he could not but feel a buoyant pride , a stern triumph in the thought that such a deadly attempt upon him had been met so promptly and manfully . The words of Randolph rang in his ears : " If they want a meeting , they shall have one . " Sometimes he shuddered at the possibility that he himself might be killed . But his reason told him that , under the circumstances , his fate , scarcely preferable , was fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuated , reckless , doomed Glendenning . " He will have it . It 's his own doing ! His blood be on his own head ! " and with these thoughts he applied himself to the gayeties of the company with more than his usual lively and cheerful calmness . " Come , " said Miss Elton , blushing as she did so , " a last duet , Frank . " " A last , indeed , " said he . It was a peculiarity in the present evening that , as he was to set off on a long separation from his family in the morning , all the incidents and remarks had reference to a parting . Mrs. Lennox 's eyes were more than once full of tears . Mary ceased to torment , and Miss Elton to be on her guard with him . All hearts were saddened and softened visibly enough through the cheerfulness which nevertheless reigned over it all . On Frank these continued allusions had a singular effect . It was almost as if everybody knew he was to meet a dangerous foe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absence , separation , and a long farewell . His romantic and tender nature made him delight to yield himself to this illusion . He felt , indeed , that , although the catastrophe of the morning would probably be Glendenning 's death , it would , in fact , break the spell which rendered him the happy , bright blessing of his father 's family circle , and that by a dark destiny he was there now for the last time as a sunshiny , innocent boy . He was about being transformed into a man of blood  --  to stain his peace of mind with murder , and thus to surround himself with associations which must make even his own mother regard him with fear and horror . But the world  --  custom  --  the fashion ! must be satisfied . Must ! He sang several duets and trios with Miss Elton and Mary . His noble form and handsome features were the object of everybody 's gaze , for , somehow or other , he appeared inspired with more than his usual beauty and manliness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And so , my dearest Frank , " said his mother , putting back ( a favourite habit of hers ) the thick hair from his forehead , " we are to lose you . " " Yes , mother . " " And your boyhood is over , " said Mary . " I fear . " " And what shall I do for you in your absence ? " said Fanny , her heart reproaching her for the unavoidable coldness she had been obliged to put on towards him . " Think of me sometimes , " said Frank . " Remember my virtues ( if I have any ! ) , not my follies or my faults . " " Of the latter you have none , " said Mrs. Elton . " And what will become of your music ? " said Fanny . " Oh , I 'm prepared to bid abieu to that and many other pleasures . " " How wonderfully romantic , " exclaimed his father . " I 'll have this lock , " said his mother ; " now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Frank . " As much as you like . " Half playfully , half in earnest , she took up a pair of scissors and cut off a lock , while the laughing circle closed around to witness the ceremony . " Now the other side , " said Fanny , " to make it even . " " Quite right , " replied his mother ; " we must n't destroy his equilibrium on the eve of such an important event . " " Why , one would think he was getting shorn for execution , " cried Mary , with one of her bright smiles . " There ! " said Mrs. Lennox , holding up two curls . " Beg a hair of him for memory , And , dying , mention it within your wills , Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto your issue . " ' This quotation was received with general laughter by all but Frank himself , who , despite his utmost exertions , could not prevent the unexpected thrill with which he had submitted to the operation from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool you make of him ! " said his father . " And his own eyes wet ! " said Mrs. Elton , pointing to Mr. Lennox . " Ridiculous ! " said Mr. Lennox . " The boy 's setting out on a delightful journey ; seven years will soon pass away . Why sadden him with all this sentimental nonsense ? " " Nonsense ? No nonsense at all ! " exclaimed Fanny , laughing . " You must n't think we 're all such hard-hearted , prosaic old bodies as you . What could make us sentimental , I should like to know , if not this ? a young soldier setting out for the field from the haunts of his youth , and all that sort of thing ! Why , it 's poetry itself . " " To be sure , " said Mary . " Upon the hill he turned To take a last fond look Of the valley , and the village church , And the cottage by the brook . He listened to the sounds , So familiar to his ear , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tear . " ' Mary began this in jest , but she appeared almost in earnest as she closed , for she observed with surprise the agitation of Frank . His lip quivered , though the smile still lingered , and suddenly he placed his hand over his eyes , and turned away his head . " Dear , dear Frank ! " said his mother . " And where is the wonder ? " demanded his father , angrily . " Would n't any one fancy he was going to be hanged , by the fuss you make about it ? " " I 'm tired , " said Frank . " I 'm a very poor hand at leave-taking . I think I 'll go to bed , as we have a fatiguing day 's travel to-morrow . " Mrs. Elton , rising to go , came forward , bade him good-by , and , with the privilege of age , kissed him on the forehead . And Fanny came to say good-by . Terrified lest some burst of feeling should betray him , he took her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , and , turning away , she departed . " Now , Frank , " said Mary , " you foolish fellow ! I thought you had more sense . " " Let him be ! " said Mr. Lennox . " Go along to bed , sir ! I hope you 'll return with a little more of the bold dragoon ' about you . What , a roystering blade like you , with the ' beard of Hercules and frowning Mars  --  " " A night 's rest is all I want , " said Frank , gayly . " Well , go along ! " repeated his father . " No more embracing while you 're all in this ridiculous mood . " " Oh , do n't mind me , " cried Frank . " Good-night , my dear father . " " Good-night , my boy : off with you . " " One embrace  --  good-night ! " " Mary ! " " Well , then  --  good-night  --  you 're a foolish creature . " " My mother ! " " My son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went slowly out of the room . In a few moments the family were all in bed . But no one slept . A nervous , broken slumber fell upon Mrs. Lennox , from which , every ten minutes , she started into wakefulness . " My dear Catharine , " at length exclaimed Mr. Lennox , " you are a perfect galvanic battery ! I had as leave sleep with an electric fish . " " I 'm glad you 're awake , " said she . " I 'm very anxious about Frank ! " " Pooh , pooh ! go to sleep . " " Wo n't you get up and see how he is ? " " My good , dear Catharine ! will you have the kindness to hold your tongue ? " " I 'm perfectly sure he 's going to have a fit of illness , " said Mrs. Lennox , in about ten minutes . " Well , my love , if you wo n't sleep , will you get up and read , or go out and take a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of that sort . Be quiet , be quiet . What absurd nonsense have you got in your head ? " " Do n't laugh at me , " said Mrs. Lennox , a quarter of an hour afterward , " but I 'm sure something is the matter with Frank . I 'm sure of it . " " Why ? Why do you think so ? Because a sensitive , affectionate boy is touched on the eve of leaving his home for several years  --  perhaps forever  --  with a parcel of women clipping his locks off , and repeating poetry , and fingering and fiddling about him like the last scene in an opera ? Do go to sleep . " " No , that 's not it . Something extraordinary is the matter with him . He acted very strangely . His persisting in the desire to embrace us all  --  and how did he embrace us ? White lips , cold hands , face turned away , or buried in my bosom . My dear husband , get up . Some horrible catastrophe is hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you be so weak ? If you think anything 's the matter with him , go and see him , and get quizzed to death for it in all his letters for the next six months . The idea of waking a man up at two o'clock in the night to ask him how he does ! " With trembling hands and pale face , the affrighted mother hastily rose , threw over her a loose robe de chambre , and ascended the stairs to Frank 's room . A singular feeling induced the father to follow her . She knocked . " Frank ! rap , rap , rap . " " Frank ! my son ! It 's I  --  your mother . " " Rap , rap , rap . Frank ! Frank ! " There was no answer . Lennox heard her rapidly open the door , and then  --  a shriek of wild horror . He rushed up . The room was empty . Frank was not there . His bed had not been slept in . " The letter yesterday ! his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clasping her hands . " It 's another duel ! " CHAPTER VIII . Night ! silence ! solitude ! not a whisper ! not a sound ! He softly threw up the window and looked into the street . Not the shuffle of a step , not the murmur of a distant wheel . The great city lay hushed as in death , a noiseless phantom . He looked up . The sky , like the earth , was voiceless . There was no moon . Perhaps he would never see it again . He thought a moment of that bright silver disk , as a corpse in its grave would remember it , had the mouldering relic of what had been a man the power of reflection . The stars lay scattered along the unbreathing void , some crowded in far-off clusters , points scarcely perceptible to the straining eye ; some , individually too far for sight , fused together by millions into a soft flush of light ; some , low and near , burned with a liquid , flickering flame , bright and large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milky-way , that mysterious road through eternal space , here vaguely lost to the unconscious gaze , there deepening into luminous nebuloe , where worlds clung to each other like a cloud of bees . " Oh God ! " murmured the young man , overwhelmed with the stupendous thoughts which rose and rolled through his mind . But the clock struck twelve , and called his contemplations back to earth . He started like the convict whose hour has come  --  whose hair is to be shorn  --  whose arms are to be pinioned  --  and who is to be led , hemmed in on all sides by tramping troops , to the scaffold . He shuddered . The idea of killing his enemy now lost its hold on his mind . He felt he was himself to die . A preternatural instinct seemed to tell him his life was terminated . Whatever he was looking on around him , he was looking on for the last time . He was parting from it forever . From all that he loved most deeply  --  most thrillingly , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now the big tears gushed to his eyes  --  Mary , Harry , Fanny Elton  --  his friends , the haunts of his youth , the hopes of his manhood  --  all were to him things of the past  --  shapes of a vanished dream . Oh God ! whither were the turbid waves of chance bearing him ? Was he indeed never more to behold the sun , the crowded streets , the woods , the hills and valleys of the beautiful earth ? Was the voice of human beings no more to sound in his ears ? Was he no more to look in the faces he loved ? A few hours , and the brain that throbbed , the heart that heaved , the hand which he lifted before his eyes , the eye itself , were to be hurled into the black and icy cavern of death ! Was he , then , to cease to exist , to sink from nature like a nameless insect , an unnoted grain of sand  --  to be forever destroyed and forever forgotten ? Dreadful thought ! and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power which watched him ? no hand to sustain him ? He knelt unconsciously ! But to what ? Who heard him ? No one ? Was he , then , utterly alone with night and death ? At this moment his mother 's exhortations rose to his memory . Her faith in God and the Bible ! her humble adoration of Jesus ! Ah ! what new conceptions broke over his mind . Could the dreams of his religious mother be true ? Was Christianity the voice of that God who had hung those mighty heavens with beaming worlds ? Suddenly he asked himself why he should perpetrate this act . He recoiled from death ; he felt he was not fit to die . Still more he recoiled from murder . He had felt like the convict ; but how different was his situation ? His arms were not pinioned ; no stern troops were around him ; no officers of justice bore him forward ; no executioner had power over him if he choose not to mount the scaffold . He was free . Bitterly did he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sought at once some enlightened Christian friend  --  Elton , Emmerson  --  but now it was too late . The challenge , so fiercely given , had been promptly accepted , in a manner haughty and stern , as the case demanded . Could he now retreat ? could he show the white feather ? could he , after all this swaggering bravado , back out , fly , and throw away the reputation which he had won for a chivalric defender of woman , of his country 's honour , and his own ? Could he meet public opinion ? Could he bear the glance of the great and distinguished men who sanctioned by their approbation , and their example , the custom of duelling ? And , after all , was it wrong ? If it were wrong , would those great and good men adopt it , advocate it , and take the lead in it ? He ran over in his mind those who had fought . The array of splendid names staggered his reason , for he was but a boy  --  inexperienced , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember one , only one , distinguished man , one public orator , one judge , one experienced statesman who had declined a challenge , under strong circumstances , publicly and unequivocally , on the ground that it was immoral and unchristian to accept it , he would have had force of character to follow the bright and godlike example . But he could not remember one . All for the world  --  not one for God . " Up , then , and away ! " he murmured . " This is no time to discuss moral questions . My fate calls me ; I can not consider consequences ; I 'm in the world , and of it . The die is cast ; shame on my weakness ! I will hesitate no more ! " The clock struck one . The heavy stroke quivered over the hushed , sleeping city , and startled him from his dreams of right and wrong . One moment he knelt , and implored his Creator to forgive him . Thus much to early associations and inner instincts . One moment he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many happy hours , where he had woven so many bright dreams . One moment he bade farewell to the beloved beings from whom he was thus separating himself on his dark and desperate adventure , and then , stealing carefully down stairs , and wafting a kiss to his mother 's door , he sallied forth into the street , and hastened with flying steps over the solitary , echoing pavement , towards the hotel designated by Colonel Randolph . CHAPTER IX . As he reached the Park , a figure started out from the deep shadow of St. Paul 's Church , and stood directly before him . It was with a singular emotion that he recognised Glendenning . The two young men , who had thus strangely met , were quite alone . They stood face to face in the dim starlight . " This is a strange meeting , Captain Glendenning , " said Frank . Glendenning made no answer . " If it is accident , stop my way no more . " " It is not accident , " replied Glendenning , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vague hope of meeting you . " " If not accidental , " said Frank , haughtily , " it is yet stranger . " " Frank , " said Glendenning , " I throw myself on your generosity . By what humiliation , by what bitter taunts I have been driven to this crisis I need not explain . I have risked my character , and the mortal enmity of White , by seeking you here , and therefore our meeting must be a secret . Give me your hand , and hear what I have to say . " " I will not take your hand , " replied Frank , sternly ; " I can have no secret with you . " " Pity me and forgive me , " said Glendenning . " I am only a victim . " " I scorn you , Glendenning , " said Frank , " scorn and despise you . The struggle I have undergone you can never know . Your conduct has been as unworthy of a friend as of a man . If I kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall not forgive you . You might have spared me the pain of speaking with you . Let me pass . " " Lennox , " said Glendenning , " your anger I can bear , because you are ignorant of my position and my feelings . " " Spare me your confidence , " said Frank , coldly . " I shall not sympathize with a weakness which has led you to this new outrage . No friend , not beneath contempt , could have advised you . You have mistaken the taunts of a coterie for those of the world . Tell your advisers what I say , and should you meet the fate you justly merit from a hand that will not shrink from bestowing it , I will triumph in having been your chastiser , and shall be ready to become theirs . Let me pass , sir , or I shall think you a coward as well as a  --  " " Frank , " said Glendenning , " I make allowances for your irritation . I am patient beneath your insults , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . Despicable , false , and fickle I have been ; may God forgive me ! As for avoiding this meeting , I wish to do so , because , if we meet , one or both of us must fall . I did intend to waste my fire . My life is without the least value to me . It would be grateful to me to fall beneath your hand , but not only my honour forbids , but the honour and life of at least one of my friends . Suffering and thought have made me cool : be so yourself , and hear me . I have weighed the matter in every way , looked at it from every point . Without any hatred to each other , we are involved in a dark destiny , from which only a chance of escape is left us . I do not mean escape from death ; I mean escape from the horror of destroying each other . My own happiness , Frank , I would resign rather than proceed ; but my honour ! Besides , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  were I to refuse to call you out  --  " " Pray go on , " said Frank . " Two or three officers of my regiment are resolved to do so . The step which has sunk me so low in your estimation does not add to your danger . We are both surrounded by determined enemies , watching to consummate our ruin . It is not my fault ; it is necessity . " " The tyrant 's plea and the coward 's excuse , " said Frank , his high temper mounting at the narration of the danger in which he stood . " But that I loved you , Frank , loved you and yours  --  oh , more than my tongue has power to say  --  let your reason tell you I am incapable of the dishonour of seeking this interview . But I remember the mad act by which I first brought this on myself , and I hope I may partly expiate the outrage by this shame . " " If you have anything to say , say it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this affair . " " I ? " " You ! not for my sake ; I ask nothing at your hands . If I fall , I forgive you . Neither for your sake , but for your mother 's ! " " I make a move ? and what move have you the coolness to ask from me ? " " Write me the most guarded apology , the faintest regret for the blow you gave me  --  say but one word , and I will withdraw my message  --  even now  --  in spite of  --  " " I ? I bear the shame of your outrage ? I apologize ? I humiliate myself before you , who first forced upon me a quarrel , who , when punished less than he merited , now , to conciliate heartless worldlings , throws reason , humanity , decency , friendship , to the winds , and with a threatening note and a bullying friend calls me out ? Do you ask me to soil my name , to bend my knee , to become a by-word and a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret the blow ; I only regret that , misled by my own feelings , I ever touched in friendship the hand that , even in a moment of intoxication , could offer an insult to a lady . " " Go , then , Mr. Lennox , " said Glendenning . " It must be confessed , if my crime has been great , my punishment is not trifling . But your passion is too just to move in me other feelings than pain . You will remember hereafter that I sought your forgiveness in vain . Remember , also , to the end of your life , that I have given you mine unasked . Tell your mother I pray for her happiness . Good-evening to you . " He turned and walked slowly away . CHAPTER X. Frank found Randolph and a surgeon waiting impatiently . " D  --  n it , Lennox , we began to think you had backed out , " said his friend , heartily shaking him by the hand . " Do you know its two , and the man is to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper is cooked to death . " " I 'm as hungry as a shark , " said Frank , who , in the presence of Randolph , resolutely turned from all reflection . " A very nice supper , at all events , " said Doctor Wilson . " Nothing is wanting but time to eat it , " said Frank . " What 's this ? " " Chateau la rose , " replied Randolph , " and devilish good , too ; but mine host says the Champagne is something particular . " " Come along , " cried Frank , laughing ; " let 's get at it at once . How 's the tongue ? " " Pretty good ! " replied Wilson . " Egad ! " remarked Randolph , " there 's nothing like a first-rate supper on these occasions ; only , my good fellow , a little moderation with the wine , if you please ; eat as much as you like , but wine we must stint you in . " " Nonsense , " said Frank , who had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A clear eye and a steady hand , my boy , and many more such bumpers as this , " cried Randolph , emptying his glass . " Wilson , " said Frank , " you do n't drink ? " " Thank you , " replied the young man : " in the night I 'm obliged to be a little careful . " " What 's the matter with you ? Dyspepsy ? " " A touch or so . " " This bird is delicious , " said Frank , feeling a strange life and spirit under the influence of the excitement , and of the wine . " How goes the enemy ? " said Randolph . " Ten minutes to three . " " No  --  twenty  --  you 're too fast . " " No  --  ten , " said Wilson , " and rather five than ten . My watch is very accurate . " " Then sharp 's the word ! " said Frank ; " just cut that other cork , will you ? " " No , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph ; " no more . You must wait : at breakfast as much as you like , but  --  " " Oh , one  --  damn it , do you take me for a boarding-school girl ? " " Well , then , only one . " " Success to us ! " exclaimed Frank ; " I 've eaten like a boa-constrictor . Positively not another go at the Champagne ? " " Not another drop . " " Well , there 's no harm in singing , I suppose ? " said Frank . " Did you ever see such a madcap ? " asked Randolph , smiling approvingly to Wilson . " That 's the stuff we Yankees are made of . This is the way we meet threats and bullying . We 'll make Pistol eat his leaks . Ah ! ha ! ha ! " " Ah ! ha ! ha ! " said Frank ; " but wo n't you sing ? Do n't you sing , Wilson ? " " No , no , " said Wilson , who did not seem so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had the air of being a guest rather from professional duty than taste . " Will you sing , Randolph ? " " No  --  excuse me ; my voice is rather in the bullfrog line . Anything wanted in the way of a trombone , I 'm your man ! " " Well , I can sing , " said Frank . " A bumper of Burgundy fill , fill for me , Give those who prefer it Champagne  --  " ' and he sang very sweetly and gayly a verse of that popular melody . As he was commencing the second , they were interrupted by a knock at the door . " Hallo ! pull up ! " said Randolph . " It 's three , sir , " said the man , who had entered , taking off his hat . " The boat is ready . " " Come along , then , " said Randolph . " Push ahead , Wilson ! do n't forget your box . " " Scarcely , " said Wilson , with a grave air . " And where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Randolph , facetiously . " The rifle 's in yonder corner , " said Wilson . " Ah , ha ! " exclaimed Randolph , and , handling with an air of familiarity the formidable instrument , he led the way out through the deserted street and to the wharf . " Now , then , governor , where 's your boat ? " " Here she is , sir , " replied the man , with a knowing grin . " Bring her round , Sam . " " Are you good oarsmen ? " " No mistake . " " In with you , then ; in with you , Wilson . Hallo ! old fellow , do n't fall overboard . Hand the box ; take care of the rifle ! Now , then , governor . " " All aboard ? " " All aboard ! " " You 'll hold us harmless , gentlemen ? " inquired the boatman . " Why , damn it ! certainly , " said Frank . " Who 's going to hurt you ? " " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day and trust to-morrow . I 'm a poor man , with a wife and twelve children , and  --  " " How many at the breast ? " asked Frank , laughing . " Two , sir . " " Well , there 's ten dollars ! nearly a dollar apiece for your brats . " " Thank'ee , sir . Now shove her off , Sam ! " " Let her went , " said Randolph ; " keep dark , and row , you villains , as if the devil were after you . " " Perhaps he is after some on us . " " Just mind your oar , will you , my honest friend ! " cried Randolph , in a low voice ; " when we wish your jokes , we 'll ask for them . " " Ay , ay , sir , " said the man , and , stripping off coat and waistcoat , and equipping his jaws with an ample quid , he applied himself to his labour , and the small and heavily-laden boat darted out from the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silent ships which lay around , and at length gained the broad open bay , when the two athletic fellows put themselves yet more seriously to their toil , with a strength which made them fairly fly through the quiet water . " That 's right , my men ; pull hard , " said Randolph ; " a long pull , a strong pull , and a pull all together . " " Ay , ay , sir . " " What a beautiful , still night ! " remarked Frank . " How perfectly glassy the bay is ! " added Wilson . " Famous weather for a lark ! " said Randolph . They soon receded from the black , long , level town , with nothing around them but the broad , sleeping flood , through which the boat cut with a gurgling rush , breaking its mirror surface into large flakes of phosphoric fire , and over them the sky and stars , paling before a pearly light , which began to grow visible in the East . In the spot thus indicated , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed clouds , lying long , and low , and in singularly level lines , began to be just tipped with silvery whiteness , which changed , as they proceeded , to a deeper , brighter hue . " The day is breaking , " said Wilson . " Beautiful nature , how  --  " But he stopped suddenly , as if recollecting himself , and Randolph quietly gave him a wink . " How far is it across here , squire ? " asked Randolph . " About two thousand seven hundred and forty-six yards , sir , " said the man . " And that point ? " " Jersey City , " said Frank . " And Governor 's Island , which is that ? " inquired Randolph . " Here , do n't you see ? " said Frank , " away off to the left , behind us . " " Yonder is Weehawk , " said Wilson , " and yonder lies the 74 gun-ship . " " And that pretty point ahead ? " " Hoboken , " replied the man . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , fresh air , the gentle , soothing motion , the sight of nature in its calmness , purity , and beauty , going on with its radiant and sweet changes , as usual , the broadening daylight , the now stirring clouds , the sight of the distant , steepled , bristling city , exercised a certain influence , not only over the young man himself , but over all the little party bent on their dreadful purpose . It contrasted as much with their object , as with the flippant jests and smiles with which that object was pursued . Upon Frank 's mind it was peculiarly impressive . The fumes of the supper and wine had passed away , and his passion had cooled . All personal fear , too , had completely disappeared , and the awful image in his mind was the body of his murdered friend weltering in its gore . He was going to do the deed with his eyes open , with his heart softened . He shuddered , but shook off the relenting weakness with a sort of savage coarseness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had several times assumed in the company , the contagious company of Randolph . Darkly and brutally , therefore , turning from all thought and feeling , all reflection of a religious nature , all communion with his Creator , he resolved , since he was in it , to go through with the matter like a man . They were now close on the land . The boat drew near to a somewhat elevated and beautiful shore , thickly wooded , even to the edges of the naked rocks , which here and there projected into the stream . The next moment the keel ran grazing upon a little sandy beach . " Land ho ! " cried Randolph . " Take care of the oar , sir , " said the boatman . " Now , then , my son-a-wax , " said Randolph , " run her right in here  --  so , so . Wilson , the rifle . Take care of your box . By G  --  d ! there they are ! " The party got out . In the actual presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool courage of his character gave a manly dignity to his person and a quiet pride to his step . He felt no longer sure of killing , or of being killed , but only that he was about engaging in a serious contest , in which he must bear himself with perfect composure , and the consequences of which he was prepared to abide by . He never appeared more at ease in his life , while Wilson was pale with the deepening interest of the scene , and even Randolph , although a thoughtless and flippant duellist , lost a portion of his colour and some of his natural coolness . The brave man may step forward to be shot at himself , but the bravest may falter while standing passively by , to behold the instrument of death directed against his friend . " You had better remain here , my good fellows , " said Frank to the boatmen . " Lie quiet . Some of us will want you in half an hour . " " Ay , ay , sir . " But these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little drama to obey . Hastily mooring their boat , therefore , to a large stone , with eager feet they stole noiselessly up after the rest of the party , who were too much occupied with other thoughts to pay them any attention , and planted themselves close to the scene of action , where they could , with an undisturbed luxury , be spectators of this  --  in the nineteenth century  --  fashionable , honourable , oft-repeated , oft-yet-to-be-repeated scene . We may all have an opportunity of testing , like them , the excitement which used to give Commodus and Nero an appetite for breakfast . " Now , Lennox , " said Randolph , in a low voice , his flippant manner entirely changed , " I understand you to assure me of your intention to fire to the best of your skill ? " " Certainly , " said Frank . " I have not come here to play . " The parties now approached each other , and calm and courteous greetings were interchanged . The rifles were immediately loaded , and the distance measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged between White and Randolph . The principals were ordered to their places , and the pieces handed to them . " Anything more , my boy ? " whispered Randolph . " Nothing , " replied Frank , with a bright smile . " When I say three , gentlemen ! " said the business-like voice of Randolph , as all receded and left the opponents planted upon the green , level lawn , erect , silent , and alone . There was one moment 's pause . Randolph advanced a step to give the signal . " One  --  two  --  three ! " Each piece was discharged as he spoke . Frank sprang into the air and fell heavily to the ground , like an eagle which a skilful huntsman has brought from the clouds , while the blue smoke rolled slowly off , curling away upon the dim morning light , and up through the green branches . All present rushed to the spot . The unfortunate young man lay extended at full length , writhing in great pain and absolutely weltering in gore , which gushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward in the convulsion of nature 's last appalling struggle . Glendenning , from whose face horror had drained every trace of colour , staggered forward , and threw himself upon his knees with clasped hands , gasping for breath . " Frank ! Frank ! " he rather shrieked than said , in a hoarse voice . But , on catching a full view of the face , he stopped , petrified and dumb . It was death he was looking at . The countenance was undergoing a frightful change . A stream of blood , apparently exhaustless , continued to flow from the wound . Wilson cut away the clothing in awful silence . Drops of sweat had burst out on the forehead of the dying man , who , with lustreless and broken eyes , sunken cheeks , the nose sharpened with the strain of the great agony , was obviously undergoing a last crisis . " Frank ! Frank ! " gasped Glendenning , his hair rising with terror , " speak to me ! " " I , I , for  --  " but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing , " said Glendenning . " He 's fainting . See ! see ! Doctor , quick ! why do n't you save him ? " " The lung ! " said Wilson , in a low voice  --  " it has perforated the lung . " " My  --  mother  --  " gasped Frank . " Tell her  --  that  --  " He fell back . " But do something , doctor , " said Glendenning . " Your instruments  --  your art  --  he 's fainting , doctor . G  --  d d  --  n it ! why do n't you do something ? " " My dear sir , " said the surgeon , dropping the heavy hand with a singular smile , " it 's perfectly absurd . He 's quite dead . " " Dead ? " " Dead ! " And the word went round from one blanched face to another . " Now , then , " cried White , " I hope Colonel Nicholson will be satisfied . " " Poor devil ! " muttered the boatman , " his jig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Randolph , dashing the quick-coming tears from his eyes . " Poor young fellow , " said White , looking at his watch . " Now , Glendenning , we must be off . " " Dead ! " echoed Glendenning , aghast , dripping with cold sweat , and staring at the outstretched , stiffening body and rigid countenance , which had already assumed a marble fixedness . " Frank ! Frank ! " There was no answer , there was no motion ; and he stood gazing on the face of his dead friend . " It will pass in a moment , " said White , quietly , to the surgeon . " Be a man : come ! there is no time to lose . " Glendenning , with a bewildered stare , suffered himself to be led off . Once he looked back . Once he looked up and around , as a fiend just out of hell might gaze upon the upper world of light , and joy , and peace , and beauty . Once he murmured , " Oh God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead , he pursued his flight to the boat in silence . CHAPTER XI . By the time they reached the city , Glendenning had collected his senses . The steamboat to start at six for Albany was lying at the wharf . No persuasion could induce him to land . He went instantly on board , and retired into the cabin . His friend hastened to the hotel , and returned at the hour of starting , and once more the gay and animated scene of a setting forth up the Hudson went on around them . Hours stop for nothing ; the day advanced ; the beautiful shores of the river flew by , bathed in the tender morning light and dew , and printing their graceful outlines against the sky , as the successful duellist hastened on , leaving behind the great city , already beginning to ring with the incident in which he had played such a bloody part . It was long before the exquisite nature through which he was passing , the rapid motion , and the crowds around began to make upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feeling that he was in a horrible dream . White was grave and silent ; his purpose was accomplished ; his duty as a man of honour and a gentleman had been strictly performed , and he left his companion to the course of his own reflections , which gradually fell back into a more slow and collected motion . He would gladly have avoided reflecting on the past or on the future , or , indeed , reflecting at all ; but the power of banishing thought he had lost ; the spectre of his murdered friend presented itself to him everywhere ; he saw it upon each green sward ; it glared at him even when he closed his eyes ; it seemed like a curse ; it was religion .

I also set up for a man of courage , moral as well as physical . I wish to see things as they are , whether the discovery be pleasing or not .

" " Certainly , " said Frank , who , during this harangue , had been leaning his face back and away as much as possible , but who was followed up close by the youthful philosopher , and greatly annoyed at finding himself entrapped into a metaphysical dispute with a person whom travelling and his own self-sufficient mind had rendered rather disgusting , " certainly , truth is the object of life , but one can not be too guarded against illusion . " " Oh yes , but I am sure I have found truth . " " You 're a lucky fellow . " " Yes , I am , and it is travel which has opened my mind . Before I went abroad I do n't think there was a greater fool to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! I do not . " " I was badly dressed , bad-mannered , and backward , without any confidence in myself , and blushing like a red cabbage when any one  --  particularly a lady  --  spoke to me . Now , egad ! I have seen the world  --  but I am wrong . It is not travel alone which has opened my mind . " " And what else is it ? " " Love ! " " Love ? " said Frank , almost with a start . " Love , " repeated Earnest . " You 've no idea how you get on in that way abroad . I was in love with three married women . You know no one falls in love with any one but married women on the Continent . " " No , I did not know that . I fear I am as backward as you were before you left America . " " One was a countess at Vienna , one a baroness at Paris , and the third the wife of a general  --  a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ladies return your passion ? " asked Frank . " Why , that is scarcely for me to say , " replied Earnest , ed the thunderbolt . The agony , the despair , the broken-hearted mother , shrieking , fainting , raving in delirious despair , perhaps ; the crowds of sympathizing friends , the stark cold , noble body , thus struck ruthlessly down in its young hopes , its radiant life . " Oh God ! have mercy on my soul ! " he strove to pray , but , with a sickening effort , he succeeded in turning from these images . As night came on his fellow-passengers retired to their berths . He alone paced the solitary deck , watched the soft , glittering stars , and strove in vain to escape from the bloody apparition , which , wherever he looked , lay convulsed , trembling , gasping before him , trying without success to utter a word  --  a parting word  --  of forgiveness and love , and the red stream of life gushing from those sunshiny lips , so full of smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever fallen , and yet warm with the fond mother 's deep kiss . Southard 's form then rose before him , and his wife , and the dead child , and the Bible he had blasphemously hurled away , and the vow he had taken , and the curse he had called on himself if he ever gave up the mild and pure precepts of the Son of man to worship the dark world and follow his own wild passions . " Wine ! wine ! " he muttered , sick with horror ; and , going below , he roused the steward , and ordered upon deck a couple of bottles of Madeira and cigars . Ah ! ha ! the immortal stream rolled warmly through his icy veins . He quaffed deep and often , and rose superior to his puny fears . New , brighter , more manly views came to him . He was the victim of a stern destiny . He had not shrunk  --  would not shrink . Duty and honour before all things . Now , then , he could face the scoffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stand before the malignant eye of the dog , Nicholson . Did they think they could blast him thus with impunity ? No ! no ! The ruin he had wrought must be avenged somewhere . First he would call to a stern account the arch-fiend who had made him what he was : ay , though he had to grasp his throat at the head of his regiment ; ay , though he had to stab him as he slept . " Die  --  die in peace , horrible spectre ! Close those hideous , starting eyes . If there be another world , where I am one day to join you , I will have a tale to tell dark as your early grave . " The daybreak found him still staggering to and fro in the drunken triumph of his bloody anticipations . On reaching Montreal , he separated from White , whose cold indifference disgusted him . " Ah , my friend ! " said Southard , pale and agitated , " where have you been ? What is it I have heard ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Glendenning . " It is red with the heart 's blood of the only friend I ever had , wet with the tears of the only family who ever took the least interest in me . " " You have not  --  you can not have  --  " " All  --  the worst  --  open the window  --  your room is suffocating  --  and leave me  --  " " Oh , Glendenning ! what have you done ? " Glendenning covered his face with his hands . Southard left him in horror . As soon as he found himself alone , he rushed out of the house , and directed his steps towards the lodgings of Breckenbridge . It was late in the afternoon . The front door was open . Several persons were passing slowly in and out . As no one questioned him , he questioned nobody . He felt that he was sent on a stern mission of vengeance . He was going to seek his insolent enemy , and to dash upon his forehead a blow of hate and insult . He mounted the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the room was a silent group of brother officers : they stood around a bed . His fierce eye passed rapidly in among them in search of his victim . The last one his glance fell on was Nicholson . They were all gazing tranquilly upon a form extended on the bed . It was a corpse , arrayed in the vestments of the grave , stretched peacefully , stiffly , at full length , the waxen hands crossed on the breast , the chin bound tightly in snowy linen , the features white , sunken , changed . At first he could not recognise them , till , still gazing , a dim idea  --  a faint resemblance  --  it was Breckenbridge ! When he lifted his eyes , at length , he found his companions had disappeared . They had left him in disgust . He was alone . His hot hate turned to icy horror . One moment he laid his hand on the forehead , which sent a sensation of cold to his heart . He went back calmly to his rooms , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XII . Section In the evening a stranger was announced . It proved to be a Mr. Beckford , an old and venerable friend of his father , but one who , in his difficulties with his family , had always been of the opinion that his father was in the wrong . This gentleman had known and loved him from his earliest infancy . He had dandled him on his knees a thousand times . Beckford approached in the kindest manner and embraced him . " What is all this I hear , my dear young friend ? " said he , with deep and tender commiseration . " You are looking ill , and are , I learn , in trouble . I have but this morning arrived . Let me be your confidant and counsellor . " Glendenning frankly related his misery to him , and felt strangely relieved by it . " Dreadful ! most frightful ! and what do you mean to do ? " " Oh , leave the army , of course , forever . " " Right ! quite right ! But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first who has been in a painful dilemma . Cheer up ! do n't be too much alone , and dine with me tomorrow at four . " " I will . " " I am going to call on your lieutenant-colonel this evening . " " What , Nicholson ? " " Yes . " " He does not dine with you , I hope ? " " I intended to ask him before I saw you , but will not now , of course . " They conversed long together . Oh , how sweet is the voice of friendship to the heart bruised and broken with treachery , unkindness , and despair ! At length Beckford took his leave . Early the next morning a note came for Glendenning . It was from Beckford . He opened it and read : Letter " August , 18- . " Dear Sir , " Circumstances have obliged me to put off the dinner to-day ; I shall not , therefore , have the pleasure of seeing you . " Truly yours , " Horace Beckford . Section " Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day and the next passed , but no farther visit or invitation from Beckford . Had he , too , abandoned him ? In the mean time , Glendenning had resumed his military duties , dined at the mess-table , and attended drills and a parade ; but the coolness of all his brother officers , with two or three exceptions , was more marked than ever . The news of his fatal duel had spread like wildfire . The papers were full of it , although he never looked into them . White he met often , but they had together no confidential conversations , and he began to conceive for him a loathing which he found it impossible altogether to conceal . The deed he had perpetrated did not seem to have produced the desired effect . A meeting with rifles startled and shocked the public mind . It was pronounced bloody , savage , horrible . True , the choice of weapons had not rested with Glendenning ; but no matter ; he was in the affair ; he was covered with odium ; he was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , the blind , stupid , dreadful error he had committed . He had risked all , lost all , and gained nothing . He was not long in discovering evidence enough , that even Beckford had dropped him . That gentleman was a great deal with Nicholson ; they dined together . Their intimacy was a sufficient explanation of Beckford 's coldness to him . " Nicholson again ! " muttered the young man . At this period his mind , unsupported by any strength but its own , appeared to give way and break down . It was crushed by the great events around him . He lost his power of self-command , and vacillated even in his purpose of revenge against Nicholson . He was seen more than once intoxicated in the streets . At length , maddened with grief , shame , indignation , and despair , he wrote Colonel Nicholson a letter , pouring forth upon him every opprobrious name , and demanding to meet him in the field . In reply , he was placed under arrest . The principal charge was disrespect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under review , and every dark stain upon his character was brought out in its blackest light . He was tried by a Court Martial . From the beginning to the end of it , the investigation was against him . He was sentenced to be cashiered . From that time nothing more was seen of him at Montreal . Colonel Nicholson 's triumph was complete , and he enjoyed it without any compunctious visitings of pity . In his defence , Glendenning had made an attempt to fasten upon him the odium of having caused the second duel ; but it had failed completely . White soon after sold his commission in disgust . He was a man of fortune , and fond of pleasure , to which he resolved to devote the remainder of his life . He expressed freely his opinion of the part Nicholson had borne in the affair , hoping to be brought into contact with him , but that gentleman , from whatever motive , did not condescend to be aware of the fact . White soon after passed down through New-York , and sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader to imagine the scene at Mr. Lennox 's when the news of Frank 's death was abruptly brought by a messenger , and presently afterward , covered with a military cloak , and borne by hired hands , the corpse , drenched in gore . We shall not attempt to paint the guilty horror , the conscience-stricken anguish of the father , as he gazed on the result of his own lessons , the despair and sobs of Mary and Fanny , and the wild shrieks of the mother , who , tearing herself from the hands which would have withheld her , rushed into the hall , met the body , and , after a series of convulsions , fell at last into a swoon . She caught but that one terrible look of the face of her son , who was buried before she recovered from the delirium which succeeded to her state of insensibility . In a week her life was declared to be in danger , and her family waited to behold her also sacrificed to the brutal error of the age . She continued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only rendered supportable , perhaps , by excessive bodily suffering . At length the crisis passed , and she recovered , but so changed that even they who had previously been but slightly acquainted could not behold her without surprise and compassion . Her deep mourning struck their attention less forcibly than the emaciated form , the pale countenance , the ever-moistened eyes , the thin , quivering lips , and the deep sighs which continually and unconsciously burst from her bosom . At length , thoughts less painful took possession of her . She had herself wished , at a former period , that her son might rather be brought back dead than a murderer . Perhaps the great penalty of so young and noble a life might be received as an expiation . Who shall put limits to the mercy of God ? Who attempt to fathom his judgments ? As week after week stole away , her excessive grief changed more and more to profound melancholy , tempered by pious resignation . She possessed the support of religion , the inestimable consolation of prayer . In the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent but heavenly blessings of fortitude , hope , submission , and tranquillity . Even while sorrow ravaged her cheek , He who watches over his own shed upon her heart a soothing repose , and , after long imploring the power to do so , she was at length enabled to say with sincerity , " Not my will , but thine be done . " Poor Mr. Lennox had no such consolation , and he began to feel that he had not . The death of his son was by far the heaviest shock he had ever suffered , and it taught him at once the precarious nature of human felicity . He did not know how to endure it , and he envied , while he could not share , the holy peace of his wife . Grief had not only shaken his health , but destroyed his spirits . That inexhaustible flow of cheerfulness  --  it was at last at an end . He never jested and rarely smiled . He became careless in his dress and irregular and negligent in his habits . He seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; partook of no pleasures or amusements of any kind , and showed a particular disinclination to anything like business . He was now fifty , and , even previous to the catastrophe which had thus broken him down , from his general habits and opinions , as well as his fortune , he had entertained ideas of leisure and repose , natural enough to a person of his age and character , after a life of confinement and occupation . But the death of his son , with the attending circumstances , rendered him still less disposed to the toils and responsibilities of the office , which he now rarely entered , committing the whole business to the care of Emmerson . Mary and Fanny were young , and youth recovers from the stroke of sorrow in proportion to the keenness of its first pangs . These two lovely girls , thus startled by an event as shocking to their imaginations as to their affections , exhausted their anguish in tears , and , while both had been too faithfully attached ever to forget the loved lost one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with time , from that gloomy and unalterable brooding over the past  --  the destined doom of the bereaved parents . The affair made a great noise in the city for a while ; indeed , it threw the whole country into an excitement . Frank 's sad fate was deplored publicly and privately . The press honoured his memory with a burst of mournful admiration , with very few comments on the immorality of the manner in which he had met his fate . Several short poems appeared in the journals , tendering sympathy to the afflicted family , and then new events , new deaths , new actors and opera , new dancers , new duels , and other nine days ' wonders , drove the incident from the public mind . Poor Frank , if thought of at all , was remembered only as the " young officer shot in a duel . " Whatever might have been the opinion of that small portion of men who really believe and endeavour to act up to the principles of Christianity , the editors , the magistrates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means excluding women , gave few tokens of disapprobation or of horror except at the accidental issue . It is fashionable to point at the drunkard the finger of scorn , but the murderer and the duellist , only by chance prevented from becoming one , hears the murmur of interest , of admiration , and applause . Emmerson watched the course of affairs with interest . By some magical influence , his secret wishes seemed already almost realized . Frank , Harry , and Seth were out of his way . He had become the master spirit of the office , and Mr. Lennox had already abandoned to him the general control of his professional affairs . The fortune which had been intended for Frank might now descend to Harry . Miss Elton , with her large fortune , might be persuaded to listen to him , now that Harry was not only away , but had left her with unconcealed indifference . So entirely had Mr. Lennox been unfitted for business by the late misfortune , that Mr. Emmerson was obliged to appear , not only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one peculiarly his ambition to assume ) of counsellor and advocate , and he had several times , in cases of interest , addressed the jury . Although never great , he was always , on these occasions , respectable , and it happened that various paragraphs appeared in the newspapers , calling public attention to these cases , and particularly mentioning the able and eloquent speeches of Mr. Emmerson . These eulogies were sometimes accompanied by intimations respecting the good fortune of Mr. Lennox in having a partner so capable of supplying his place , now that his health and mind were so seriously injured by the late affecting family affliction . Who it was that took such peculiar pains to acquaint the world with the merits of Emmerson , must be left to the imagination of the reader . It is not likely we should be able to get much proof of it without spending more time than we are at present able to spare , and probably not even then . It is , however , within our power to state that , on several occasions , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to have been unaccountably mislaid , and that , by an odd coincidence , each one of the said mislaid papers contained a paragraph of this kind . Some of them , however , Mr. Lennox could not but see . Far from being offended , however , he was pleased at the compliments to his friend , and took pains to advance him on all possible occasions . He spoke of him enthusiastically to his clients , as a man superior to himself in coolness and business habits . He congratulated and complimented him on his essays as an orator , delicately forced him forward , and loudly praised his efforts . With feigned modesty and reluctance , but secret triumph , Emmerson received these generous attentions . " Yes , my dear fellow ! " said Lennox to him one day , " I am done  --  my heart is broken ; I shall never be worth anything again . You must , in some measure , supply my place till Harry , poor boy , gets back . Let us have all ready for him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enough for both of you , and I want him to distinguish himself as a lawyer , and , at the same time , keep him near us the rest of our lives . Poor boy ! poor boy ! poor boy ! " he continued , his eyes filling with tears . " Has anything happened to him ? " inquired Emmerson . " No ; we have not yet had a line from him , and it 's two months since he sailed . But I was thinking of  --  " He rose and left the room . CHAPTER XIV . We must hurry over this part of our story . The Lennox family , from the most happy had become the most miserable in existence . If anything could have added to their anguish , it was the particulars of the affair , and of Glendenning 's part in it , which they learned in due time . Mr. Lennox even went to Montreal , and ascertained sufficiently the state of the case to comprehend , however , that the unfortunate young man was less to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn into indignation as he received from Southard , to whom , as Glendenning 's landlord , he had applied , the description of the manner in which he , whom he had regarded as the murderer of his son , had been drawn into his present position . He learned that he was ruined , degraded , and desperate , and that he had disappeared , no one knew whither . He conceived at one time the resolution to insult , and thus meet Colonel Nicholson , but here , in lieu of religious principles , his excellent heart and his sincere attachment to his poor wife saved him . He would not , in her present state of health and spirits , subject her to another shock . He would have no more dead bodies brought into the home once so happy and gay , and he so well knew that the event of his returning to her , his hand stained with lifeblood , would utterly destroy her , that he found himself once or twice in society with Nicholson , his arm yearning to dash upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of one or the other , and yet , great as was the effort , he restrained the swelling emotions of his heart . He had seen that side of the duelling question which the world do not always see . He had caught a fearful glance behind the scenes . He had beheld the mother 's anguish , he had felt the father 's heart . " No ! no ! " he said . " Poor Katy is not so wrong , after all . No matter what the provocation , a man has no right to fight a duel . " On his way down to New-York from Albany he had Mr. Lawrence as a companion . This gentleman heard with surprise that he had been to Montreal , and , with still more obvious marks of astonishment , listened to the recital of what he had learned there , and what he had refrained from doing . " What ! " said he . " Your wife has allowed you to go alone to Montreal to make inquiries on this subject ? " " Alone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you found the blame lay with this Colonel Nicholson , and you met him in society , and from prudence , and considerations for your family , refrained from calling him to account ? " " Certainly . Do you not approve what I have done ? " " Approve ? my old , faithful friend ! " cried Lawrence . " It is the noblest action you ever did in your life . He who governs himself is the greatest of men . But you 're very well  --  you 're mind is tranquil  --  you do n't seem to  --  to  --  " He paused . " My heart is broken ! " said Lennox . " Yes , but  --  " resumed Lawrence , without showing the sympathy his friend had expected , " your heart is broken , certainly ! That 's very well ! that 's all right ! that 's as it should be ! but  --  " " What do you mean ? " demanded Mr. Lennox , surprised . " I 'll tell you what I mean  --  I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you as my old friend , and , moreover  --  it is utterly impossible . You ! a man capable of such self-government as that . " " I really do n't understand you . " " The long and the short of it , then , is this , " replied Lawrence . " It is generally reported and believed in New-York that you are  --  that  --  that  --  " " That what ? " demanded Lennox . " That you 're reason has been affected ; that you 're , in fact , not in your right mind . " " I ? " said Lennox , thunderstruck . " You ! I 've heard a hundred people speak of it as a thing certain . Grief , they say , has affected you in this way . Now I see so plainly it is an absurd mistake , that I do n't hesitate a moment to make you acquainted with the report , in order that you may take what measures you please to set the matter right . " " But whom did you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conversation . " There are few more disagreeable things than this . Such a report , whether true or false , is so sure to be contradicted , that contradiction can scarcely be said to mean anything , and the annoyance is heightened by the difficulty of disproving it . Mr. Lennox procured from Mr. Lawrence the names of several persons who were under the impression he was not in his right mind . On his return to town he made some effort to trace the rumour , but could not do so . His abandonment of business had given probability to it , and some one had fairly and distinctly made the assertion . Who this some one was , he found it impossible to discover . Once or twice he came so near him as to hear , in so many words , that the statement had been made on the best of authority , but it had been communicated in a confidence too strict to be betrayed . " I can tell you who it is , " whispered Emmerson one day , " but I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't be afraid ; I will never name you as my informant . " " On that condition , then , " said Emmerson . " It is the young doctor you recently called in , in the absence from town of Doctor . N  --  . " " What , young Doctor B  --  ? " " The same . He hinted something of the sort to me , but I did not rightly understand what he meant . Now , I see , he must have had some absurd idea of this sort in his mind . " " He shall never cross my threshold again , " said Lennox . " He 's a weak , ignorant young man  --  a poor devil . I would n't notice him ; he is n't worth it . The report will die away of itself  --  let it go . Any noise about it , you know , will only spread it wider . " " True , quite true . " " Such an infamous slander must fall to the ground of itself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles . CHAPTER XV . The excitement of getting out to sea for the first time , to a young fellow like Harry , is very great . It is one of those immense changes which make life look most like a passing drama . In one hour he is in the midst of a gay , crowded , roaring city , surrounded by the scenes of his youth and boyhood , and beholding only the horizon , which has , till now , bounded his existence within a narrow circle ; the next he is abroad on the eternal ocean . All the objects of his love , all the shapes familiar to him , have passed away , and who can say whether he will ever see them again ? As the last point of land , a dim shape of blue , melted into the air under Harry 's thoughtful gaze , he was assailed by various serious and some tender reflections . How long should he be absent ? What changes might take place before his return ? Might he not leave his bones in a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike some of those beloved objects , and might he not come back , after years ' wandering , to find seats empty in the home circle ? If fate had decreed it so , which one was it he was destined never to see again ? The last look , the pale face , the anguish , and trembling agitation of Fanny Elton at the moment of parting , he felt could never , never fade from his memory ; and he felt , also , that , but for the certainty he had acquired from her own rejection of him , and from Emmerson 's statement , he was a monster to part from her so coldly . All the hopes once cherished respecting her , her beautiful and noble form and face , her easy and graceful manners , the numerous tokens of love he had received from her at various times , all came thronging together upon his memory , and affected him again with the inexpressible , sweet , and yet painful idea that her alienation was the result of an error . It is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on the stern of the now fast-advancing ship , and saw the last point of blue cloud which marked the spot of all his love , and where so many hearts beat with love for him , an irrepressible tendency to moisture obliged him to keep his eyes for some time longer than he should otherwise have done , away from the observation of his fellow-passengers . These tender emotions were , however , soon lost in those with which father Neptune delights to agitate inexperienced intruders into his watery domain . It was not till after the expiration of several days that his health and appetite returned ; when they did , he felt that , if the horrors of suffering had been great , they were more than compensated by the pleasures of convalescence . His spirits were never lighter or his thoughts clearer . To the natural elasticity of youth were added the anticipations and excitement consequent upon his voyage . For some time these occupied his mind almost exclusively , in a manner of which a European can form but a faint idea . The abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to one quitting the former for the first time , is , perhaps , the nearest approach to enchantment ever granted to a mortal . Let the European be indulgent when he remarks the amazement , bewilderment , and enthusiasm of the newly-arrived American . The poor fellow is in a dream , looking on what have always been to him mere ideal forms , now suddenly conjured up around him in shapes of still only half-credited reality . London and Paris have hitherto been mere sublime visions of his imagination side by side with ancient Rome , Babylon , Thebes , or Jerusalem . The town of Louis Philippe or Queen Victoria is as astounding a spectre to him as that of Pilate or Pharaoh , and when he first gazes on Peel , or Moore , or Wordsworth , or Wellington , the delightful novelty would scarcely seem greater were he to discover among these celebrated personages Shakspeare , Csar , Pericles , or old Homer . For some time these reflections formed the subject of our young traveller 's reveries , but by-and-by his mind reverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , to his happy family circle , the well-known rooms , the loved voices , the familiar forms already beginning to be hallowed by time and distance . Among them his fancy distinguished Miss Elton with new and strange emotions . Despite all the proofs he had of her frivolous and capricious character , there were certain words and looks which remained printed on his memory . Her image no more came to him as a coquette , but arrayed in all the charms of tender fidelity and patient sadness . He was beginning to count over , with the solitary delight of a miser , each look and word of hers , when , recollecting he had proof positive from Emmerson that she was but a trifler , he refused to follow the subject farther , and resolved ( not for the first time ! ) to think of her no more . At last he recollected the promise he had given his mother to read the other volumes with which her affectionate piety had supplied him . " What time so proper as the present ? " thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be sure , I had rather study something a little more profitable and interesting , and more immediately in connexion with the countries I 'm going to see ; but , once ashore , I shall have no more time or inclination to wade through the Bible . Here , at least , we have plenty of time . " So he went down , and , taking out the volume in which were inscribed the words , " To Henry Lennox , from his affectionate mother  --  Be not wise in your own conceit , ' " he commenced it with a sturdy determination to devote a large portion of every day until he should complete it . He accordingly set himself seriously to the performance of this resolution . He felt a certain consciousness of embarrassment and shame when any of his fellow-passengers walking near him discovered what he was reading . " They 'll take me for a Methodist parson , I suppose , " said he to himself ; " but no matter ! I do n't mind their opinions , and I quite agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity  --  as an accomplishment even  --  the book ought to be read by every gentleman . " For some days he read steadily on . The weather happened to be calm and pleasant , and he pursued his task with unremitting assiduity . He was habitually a rapid reader , and , once fairly engaged , he made great progress . In a week he had finished the Old Testament , and got far into the second evangelist . " You pursue your studies with great diligence , " said a voice to him , one afternoon , as he was absorbed in his labour . The person who addressed him was a gentleman of about fifty , of a pleasing and dignified exterior , whom Harry had previously remarked accompanied by a young lady of a more than prepossessing appearance . " Oh , I am  --  I was going to say , performing a wager . I mean , I am fulfilling an injunction in giving the Bible the benefit of a continuous perusal . " " You do not read from the attractions you yourself find there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find some parts of it more interesting than I could have supposed . " " Really , " rejoined the stranger , with a smile , " you must think that very odd . " " Oh , no , I do n't , " replied Harry . " In the first place , any resolute employment is a protection against ennui , which , with sea-sickness , is the fashionable malady on board a ship , you know . " " May I ask , without boldness , who has enjoined this task upon you ? " " My mother . " " She is a believer then ? " " Oh , yes ; she believes it all . " " And you do not ? " Harry paused and looked his interrogator in the face , uncertain whether to be pleased or offended at his freedom . There was something , however , in his countenance and manner so benevolent and intelligent that he replied with frankness . " I do n't think any man of sense can believe it literally ; it is rather too heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as a literary production ? " " Yes ; some scenes are dramatic and some descriptions poetic . It is a curious  --  a very curious book . Did you ever take the trouble to read it through continuously ? " " Yes , I have read it quite through ; but I fear I interrupt you . " Harry returned his polite salutation , and resumed his reading . In two weeks he finished it , and closed the volume with a sigh of fatigue . " Well , it 's done at last , " thought he ; " I really had no idea I could get through with it in so short a time ; I had always a fancy , somehow or other , that reading the Bible was a work of years , and , consequently , postponed it to some indefinite period of sickness , confinement , or old age . Now it 's done , and , thank Heaven , it 's off my mind . I hope my poor , dear mother will be satisfied . " Thus was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his " poor mother " hoped such a perusal would send into his mind . He had read a curious historical monument of ancient credulity , palmed upon mankind when there was no press , and descended to the present time in some odd way , which he remembered Gibbon had admirably explained , though he did not recall exactly how . So far from having become any more inclined to believe , he was ten times more confirmed in his incredulity . He had forgotten much of the Bible . Some of it he never had read , and was entirely unacquainted with , and , truth to say , he could conceive nothing less probable , less believable , than the principal parts of both the Old and New Testaments . The supernatural events were so glaringly fabulous , and the historical ones so infinitely removed from inspiration  --  so darkened with blood , crime , ignorance , and superstition , that the only reflection it raised in his mind was wonder how it could all be received , in the present enlightened age , as the faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be forever rising to it , and how it came that those sensible , brave fellows who had honestly written against it should rest under an odium . In this mood of mind he took up Newton on the Prophecies , and fell fairly asleep a dozen times before he reached the welcome " finis . " Here was another mystery  --  a real unsolvable problem . Did Newton believe in what he has displayed so much learning at attempting to prove ? If yes , by what extraordinary hallucination of intellect  --  by what unimaginable train of reasoning had he formed his opinion ? If no , why had he lent himself with such apparent earnestness to a fraud  --  a pious one , perhaps , but still a palpable fraud ? There was something despicable , he found , in such an enterprise . He must have been , then , either a block-head or a charlatan . From Newton on the Prophecies he went to Butler 's Analogy . But he was now tired of following an ungrateful subject , and could not accompany this author through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and severe . Besides , he was already convinced that Butler was attempting to establish the truth of an impossibility . He might certainly do this with more or less acuteness and logic . A skilful lawyer may throw a wonderful plausibility around a bad cause , particularly if he believe it to be a just one , and an enthusiastic mind may be led by sophistry to believe anything . He therefore read on with his eyes , but not with his reason . His mind , too , began to be crowded again with briliant images of Europe , or with soft recollections of home , or of Miss Elton . He would read  --  that he had promised to do  --  page after page , but he aroused himself at the end of each chapter to a weary conviction , that , instead of accompanying the author through his abstruse , complicated arguments , he had been , in imagination , leading Miss Elton down the road from Rose Hill to the landing-place , or bidding her good-by with affected indifference , while his heart thrilled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , good-by ! God bless you ! " In short , he laid by the volumes of which thus , according to his promise , he had read every word , with a renewed conviction that Christianity was a mere Eastern fable . He had not even seen any beauty in it ; he had not felt any moral power . The mysterious person to whom all tends , and from whom all flows , was no more , in his eyes , than a historical character , extraordinary only from the notice subsequently taken of him . If before he had disbelieved from instinct , he now conceived himself entitled to reject upon more rational grounds . He had examined , and remained unconvinced . He acknowledged himself a Deist , and , true to his impatient and decisive character , from Deism he stepped to Atheism . If there were no God , of course there was no hereafter . Thus , in the mind of youthful philosophers , are disposed of these grave questions . CHAPTER XVI . Harry had scarcely made any observations on his fellow-passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studies . He exchanged with them the ordinary courtesies of the day , but had experienced no desire to cultivate the acquaintance of any , with the exception of the familiar and kind stranger , Mr. Rivington and his daughter . Several casual occurrences brought them more together , and , on a nearer view and better acquaintance , he perceived that they were particularly agreeable , and that the young lady was a very charming girl in mind and manners . She had not appeared to him , at first , beautiful , but , while conversing , he perceived a certain loveliness dwelt in her countenance , which , as if a quality of her soul as well as of her features , seemed to increase in proportion as the conversation grew animated and interesting . There was in her a mixture of frankness and modesty , of self-possession , and yet of reserve , which at first attracted his attention , and then captivated his taste . On seeing yet more of her , he found that nature had not been less bountiful in the solid qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made her so engaging . One day a death occurred on board , the little son of a poor Englishman , who , with his wife and three children , had emigrated several years before to America , been unsuccessful , and was now returning in the steerage to his native country . The small body was the next morning sewed up in a piece of sail and shoved off into the sea . The burial service was read by Mr. Rivington . The mother stood by without a word , and heard the plunge of her child into the waves . It was painful to conjecture , by the deadly paleness of her face and the expression of her features , what emotions filled her soul . The circumstance drew the attention of Harry to the family . Fearing , from their appearance , that they were but ill provided with the necessaries of life , he offered to supply their wants , but found Mr. Rivington and his daughter had already anticipated him . It was by and by discovered that another child was ill , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers a physician , who called himself Dr. Mason . Mr. Rivington politely informed him of the illness of the second child and the distress of the family . " Pray , doctor , see her at once . " " Not I , " was the answer . " No ? " " Certainly not , " and , taking out a fire-box , he lighted a cigar . " I do n't consider myself on duty at present , and a contagious disorder . I do n't deem it necessary to expose myself , and the other cabin passengers too . " " I will cheerfully compensate you , " remarked Mr. Rivington , mildly , after a pause . " Oh , d  --  n it ! that 's not it . " " But it seems to me , my good sir , " resumed Mr. Rivington , more gravely , " if duty did not urge you , humanity  --  " " Of that , " replied the doctor , coolly , " I must be the best judge . " " My daughter has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rivington . " But Dr. Mason is not your daughter , " interrupted Mr. Barnett , a tall , ugly-looking young gentleman of one or two-and-twenty , and a great ally of the doctor in smoking , drinking , and backgammon . A few days after , despite the assiduous attentions of Mr. and Miss Rivington , and Harry , the little sufferer also died . The same funeral ceremony was gone through with . The mother heard the same plunge , with the same pale , silent face , while the father , in a distant part of the ship , sat alone , leaning his head on his hands . Harry 's soul was struck with deep compassion . He had watched the little drama with interest , and , ardent in his feelings , he at once formed a strong and tender attachment for Rivington and his daughter , and at the same time conceived a lively indignation , mingled with a disgust which he scarcely made any effort to conceal , against Dr. Mason . At length the poor mother became ill  --  too much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of her misery to overflowing , the third and last child , a very pretty boy three years old , was attacked with the same disorder which had carried off his brother and sister . Miss Rivington determined to descend into the dark and filthy hole where the poor sufferers lay , but she was met by Harry , who gently but firmly refused her admittance . " I have been below , " he said . " The child must die . I do n't think the poor mother will . For her sake , one might almost wish she might . Her only ailment is grief , and that does its work slowly . I will see that the little creature has all the attention possible . " " Is the father below ? " " Poor fellow ! yes , but completely prostrated with despair . " " I think , Mr. Lennox , I had better go down . " " No ; I positively interpose force . I will not permit your daughter , sir , to expose herself to any more danger . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , but , while he exists , suffer me to be his nurse . The exposure of one person is necessary , of two would be useless and imprudent . You and your daughter attended the last : now it is my turn . " Mr. Rivington shook him warmly by the hand . In the evening , as he had predicted , the boy died . This time the mother was too weak to witness the third ceremony , which left her childless . The father retired , as before , to a distant part of the deck , and covered his ears with his hands , as if to shut out the sound of the fatal plunge . In pity to the bereaved mother , Harry spent some time below with her . She spoke with him freely , and even cheerfully . " You do not seem , my good woman , " remarked he one day , when they had been speaking of her bereaved state  --  " you do not seem to be as much prostrated by your loss as I feared you would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in silence . " I feel , but I do not yield to my feelings generally . Whom He loveth , He chasteneth . I am in his hands . My children are removed , I doubt not wisely , from a cruel world , where I had little power to protect or make them happy . They are in heaven , where I hope to meet them soon . Their sufferings are over . The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away : blessed be the name of the Lord . " Harry felt as if he could have shrugged his shoulders , but he contented himself with the reflection that her trust in the Lord had been but poorly answered . " I would not be ungrateful for the blessings left me , " added the woman . " Blessings ? " echoed Harry , looking around upon the wretched den , which he could not remain in a moment without a sensation of disgust , and then upon the emaciated form and face , the ragged clothes of the poor woman . " Blessings ? what blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand upon her bosom , " and here . " She produced from under her pillow a small Bible . Harry took it and turned over the leaves . They appeared worn and almost ready to fall to pieces by the constant use of years , but it was obviously in a state of the most perfect cleanliness and preservation possible . " You love to read your Bible , then ? " " I hope so : I should be very ungrateful if I did not ; for it has consoled and supported me through many a long year of suffering . My story is rather a sad one , but the more sad the life , the more clear appears the divine power of that book . I have often thought it is like the stars , which , the blacker the night is , look more bright . " " You have not always been in your present impoverished state ? " inquired Harry , becoming interested . " Your language and thoughts imply education and reflection . " " Oh yes , sir , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think those in our class have not thoughts and feelings like them ; and when they find we have , and when they hear us utter them , they are as surprised as if a dumb man should speak . " " There is a good deal of sad truth in that . But where did you learn to express yourself so well ? " " If I express myself better than others of my condition , it is because I have been more diligent in studying my Bible . It has been education as well as happiness to me . It has , moreover , taught me how to live , and , I hope , how to die . The loss of my sweet children , in one sense , makes me happy , and I bend to the judgment of God with more patience than others might . Those children were so dear to me  --  they were all of them so sweet , so pretty  --  so  --  " Here she stopped and wept again . " My mind was always disturbed with apprehensions about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they bound my soul to earth . Now I never can suffer anything more this side the grave which will disturb my peace . A few more years , perhaps days , and I shall join them . All our troubles will then be at an end . I look upon my own death as a desirable and even happy change . How can I , then , yield to grief for them ? " " The Bible , " thought Harry , " is certainly useful in such a case as this . What would this sick , childless , friendless woman be without some such consolation ? True or false , earthly or divine , the Bible has its use . It is not , as I once thought , a mere collection of absurdities . It has a task in the world , as much as air or medicine . It performs an appointed duty . It is like the sunshine , which warms the unclothed and houseless , which shines with its blessed light into the cottage as into the palace . " Thus a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference rose in his heart . He regarded it as he would have beheld some notorious quack doctor actually perform a remarkable cure . True , it might be by acting on the imagination of the patient , but he who can cure the ills of life in any way , can not justly be passed over with contempt . He related the conversation to Mr. and Miss Rivington , with whom he had now become much better acquainted , and who appeared to return his obvious friendship with one as sincere . He expressed his astonishment and admiration at the " philosophy of the woman . " " I can conceive that , as the keenest anguish of life may arise from the severing of affections , the mother 's grief for the loss of her child must approach nearest to the inconsolable ; but three children , one after the other , torn from her in that way : it is enough to crush the heart of Socrates or Zeno , and yet she seems actually happier than she was before . " " This is not philosophy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , philosophy embellished by fancy and strengthened by superstition ! " answered Harry . " I perceived some time ago , " observed Mr. Rivington , " that , while Providence has blessed you with a heart capable of feeling all the necessity of religion , you have not yet become aware of its truth . " Harry looked at Miss Rivington with a certain embarrassment . " Oh , you need not mind Helen . She has made the subject a study , and will not be any more frightened at your open acknowledgment of infidelity than a good physician at the confessions of a sick patient . " " I could hope Miss Rivington might pardon me , " said Harry , " for acknowledging my own deficiency . " " You mean by that , boasting of your own superiority , " said Miss Rivington , smiling . " I should not pardon myself , " continued he , " were I to expose her to the contagion of bad example . " " If it were not , " said Mr. Rivington , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you try the effect of your example on her . The contagion could not take . You have not an argument or an impression which she could not confute to her and your own satisfaction . Pray confess what you like . It will , perhaps , prove the first step to reformation . " " Well , then , " said Harry , frankly , " I confess at once , that the only mystery in religion to me is , that any one of education and sense can be found to believe it . " " You have not examined the subject ? " " Oh yes , I have , carefully , and believed less after the examination than I did before . " " You did not come to the task with the proper spirit , " observed Miss Rivington . " Ah , that is the way the advocates of Christianity defend their cause . First it is , you have never examined it ; then , you did not examine in the proper spirit . And pray define to me what sort of spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to believe black is white . " " My father can perhaps explain , " said Miss Rivington . " No , " said her father ; " it would be like explaining what light is to a blind man . Life will explain it as it rolls on over your head . Death will explain it when the spectre appears to you . Sorrow and sickness , should you suffer them ( and you can scarcely go through the world without doing so ) , will shed upon you that spirit . " " Mysticism , transcendentalism , and all the isms , " said Harry , laughing , " ca n't have any more incomprehensibleism than this . What can a fit of the gout have to do with an opinion on the subject ? You place a sum in arithmetic before me , and tell me twice two make five . I do n't believe it . You accuse me of not examining . Well , I do examine , and find two and two make four . Then my spirit is not yet prepared . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till I get very ill ( and imbecile , perhaps ) ; then you come to me with your arithmetic , and I tell you , perhaps , two and two make five , or twenty , if you will , and believe it , perhaps , simply because my feelings predominate over my reason : and yet , after all , two and two do make four . " " I never debate on religion , " said Rivington , gravely , " because a debate is a struggle for victory , not a search after truth . Only do not deceive yourself with the idea that you have examined the evidences of Christianity . If Heaven spare your life , you will one day feel the want of religion . With the want will come the spirit , and then you will understand me . " Harry was silent before the mild dogmatism of the amiable enthusiasts . He shrugged his shoulders while alone he paced the deck late that evening to enjoy his cigar . " Thus it is , " he thought , " that education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twig is bent the tree 's inclined . ' Had this amiable person been educated to believe theft and murder justifiable , he would still retain the opinion . Had he been taught that Mohammed was the true God , he would tremble and bow at the name of Mohammed . Hence , through the wonder-working power of education , a Galilean peasant , executed for disturbing the public peace , becomes a divine being , and receives the worship of the same intelligent mind which would think adoration paid to Mars or Minerva utterly ridiculous . " " And what do I believe ? " he added , gloomily , after a long pause . " That this world has ever been what it is , will ever remain what it is . If God may be eternal and from eternity , why may not the world ? If God made himself , why may not Nature have done the same ? What , then , is man ? an insect ! an accident ! Where have gone those dead children ? Into the deep , to the fishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duped mother , who thinks she will meet them again beside summer streams and amid perennial groves  --  she is a fool ! and there is no real difference between Rivington and Barnett , between Miss Rivington and Dr. Mason . One is as good as the other . Yes , this lovely being , so fair , so gentle , so self-sacrificing , has no real , only an abstract , temporary superiority over this selfish , cowardly Mason . I ought to respect one as much as the other . Certainly , to the eye of philosophy , they are the same . A rose is sweeter , but not more innocent , than a thistle . God , that is , Nature , made them both , and hereafter they will go together to the dust . The difference between them will not exist after death . The admiration I feel for the one , the disgust towards the other , is a weakness . Strange world ! But as it is , it is ! " And with a cold and barren heart , the young infidel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses , and strove to turn from truth and nature into paradoxes and follies , which he called reason and philosophy : strove , and for the time succeeded , for to his youthful fancy life seemed endless , and he was surrounded by all that could make it gay and happy . Memory brought him scarcely a care , and hope pointed to joys which filled him with delight . He was rich , handsome , young , gifted , absorbed by this world , its proud plans and graceful pleasures and virtues . He was satisfied with infidelity , because he felt no need of God or religion . He had resources enough without them . His happiness was his misery ; his hopes were his despair . He was like some traveller carrying a torch , whose smoky and lurid light prevents his beholding the moon and the stars , the order and harmony of the universe , and the hand that created and sustains it . CHAPTER XVII . In the mean time the great ship had ploughed her way , rushing and thundering on , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaning , shrieking , and trembling beneath a tempest ; now advancing regularly and majestically over the blue deep , now becalmed and abandoned to the heaving , glaring flood , in a very disagreeable state of inactivity . For the want of other excitement , Dr. Mason and Mr. Barnett had undertaken to amuse themselves lately by quizzing Mr. Seers , a young , modest , and rather shabbily-dressed man , who had been sea-sick nearly the whole time till within a few days , who scarcely ever opened his mouth , and never without blushing , and who turned out to be a Methodist clergyman travelling to regain his health . A slight attempt had been made to pursue the same course towards Harry , but they were speedily satisfied that , however gay he might naturally be , he was not exactly the man to stand much quizzing from them . Their facetious humour , therefore , sought a less dangerous object . On the health of Mr. Seers being sufficiently re-established for the purpose , it was proposed by some one , the day being Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voyage , that he should perform a religious service . Every one acquiesced , and the company were assembled accordingly . The service commenced with a prayer , which , though not long , was fervid and eloquent , without in the least offending against the coolest Episcopalian taste . The bashful hesitation of the speaker disappeared as he proceeded , and Harry listened to his strong devotional language with an interest for which he could not account . Becoming accustomed , as he grew older , to analyze his feelings , he asked himself whence came his emotion . He did not believe the young preacher was right in his creed , or that the Creator , if , indeed , there were one , of the infinite system of things , cared or knew what was said or done in the globe itself , which , compared with the whole universe , is so inconceivably insignificant , far less what a few individuals were doing in an obscure spot of the globe ; yet , what was it which , during the earnest prayer , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmed his thoughts , elevated and broadened his mind , and thrilled his soul ? He ascribed it partly to a reawakening in him of early religious associations , dim , sweet , tender visions of those years when he also had folded his little hands , and on his bended knees offered up thanks and prayers to the Creator at his mother 's knee . Partly , too , he perceived in the picture before him something strikingly poetic and sublime . There was no God ; there was , at least , no revelation from him except through the ordinary course of nature , but it raised in his mind the reflection of what a different scene the earth would be , what a different thing life would be , if there were a God made manifest ; if the mysterious and celebrated being who rose from the lowly condition of a Galilean peasant , an untravelled , uneducated Jew , a Roman slave , were really an incarnation of the Divinity , descended to walk with man as an example , a guide , and a star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy child . He was not a believer , but he was beginning to be a thinker . The grand fabric of Christianity rose before him at a distance , and he was beginning to look at it , and the form of Jesus began to appear to him , amid the crowd of historical characters , as a remarkable one ; remarkable from the purpose he had adopted , from the effects he had produced . Various questions concerning him began to rise in his mind , to arouse and awaken his curiosity . Had he really lived ? Was there such a person as Jesus at all ? If not , the wonder was not less striking , that such a character should have formed itself in the human imagination , and glided into the credulity of so many ages and countries ; or had the sublime structure of Christianity been raised upon the life of a real personage , only altered by the Oriental mind at a superstitious period ? Still , the wonder continued , for how came the cold science of modern times to receive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what a fable ! and by how many millions received as the most sacred of truths ! Beside him sat the bereaved mother . He could not without emotion behold her , as she listened to the glorious visions of the speaker , who represented this world , and its cares and pleasures , as so insignificant compared with the mansions of bliss prepared for mortals in another and better one . The unfortunate woman listened with eager devotion , and although tears were on her cheeks , they were obviously tears of joy . She was drinking in from the lips of her spiritual teacher , not only consolation , but triumph . Although her hopes might be but illusions , yet , in her case , the grave was deprived of its victory and death of his sting . At this picture , Harry felt with singular force what a sublime , what a magnificent thing life would be if religion were true ! if there were a God to superinted , to guide , to reward ; if death , the remorseless , resistless tyrant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of probation and preparation . For the first time in his life , the meaning of his mother 's exalted enthusiasm respecting Christianity began to break upon his comprehension . He believed , not that it was or could be true , but he saw , if it were true , how glorious it would be . Thus , for his mind was pure and his heart good , his humanity towards and his sympathy for this poor woman awoke in him the first conception of spiritual light . In the midst of the sermon and of Harry 's reflections , Doctor Mason and Barnett fell into a fit of laughing . For some moments they appeared willing to suppress it , but , at length , finding it not easily done , they leaned forward their faces on their hands , and continued to indulge in a mirth so noisy as not only to greatly disturb the little congregation , but at length to render the speaker 's continuing impossible . The young clergyman stopped , waited a few moments , resumed , stopped again , unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the impiety of the interruption . This only made the offenders laugh louder , upon which the clergyman , with dignity and firmness , requested that they would leave the cabin , or he should not proceed with the service . " I shall certainly not leave the cabin , " said Barnett . " I have paid my passage ; I have as much right here as another . My consent was not requested to have the service here , and no man has a right to convert my house into a church , any more than I have a right to turn a church into a theatre . " " I shall send for the captain , " said Mr. Seers . " The captain 's business is with his ship , not with me , " replied Barnett . " Then I must desist , " said the clergyman , mildly . " My good friends , " remarked Mr. Rivington , " the occasion seems to warrant the interference of your fellow-passengers . " " Indeed ! " " At least of the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " If the captain or any one else , " cried Mason , " attempts to prohibit a man 's laughing at what amuses him in the cabin of a packet ship , where he has paid his passage , he will find himself in the wrong box . " " I quite agree with you , " replied Rivington , with perfect forbearance ; " and , rather than promote any difference , we are so near the land , I think , sir ( to the clergyman ) , you had better desist . " This circumstance rendered the doctor and his friend extremely ashamed and indignant , but , at the same time , more bold . They now took pains to annoy the rest on all possible occasions , playing whist and backgammon with loud oaths , and in as noisy and reckless a way as possible . The captain was vexed , but , being a mild man , and the voyage nearly concluded , he begged the company to bear it as well as they could . One day Mr. Seers was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to meet him . Mason stood by with a curious expression on his face . It was after dinner , where , as no deduction was made in passage money for those who did not take wine , these two gentlemen had at command the whole stock of the ship , into which they appeared regularly every day desirous of making as great an inroad as possible . Harry was standing by , and watched the manoeuvre with considerable interest . It struck him , from the manner of the young bully , that he had the intention to offer an insult , although he could scarcely have expected to pick a quarrel with the most inoffensive and amiable of human beings . The proceeding continued with a more and more definite approach to a crisis . At each turn Barnett gave less way , till , at length , Mr. Seers , who did not seem to understand the spirit of the thing , and who had kept yielding more and more place as he was pressed upon more rudely , not supposing it necessary to go entirely out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder of Barnett as to throw him aside with some violence . " Mr. Barnett ! " exclaimed he , with mild amazement . " Get out of the way , then , ca n't you ? " cried Barnett , coarsely . " You do n't expect people to give you up the cabin and the deck too , do you ? " " I expect nothing from you , sir , " said Mr. Seers , with a flush of indignation , " which a gentleman would require or a gentleman bestow . " " What do you mean by that ? " demanded Barnett , coming close up to him with a clinched fist held threateningly just behind him . " I can have but one meaning , " replied Seers , folding his arms . " You would n't dare to brave me so , " cried Barnett , with a contemptuous laugh , " if you did not feel safe in your insignificance and helplessness . " " If I am insignificant and helpless , " rejoined Mr. Seers , " why does Mr. Barnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's good ! " interrupted Mr. Rivington , emphatically , " and you deserve it , young man . " " Pray keep your opinions to yourself , sir , " retorted Barnett , in an under voice , for there was something in Mr. Rivington 's figure and countenance which inspired respect as well as fear . " Oh , my lad , " said Rivington , with a quiet smile , " you have the power to prevent religious worship in the cabin , but not to prohibit conversation on deck , I believe . " " Who wants to prevent conversation ? " demanded Barnett , fiercely ; " d  --  n me , sir , who are you ? and whom do you take me for ? " " I am a gentleman , very much disgusted with your bearing during this passage , and I take you to be an ill-educated boy , with a very weak understanding , and I should judge not a good heart , who knows what is due neither to himself nor to others . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't unsay that ! " exclaimed Barnett . " Then you 'll be d  --  d without a doubt , for I shall not unsay it . " " If you are a gentleman , sir  --  " " Oh , if , " retorted Rivington , laughing . " You are very polite to apply that celebrated little word to me . " " And why not , sir , pray ? " demanded Dr. Mason , coming to the support of his friend , with a swagger . " Because if supposes a doubt , " rejoined Mr. Rivington . " Respecting the claim of yourself and friend to the character of gentlemen , I hope you will agree with me there can be none . " " Certainly not , sir , certainly not , " cried Mason , not exactly knowing what it was he was agreeing to . Another laugh from various by-standers , who had collected in a circle , now made Mason almost as enraged as his comrade . " Are you presuming to quiz us , sir ? " demanded Barnett , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , " replied Rivington . " Why , damme , sir ! that 's an insult ! " said Barnett . " I meant it as one , " replied Rivington . " You dare not refuse to give me the satisfaction of a gentleman ! " " Oh , yes , I dare ; I dare refuse to give you anything that ca n't possibly belong to you ! " " Do I understand you to say , sir , " interrupted Dr. Mason , with a swagger , " that you decline meeting Mr. Barnett ? " " Of course I do , if possible , either as a friend or an enemy . " " Then , sir , " cried Barnett , with a swagger of importance and triumph , " I shall post you for a coward . " " Thank you ; it will save me the trouble of posting you for a fool ! " rejoined Rivington , laughing heartily and good-naturedly , and without at all altering his usual manner . A general laugh announced that the scene , so threatening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merriment , and appeared to overcome the young men with rage and shame . They sneaked away to plot some other better method of revenge than seemed procurable by their conversational abilities . It was very soon observed , however , that the several outrages they had committed with impunity , and particularly their discovery that the gentlemen on board would not fight them , added to their impudence and audacity . They strutted about the deck all day , making whispered remarks to each other , and then laughing aloud , smoking , drinking , and swearing , and intentionally annoying their fellow-passengers . They had now attacked both Mr. Seers and Rivington without any particular danger or inconvenience , for they were not persons to feel to their full extent the " whips and scorns " of superior wit . Harry had an idea he himself might be their next object . He had been delighted with the admirable manner in which Mr. Rivington had met their vulgar attacks . There was something in that gentleman 's age , appearance , and manners which rendered such a mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to be engaged in brawls and duels , at least with such characters . But Harry was young and hot , and he inwardly vowed to pursue a different course , should the least occasion present itself . CHAPTER XVIII . The voyage was now nearly completed . It had been , luckily , free from storms , and , generally speaking , favoured with pleasant weather , although long delayed by head winds , and sometimes by no wind at all . Harry grew more and more happy . When he thought of home and Fanny Elton , his mind shaded over sometimes with sadness , but he found it every day more easy to shake off this amiable weakness , and to forget Miss Elton he resolved to make the first purpose of his life . What , with the various incidents of the ship , the anticipations of soon seeing England , and the attachment , each day more strong and familiar , which had mutually arisen between him and the Rivingtons , he had scarcely found time to think of ennui . As to the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to love him also , and to enjoy a certain benevolent amusement in hearing his opinions , anticipations , and raptures about Europe . The approaching end of the voyage , and disembarcation at Portsmouth , and their return to the great , mighty , gigantic London , appeared to interest them less for themselves than for their pleasure in beholding the effect on him , as an old theatre-goer enjoys the amazement and delight of an intelligent child for the first time introduced into that magical scene , much more than he does the scene itself . The captain 's daily reckoning was now listened to with intense anxiety , and his announcement that they would make land that same day was received with a profound satisfaction , of which mere " land-lubbers " can have but a very feeble idea . The breakfast to-day was ominously fine , and the dinner appeared to have no object on earth except to throw the breakfast into the shade . Champage was added to the usual fare , and carried to a yet higher point the good-humour of the passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After dinner Mr. Rivington , having chatted as a man might with his son ( for there is nothing which creates so close an intimacy as a sea-voyage , between people of a kindred nature ) , had taken a seat and a book . Harry offered Miss Rivington his arm , and they began talking and pacing the deck . " I think you said that you had been but little in the United States , " remarked Harry , for he had long ago discovered his friends to be English . " My father has an estate in the West Indies . It required the presence of a confidential agent . My father was not very well . My health , also , was rather delicate , so he was advised by the physicians to give both himself and me the benefit of the voyage . It was our intention to have seen much of the United States , but he was called to London by business , and we were obliged to leave at once . We saw your sweet Hudson and magnificent Niagara , however . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , with all the frankness of a sea-friend in the last days of the voyage . " What should you think ? " asked she , smiling . " Well , let me see , " said Harry , thoughtfully , measuring with his eyes the quiet , noble form of the plainly-dressed but gentlemanly-looking person , who sat reading at a little distance . " A physician ? the army ? an author ? a lawyer ? a merchant ? " These guesses were replied to by a smiling negative on the part of Miss Rivington , who was greatly amused by them , and who at length said : " You must not think too badly of him when I confess that he is not anything . " " Is London your residence ? " " Sometimes . " " And sometimes the country . How delightful ! Do you know I look upon you with extreme curiosity , Miss Rivington , as one who has seen and knows London and England . " " And I look on you with equal interest , as one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person can have lived a whole lifetime , and occupied himself and been happy , and never seen London . I hope you will let us see you when we get home . " " If you will allow me to renew my acquaintance . " " Oh , say to continue , not renew , " said Miss Rivington , laughing ; " for it is not going to be broken off , I hope . " " What is a good hotel in London ? " inquired Harry . " Really , " replied Miss Rivington , " there are so many ; there are some rather expensive , but you have no wife , and do n't wish to dazzle . I should recommend L  --  ' s hotel , in Bond-street . " " It is in a good neighbourhood , at all events ! Bond-street is a term in the language for splendour and fashion . " " Oh dear , Bond-street is not splendid ; it is a very plain-looking street . You must n't have too high expectations . All London is plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must not expect the bright architecture and hanging gardens of Athens or Babylon . " " What I am most interested in seeing , " said Harry , " is your distinguished persons . We have heard all our lives of these great names , and we naturally wish to behold them . What should you say , now , if I possessed the ability to raise up before you any personage of history ? whom would you most like to see ? " " Napoleon , Dante , Shakspeare , and your own Washington . But I hope , if you really have such miraculous power , " she added , laughing , " you would not confine me to so few . " " Well , I feel , on entering London , as if I had acquired such a power ; and I shall be as much thrilled with curiosity and delight in first beholding Moore , Peel , Lyndhurst , Rogers , etc. , as you would be on having raised up before you , on the deck of this ship , Pontius Pilate or Pliny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth , I believe , " observed she . " Did you ever seen Moore ? " " I know him very well , " replied Miss Rivington . " I should have asked you if you knew him at once , but the simplicity of us Americans in coming abroad is to be borne in mind . The expression do you know Moore ? ' has in it something as extraordinary to me as do you know Nebuchadnezzar ? ' or have you seen Anacreon lately ? " ' At this moment , just from their after-dinner wine , Dr. Mason and Mr. Barnett came on deck , and began pacing to and fro so as to meet Harry and his companion at every turn . " Those interesting gentlemen ! ' said Miss Rivington : " I am really afraid of them since they got what the captain calls such a regular sitting down ' from my father . " " If I dare ask so much confidence in me , I beg you will not gratify them by going away . " And they continued their walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , till at length , although the young lady shrank perceptibly away from the contact , she received a by no means equivocal push with his shoulder . Harry 's quick blood mounted . He disengaged her from his arm , turned upon the offender , and knocked him down . He rose with a frightful oath , and rushed upon Harry , who coolly knocked him down again . A second time he rose , and , with desperate rage , leaped again on his foe , but stopped short on beholding his cool , stern attitude and flashing eyes . " Mason , come down stairs here , " he cried , and , pulling his friend violently along , they descended into the cabin , to do , no one could conjecture what . A general exclamation of the passengers applauded the course of Harry , who did not seem at all flustered by the circumstance . Mr. Rivington smiled , and , shaking him by the hand , said , " You 're a true John Bull , Mr. Lennox , and I 'm very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now pace the deck all day with my daughter , and they will not be impertinent again . But where 's the enemy ? " " I 'll tell you , " said Harry ; " they 're gone down stairs , probably , for pistols . " Miss Rivington turned pale . " Do n't be alarmed , Miss Rivington , either at their measures or mine . That they are bullies is plain enough , and as despicable cowards as ever breathed . Did you see him stop when he came up to me the second time , and quail when I looked at him ? He has gone down for pistols . I am a shot , however , such as is rarely seen . I venture to boast , because I can give you proofs of my skill . These men will never dare to proceed to extremities . They count on our contempt , on the interference of the captain , or the police when we land , etc. , etc. , etc . Let us be repaid for all the annoyance they have been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they really not back out before the matter goes so far , I shall exhibit to them evidence of my skill which will bring down their courage . " All agreed . The captain said he would not have any serious affair occur on board his ship , but he was so convinced they were a pair of cowardly poltroons , that he promised not to interfere . " Now , sir , " cried Mason , coming up with a note , " I have to request your perusal of this document , which requires you to name a friend . There , sir , put that in your pipe and smoke it . " Harry read the challenge , and immediately referred the bearer to Mr. Rivington . " You will be so good , " said Harry to the latter , " as to bring this affair to an immediate conclusion . " " I see no occasion for consultation , " remarked Mr. Rivington , gravely ; " your weapons , I suppose , are pistols ? " " Certainly ; and I have them ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Rivington , " and fire when I say three ; and the time of meeting ? " " The daybreak of the morning after our arrival at Portsmouth , " replied Mason ; " the very , very first morning , sir . " Barnett , who stood by and heard this colloquy , turned pale . " No , I can not then attend to it , " said Rivington . " I have an affair of the same kind in my hand on that day . " " Well , as soon as you possibly can , " said Barnett , unable to repress his relief . " You had better arrange this little matter here ? " " What , on board the ship ? " " Certainly ; now , this moment . " " Agreed ! " said Mason , firmly ; " I have no objections . " " Agreed ! " echoed Barnett , in a somewhat fainter voice . " Here are no policemen , " said Rivington , " no magistrates , and those impertinent meddlers . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the captain , " stammered Barnett , in vain endeavouring to keep up his swagger . " Oh , pray do n't mind me , " remarked the captain . " Well , gentlemen , " said Rivington , " it is arranged , then . You have pistols , I think you said , Mr. Barnett ? " " Y-y-yes  --  that is  --  no . My pistols are not ready for immediate use . They want cleaning and some repairs . " " Oh , I have pistols , " remarked Harry ; " I never travel without them , or part with them even when at home . My greatest pleasure is practising with them , which I have not failed in these ten years scarcely a day . I 'll go down and get them . " He went down , and presently reappeared with a box , which , on opening , presented , sure enough , a fine glittering pair of rather large duelling pistols , with the necessary appurtenances of powder and ball . " Captain , " said Harry , " put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used them since I left shore , my hand may be a little out . I can see a sensible difference in my aim if I neglect one day 's practice ; besides , they must be reloaded . " The captain ordered a plank , chalked a circle on it about as large as a man 's head , to which it bore a ludicrous resemblance from the provisional eyes , nose , and mouth , and a large quantity of outstanding hair with which it was adorned , and ordered a sailor to set it up in such a way as to permit its being fired at . " For Heaven 's sake ! " exclaimed Miss Rivington , turning a little pale , and putting her hands over her ears . " What , you ai n't afraid of pistols , ma'am , are you ? " asked Barnett , with a hysterical attempt at a composed laugh , which died away , however , utterly from his lengthened , ugly countenance , when Harry , at a good , long distance , and apparently without any effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which Barnett exhibited more sympathy than he had probably ever before felt for anything in his life . " Ah , ha ! " exclaimed Harry , in a business-like tone ; " let us try the other . " He discharged it accordingly , and again the ball struck the unfortunate head , while a murmur of real admiration became audible among the delighted spectators , too happy in having the monotony of a sea-voyage relieved by such a scene . To say that Barnett was pale as a sheet would be to pay most laundresses a compliment . " Load them , Rivington , will you ? " said Harry . " Damnation ! " cried Barnett . " Do you think to frighten me in this way ? But this is no time or place : the captain will not , I fear , permit us to proceed ; for I shall make this a damn bloody thing , I can tell you  --  damn me ! " " Oh ! " said the captain , " I have no more right to keep a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fighting a duel , if it amuses him , than I have to prevent his walking the deck or laughing in church ; I should be afraid of getting in the wrong box . A captain 's business is with his ship , you know . " " But before ladies ! " stammered Barnett . " Oh , do n't mind us , " said Miss Rivington . " Measure the ground , Rivington , " exclaimed Harry , impatiently . His friend took ten short paces , and marked the positions with a piece of chalk . " Time flies ! " said Harry , taking his pistol and his place . " Perhaps the ladies had better go down stairs , " said Rivington , with profound gravity . " No , we 'll retire into the round-house , " said Miss Rivington . " I will go so far as to say that it was merely accident that made me push against Miss Rivington , " exclaimed Barnett . " It was the rolling of the ship . " " Do n't make any apology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennox requests me to say that , if he survives this affair , he shall give Dr. Mason the pleasure of a shot with him ; if not , that honour will fall to me , " said Rivington , with a stern look . " I beg your pardon , Mr. Lennox , " cried Barnett , walking close up to him . " I can not massacre you in this way , when I feel myself to have been the aggressor , " and he suddenly discharged his pistol in the air . " I ca n't accept an apology , sir , " said Harry , firmly . " You must load again ! " At this moment the man at the mast cried out , " Land ahead ! " which the captain said was the Scilly Islands . " Never ! " cried Barnett . " At such a moment as this I can no longer entertain feelings of revenge or anger . You may fire at me if you will : I am not afraid of you , but I will not be frightened into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed Harry , " is no more than I expected , and equals your courage . I have always found that the most brave are the most generous . For sparing my life in this chivalric manner , your own feelings must be a sufficient reward ; if not , you must find the honour you will gain by this circumstance an ample compensation . " " Do n't mention it , I beg , " said Barnett , with a mock-heroic air , which infinitely amused the spectators . The scene , indeed , had been exquisite , and in its full breadth of caricature was so far beyond what could have been thought possible , that , while it reduced the two heroes to a most inimitable tone of quiet politeness , it carried the good humour of the rest of the company to its highest point . Harry gained " golden opinions from all sorts of people . " Captain , mates , crew , and passengers were enthusiastic in their admiration ; and as Master Barnett had not only received such lessons in his attempts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in another way , and as everybody saw in the exposed bully only an object of contempt and ridicule , it appeared to be universally understood , by tacit consent , that the tone of mock admiration assumed by Harry should be followed up . The poor devils , therefore , found themselves , during the rest of the period of their stay on board , quite amazed and bewildered by general tokens of exaggerated respect , which they knew not whether to consider real or ironical . Every one took off his hat to them with a sweeping , profound salutation . Everybody turned widely and ostentatiously out of their way . The ladies made them timid courtesies : the captain asked if everything on board the ship was to their liking . Never was a pair of braggarts honoured with such gratifying attention , and never did braggarts receive attentions with blushes more like those of modest merit , accidentally discovered and brought to light . At dinner everybody drank wine . The steward was ordered to serve them first . Their opinion was asked by everybody on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoax had not been put in operation at an earlier period . CHAPTER XIX . But now this happy voyage was over ; for happy it was to all but the sad mother and father , who , however , had found such substantial friends in Rivington and Lennox as were likely to guard them from future want . Harry was in a state of exquisite excitement , more like an enchanting dream than sober reality , and opened as his heart was by these novel and delicious sensations , he gave vent to his feelings in all the eloquence of his nature , to the constant admiration and amusement of his more quiet friends the Rivingtons . These amiable people took extreme delight in his freshness of character , his intelligence and nobleness of disposition , which could never appear to more advantage . With a sort of incredulous rapture , he beheld at last that little bit of blue , the first dim herald of the mighty old Europe . A fine breeze carried them swiftly along up the Channel , over water now smooth as a summer lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . The sky was bright , the air balmy . Everybody was animated . The very turkeys , and hens , and sheep , had a contented look ; the very cock began to reassume his magisterial bearing ( which , at one or two windy points of the passage , had been rather laid aside ! ) . Ah , what is there on this earth so delightful as the American 's first approach to England , his venerable and beloved mother ? If it may be said without irreverence , it more resembles the sensations of a blessed spirit which has just passed the dark valley of the shadow of death , and rises into the enchantment of a new and brighter existence . The limpid , idle water has lost all its terrors , and the threatening wind sinks from a sublime and despotic fiend into the softest and sweetest of playful angels , and weeds and branches are seen floating around , lately washed from the near shore , and Mother Carey 's chickens have long since disappeared with the flying froth of the tumbling billows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yet unseen European groves , and English and French porpoises are tumbling together in amity , and a delicious , sunshiny atmosphere of hope and happiness wafts onward the good ship , after all her dangers , over the surface of the beautiful and lucid sea . Now do you behold all sorts of vessels passing you outward bound , and fishing-smacks lie scattered around , and give a supply of fresh fish to add to breakfasts and suppers which already seem perfect , and the pilot , a silent , weather-beaten English face , comes on board with newspapers , and your bewildered and half-incredulous fellow-passengers , on learning that the breeze is fair for landing that very afternoon , appear newly clad in still more fine clothes , so that you scarcely know them . Everything speaks the end of the mighty traverse . The poor captain looks like an ex-monarch . He who was regarded at sea with such profound veneration , the oracle of that mysterious and awful world , now stands with his hands in his pantaloon 's pockets , unquestioned , uncared for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight as he beheld , at last , the soft , sweet shore close at his side , and heard the new ( and yet so old ! ) names of Dorset , Cornwall , Devonshire , Cowes , and Leamington , for they were gliding up to Portsmouth . Scenes , bright as if just from the easel , met his eyes . Old castles covered with ivy , antique towns , orchards and roads , gardens and hills , vales and creeks , peaceful cot and opulent palace , foliage and flowers , rock and hill , steeped in shadow and sunshine , all soft as a vision , all harmonious as music , all beautiful and pure as Heaven itself ; and the land odours were upon the air , and the land sounds came floating to his ear , the barking of a dog , the lowing of a cow , and the ringing of a bell . " Oh ! " exclaimed he , as Miss Rivington stood on one side of him and her father on the other , answering his questions , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was enjoying a rare sensation , perhaps granted only once or twice in a lifetime . " Oh , " cried he , while his handsome face was all lighted with soul , " this is ecstasy . This it is to travel ; and I have crossed the Atlantic ; I am looking on England ! England ! beautiful , merry , brave , time-worn , warlike , intellectual , immortal England ! " " Yes , there she is , " said Miss Rivington , and her own eyes , if not wet , were not quite dry ; " there 's my country . " " I protest , " said Harry , " that the spirits of the past seem hovering around me in the air and welcoming me to these renowned and hallowed shores . King and queen , fierce noble and unshrinking commoner , poet and statesman , orator and author , Shakspeare and Scott , Charles and Cromwell , Burke and Chatham , Elizabeth and Mary , the past and the present , all crowding together in my mind . Hail ! great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read rather wild on shore , they had no such appearance in the high-wrought excitement which reigned around him , nor did the Rivingtons see in them other than the manifestations of a clever , ingenuous , and very warm-hearted young man under circumstances well-calculated to awaken lively emotions . The ship at length came to anchor off the town of Portsmouth . The usual visit of the government officer was made , a pretty , yacht-like boat was sent by the packet agent to bring the passengers ashore , and Harry , with a thrill , at length placed his foot on English ground . His pleasure was a little dampened by the necessary separation from the Rivingtons , who said they had friends in Portsmouth , where they should first repair ; that they might possibly go up to London without delay . Rivington , on parting with him on the quay , shook him warmly by the hand . His daughter , who , without the least idea of love on either side , had learned to entertain for him a sincere friendship , did the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Rivington ; " come and see me when you get in town . " And so they parted . The doctor and his friend were not visible after landing . The unfortunate parents were not forgotten by Harry in his whirl of delightful sensations . He inquired particularly where they were going to put up , what their prospects were , and what they were going to do . He found he had been , however , anticipated by Rivington , who , besides a rather ample donation of glittering English gold , had given them his address in London , with a promise to do something for them . On their way up from the ship he requested them to stop with him into a book-store , where , remembering the scene in the steerage cabin , he bought a plain , well-printed Bible and prayer-book , and presented them to his unfortunate protege . With tears in their eyes , the poor people made him their parting salutations . " This Rivington is really a fine fellow , and a true Englishman , " said Harry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ship Hotel . " I wonder who he is ? " If anything on earth can be more delightful than the deck of a ship on approaching the end of a voyage , it is the wellfurnished , neat , and comfortable apartments of an English hotel : the different sort of meals you get from those on ship-board , the admirable attendance ; in short , everything you see , hear , taste , and feel . Harry had brought Mr. Seers up with him . That excellent young man , although he regarded him as a mere enthusiast , was so pure , sincere , and intelligent , that he could not have wished a more agreeable companion . They spent a day together at Portsmouth ; went to see Netley Abbey , and wandered round the town ; breakfasted , dined , and supped  --  at least , so it appeared to them  --  as if each had been the autocrat of all the Russias : the fine , fresh fruit , the very sweet butter , the uncommonly nice soles with shrimp sauce ( did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first-rate tea , milk , and beefsteaks . The fact is , so perfectly happy were they , that Harry spouted with Othello , " If it were now to die , ' T were now to be most happy ; for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute , That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate ; " while , to proceed no farther in their travels , but spend the rest of their lives happily at the Ship Hotel . Right heartily did they laugh over their voyage , and the glorious denouement of the little tragedy in which the two turkey-cocks , Mason and Barnett , had played such distinguished parts ; while sometimes their sunshine was shaded by the remembrance of the sad events which had deprived the poor emigrants of their family . At length it was agreed that they should start the next day for London on the outside of a stage-coach , with which both were well acquainted ( as who is not ? ) through the pen of the immortal Irving ( whose health they drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius ) . Harry retired to his room , to sleep for the first time in a foreign country ; but he could not sleep . The transcendent loveliness of the night , the cloudless sky , burning and glittering all over with stars , the only familiar objects which reminded him of home , the broad , full moon just opposite his window , slowly ascending up the hushed and magnificent heavens , and the soft air wafting into his apartment the land odours of which he had been so long deprived , disposed his mind for tender revery . He sat by the window , he knew not how long , lost in silent , sweet thought , fond dreams of the past and images of home mingling with vague , high aspirations of future bliss . Only the idea of Fanny Elton awakened a discord in the general harmony , which seemed to wrap earth , the heavens , and his own soul in one tranquil emotion of tender delight . " Ah , Fanny ! " he thought , " if to all this I could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard those scornful words , and if Emmerson himself had not told me what he did , at this delicious moment I would dismiss all doubt from my mind , and my happiness would be complete , full , perfect . Perhaps she now sits also in solitary thought ; perhaps she gazes on those flashing stars , that spotted moon . " And he gazed and gazed , lover-like , lost in a tide of soft associations . " It is nonsense , " at length he said : " it is but a boyish weakness . Years  --  travel will overcome it . In the mean time , let me enjoy myself . Her ungrateful and capricious conduct shall not prevent it . The world is bright before me . Who says it is not a happy one ? Whining moralists and lying priests . It is at least happy enough for me . I ask no better , want no other . I have health , wealth , an affectionate , merry home : I have before me the most brilliant tour possible . After a few dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sober duties and mature pleasures of a man , boyhood 's once sweet and tender dream of love . " As he spoke he perceived the sky had changed its appearance . The yellow moon had assumed a silver cast ; a new , pearly lustre had overspread the heavens , and the smaller of the but now glittering stars had disappeared , while the few large ones had paled their yellow beams . It was morning , which , in the far northern latitude of England , and at this period of mid-summer , is visible in the east almost before the radiance of the dying yesterday has faded from the western horizon . " Another day and another night ! Do they flow so quickly , and am I so far and to be so long separated from the still lovely , still beloved ? " CHAPTER XX . Notwithstanding his romantic night reveries , Harry was up , refreshed , and in scarcely repressible spirits , in time to partake with Seers of as good a breakfast as the most respectful of landlords could provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaired the agreeable state of his sensations . The day was again one of those preternaturally bright ones with which Nature blesses the foggy , " sea-girt isle " at this season , as if in compensation for her indifferent generosity during the rest of the year . The sky and atmosphere of Naples seemed transferred to the particular road over which the coach took its way with our hero , feeling more like a healthy , young Neman lion than a mere man ; and such a road , and such enthusiastic admiration as it inspired our two travellers with , and such questions as they asked the coachman , and such astonishment as the latter evinced to be asked such questions by Englishmen , and such still farther amazement as he was thrown into on discovering they were Americans , and such unaffected and highly gratifying compliments as he paid them on the " wery excellent manner in vich they spoke the English langvedge , " and such questions as he asked about Jerusalem when he found they were from the United States ! and such a famous lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart as Harry experienced as they approached London , and such an immense , endless , black , crowded , busy , stupendous sort of place as it seemed to be , and such glances as he cast around him to see any one who might be Moore , or Wellington , or the king ; and , in short , if the reader have any sort of experience in the composition of this sort of historical narrative , he must see at once that to describe it all is impossible . Besides , we are not quite certain we ought to tell the simple feelings which roll through the mind of a susceptible young Yankee on coming abroad for the first time . This , however , Harry himself was afterward heard to confess , that he was as much astonished on seeing Piccadilly and Hyde Park Corner , as the boy in the story was on being shown , for the first time , the useful and celebrated letter A ! A hackney-coach brought the two wanderers safe and sound to L  --  ' s Hotel in Bond-street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , somewhat to his disappointment , though he knew all the while how ridiculous it was , he did not see St. Paul 's , Drury Lane , Westminster Abbey , Windsor Palace , the Parliament House , the Tower , and the Monument all standing together in a row to be looked at , and in which , although he met many people , he did not see O'Connell , or Lord Byron , or Shakspeare , or Scott , or Lord Chatham , or Falstaff , or Richard the Third , did n't have his pockets picked , and did n't , in short , meet with any astounding adventures whatever . He then returned to the hotel to as nice a dinner as could possibly be prepared , and ate it , in company with Seers , with as nice an appetite as a reasonable man might wish to have . It would give us infinite pleasure to go on in this way , and describe each one of his sensations as the wonderful metropolis broke gradually upon him , what absurd American ideas were now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . But the fact is , he got through with several days in such a confused , exquisite sort of way that it would be difficult to render any coherent account . At the end of that time , however , he began to subside a little . He had graduated himself to the dimensions and peculiarities of the place he was in , and began to have a dim recollection that he lived in the nineteenth century , and that there were various personages mentioned in English history and literature who possibly might have other occupations than walking about the streets of London to be stared at by very green young Yankee travellers . Seers was to start for the Continent in a day or two , and before he went they both bethought them of their promise to their old , good-natured sea comrade , Rivington . Having hunted up his address , which Harry had taken in his pocketbook , and inquired the proper calling hour , they repaired to Grosvenor-street . The house was rather a stately one , and both the visiters fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dignified-looking man , in a plain livery , with powdered hair , opened the door , and to their query , if Mr. Rivington lived there , replied with an air of some surprise , but very respectfully , " The Earl of Rivington lives here . His lordship is at home . Shall I take your names ? " " The Earl of Rivington ! " echoed Harry . " His lordship ! " said Seers , stepping back . " Oh no , certainly not ; we have mistaken the house . " The servant waited with deference their ultimate conclusion . Seers was for going back at once , but Harry had a different idea . " Pray , has his lordship lately been absent from England ? " he inquired . " His lordship returned a few days ago from  --  ah ! perhaps , " continued the man , still more respectfully , " you are the two American gentlemen who came with his lordship from America ? " " Yes , yes , " replied Harry , not quite concealing his astonishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seers , blushing very much . " An earl ! bless me ! I have no desire to  --  " " No , let us go in , " said Harry . " You were expected , " said the servant , " some days ago . " The man led them to the broad stairs , where they were received by another , who conducted them through several lofty and richly-furnished rooms , into one which belonged to a side apartment . Here they were left a few moments alone , struck with the elegance and opulence of all they saw , and the beauty of various marble statues , and large and splendid paintings which adorned the walls . Seers , who had probably pursued a path of humble obscurity and simple poverty , scarcely dared sit on the deep fauteuils , but , after attempting one , rose with a new blush , and took a place on the edge of a large damask chair . Harry had seen luxury before , but he was rather curious to see how the distinguished nobleman , whom he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , would receive his humble travelling companions in their own character . " Why , Mr. Lennox , " whispered Seers , " is n't this an extraordinary adventure ? " " Yes , but a pleasant one . " " I do n't know , really ; I certainly had rather be well out of it . What if there be ladies with him ! " " Well , you 're not afraid of ladies , I hope ! " " But will he come in his own dress , just as usual , do you think ? or have earls any particular costume ? " " What ! cap and ostritch-feathers , and velvet robes , do you think , " said Harry , laughing , " like a stage nobleman ? " " At least , " said Seers , " it 's very embarrassing to feel such an immense difference between one man and another , to stand before a fellow-creature as if he were a  --  a  --  " " Pooh ! nonsense ! " " And to have people looking down upon you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mordecai the Jew at the king 's gate . When he was incog. he was , of course , very civil ; but now , I do n't believe he can be pleased to see such an humble man as I in his royal halls : I think I 'll go back . " " No , no , " said Harry , laughing , and holding him by the arm . " You sha n't stir a step . The Earl of Rivington is a gentleman , as you are , and a gentleman is the same in all countries and all ranks . He asked you to his house , and  --  hush , some one comes . " The door was opened , and the object of their fears entered with a rapid step and a delighted smile , and , taking the hand of each in succession , but first of Seers , in both of his , said : " I beg a thousand pardons for detaining you . I had a person with me . How do you do ? " " I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Seers , with the most unlimited blush he had ever been seen to produce . " I am , in short , your lordship  --  perfectly well . " " You have deceived us , " said Harry . " I was quite ignorant we were honoured with the acquaintance of the Earl of Rivington . " " I shall consider that title a misfortune if it make the least alteration in our friendship , " replied the earl . " But you are standing . Now , then , what have you been doing with yourself ? Where have you been ? Have you seen anything of London ? " " A part of it , " said Harry . " A part of it , my lord , " echoed Seers . " And how do you get on , Mr. Seers ? You look so well , if you left home in search of health , I hope you will not be obliged to go farther . " " Oh yes , my lord ; I am going to the Continent in a day or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of our famous little island . I have been expecting you several days . " " May I inquire after  --  after  --  " " My daughter ? Oh , she is getting on famously , and raves about her voyage . She 'll be delighted to see you , and will be here in a moment . She will not forget in a hurry the noble reply you made , Mr. Seers , to that sad fellow , Mr. Barnett . " Seers bowed and blushed , and got himself more at ease on the chair , which before he had scarcely touched . " Ah , there she is . Here are our friends at last , my dear . " " Are you not ashamed of yourselves , both of you ? " she said , giving her hand , with pleasure beaming from her face too plainly to be affected ; " we thought you had forgotten us . " " You have given us such a pretty romantic adventure , " said Harry , " that forgetfulness for the future is quite out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at L  --  ' s ; well , I must insist upon Mr. Seers putting off his departure for a few days . We must not let him go away without doing the honours of our Old England for him . You must come into the country for a week , and we must show you a little more of the town than mere passing strangers see  --  and  --  " " My lord , " said a servant , opening the door , " the Duke of G  --  . " Seers started and blushed again . " Two American friends , Mr. Lennox , Mr. Seers , " said the earl . " You 're just from America , I suppose ? " inquired the duke . " Yes , " said Harry ; " and I believe I have the honour of bringing you a letter of introduction . " " Delighted to meet you , " said the Duke of G  --  . And a light , laughing , lively conversation of several minutes ensued , in which both Harry and Seers were unconsciously made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much at their ease as when chatting on the deck of their old packet-ship . Harry , however , though fascinated , rose to go , and the earl said : " What ! you have already learned to be so careful of your time ? Well , off with you , then , if you are so wild ; but you must come dine with me next Saturday at six  --  both of you . " " With the greatest pleasure , " said Harry , while Seers blushed and bowed in speechless astonishment and delight at his previous fears of English aristocratic society . " And before I let you go , " added the earl , " I must have your promise to spend at least a week with me in the country , and to let me put you in the way of seeing something of the town . " The servant conducted them to the door , which was opened by another one with a bow , and the two young Americans , a few days after their arrival in London , found themselves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which so many millionaires sigh and strive in vain , and under the friendly and familiar protection of one who , without farther inquiries , they had no difficulty in perceiving , was one of the wealthiest and most distinguished noblemen of England , as , on inquiry , they learned he was . Seers was astounded . " Why , they 're delightful , superb people , " said he . " I never felt more at ease in the company of my most intimate friends . I 'm sure I never expected to be so sociable with a duke and an earl ! " CHAPTER XXI . On returning to the hotel Seers found a letter for him . He became pale as he saw it , for it was sealed with black . While reading it he trembled violently , sank into a chair , and burst into tears . Harry had learned to love this young man for his purity and gentleness , his warm heart and intelligent mind , which , though he was totally unacquainted with the world , was richly stored with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with feeling , while Seers wept in silence . " What is it , my dear friend ? " " My wife ! " murmured he . " We were all in all to each other . She gave up a little income of her own in order to enable me to come abroad . She refused to accompany me from motives of economy . I left her in perfect health , and now she 's dead  --  dead  --  dead ! " and he repeated the word , as if he had forgotten all other things in that tremendous idea . An interesting scene followed , in which Harry manifested the deepest sympathy and attempted to offer consolation . At length the poor fellow took his hand and said , " I thank you for your sympathy , Mr. Lennox ; but , for the present , leave me . " For a moment Harry hesitated , almost apprehensive lest the sudden and violent shock might lead to some act of desperation ; but , on looking at the face of his unfortunate friend , his streaming and upraised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not deprive him of , he felt ashamed of his suspicion , and still more ashamed of the manner in which he himself had met the first ( and , compared with the present affliction of Seers , how insignificant ! ) shock he had received from the displeasure of Miss Elton , when he for a moment proposed to terminate his existence . He went out , therefore , and , his heart swelling with compassion , left him alone . The whole of that day and the next Seers kept his chamber , refusing to receive even his friend . In the afternoon of the third day , however , he sent for Harry , and met him with a calm and even cheerful smile . A Bible lay open before him . " Well , my dear Mr. Lennox , it is over , " said he ; and , though his eyes were continually wet , he did not weep . " You would not believe me if I were to describe to you how calm , cheerful , and happy I am ; how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual and intellectual it has made me . I now possess two inexhaustible sources of delight , which , although they existed before , were not visible to me in their true value . One is the recollection of her , the spotless purity of her mind , the inexhaustible tenderness of her nature , and the angelic sweetness of her temper . From this , when it renders me too sad , I turn to the second . I paint the wished-for , happy moment when death shall relieve me from the cares and griefs of life , and I shall meet her once more , a radiant angel , never to be separated again . " Harry saw it relieved him to speak , and he , therefore , suffered him to go on without interruption . As he now raised his face , beaming with hope and pleasure , he addressed him with feeling and sincerity on the subject of his loss . " But , after all , " continued he , " notwithstanding your grief , how happy you are ! I have never lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not fancy what effect it would have on me . Should I ever suffer such a calamity , I shall think of you ; I shall do more  --  I shall envy you . " " Here , " said Seers , laying his hand on the Bible , " I find consolation for all grief , solution to all mystery , advice for every situation . You are an unbeliever ; but you will come to it one of these days . " Harry shook his head . " Indeed , I wish I could . " " Ah , my young friend , I once , like you , doubted , derided it all . Youth sees only the objections , of which there are some , apparently , unanswerable , I freely allow ; but the united arguments in its favour are infinitely more so . A subject so vast  --  a scheme which commenced with the globe , runs through all human history , and , embracing the creation , the universe , and man , passes over death , and comprehends the ultimate destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination of sublunary things . So vast a subject may be supposed to contain some discrepancies , or , at least , what may appear so to us . " Harry listened with respectful attention and interest . " What do you mean , " inquired he , " for I am very ignorant on this subject , by the scheme of Christianity extending from the beginning of the world ? Christianity is only eighteen hundred years old , is it not ? " " Have you ever examined the prophecies ? " " I have looked them over . " " Well ! you are but a young pupil ! but I 'll tell you what , " he added , cheerfully , " you shall go through a course of religious reading with me ; it will not , believe me , be either a dull or a sad task . We will look into the evidences of Christianity together . It will relieve me " ( and his eyes were full of tears while he spoke ) " from a weak indulgence of grief , and I venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I shall convert you into a Christian . " " Yes , but , " said Harry , " I have already examined ; I have read the Bible continuously through ; I have read Newton , Butler , and all that sort of thing . " " All that sort of thing ! " echoed Seers . " But an examination , by a mind in such a state as yours , unaided by one more experienced , is sometimes likely to do more harm than good . Let us do it together . Let us leave London together : accompany me on to Italy , for I have now less cause to return to America than I had before . We will read and study the whole subject together ; I will point out the way . It is the most important thing for you , for of what avail is it if a man gain the whole world and lose his own soul ? Oh , you will find more happiness in this than in any other thing . One day in his courts is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of your God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . You will then be able to say , when misfortune overtakes you , as it has now overtaken me  --  and it will overtake you  --  you can not expect to walk through this vale of tears unscathed  --  you will be able to say , as I do , Yea , the sparrow hath found her a house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , O Lord of hosts , my King and my God . " ' From whatever secret association , there was nothing which repelled Harry more than phrases quoted in conversation from the Scriptures . Strong in yet undisappointed hope and buoyant happiness , he felt a disagreeable impression from the sight of his friend 's sorrow , nor was he pleased with the prediction of evil to himself . He therefore only replied : " My good friend , you know I have come abroad to see Europe  --  not to study what I might better have studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine with the Earl of Rivington , to go into the country with him , to pay a visit to the Duke of G  --  , to do a thousand things . You , also , are engaged to the earl , you know . " " He will require no better apology for my absence from his table and from London , than the sad event which has struck me , and which you will please to tell him . I shall start for the Continent to-morrow . I was wrong to press you too far , perhaps . Your time will doubtless come . In the mean while , we must bid good-by now . You are now going to dine with the earl , and will be late out . I shall go early in the morning , and we shall not see each other again . " " Good-by , my friend . We shall meet , doubtless , once more , when , I trust , time will have softened your anguish . " " Time ! " said he : " I trust myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor Seers to his sad thoughts and spiritual consolations ; Harry to a scene of brilliant gayety and novel delight , which might well have dazzled an older person , and over his anticipations of which the light shadow caused by the grief and the prediction of Seers passed immediately away . Time and space will not allow our relating at full the experience of our hero as a man of pleasure and fashion : how he found himself at dinner after he left Seers , in the midst of the most distinguished society that one of his own fancies would have conjured up ; how every individual he sat by , when he heard him named , almost made him start ; how Moore sat opposite him , and Lord Brougham near , and Sir Robert Peel on one side , and Mr. Bulwer on the other ; and how the delightful young lady he had known as Miss Rivington smiled and whispered to him something about Pontius Pilate and Nebuchadnezzar , and how the earl was exactly like a father to him , and how much at ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what a charming person Lady Rivington was , and what plans were made for his future sight-seeing , and how he had another invitation to pass a week or two at the enchanting seat of Lord H  --  , and how he went home from this dinner , and stopped in at the king 's theatre to hear the most magnificent music in the world , and had the inexpressible pleasure of seeing Taglioni floating about the stage like a sylph , and how he did go out to the seat of his distinguished friend , though not before he had seen London pretty well and made some agreeable acquaintance , and how many letters he wrote to his father and Frank , describing all these fine things in the style of the Arabian Tales , and how anxious he was to have letters from home , and how he never had been , since his first birthday , one ten thousandth time so enchanted with life and this bright world . A poor time for the sad and spiritual Seers to ask him to leave London and all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave a nature as religion . Two weeks thus passed away , as time would naturally pass to such a young man , with such friends and under such circumstances . In the very midst of it all , when his sky was the most cloudless and his prospect the brightest , the news of the bloody and inexplicable duel  --  of Frank 's death  --  of his mother 's almost fatal illness , and of the grief and despair of the family , burst upon him like a thunderbolt . It was communicated in a letter from his father , but in a style so different from his usual gayety , that the manner shocked Harry almost as much as the matter . The letter was not long , but , after simply detailing the event , their horror and wonder , concluded by requesting him to remain abroad , as it was the advice of the physician and the intention of Mr. Lennox to bring his wife and Mary to Europe in the course of the autumn . Emmerson also strongly advised it , and offered , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the office till they should all return . But for this injunction , Harry , in his anguish , would have sailed for New-York in the next ship . The blow was almost too much for him . He staggered into his room on finishing the letter , blind with tears , stunned , and in an agony of horror and despair . He could not believe it . The last letter of Frank was lying on his table , fresh from his hand ; he could only exclaim , amid his bursting sobs , " Oh Frank , my brother ! my beloved brother ! shall I never see you more ! " Never was brother more tenderly beloved . In a moment all the splendid gayeties around him lost their charm . The sun seemed extinguished , Nature a dead blank , and the idea of future happiness utterly impossible . CHAPTER XXII . Colonel Nicholson saw the ruin he had caused with a vindictive delight . It soothed his wounded vanity and gratified his revenge . Glendenning , who had presumed to mate himself with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as he detested , had been obliged to act as the humble instrument of his friend 's destruction and his own disgrace . Let not the reader suppose the character too darkly drawn . Life affords examples enough , although the unthinking world does not always become fully acquainted with them . When selfishness and ambition take possession of a character not blessed with the Divine light of religion , that character will go as far in the way of evil as its own interest will let it . The death of Frank , the desperate folly of Glendenning , who ran directly into the snare laid for him , his degradation from his rank , the resignation and departure of White , were all so many triumphs to Nicholson , while it rendered him more arrogant and inflated his ideas of his own importance to a yet higher degree . His ambition had been unusual before , now it was overweening . His parasites and flatterers , and they were not few , played upon his weakness and exaggerated it almost into a malady  --  a monomania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals became intolerable , and to insult every one near him ( and who had not the means of resenting ) from a vicious amusement became at length an unconscious habit . His exorbitant pomposity appeared to be pampered by the course of events , and , as if Providence were willing to punish such a character by displaying it fully in the broad sunshine , a circumstance occurred calculated to infect him with new arrogance , and to cause him to conceal his peculiarities with less caution . This circumstance , by which , it seemed , the worse he grew , the more favoured he was with worldly success , was the sudden death of his elder brother , which was immediately followed by that of his father . By these events a princely estate and the title of Lord Middleton fell very unexpectedly to him , and he returned to England . On reaching London , that love of display , which was one of his strongest passions , led him to an immediate assumption of a style dazzling even amid the splendours of this most dazzling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the comparatively humble Lieutenant-colonel Nicholson were cast into the shade by the costly elegance and hospitality of Lord Middleton . Few gave more or better dinners . But however his love of show was gratified by this munificence , that was not his principal object . It had been always one of his strongest desires to receive a diplomatic appointment , and both his late father and brother had long been engaged in negotiations to this effect . If these negotiations had not been carried on with any particular prospect of success , they had kept the subject alive in the minds of certain distinguished persons in England , and they had kept alive the pleasing flame in the bosom of the great man himself , engaged in the arrogant and haughty duties of his distant post ; and if they had been broken off by the death of the two noble applicants , it was only that they might be renewed with much more energy by the party principally concerned . Among those who , unacquainted with the real character of the present Lord Middleton , had yielded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl of Rivington , and his influence was of a kind not likely to be exercised without effect . At the moment to which we now call the attention of the reader , he had exerted himself with so much sincerity that success appeared about to crown the most determined , the most brilliant desire which had ever swelled Lord Middleton 's cold and pompous heart with the sweets of selfish triumph . The Earl of Rivington had a seat about thirty miles from London , to which he was in the habit of resorting when business did not permit a more distant excursion , and where he constantly gave rendezvous to his noble friends . Here he lived with the freedom and simplicity of a farmer , though , it must be confessed , a farmer pretty well surrounded by the comforts and luxuries of life . Here he was staying at the opening of our present chapter . Harry had become a familiar and very favourite guest in the family of his benevolent and distinguished old travelling companion , before the affecting intelligence of his brother 's death had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of the English nobleman , combined with his cultivated mind , open , warm heart , and easy manners , had presented to Harry something so fascinating , that he not only admired , but learned to love him almost as a father , and the freshness , intelligence , and ingenuousness of the young American , his warmth of heart , strength of mind , and straightforward sincerity and honesty of character , combined with ( for so young a man ) very considerable attainments and particularly pleasing manners and person , charmed the earl into an intimacy which became gradually a friendship . Long before the dreadful blow had fallen upon him , Harry had unbosomed himself to his illustrious host , who knew all about him , his unlucky affair with Miss Elton , his affectionate family relations , his generous , warm-hearted father , Frank 's prompt and spirited character , and even little Seth 's difficulties in finding a commodious resting-place for his hands and feet . He had brought to Europe with him , also , such letters of introduction as , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predisposition in his favour . When in some degree recovered from the first effects of the appalling calamity which had fallen upon his family , and in pursuance of the advice and request of his father to wait in Europe , Harry resolved to spend a year or two in seeing England , Scotland , Ireland , and Wales , and carried the plan into effect thoroughly , with great benefit to his mind , but not without a perceptible change in his health and happiness . He had found it impossible to bear , with anything like the philosophy of which he had been somewhat previously in the habit of boasting , the loss of Frank in such a way . Time seemed rather to strengthen than diminish its effects on his imagination . No philosophy but one can afford consolation to grief for the dead without hardening the heart and narrowing the mind , and Harry was far too sensible and affectionate to seek relief in flippant forgetfulness or selfish pleasure . In these two years his character had altered as much as his appearance . He had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , had entered his mind ; he had several times since his departure seen its effects upon others , but now it presented itself to him in a new aspect . He loved his brother so , he had been so much with him , all his plans and thoughts of life were so interwoven with him , that Frank formed a part of the world , of nature , in his imagination . This part of nature was now annihilated ; one black , terrifice , and ominous blot had been dashed upon the picture , before all happiness and sunshine . He could hereafter do nothing without thinking of Frank ; he could enjoy no pleasure , cherish no hope , overcome no difficulty , achieve no honour , accomplish no enterprise without being haunted by the shadow of Frank . Over his visit to Europe a frightful cloud had come  --  a cloud which could never be dissipated ; and on his return home , among all the images which awaited him there , stood prominent and horrible , shrouded in unnatural gloom , the grave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until now , had been his brightest hope and surest reliance . By nature he was of a thoughtful and brooding disposition . There are men who can thus behold a beloved object struck suddenly down and mysteriously hurled from the arena , and yet forget , in their selfish interests , the solemn lesson . Harry was not one of those . He felt he could never forget , never recover from the shock . He could never be to others what he was ; the world could never be what it had been to him . But it was not grief alone from which he suffered ; it was not only his heart which had been struck A new idea , and the most mighty and startling of all ideas to those who are not wholly possessed by mere vulgar , visible things , had entered his mind . Death , like some sublime discord , had made itself heard through the deep , universal harmony of nature . His meditations thus aroused , he saw , with horror , could never again be laid at rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen from his eyes ; the universe had become a new universe to him ; the real had been transformed into the unreal . All the pomp and promise of the world had shrunk to a theatric spectacle ; those he loved , to empty visions , destined to vanish at any moment ; himself to an insect without any just value or rational object . This state of mind prevented all the expected enjoyment of his year 's travel , and counteracted , in a great degree , the desire of self-cultivation . Without faith in revelation , the idea of a future existence appeared ridiculous . Even grief for the loss he had sustained seemed a weakness , for why weep for or continue to love that which does not , which never can exist ? Exhausted by these reflections , he at length found a certain relief in the languor by which they were succeeded , though this languor itself soon became almost insupportable . In his desire to escape it he consulted a physician . Of all men , physicians possess the best opportunities of doing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals ; none are the depositories of so many family secrets , behold the human mind in a state more favourable to the reception of true knowledge . But how few of these gentlemen are religious men ? how few , while they give their senna and rhubarb , think of looking into " the mind diseased ? " In the pursuit of worldly learning , how frequently do they forget to seek , and so administer spiritual light ? Doctor Jackson was a fat , florid-faced , sleek little man , with a very round stomach , who had his guinea a visit , rolled about town in a luxurious carriage , loved the pleasures of the table , and never thought of looking beyond the world to remedy the world 's evil . " You want pleasure  --  society  --  excitement , " said Doctor Jackson . " Take your bottle of wine  --  Port or old Sherry ! Ride , go to the opera , and dash into the world a little . You want excitement . " Harry sighed . At the moment a note was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down to his seat . " There ! there 's your man , " said the doctor . " Go to him ; dine , sup , play , laugh , fall in love . Tut , man ! in a month there 'll be no holding you back . " So Harry accepted the earl 's invitation , and resolved to seek excitement . He had been too much with his own thoughts . The affair of the duel had absorbed him . He had not yet learned the details , and he could not imagine them . He seemed to be the sport , indeed , of a destiny equally cruel and capricious . First Miss Elton , whom he loved , and who , on mature reflection , he could not but believe loved him , had chosen to cast him off with unconcealed scorn . Then Frank 's bosom friend , the amiable and beloved guest of his family , had left them in apparent friendship , and returned to murder him . The cause was a mystery to him , which he had yearned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound by the discovery of new details . The grief he experienced was scarcely more strong than the deep disgust and indignation with which he regarded Glendenning , who appeared to him a hollow and unprincipled man of the world , whom he felt he could not meet without losing his self-command . This thought by degrees became habitual to him . It was the only one which afforded him any relief , or , as Dr. Jackson would call it , " excitement . " He would not seek Glendenning . He had no reason to suppose his brother had not fallen in a fair duel , such as must and ought to take place between gentlemen ; but , in the present one , the circumstances appeared so peculiar , that the anticipation of one day meeting Glendenning afforded him a dark delight . He would not own floors , were silenced by the general approbation bestowed upon Frank . Had a British officer been permitted to leave the United States unpunished after such an act  --  to have worn , perhaps , on his own bosom the rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American officer at her side , what would England , what would the whole world have said ? There was so much force in this argument that they who had nothing to oppose but the Word of God were but slightly listened to ; so difficult is it for pure Christian principle to contend successfully against the passions and illusions of life . On the present occasion it was soon perceptible that Frank was the lion of the day . When it was whispered about who he was , he could not have been insensible to the eyes which were fastened on him ( and some of them , as Mr. Mantelini says , " demned handsome ones too ! " ) . He had entitled himself to the applause of his native city . The newspapers had been full of compliments ; judges , lawyers , statesmen , and public magistrates shook him heartily by the hand ; and among the ladies , a young hero who had just saved his country in some brilliant battle could scarcely have been more openly admired . Mary and Lennox enjoyed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole time being occupied in talking , did not think much one way or the other , shared in the triumphs of her favourite young friend . But Mrs. Lennox looked on with regret and apprehension , lest a serious injury might be thus inflicted on her son 's character . Glendenning , too , against whom , at first , the general indignation had run high , began to be regarded , not as a libertine who spent " His rich opinion For the name of a night-brawler , " but as a mere frolicksome young madcap , who had firmly and magnanimously atoned in his sober senses for a boyish spree . White , too , who , it was understood , had done all in his power to prevent the occurrence at all , was praised for the officer-like firmness with which he had pressed it through to just the point where his thoughtless friend might withdraw in a chivalric way from an affair of which he had become justly ashamed . In the mean while everybody was introduced to everybody , and everybody talked to everybody about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party would have thought of these Harry had listened with apparent attention , though in silence , without taking any share in them . At length , gliding carelessly from subject to subject , they fell into a debate upon pistol-firing ; and one person , who had spoken a great deal , and with the authoritative air of one accustomed rather to decide than to debate questions , asserted that he had acquired a perfection of aim not surpassable . " I tell you what , my lord , " said the earl , still anxious to bring forward his young friend , " I believe you are a practised hand , but I will not allow that you are either infallible or unsurpassable ; and I 'll undertake to find a shot at least your equal , if not your superior . " " You have not seen me fire , I presume , " replied the person to whom this was addressed , rather grandly . " I should not feel honest in allowing you to engage in such a hopeless enterprise . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till by experience rendered sager , Are willing to back their opinions ( or whatever the line is ) with a wager . ' What will you bet ? " " If you seek throughout England for my equal , a hundred guineas , " said Lord Middleton . " If I go no farther than this table , and threaten you a superior ? " rejoined the earl , laughing . " Five hundred guineas to one hundred , " replied Lord Middleton , casting his eyes slowly around the company , as if to assure himself that no celebrated shot was , unknown to him , seated by his side . " I take the bet , " replied the earl ; " and as it 's quite light enough , we 'll decide it this moment . " " Agreed ! " exclaimed Middleton ; " but who 's your man ? " " My young friend Lennox , there , " said the earl , delighted , at last , to have hit upon a method of breaking his reveries . Lord Middleton started , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . After ordering pistols , and the necessary preparations to be made upon the lawn before the door , the earl related the incident which had occurred between Harry and Barnett on their voyage across the Atlantic . The story was admirably told , and brought Harry at once into the foreground . In the mean while , by the mild light of the late setting sun , although it was nearly nine o'clock , a mark had been set up , pistols loaded , and the whole company repaired to the spot . The target was a board , upon which was painted the form of a man of not above the usual dimensions . Upon the breast had been ordered a star , but the person acting as the painter , entering poetically into the spirit of the thing , instead of a star , had drawn , in about its natural size , a human heart . The scene and the occasion gave rise to a great many lively remarks , and it was in the midst of a peal of merry laughter that Lord Middleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after some moments ' careful aim , launched his ball into the little finger of his painted victim . His previous conversation had rather produced the impression that he was a brag ; and although the earl would certainly not have bet had he not believed he possessed much of the skill of which he boasted , yet there were others who were rather surprised that he hit the mark at all . Harry stepped forward , and fired without any pause . His ball lodged in the breast , within two inches of the heart . The second fire , Middleton struck the arm ; and with a very important and rather proud face , gave way to his opponent , who , in a manner equally careless with that of his previous attempt , sent his ball again through the body one inch below the object of his aim . " Now to decide ! " said the earl ; for they were to fire three times ; " though I rather think , my lord , you are a loser . " " We shall be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Middleton , with a certain grandeur , as he fired , carefully , slowly , and skilfully . He did not strike the heart , but his ball went rather nearer to it than the nearest of his opponent 's . This was the best shot yet , and the noble marksman received the compliments of all , and even offered his condolence to Rivington for the loss of his wager . But while he was playing off in advance the modest airs of a conqueror , Harry stepped forward with somewhat more care , and aimed with a steadier eye . A general exclamation announced the result . The ball had sunk directly into the centre of the heart . We should have observed that the distance had been lengthened much beyond that usually prescribed in real " affairs . " cient and formidable foe . In short , Seth , somehow or other , found himself strangely happy . Of all men on earth , he most disliked and feared Emmerson ; now he had escaped from the dark face of that gentleman for a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of his benefactors , and , with the facility of youth , regardless of the future , he gave himself up to the pleasing impressions of the moment , watched the easy and elegant manners of the three gentlemen , and delighted to bestow such attentions as he knew how upon the ladies , each one of whom he loved with all the unbounded fervour of boyish gratitude and admiration . Strange and sweet impressions , too , began to descend upon his mind , from the varying and resplendent scenes of nature which were so rapidly flying behind him . He listened , too , with mute wonder to the conversation of the rest , of other shores and other rivers , of the scenes of Europe ( that great dim vision of imagination to him ) , and to the thousand interesting remarks upon life which he heard now for the first time . The scenery , which struck every one else , and brought forth various exclamations of noisy rapture , sank into his soul silently , but not with a less deep effect , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident , into a sphere of life so much above his own , began to feel within him the development of new thoughts and the stirrings of new emotions . The beautiful countenance of Mary Lennox ( who seemed to consider herself quite a woman and him only a little boy of no account whatever ; and if she thought so , of course it must be so , for very far from him was the boldness to have an opinion of his own ) had a sort of unaccountable attraction in his eyes . He could have sat gazing on it for hours , and so he did quite uninterrupted , for no one looked at him . If the young girl herself sometimes caught his eyes with her own in these encounters , she only smiled so kindly and good-naturedly , that , as we before observed , somehow or other , this passage up to Rose Hill was the most enchanting delicious day he had ever known . Fanny Elton , who appeared only recovering from her late indisposition , required no other explanation for a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . She presented with Mary the rare spectacle of a young lady decidedly prettier than her friend , yet without believing so herself ; while Mary , equal in character , if not " I hope I am not bloodthirsty , " answered Harry , " nor will I , under any circumstances , go one step out of my way to meet the man who killed my brother . But , should chance throw me in his way , any statement from you would direct me how far the circumstance requires an investigation . I should be able to make up my mind how to act . Where was your regiment stationed , my lord ? " " In Montreal . " " Why , you were Glendenning 's commanding officer ! " " I was ! " This short conversation excited extreme interest . Lord Middleton was a coward , although , from vanity and the associations and habits of a military life , he could , when occasion required , meet death , at least , with apparent composure . His very love of display made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not wish to leave the world , which was just becoming brighter to him than ever . Neither did he desire to kill Mr. Lennox , the friend of his noble host , and after the part he had played in the duel which had ended in the death of his brother . He was not inclined seriously to be cruel , except when urged by some selfish passion , and in the present case every consideration united to make a conflict disagreeable , as one in which he could gain nothing , and might lose much . It would be ignorance , too , of human nature , to suppose that , with other thoughts , the very particular precision with which young Lennox 's ball had hovered around the centre of the target , and at last plunged directly into it , had not some influence over him . He perceived , however , that , although on the brink of a precipice , he had only to walk calmly forward to avoid the chasm . White and Glendenning were not there to betray him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter . Harry had declared he never would , under any circumstances , step out of his way to seek him who had caused his brother 's death , but that only in case of being accidentally thrown into his society would he act ( and action , under such circumstances , was rather a serious business ! ) . He had , then , but to quietly disengage himself from so dangerous a companion , and he inwardly resolved to leave B  --  Hall on some occasion , real or feigned , with as little delay as possible . These various considerations , which have occupied us so long to write , passed through Lord Middleton 's mind in the instant 's pause which followed the last question and reply . " At last , then , may I hope for an authentic statement ? " demanded Lennox . " It would be useless , " replied Middleton ; " Captain Glendenning is not a person with whom a gentleman can associate . To notice him  --  to meet him would be impossible . He was an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of his reckless character , you yourself had a specimen in the original insult offered to your brother . He is a hot-headed rou and an unprincipled blackguard . This is the person after whom you inquire . Shall I go on ? " " Go on , " said Harry , gravely . " On his return from his first duel with your brother  --  I fear I pain you , Mr. Lennox . " " Pray go on , my lord . " " He became engaged in a brawl in a billiard-room with a young officer , who was challenged by him , and who refused to fight . The prematurely arranged duel with your brother was stated as the cause . Anxious to save the young man , I proposed to call a Court of Inquiry , but before it could assemble , he was off . The rest you know . " " And where is Glendenning ? " " As his commanding officer , let me assure you he is unworthy your attention , and entirely beneath it . For this and other gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cut by all his brother officers , and then tried by a Court Martial . His misconduct was as undeniable as it was unpardonable . He was cashiered , and left the place , degraded and ruined forever . Where he is now , I know not . What he is , I have told you . The subject is a painful one to me , for I know the unfortunate , weak-minded young man 's father , and had wished to save him . " " I thank your lordship , " replied Lennox , after a pause . The earl smiled . Middleton breathed more freely , and taking Harry by the hand , said , " I need not add , my young friend , how sincerely I sympathize with you ; how sincerely , indeed , I have sympathized with you long before I knew you . " The next morning , Middleton announced to his host his intention of returning to London , a departure rather sudden , but which occasioned more surprise than disappointment . A few days subsequently Harry received letters from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . He could not refrain from tears as he reflected with what perfect happiness he would have had the precious treasures completed by one from Frank . The nervous agitation into which letters from home throw the wanderer in a foreign land can only be fully understood by him who has experienced it . His mother 's health did not yet permit her coming abroad . His father was attempting to engage himself in his professional occupations to divert his mind . Mary was become the most tender of nurses , and continued the most devoted of daughters . Not a word of the late calamity ! not a word of Fanny . Harry was requested to continue his travels , to visit the Continent , to see what was to be seen , preparatory to a final return and a serious business career . He was , indeed , rather struck with the earnestness of his father 's letter on this subject . " I wish you , " thus it read , " to bear continually in mind that you are to acquaint yourself with the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must by no means abandon your intention of hearing Savigny , and any other distinguished professor of jurisprudence . While you need not deny yourself any necessary expense , I wish you to form a habit of sober economy , and remember what I have always told you , your way through the world is to be achieved by your own industry and talents . Do not fall into the idea that you are to start a man of fortune . I shall leave you a business which can not fail to be a source of independence . I desire you to be studious , and not to come home without availing yourself of the advantages which Europe affords in order to render you a superior lawyer . We shall be with you by-and-by . " His mother 's letter was short , and written as with the tremulous hand of an invalid . The sight of it affected him strangely ; it was full of an affection , which he felt had concentrated upon him with more force since his brother 's death , and it closed with an earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not neglect the most important study of all . " Take no thought to yourselves , saying , what shall we eat and what shall we drink , or wherewithal shall we be clothed ? for after all these things do the Gentiles seek , and your Heavenly Father knoweth you have need of all these things . But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you . " " Ay , my dearest mother ! " he murmured , " how happy are you in such a soothing , such a holy illusion . How I envy you the power of belief ; perhaps one day I shall share it . I have made , at least , one step towards it ; I have learned to overcome myself ; I have learned to forgive . Glendenning , the murderer of my brother , lives . " For two years he had been subdued by grief for the dead , a gloomy , hopeless , helpless grief . He often thought it insupportable . Alas ! we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we experience those which follow . Some beams of religious light seemed penetrating into the darkness . He resolved once more to read , not only law , but , as his mother had recommended , Christianity . His breast was sad , but calm ; his sky was dark , but it almost seemed as if the morning were going to break . He did not believe , but he admired ; he saw no truth , but he began to discover beauty , mystery , and sublimity ; he wished for faith . Frank 's death had overshadowed him . He felt how much of his happiness had depended upon that which an instant had borne away . The dead , cold breath of the tomb had chilled him , and he saw he could never altogether shake its icy horror from his heart . What guarantee had he that father , mother , sister , and that Fanny Elton , would not , also , die before his return ? Why might not one , why might not all be torn from him , and what would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built his hope , his happiness : alas ! then he had built his happiness and his hope upon air ! " Ah ! " he murmured , " if Christianity were true ! if Frank were not gone from me forever ; if some almighty power were directing and protecting us ; if there were a refuge from grief , a rewarder of virtue , a punisher of sin , a conqueror of death , a friend , a father , a God ! what a world this would be ! " But , alas ! these high and flattering dreams are false ! the visions of poets and madmen ! Reality is dark , cold , and terrible ! Destiny crushes without pity or care ! " With these opinions , it is not remarkable that his heart grew sadder and sadder every day ; that life appeared a mockery , and virtue , even while he loved it , an idle dream . CHAPTER XXIV . No man enjoyed life more than Middleton ; we mean by life the world . His contracted understanding and selfish heart permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling himself with recollections of the past or speculations concerning the future . His mania for distinction had been gratified beyond his most aspiring hopes . His pomposity had increased with his power , wealth , and rank , and it would be difficult to find a gentleman more fully possessed with the idea of his own greatness , and more desirous of possessing others with it . These high airs were set off by his fine person , and he met few who denied to him all the outward tokens of the immense respect he required . It was now even more than ever his pleasure to dazzle all around him , to make the vulgar stare , to reveal himself in striking attitudes , and with that sort of effect which nine out of ten of those simple people who compose the world innocently suppose real . All the disagreeable points of his character were ripened by prosperity into more odious perfection , and he had never been more disposed than at present to arrogate to himself , to keep people around him at a distance , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reader must not suppose we are attempting to draw an English gentleman ; nothing can be more unlike . Simplicity of manner and a perfect indifference to display almost invariably form a part of their characteristics . The Earl of Rivington was an English gentleman . Lord Middleton belonged to no class of any country , but to human nature . One morning , towards the autumn of the present summer , the proprietor of the Htel de Saxe , at Dresden , was gratified with the sight of a very elegant travelling-carriage and four horses , which dashed across the square and stopped before his door . If a " milor Anglaise " had not been written in every point of the equipage and its appurtenances , the stately , proud-looking , officer-like person who alighted , and proceeded immediately to the most expensive apartment in the house , would have revealed the nationality of that agreeable vision , and flattered the imagination of mine host with brilliant promises of a long bill indefinitely augmented and uninquiringly paid . The flutter of delighted agitation which such an arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent was not wanting in the present instance , and everything that the humble efforts of mere Continental politeness could invent was put in operation to render his lordship ( for they have adopted the word at last ) " comfortable . " No one approached him without a bow . No one spoke to him without emphatic exclamations of milor , monseigneur , excellence , or mon prince , which last , a very fat , very handsome , exorbitantly well-dressed , particularly impudent-looking , and yet extremely respectful waiter , with whiskers and mustaches cultivated to the last imaginable point of perfection , bestowed upon him with impunity , having detected the sort of man he had to deal with the moment he set eyes on him . " Here , waiter ! " said his lordship , after having bathed and completed his toilet . " Mon prince ? " " Have you many in the house ? " " Oui , mon prince . " " At what hour is your table d'hte ? " " At two o'clock , mon prince . " " And can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mon prince , " replied the waiter , with one of the sweetest smiles , " il faut esperer , we must hope to satisfy your excellency . " " Well , put some Champagne to cool ! I 'll dine with you . " " Oui , mon prince , " fell once more from the lips of the bowing attendant . At the hour designated , propelled partly by a desire to display himself before the company , Lord Middleton , with his person drawn up erect , and all the military commander and embryo ambassador in his air , entered the room . The first person he met on his way to the table was Harry Lennox . There were few men he would not rather have seen . " My lord , " said Harry , " I 'm delighted ! I did n't even know you were on the Continent . " " And I thought you also in London . Which way are you going ? " from the rest of the company to pursue , without interruption , her plan of awakening his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house , where , after a slight repast , Mrs. Lennox reminded them they might expect her husband and Harry by the noon boat . It was therefore proposed to go down to the landing at the proper hour , and receive the new visiters with all the honours of war . Accordingly , at about one o'clock , the whole party repaired to the spot , laughing and talking as friends who have spent a week in the country are very apt to talk , for nothing brings mind and heart closer together than such an interval of uninterrupted intimacy . A few moments after their arrival they discovered a light cloud of ascending smoke and steam peering over the summit of a green hill , then the plunging strokes of the wheels and panting of the engine , and immediately the large and stately vessel , more like a floating palace than a boat , darted from behind a projecting angle of black , broken rock , with the well-known barge cleaving the foamy flood at its side , and containing the three figures of Mr. Lennox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrah , boys ! how are you ? here we are ! " shouted Lennox , waving his hat . " Now then , my fine fellows , out with ye . Hand up the valise . That 's it ; all right ! How d'ye do ? How de do ? " And then the various embraces and shaking hands natural to the occasion . As Lennox and Mrs. Elton did not find it convenient to stop talking , the exclamations of the rest were edged in as well as they could ; and as nobody waited for any answers , it was pretty much all the same in the end . Emmerson 's face was all smiles and blandness , though his gratulations , like everything else he did , were performed in a quiet way . " But what 's the matter with you , Harry ? " said his mother ; " you do n't look well . " " Oh yes , perfectly . Never so well and so gay in my life , " said Harry , rousing himself from a revery . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , at least here she was , or I thought she was here . " " Did n't she come down ? " asked Mary . " No , I do n't think she did , " said Frank . " I observed she was not with us . " Up the steep , fragrant foot-path they wound , and met " I should not dare to do so , Mr. Lennox , " cried Glendenning , growing yet paler ; " I should have fled from your presence in shame and horror , had I not learned you were on friendly terms with that man . Had I not just seen you touch his hand in kindness , and speak to him  --  him , of all human beings  --  with a smile on your face  --  " " I do not know what you mean , " said Harry . " He means , " cried Middleton , " I should presume , from his language , some new calumny against one whom he has no other means of revenging himself upon for having him dismissed the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insinuations of one , " cried Harry , " who has already , in regard to himself  --  " He stopped , unable to proceed . " But know , sir , " he added , after a pause , " that while you so meanly attack Lord Middleton , you live only by his sufferance . His intercession alone has saved you from the fate you merit . " " Lord Middleton , I presume , persuaded you , then , not to seek me ? " " He did . " " As one unworthy of notice , perhaps ? " " To what other consideration could you owe your life at this moment ? " demanded Harry . " What but contempt would save you from vengeance ? " " Mr. Lennox , " replied Glendenning , " you would be too noble to insult the fallen , and to strike the helpless , if you knew the truth . Leave that to Lord Middleton , who pretends to be calm while his heart trembles to its centre lest I betray his secret . " " Landlord ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person seated opposite me is not a fit character for your table . I , Lord Middleton , formally acquaint you with the fact . If he remain at the table longer , I shall leave it . " " I do not understand , milor , " replied the landlord , " on what ground I am to decline receiving one gentleman at my table , merely because he has a difference with another . " " Will you do me the favour to dine with me in my room , Mr. Lennox ? " said Middleton . " You dare not leave me one half hour in company with Mr. Lennox , " cried Glendenning . " You dare not suffer him to hear from me that you , the lieutenant-colonel of my regiment , were the malignant reviver of my first affair with his brother , and that your cruel interference obliged me to go back , and steep my hands in the heart 's blood of my noble and beloved friend . " " Great heavens ! " cried Harry , turning his flashing eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one instant 's attention , give colour to a slander so diabolical , " said Middleton . He laid his hand on his bosom with all his accustomed grandeur . " The commander of a regiment can have no connexion with a cashiered officer , desperate beneath the lash of merited punishment , and sunk in irreparable degradation . " Glendenning started up . The landlord rose and cried , " But , gentlemen , I beg , I entreat ! " Harry folded his arms , pale and agitated , for the conviction was now clear to him that there had been some foul play in the matter , and that he was about to have it laid open before him . Middleton preserved a calm and dignified air ; conscious innocence , or conscious power , showed itself in his tranquil demeanour and quiet smile . " Will you come with me , Lennox ? " said he . " This thing is really too absurd , " " What is too absurd , my lord ? " interrupted a strange voice . He started , he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , " exclaimed Middleton , with an affectionate familiarity , and without a trace of the self-important superiority with which he had dealt with Glendenning . " My dear White , how are you ? " " Thank you , " replied White . " But where did you come from ? " cried Middleton , extending his hand , " and how are you ? " " My lord  --  " said White , without accepting the proffered courtesy . " Had we not better conduct this inquiry in private ? " remarked Harry , with a grave mildness , which made Middleton turn yet paler . " Pray walk into my drawing-room , " said Middleton . " And Mr. Glendenning ! " suggested Harry . " Would you take into your society a dishonoured man ? " " And the murderer of your brother ? " added White , with a singular smile . " Whether he be so or not , is the question we are to investigate , " replied Harry . " I really can not consent , " cried Middleton , imperiously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted Harry , sternly , with a look and gesture of command , which made his distinguished companion start and knit his brow . But he obeyed . He could not help it . He had , at length , met his master . " A la bonne heure ! " said White , in a low voice . CHAPTER XXV . " We wish to be alone , " said Middleton to his servant . And these four gentlemen , so strangely connected together by the various incidents of the past  --  the blood-stained , heart-broken Glendenning ; the sad , grief-worn brother , upon whom he had caused to fall such a heavy blow ; White , who hated Middleton with all the hatred of his nature , yet who had , till now , been unable to give vent to his feelings ; and Middleton , whose arrogant and malignant course had so profoundly changed the destinies of all three , and who , till now , believed himself far beyond their power . When they were at length alone , there was a pause . Harry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly awakened , and he silently drew up his tall form and folded his arms , to gaze upon each one of those three dark men , among whom rested the guilt of his brother 's death ; for guilt , it was now evident , there had been somewhere . As he stood , like a judge with the power to doom , the whole subject of Frank 's death appeared conjured up again in his imagination in all its original distinctness , and the idea of vengeance once more , like a demon , took possession of him . His agitation was increased by the demeanour of Glendenning , who , without any trace of the fiery , high-tempered youth of eighteen months ago , scarcely lifted his eyes , till , at length , as if no longer able to suppress his emotion , he prostrated himself upon the very floor at Harry 's feet , and wept . " Speak ! " cried Harry . " I can not ! " replied Glendenning . " I would ask forgiveness  --  mercy  --  but I can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared for this extremity of agony and self-abasement . It touched both Harry and White . Down the cheeks of the former rolled large tears , and even White grew a shade sterner than he was on first entering . " This is a very extraordinary scene , gentlemen , " said Middleton . " Where is my brother ? " at length demanded Harry . " Murdered ! " said Glendenning , springing to his feet . " Slaughtered in his young beauty , savagely , like a lamb , by the hands of a ruffian and a butcher , but not by mine ! " " Will you allow me to light a cigar , my lord ? " said White . Lord Middleton bowed , and led him apart to a fire-machine , took him by the button , and was beginning to speak , when White , who had leisurely lighted his cigar , said , " Your lordship wo n't smoke ? " " No ! not now . In respect to this sad affair , my dear White  --  " " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I beg your pardon ; your lordship was saying something . " Deep to his soul Middleton felt this disrespect , and yet more when , as he once again commenced to speak , White again interrupted him with , " I beg your lordship 's pardon , but I had rather say nothing in this matter , except in the presence and with the full understanding of my friend Glendenning . " " Will you not , at least , be seated ? " " No , my lord , not beneath roof of yours . " " Do you mean to insult me , Captain White ? " " And if I did ? " replied White . " You would , of course , not refuse me immediate satisfaction . " " I should refuse you for the present , till I had fully given my testimony in this , as your lordship just now justly termed it , sad affair of Glendenning . " Middleton from pale grew to paler as he detected the design of White to drive him into a duel , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel with a man whose skill with the pistol he had seen so fearfully displayed , and whose lofty determination of character and fatal cause of quarrel made him such a formidable , not to say , at once , fatal foe . Most bitterly did he now regret the insults he had not hesitated to heap upon White when that gentleman had come to him a suppliant , and borne with such cool patience and self-government those sneers and insinuations which , at length , brought the matter to such a terrible crisis . They had now changed places . White had the vantage ground . He himself ( oh , galling thought ! ) was the suppliant . Glendenning was the witness of his awkward position and humble endurance of insults , while Lennox , the brother of the Yankee lieutenant , whose life he had so recklessly sacrificed to his own pomposity and malice , had thrown himself upon a sofa , and sat with folded arms , pale face , and a frowning brow , as if determined to wait patiently the result of the present interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My lord , " said Captain White , " let us be frank . The meeting down stairs was not accidental . I have been travelling with Glendenning for some months . Although the world has deserted him , I have not deserted him , because I knew he was not to blame in the affair with Lieutenant Lennox , and only to blame for imprudence in a very difficult position , in the matter for which he has been court martialed . I heard you and Mr. Lennox had arrived at the same hotel the same day , and I agreed to dine here with Glendenning , in the hope of meeting you . In accordance with my hopes , we met you together at the same table , in a friendly greeting ! This is so remarkable , that it imboldens me to ask you , would you be unwilling to join me in the task of reconciling these two young men ? Do n't you think circumstances have cut them out for bosom friends ? " " I see you mean to be impertinent , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor shall I expose myself any longer to your insults . I pronounce the charges of Mr. Glendenning false . If you back them , you are also guilty of falsehood : so I brand you , and you may take your course . " " That means , my lord , you prefer a meeting with me rather than one with Mr. Lennox . " " You are insolent , sir . If you have business with me , you had better send a friend , who may know what is due to the usages of gentlemen . " " Not till this question of your agency in causing the death of Lieutenant Lennox be settled one way or the other . Mr. Glendenning charges you with being the cause . I bear my testimony to the truth of the charge . " " It is false . " " I waive the insult . Dare you answer me three questions ? " " I answer no questions , sir . " Harry rose and walked up to Middleton . Deep was the suspicion aroused within him . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than words , and while he read on that of Glendenning grief and truth , Middleton 's was full of guile and shuffling cowardice . Glendenning he could have pardoned ; for Middleton there was no excuse . " You will , perhaps , be so obliging , my lord , " said he , in a deep , tranquil voice , " as to reply to any question which I may put you . " " Certainly , my dear Lennox , certainly ; but these gentlemen are both old enemies of mine , and I confess I  --  " " You desired to put three questions , " interrupted Lennox , turning to Captain White , with the utmost calmness . " What was the first ? " " After the return of Glendenning from his first visit to New-York , did his lordship give a ball ? " " Did you give a ball , my lord ? " " I did . " " Did you invite Captain Glendenning ? " said White . " I did not . " " And did his lordship never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " This is a captious question of Captain White 's , not your own , " said Middleton to Lennox . " Answer it as if it were mine , my lord , " replied Lennox , sternly . " I do not understand you , " said Middleton , haughtily . " Mr. Lennox , " interrupted Glendenning , stepping up , " hear me speak . If Lord Middleton denies the truth of what I say , let him put his denial on paper , and I engage to bring twenty witnesses against him . " " Gentlemen , this is intolerable , " exclaimed Middleton . " If I were a culprit at the bar of justice , I could scarcely be expected to stand in a more humiliating position . I hope you will excuse me for intimating that this apartment is a private one , and I have not yet dined . " " Your lordship refuses to reply to the interrogatories , then ? " demanded Harry . " I have nothing to confess , and I no longer condescend to deny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calumnies of both these gentlemen . " " My lord , you will not leave town before I can communicate with you ? " " Your question is insolent . " " Captain White , Captain Glendenning , I request your company in my room , " said Harry . CHAPTER XXVI . Lord Middleton , when alone , involuntarily clasped his hands . He then rose and locked the door , that no chance intruder or servant might see the paleness of his face ; for he beheld death staring in his very path . With an effort , however , not difficult for men who live much in and for the world , he recovered his composure , unlocked the door , ordered dinner in his room , and ate and drank as if nothing had happened . In the mean time Harry had heard the whole story , heightened by the cool recollection of White , and the agitation and anguish of the forever ruined and heart-broken Glendenning . He had details not only of the causes of the second meeting , but the particulars of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , his dying agonies , and the broken words of forgiveness he had uttered , as his young spirit took its fearful flight . We have seen Harry , from his high-wrought temper , on the eve of suicide , lashed into insanity by the frown of a girl . The reader may imagine the extent of his present emotion . He had no principle , moral or religious ; no doubt of the propriety of duelling ; no scruples against sending such a wretch as this headlong into eternity . Neither had he the least fear for himself . The idea of his own fall scarcely entered his thoughts . He wrote no letters , made no preparations , desired no delay . His mind was made up . He had a stern duty to perform . He had found , at last , the murderer of his brother : a person who had perpetrated the most diabolical crime that ever was committed without the least shadow of excuse . That per son must die  --  die by his hand  --  die like a dog , and at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning indignation that he could scarcely wait the necessary formalities of one of these fashionable combats . He brought forth his pistols ; he had them instantly put in order ; he examined them with care , with delight ; he was going to inflict a just punishment for a heinous crime ; he was going to lay low in the dust the vindictive , arrogant , remorseless villain who had brought his brother to an early grave ; who had broken his mother 's heart , and cast a shadow over the last days of his father and his own . Oh , what might not Frank have become , had his career not been cut short ! His high-wrought , sympathizing heart burned at the thoughts even of the pale , blood-drenched , spiritless Glendenning , crushed , trampled on , his hopes and good name , nay , his happiness and his innocence , blasted forever by the reckless pride and power of one malignant man ; and this man , high in rank , and opulence , and strength , thought himself above retribution . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought added fury to Harry 's mind , that he himself , had he appeared to him as a stranger , had he not been presented to him by even no less a person than the Earl of Rivington , he too would have been treated with that contempt with which the haughty and inflated Middleton chose to regard all mankind beneath him in rank . " It is left for me , then , " thought Harry , as he paced his room , " to teach this proud villain a lesson . Rest , my brother , rest  --  rest , pale , bloody shade ! I am here to avenge thee , or to follow thee . Dear Frank , would you not have done as much for me ? Oh vengeance , keep steady my heart , and fortune sit upon my arm , that I may cut short this monster in his career of triumph and guilt . " Thus , with half-heathen , half-theatrical thoughts , our young philosopher awaited the result of his message . He panted for the deadly conflict . He trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . White bore his message . He found Middleton in a dressing-gown and slippers , smoking a cigar . " Well , sir , " said the latter , " I suppose I need not ask to what I am indebted for the honour of this visit ? " " Scarcely , my lord , " said White , smiling , as he presented a note , whose bold , deep characters appeared traced by a hand impatient for action . " I have already provided for this little contingency , " said Middleton . " Colonel Rochelle , at the Hotel de Russie , is kind enough to charge himself with the matter . Good-morning to you . " " My lord ! " said White . Middleton turned short round upon him with an expression of countenance of which the interest , although veiled under an air of quiet indifference , was not , could not be concealed . His eye glistened with a wavering hope . His lip ( for he loved life with a sensualist 's , with an infidel 's love , and he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his lip , although through a well-bred smile , trembled perceptibly . " I suppose that 's all , White : we are now entirely in your hands  --  m  --  my dear fellow . " " Of course , my lord ! but  --  " There was a moment 's pause , which Middleton broke with an air of careless annoyance , as if the interest in question were a mere trifle . " White , you see my position . This hot-headed young man is rushing on his fate . He is too good a shot to permit of much magnanimity on my part . A fine , spirited young fellow ; I would give him his life if I could . I hate to fire at him . I  --  I detest bloodshed . " " Well , my lord , " said White , listening attentively . " I speak for your friend . He has father , mother , sister  --  and  --  " " No , my lord , no brother , " interrupted White , so mildly that it was impossible to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which met the ear . Middleton paused , looked at him keenly , but then , as if after having overcome an effort , proceeded . " Before you go to Rochelle , I should make a remark to you . In representing the part I took in that unhappy occurrence , you have , of course , stated your implicit belief . But , my dear White , let me refresh your recollection on one point . I did not advise any second meeting ; I did not want it . I had heard the matter alluded to , and , as much for the honour of Captain Glendenning as yours  --  and  --  and  --  mine  --  I proposed a Court of Inquiry . You may remember , I said to you I did not advise a meeting . I said so expressly , in so many words . Did I not ? I appeal to you . " " You did , my lord . " " Well , then ! " continued Middleton , " do n't you think it your duty to state this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . For myself , of course I can ask nothing , though I might with perfect propriety implore to be saved from the cruel necessity of shedding innocent blood . You see my position . I can not  --  God knows I would if I could  --  but I can not spare this young fellow . He is too resolute , too skilful . Yet with what heart shall I pursue the rest of my life , with the blood of a noble , high-spirited , innocent young man , who , au reste , has never injured me , upon my hand and upon my conscience . " " Upon your what , my lord ? " asked White . " Upon my conscience , " replied Middleton , the shade suddenly returning to his yellow countenance : " I hope you fully understand . I hope you do not misconstrue what I say , Captain White . " " My lord , " said White , with a sardonic smile , which revealed all his hate and all his triumph , " it would afford me the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have listened to you with patience , in hopes of hearing something which might change my opinion . I am sorry to say your remarks rather cast a deeper shade over the affair . " " Good God , what have I said ? " " I deem it a high duty , my lord , and your lordship 's noted sense of duty can not but sympathize with me , to advise my friend , Mr. Lennox , to carry the affair through to the end . Your lordship 's well-remembered example has taught me how to be firm , and to place a lofty sense of duty above all personal feelings . You will pardon my suggesting that , as to your dislike to budren your conscience ( I think that was the word your lordship used ) with the blood of an innocent , noble young man , you should have thought of that before you meddled with the original affair . When I waited on you in Montreal , one word , one look , one concession from you would have saved my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and broken his heart . That word your lordship 's high sense of duty did not permit you to utter . I bent to you ; I implored you ; I all but placed myself upon my knees before you ; I threw myself upon your generosity , your humanity . I told you I was authorized by Glendenning to solicit from your mercy a reconsideration of your views . I need not say how this humiliation was received . I need not recall to your lordship 's recollection the cutting sneers , the lofty insults , the immovable disregard with which I , a supplicant beneath your own roof , was coolly , remorselessly , insolently dismissed to my task of death . I am not accustomed to beg , nor , to be frank , inclined to forgive . The details of that hour are written Where every day I turn the page to read them . ' " " You are driving your friend into this matter then , sir , from mere motives of revenge ? " said Middleton . " No , my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of Lennox , do as I advise him to do . I shall act towards him as I would , under such circumstances , he might act to me . You are , my lord , and you know it very well , the deliberate murderer of his brother . You became so from motives of personal malice . You hurled the bolt without caring where it fell , nor what ruin it wrought , so long as you struck the devoted head of a rash , high-tempered young man , who had thoughtlessly offended you . The blood of Frank Lennox rises up against you from the earth . You have dashed to pieces the happiness of a most sweet and affectionate family . You have put your foot upon the neck , upon the heart of my friend . He is a wreck : only in the grave can he ever taste repose . Towards me , my lord , you have but manifested the indifference which I now feel towards your lordship . You have asked a favour of me . I refuse it . Should Lennox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as that of his brother to reflect upon ; should you fall , your lordship will , I trust , know how to meet yourself the fate you have not hesitated to inflict on others . " " Captain White ! " said Middleton , rising and ringing the bell . A servant came . " Show Captain White to the door ! " CHAPTER XXVII . When Middleton was once more alone , he pressed both his hands upon his bosom , and paced backward and forward in an uncontrollable agitation . The world does not see the boasting duellist in his solitary chamber , when , running up his account with Heaven , he gazes around him for the last time on the familiar objects of life and nature . There was a chance for his life , perhaps , but it was very remote , and even that chance was only the alternative of killing his antagonist . Bad as he was , steeped in worldliness , tainted with selfish pride and ungodly thoughts , he recoiled from imbruing his hands in more blood , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular denouement of a drama . But it was far far more probable that the indignant arm of his terrible foe would leave him a corpse upon the field . He was startled , appalled , overwhelmed . His memory ran over his past years , " Nor left one sunny resting-place ; Nor brought him back one branch of grace . " Ah , life was sweet ! His wealth , his rank , his splendid house , his noble villa , his luxurious carriage , his expected embassy , all the pomp , pride , and circumstance of the world he had loved and alone lived far , floated before him like a glorious vision  --  things seen in a vanished dream  --  never , never to be met with again . Each shape of opulent pleasure rose up and passed off like Macbeth 's apparition of kings : " Show his eyes and grieve his heart ; Come like shadows , so depart . " " By G  --  d ! I 'm a lost man ! " broke from his quivering lips , as he locked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fit of agitation . For an hour he remained alone . It would be difficult to describe his meditations . At length his not very agreeable solitude was interrupted by a knock at the door , and the servant announced " Colonel Rochelle . " " Well ! hallo ! " said the smiling second , without a care upon his brow . " Ah ! ha ! " replied Middleton , greeting his friend with a bland , clear smile . " You 're a business man . How are you again ? Scarlet ! wine ! " " All right ! " said Rochelle , with a look of triumph , as the servant closed the door . " To-morrow  --  daybreak  --  pistols  --  ten paces  --  passports vise 'd already  --  yours for England ! " " England ? Good ! A very necessary idea , that of the passports . I 'll be damned if I should have thought of it ! " CHAPTER XXVIII . Neither party had much time to think . Every preparation was made with a skill , secrecy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rochelle were in their element when presiding over one of the remarkable orgies of modern civilization  --  while decking with flowers and bearing the sacrificial victim to this old surviving image of Baal and Ashteroth . Middleton strove to write a few letters , but could not , and remained some hours like Prometheus on his rock , the prey of thoughts from which he could not fly . Harry did not even attempt any letters or other arrangements . He sat by an open window that looked abroad over the desert square and hushed city , steeped in moonlight and peopled only with those vague , blended , harmonious sounds , which float  --  unresting echoes of the day  --  over the dim night masses of a great city . There was no fear in his bosom . Life was not dear to him , and death was not terrible . The one had been already scathed with two blows of fortune , than which he thought none could be more crushing and insupportable : the fading of his earliest , only dream of love , and the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . With Frank in one hand , and Fanny Elton in the other , ah ! what a scene of bliss would the world have been ! Both were gone : one to the grave , the other he believed unworthy of him . Should the approaching combat leave him a corpse , neither he nor any one else , he thought , would be greatly the loser . Sometimes the image of his pale mother , clothed in black , floated up to his eyes , but Time , that heals all wounds , Page 151 must heal hers , or bear her with him into the black and empty void . Then Frank 's well-known voice rang in his ear  --  his bright smile , his snowy teeth , his rosy cheek , his thick , silky hair , his broad , white forehead , his thousand little endearing ways , and then the image of his stiff , cold corpse , to be avenged in a few moments . But all these meditations were vague and mingled , and he felt oppressed and bewildered by one tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes he asked himself , was it right ? but that was too late . Besides , do not all men  --  all gentlemen  --  sanction the duel , and was ever cause more holy than his ? So the silent , fragrant , soft hours fleeted along and bore him on , as with the swift , black current of a river that lapses to the edge of the cataract . He would not pause if he could , he could not if he would . The custom had caught him with its resistless tide , and thus duty , honour , vengeance , and necessity , all united to sanction the deed he was about to do . With a stern resolution , he sat lost in thought , till the wheels of the carriage were heard , and White came , and deliberately determined to take the life of his opponent or lose his own , he set off for the appointed ground . As the dark shapes of the city , the open spaces , shadowy woods , fragrant gardens , and dim , sweet shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect he was on a dark errand , which contrasted strangely with the calm and tender beauty of outward nature . " There they are ! " cried White . " They are welcome , " said Harry , gravely . Nothing could have been better managed . Harry himself had nothing to do but float with the stream . Before he knew it , he was standing , with a pistol in his hand , on a green lawn by the road-side , in the silver light of daybreak , ten paces in front of the pale and silent Middleton . " At the word three ; " said White , and began to count . " One !  --  two !  --  three ! " They fired . Middleton staggered forward a few paces , and fell headlong . Harry stood motionless , looking down on that once haughty form , now prostrate , and which , after turning twice over , lay on its back , the face staring wildly upward , at his very feet . The surgeon knelt , and said , in a hurried voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  quick ! " " He is not dead ? " cried Harry . His voice sounded strange  --  like that of ons who addresses an immense , listening multitude . " Dead  --  quite dead  --  through his very heart ! " said the surgeon . " Come ! Lennox  --  come ! " cried White . With the smoke in his nostril  --  the thunder surging in his ear  --  his hand benumbed with the thrill of so unaccustomed a deed  --  his head reeling and the ground moving under his feet , Harry stood , still motionless , looking down on his victim , and only repeated , " Lord Middleton is not dead ! " " Dead enough , " repeated White . " Wo n't you get into your carriage ? " " Yes , " said Harry . " Your passport is vise 'd for Vienna , you know ! " " Is it ? " " Mine is for London . What 's the matter with you ? rouse yourself  --  it 's getting light ! " " Frank is avenged , then ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . " His arm dropped without strength to his side . The carriage drew up , and he got in , but his eyes , as if by a fatal fascination , were riveted upon the form which , with stark , marble face , the blood-drenched clothes torn and cut from the naked breast , the convulsive hands clutched full of grass and earth , had already received the eternal seal of death . The carriage-door was gently closed , and the postillion mounted . Colonel Rochelle and the surgeon lifted their hats . Harry returned their salutations calmly , and in a few moments the spot was left far behind him , and the deed was written among the irrevocable , ineffaceable records of the past . CHAPTER XXIX . It was with a singular sensation that our hero felt himself in rapid motion , dashing as fast as four swift horses could carry him , he scarcely knew where . He endeavoured to enjoy the stern triumph of his just and holy vengeance , but it was , somehow or other , a very different thing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had , till now , filled his mind , had given place to another thought , viz. , the fellow-being he had left stretched in death upon the road-side , and a stunning and bewildering sense of responsibility fell upon him which he could not well analyze . His mind had undergone a startling change . His fiery indignation was quenched  --  quenched in pity , in horror  --  nay , more , in regret . Lord Middleton , perhaps , deserved to die , but rather by the hands of an executioner than by his . A thousand reasons flashed suddenly upon him why he had better have left the deed undone ; while the inducements to it now appeared but the dictates of the hot rage which had overflowed him yesterday . The image of his mother rose before him . She was already ill from Frank 's death . What effect would this new shock have upon her ? How would she meet her sole surviving son ? But yesterday the sight of him would have been balm to her wounded soul ; but now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , blood-stained murderer ? The effect of this morning 's work upon himself , through the rest of his life , also startled him . For good or for evil , the dreadful distinction of having killed a man was to mark him wherever he went . True , his victim merited his fate , but it was an awful thing to have inflicted it . To be a butcher  --  to be drenched with blood ! There was nothing mean , or selfish , or even vindictive in the act he had just committed . It was not for himself , but for his beloved brother he had perpetrated it . He had not even sought his victim . Chance had thrust him before his face , and it was with the irrepressible impulse of a noble and sublime emotion , in which all men must sympathize , that he had killed him . Yet the deed was a mighty and a terrible one . A class of his fellow-creatures would applaud it , but there were others  --  all the pious , all the calm and wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a murderer . He shuddered ; his blood grew cold ; he ordered the postillion to drive faster . On reaching Vienna , he , for the first time , entered a room to sleep . On undressing himself , he perceived the button of his waistcoat had been shot off , and a ball had passed through the lappel of his coat . " D  --  n him ! " he exclaimed . But he stopped . He had forgotten . He was speaking of the dead  --  dead by his hand . The thought pierced him like a sword , and his utmost efforts could only bring himself to a gloomy and unsmiling tranquility . Indeed , he felt as if he should never smile again . He felt as if every man 's eyes were on him , and he muttered , as he laid himself , chilled and shocked , into bed , " Shall I never get that dying look out of my imagination ? " His fatigue and excitement had been great , and he fell into a deep sleep , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had never quitted . He sat in the midst of the family circle at breakfast . Frank was at his side , laughing and talking with a strange living distinctness , and the rest were gayly rallying him about Fanny Elton . " And I wonder where we shall be five-and-twenty years hence ? " said his mother . " Be ? " replied his father ; " why here  --  Frank commander-in-chief , with his eyebrows and whiskers a little more bushy , if possible ; and Harry a senator or secretary of state . " " Miss Elton may be a very decent sort of girl , " said Frank , " but as for  --  in respect to  --  so far from there being any danger of  --  " " Hold your tongue ! " said his father . And then a burst of gay laughter , in which he thought he joined till the tears filled his eyes . Then he was at Rose Hill , wandering with Frank through the scented walks , and gazing on Fanny Elton 's graceful and noble form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill and asking her why she had forgotten him . " I have not forgotten you , " cried she , fixing her eyes on him . " I love you beyond all other earthly things . It is a cruel mistake which has separated us ; " and , as she spoke , she came nearer to him , put her arm around his neck , and kissed him . And then he knelt at her feet , and she placed her fingers on his forehead and parted his hair , and looked at him with her deep , tender eyes ; and he led her back to the house and to his mother , who received her with open arms , and embraced , first her , then him , and an ineffable happiness overspread all things : and a clergyman came , and they stood together at the altar , and the holy man opened the book and read , and a peace that passeth understanding entered his heart ; and soft music rose in the distance , and the odour of flowers was wafted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elton was his bride . Then  --  like a stroke of thunder bursting from a cloudless sky  --  Middleton suddenly appeared in the midst of them , and fired a pistol at Frank , who shrieked and fell back , dead , and covered with blood . Then his cold , ghastly body lay extended upon a table ; and the whole circle stood around , and gazed at it with pale faces and quivering lips , in deep silence ; when a peal of contemptuous and triumphant laughter broke the solemn stillness , and Middleton again stood leering like a fiend , pointing to the sad group and the stark body , and laughing till the tears ran down his cheeks . Then the blood of the dreamer began to boil in his veins , and he knelt down and swore he would pursue and kill this demon ; and his mother , and Mary , and Mrs. Elton , and Fanny , surrounded him and implored him to desist , and caught him with convulsive grasp , and screamed , and prayed ; but he shook them fiercely off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny from him with a force that threw her senseless to the earth , and dashed a reckless blow upon his mother 's forehead , and then he was free , and , with rapid feet , and burning curses on his lips , he went on and on in the pursuit ; and his enemy fled , and he followed ; till at length he no no longer ran  --  he flew  --  he rose from the ground  --  he glided through the air  --  he ascended to the roofs of houses , the battlements of old castles , the black , ragged edges of inaccessible cliffs ; at last , in a green plain , he overtook the fugitive , and shot him through the heart , and placed his foot upon his breast , and laughed , in his turn , till he could scarcely stand . When lo , beneath his feet , the ghastly body , all dripping and red , began to stir ; and he looked down to see , and behold , the corpse arose , with its dead , sunken , horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with convulsive hands , as of a man in a fit , or a raving lunatic . He started and fled , but his pursuer was at his back ; and wherever he went , the spectre still followed  --  over seas , over valleys , over mountains , over moors  --  through busy cities and laughing crowds  --  across uninhabited deserts , into black , wet caves , down fathomless abysses  --  but still the spectre , with outstretched hands , chased him . He strove with agony unutterable , till at length he found himself in a sepulchre full of dead men 's bones , and dripping with blood , and echoing with the wailings and moanings of damned spirits , and he thought he was in hell , and there was no outlet , so that he could no longer elude his frightful enemy ; and he felt an iron and a burning grasp upon his shoulder , and he saw Frank walking near in a sunshiny garden , smiling and picking the flowers carelessly , and he knew he could save him if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to scream , but could not stir  --  could not utter a sound  --  could not even breathe . In his struggle of agony he awoke , dripping with sweat , trembling , and overcome with terror . He started up and looked around ; the form of Middleton still seemed to stand before him , gazing sadly on him . Hastily rising , he rang the bell , threw over him a robe de chambre , and when , at length , with some difficulty , he aroused a servant , he ordered a light , on the plea of indisposition . Unable to sleep , he sat lost in reflection till the morning broke . We shall not attempt to lift the veil from his meditations . It will be easily imagined they were not of precisely the same nature as those which had occupied him the wakeful night previous to the meeting . CHAPTER XXX . Several days passed , and several nights . The former were employed in vain attempts to divert his mind by sight-seeing and other pleasures . He found he was a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; he had lost the power of enjoyment from simple things ; he had thrown away his careless ease ; boyhood was gone ; even youth had passed away ; he had become suddenly a man , and a stern one ; he suffered inexpressibly , as any one with an element of good in him must , and ought to suffer , under similar circumstances . But it was very different suffering from that of grief . The loss of his brother had also been suffering ; but , ah ! how unlike his present experience ! Grief is softening , elevating , purifying ; remorse withers , consumes , and destroys . His nights were invariably sleepless . There is nothing more exhausting than the loss of sleep  --  more wearing on both mind and body  --  more likely to impair health and happiness . Yet he found he had in a great degree , at least for the present , thrown away that blessing . From his first slumber he would speedily awake with a start , and then came those long , weary watches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear an aspect so different from that which they present in the day . Here he could not withdraw himself from the voice of reproach and accusation . Then the idea that he had shed human blood in merciless vengeance weighed on his mind and oppressed his soul ; and Middleton 's dying face presented itself to his imagination with a horrible distinctness . And whom had he slain ? A weak , pompous fool ; a poor victim . And how had he slain him ? The world would consider that his opponent had had an equal chance ; but his conscience taught him better . He had not had an equal chance ; his own perfect skill with the pistol , he was well aware , far surpassed that of his victim ; he felt , when he fired , he was inflicting death . Whatever interpretation , therefore , the world might put upon the matter , he knew he was a murderer . Whatever excuse he might have had , he had deliberately killed a man who could neither escape , nor resist , nor resent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ( if , indeed , there were one ) , the task of punishment ; he had cut off a despicable fool in the midst of his folly ; he had launched a new thunderbolt upon the heart of his mother , which might destroy her also . Ah ! he repented of the bloody deed ! Not that he had a definite feeling of guilt , but he was overwhelmed with sympathy , horror , disgust , alarm , doubt , pity for the mother who watched his course with such interest , and regret that his own thoughts and feelings should be thus shocked and overshadowed . After a week spent in this state of depression , he resolved to arouse himself , to shake off the superstitious and nervous terrors to which he had so weakly yielded , and to drown , in a rapid and brilliant tour , all his youthful meditations . He concluded to start immediately ; but first to write to his mother a simple account of the circumstance . He tried to do so . He wrote and rewrote again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy himself as to the best mode of making the communication . While engaged in this task , his candour obliged him to confess that the act , so difficult to relate , must be , at least , a doubtful one . Its nobleness , its stern justice , its terrible retribution , which , before the perpetration , had been so clear to him , seemed but mockery when he attempted to set them forth to his mother . Her pale face , her streaming eyes , her look of despair , her hands uplifted for mercy on him , seemed to fill the page he was writing on . It was , however , a necessary duty , and he accomplished it ; and a cool , simple statement , announcing the discovery of Middleton 's guilt , proved by White and Glendenning , the instantaneous meeting , and the fall of the man who had deprived them of their beloved Frank , was at length completed . He appealed , at the same time , to his mother 's forgiveness , and , before he was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , under any circumstances , to engage in another duel . He would take blows , insults , opprobrious epithets  --  anything  --  everything rather than repeat an event which , he candidly acknowledged , rendered him deeply unhappy . He desired , at the same time , to know whether he was to have the great pleasure of seeing the family in Europe , and when ; and stated his intention to take an extended Eastern tour , from which due notice of their intended embarcation would , however , speedily recall him . On reading over the letter , he added the following postscript : " I perceive , my dearest mother , that I have laid myself under a vow . Do not fear I shall ever break it ; I repeat it here deliberately , and with regreat that I had not made it before rather than after this last calamity , for such I consider it . I acknowledge your superior wisdom and sense of right . I wish I had complied with your desire so often expressed . I am convinced no man ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had time to do so , that he had been a fool , and no one killed another without bitterly and eternally repenting of it , unless deprived , by nature or education , of a warm heart and a clear understanding . " This duty performed , Harry set off upon his travels , whither we shall not follow him . He extended his tour as far and with the design of occupying as much time as possible . The letters he received from home were heart-rending . Those from his mother affected him profoundly , more from their subdued , deep melancholy , than from their allusions to the new calamity which had fallen upon her . With a characteristic gentleness , she spared him all reproaches , and she even assured him that she had borne the blow with a patience which could only have come from above . Their visit to Europe was still deferred , and Harry still lingered in the East , examining into the state of those interesting countries , which to the European have almost the awful solemnity of a previous world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spending a winter or a summer first in one town , then in another , according to the caprice of the moment or the relief he found in any particular place , or from any particular person or study , he went over into Russia , and occupied himself with the various peculiarities of that vast empire , sometimes plunging into the splendid gayeties of the court circles , and sometimes loitering in the retreats of the nobles , or watching with interest the modes of life and mind among the serfs . He devoted eighteen months to the northern countries of the Continent , so little visited by travellers , where he found , with surprise , materials of interest he had never dreamed of . In their turn , Germany , France , Switzerland , and Italy occupied his attention . He studied their forms of government , their history , the character of the people , moral , political , and religious , their various resources and peculiarities , and their relations with his own country . Gradually , as the months and years of this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic course of self-cultivation , and carried it into effect with severe determination . He had the custom to stop months , and sometimes a whole season , in order to investigate some particular subject thoroughly . By means of these habits of intense application , and of the materials thus poured richly into his mind , and carefully digested , his intellect became strengthened and matured . His opinions , subjected to a new course of examination , were rejected or remodelled , and became more definite and just , the result of observation and reflection . His reasoning powers were enlarged and sharpened , and , besides a large stock of general information , he had attained a far more accurate idea of history , of the present state of mankind , of the literature and achievements of different nations , and of the powers , characteristics , and limits of the human mind . He had not neglected either his own country or his own profession , but , by a careful study of the Roman law , added to that of the existing codes of various countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more competent to take a high rank at the bar of his native city than he would have been had he spent the whole of this time in the routine of daily business . But ( let not the reader start , for he will one day find his own life has passed even thus unheeded away ) all this travelling and studying , these winterings in one part of the globe and summerings in another , took time , and when Harry , one winter , settled himself in a comfortable lodging at Florence to consider what he would do next , he happened to calculate how long he had been abroad , and he found , with a very considerable surprise , which recalled the amazement of his father on reaching his fiftieth birthday , that he had been absent from home ten years . He started to perceive so much of his life had vanished , and his conscience smote him for having remained so long away from his father and mother , deprived as they were , too , of Frank , and by so frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , expected them in Europe , and he had really been profoundly occupied , and the recollection of Middleton 's death clung to him with a never-ceasing horror , and his own infidel opinions had made him indifferent , if not selfish , and he dreaded going home with his dark , stern , bloody brow , to meet Miss Elton , and to throw a new shadow over his altered domestic circle . He had improved his mind , but he had not acquired any moral light . He had enjoyed pleasures , but they had come and passed away like bright shadows , leaving no trace behind . He had sought the alleviation of all kinds of society , from that of the royal hall to that of the student 's closet and the peasant 's lowly hut , but from the great and the gay , like the wise and the gifted , he had gained nothing , learned nothing to make him happy . Happiness had been the object of his search , but he had not found it . Through all his enjoyments , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , tremendous idea  --  death ! He had seen it : he had suffered ; he had inflicted it . It was the shadow , the crowning mystery of his life ; he could neither reconcile himself to it nor understand it . The two fatal events , the death of Frank and the fall of Middleton , had deprived him of youth 's greatest charm and greatest danger , thoughtlessness . He had become a thinker , and all things were changed to him and he was changed to all things . This idea of death had gradually awakened in him a deep sense of the valuelessness , the mockery , the mystery of life . His existence was rolling away ; his career would speedily come to an end , and he was weighed down with astonishment and agony at the fleetingness , the worthlessness of everything . The skies , the air , and the objects of the world were but visions . The ground seemed passing away from beneath his feet , and his own insignificant , useless , perishable nature to be on the brink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folly , an insult , a mockery , a lie . Pen may not paint the indignant and bitter scorn , the sense of wrong and oppression , the hatred and the despair which fair things raised in his bosom , his curling lip when he gazed on a flower , his gloomy scorn when the rising sun threw his glory over the sky and earth , and , more than all , his infinite contempt for the whole human race , with their idle credulity and dreams of superstition , their inflated hopes of immortal happiness , their ceremonies of worship paid to the merciless , crushing , unlistening , blind chance which presides over the universe . In short , pleasure , society , study , and travel at length fatigued him ; science disappointed , knowledge oppressed him . He wanted a refuge ; he wanted repose . He continued to receive frequent letters from all his family , as well as from Emmerson . Those of his father had recently grown shorter and more vague , and , at length , announced that circumstances had obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Harry might turn his step homeward . The reader must imagine the tenour of his mother 's letters , although it was evident she did not allow herself to give way to all her feelings . Emmerson , on the contrary , wrote at full , and it was on the strength of his representations that Harry had remained so long abroad . He assured him that everybody was well , that he had hopes , notwithstanding the proposed abandonment of the European tour , that the next summer would see the whole family in Paris , and that all was going on as usual . These frequent epistles from Emmerson , written in an affectionate and confidential manner , were very grateful to Harry . They were the accounts of a cool , disinterested observer on the spot , and effectually calmed the fears and anxieties so apt to assist the heart of an absentee from home . Harry had devoted a great part of his time in Germany to philosophy , and philosophy led him to religion , or , rather , to irreligion . About this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . This work is the most learned , searching , powerful , and successful attack ever made on Christianity , and has been justly considered an important event in ecclesiastical history . The mighty intellectual efforts of the German mind in philosophy had fully prepared our student to read , and to yield to this astonishing production , particularly as he saw that the great and learned people received it with enthusiasm , and that , with exceptions , the savans of the day did not conceal their opinion that it would prove a death-blow to the greatest illusion that had ever occupied the human mind . Harry read it , and , for a time , the triumph of discovering so able a champion of his own views threw around the subject a sort of wonder and delight . It confirmed , apparently forever , his entire infidelity . Why was delight among his feelings on arriving at a certainty that the most cheering hope ever conceived by mortals was an illusion ? Because it relieved him from a secret fear , of which , with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that when he killed Middleton , he had offended a superior power , which would hereafter call him to account . He went on now studying with more zeal than ever all the arguments against Christianity . He nearly confined his reading to infidel authors and historians . His industry was great , and he possessed himself of the entire ground on which the skeptic stands , of all the probabilities of infidelity , and all the improbabilities and impossibilities which can be urged against religion . He read again with attention certain portions of the Bible ; but only to confirm his disbelief of it . While thus employed , he was attacked with a strange weakness , and heavy , painful headache , the consequence of too much mental exertion , too little exercise , and too constant brooding over his own dark thoughts and his one terrible recollection . One evening he had returned from a gloomy , solitary ramble , much more unwell than usual , and was undressing for bed , when , in a chair by the table , he observed the figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he beheld , with a thrill of horror , the face of Middleton , calm , pale , sad , and noble , the lip and temple spotted with blood . This same appearance had , at different times during the previous years , presented itself to him , and , generally , before a severe illness . He knew it was the vision of a heated imagination , but it always overcame him with unutterable terror . He rushed forward , but the apparition disappeared . He seized the chair and threw it across the room . No one was there . He staggered back to the bed , literally overcome . Before morning he was in a raging fever . In a week his life was in danger . In a month it was despaired of , and , as he retained at times the possession of his senses , his physician told him frankly to regulate his affairs . He did not suffer much . At intervals his power of reflection appeared rather increased than diminished , and he lay thus some days . During this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . The incidents of his vanished years passed before him , and the images of his distant home and friends were present with him . Sometimes he was delirious , and again his faculties came clear and distinct to him . We can not trace , thought by thought , the process of change which now went on with him . His feelings were often thrilling and sublime beyond description . He saw now what it was to want religion ; what a helpless creature the mortal is by himself . About to step off the precipice , he looked around for some hand to guide , some voice to console him ; nor , infidel as he was , could he believe it possible that a support so necessary should be denied to man even by the blind chance which had given the ear to hear and the eye to see . Was it credible that , all wants else supplied , this , the greatest , should have been omitted ? No , it was not . A singular consciousness shot into his mind that he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection of the famous work of Strauss occurred to him , and he thought this author had fulfilled but a useless and a cruel task if he had really caused any Christian to abandone his faith . As he lay thus powerless , weak , and dying , never to see the green earth again , never to hear the voices of those he loved , neither here nor hereafter , to all eternity , this want of some aid above the world  --  in short , of supernatural aid , grew intense . The thought that a wonderful and mysterious personage had once lived who professed to give this light , struck him with a very strange effect . This person had been predicted , had come , and had been received by millions . The wisest and greatest of men had believed in him . He saw nothing improbable in it . He who made the sun , the moon , the stars , the comets , could make a prophet , or could manifest himself in person , or in any other way could conceal himself or reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously beyond the conception of man . Too much reflection heated his brain and brought on another crisis . He felt his senses wavering . The universe seemed to reel around him , and the earth to pass away from beneath him . He felt like a wretch falling off a precipice , impotent and lost in infinite horror and despair . When he recovered his senses , his physician informed him he was out of danger . The strength of his constitution had mastered the disease . But he must not speak or move . CHAPTER XXXI . In a few days he sat up . He was extremely emaciated and weak . He was informed that his recovery had been almost miraculous . On relating the circumstance of the figure which had appeared the first evening of his illness , and at the previous periods of the last several years , the physician referred it at once , of course , to shattered nerves and a disturbed imagination , and stated that it was not an uncommon symptom . When the doctor left him , a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw himself upon a sofa , and could not restrain his tears . His heart swelled with mingled emotions , which all merged in an insupportable despair . Thoughts of his happy , innocent boyhood , of Fanny Elton , the still deeply-beloved , first-chosen object of his affection , and of Frank , his brother , now mouldering in his early grave ; the horrible image of the dying Middleton , the conviction that he could never know peace of mind again , and the idea that he had recovered from death only to sink back , in the course of a few years , into a state of annihilation  --  all these thoughts pressing upon him together were too much for him . He regretted his recovery . Why had they brought him back to life ? Why had he not gone to ashes and the worm ? Why ! since he must go to them at last ? He looked forward to the path before him : a world of phantoms and blind chance , with no reward for virtue , no protection from vice , no guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive in self-cultivation but what arose and ended with this transitory scene , no glory in pure things ; no distinction , but passing and conventional ones between right and wrong , no meeting again with the dead , no future , no God ; all dark , all accidental , all reckless , all cold and lonely , and all fleeting away into nothing . What was the world , what was life on such terms ? Oh , nothing , worse than nothing . His long illness had made him hysterical , and , as these really sad and withering thoughts rolled through his mind , like the dark , damp clouds of a stormy sky over the head of the wave-tossed sailor , who , in his little boat , without compass or rudder , finds himself abandoned to the pitiless tempest , the saddest tears a mortal could shed flowed down his cheeks , and he abandoned himself to utter despair . " Yes ! " he murmured , " my poor mother , and Mr. Elton , and Seers , were right in one respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have gone abroad in life confident in infidelity , and all around me has become hollow and miserable . I do want aid and protection from that Great Being who created me . I am weak and guilty , blood-stained and broken-hearted  --  oh God ! " And now , from his loneliness and his despair , his soul turned to his Maker at last . " If thou hearest thy creatures , have mercy upon me ! If there be light , let it shine on me ! for , of a truth , by myself I am a wretch . " There was a knock at the door . He rose hastily , ashamed of his tears . The intruder was his servant . He brought a letter and went out again . Harry left it on the table a long time untouched . He was afraid to open it ; he felt he had no strength in himself to bear any shock . That proud self-confidence , that buoyant strength , that daring readiness to meet events , alas ! they had left him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , his round cheek , his careless forehead , and unshaded heart . At length he took the mute messenger . It was covered with addresses and post-marks . It seemed redolent of the air of home . The flowers of Rose Hill breathed from its folds . The faces of the loved ones associated with that spot crowded around him , and he kissed it as he recognised the writing of his mother , and saw that it was not sealed with black . " No , no ! They are yet all there . No new stroke has bereft me ; my father , my mother , Mary , and Fanny are not yet gone down into the black , unfathomable , eternal abyss . Oh why am I so long away from them ? Why do I spend my weary , lonely life , distant from this sweet circle ? True , Frank is no more there ; true , I shall go back a strange , altered , darkened , gloomy man , with bloody hands and a broken heart . But I will go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore open the letter . It was from his mother . It was dated nearly a year ago . It had been following him through several places , had been in the house since his first illness , and been withheld till now by order of the doctor . It contained another addressed by the hand of his father . He read his mother 's first . CHAPTER XXXI . Letter " My beloved Son , " Come home and share our sorrows . Come home and lessen our unhappiness  --  " He trembled at this ominous commencement , but went on . " Great changes have taken place within the last year . We have lost all our property . A succession of the most unexpected events has ruined hundreds , and involved us in the same fate . An appalling monetary crisis , as you must well know , is sweeping over the country . Your father , in his generous confidence in , and characteristic desire to assist other people , has risked everything and lost everything . He is obliged to begin the world again . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Heavy losses , sustained , in common with so many of his townsmen , occurring at a time when his health was feeble , proved too much for him . Mrs. Elton is with us , and Fanny also  --  the tenderest of nurses and the sweetest of friends . Mr. Emmerson  --  but the story is not altogether one to commit to paper . You will hear it on your arrival , which I hope will not be long delayed . We have a thousand interesting things to tell you , but will not enter upon such subjects till we meet . " It grieves me to add still farther to your distress and alarm , but I think it better to prepare you at once for the state of your dear father . He has been dangerously , and is still distressingly ill . For some time his disorder went into his eyes , and he was , during a period , entirely blind . He is better , but his final recovery of sight is doubtful . Hoping to retrieve our affairs , we long resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recital with better tidings . That hope is now past . It is decreed by an All-wise Providence that we shall taste sorrow in our old age . But He has mingled the cup with one good , which counterbalances the evil . What this blessing is you will learn by the enclosed letter from your dear father , which he insisted upon writing himself , lest you should think his blindness worse than it is . Indeed , since a few days , he sees very well , and can read at intervals without danger . I fear , however , for purposes of business , he will never be what he was . " I know you will hasten home , my dearest son , the moment this reaches you . But do not be too much alarmed , knowing , as we do , that whom He loveth He chasteneth , ' and that this life and all its vicissitudes are comparatively unworthy the grief of a rational being , except those events of it which relate to spiritual things . Do you know , can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pass in review what has befallen us in the interim , the period seems long enough ; but when I recall the morning we accompanied you to your ship , I can fancy you left us only yesterday ; and so life passes away . Answer me now , my son , is it not a dream ? " Mary is well and happy , and sends her love . There is a story connected with her , but , with a yet unconquered love of mischief , she has forbid my even alluding to it . And  --  I shall really tell you nothing until you are here . By the blessing of God , notwithstanding what I have suffered , my health is excellent . My heart yearns to embrace you , my dear Harry . Oh , may God grant you that light which will render all things endurable , all things welcome . I do not doubt there is happiness yet in store for us . Read the enclosed letter with attention . Surely our misfortunes are but His means to accomplish His wise ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my beloved wanderer , and soon return you to your ever affectionate mother . " Although Harry 's hand literally trembled at this astounding intelligence , he hastened to open his father 's letter . It ran thus : Letter " My dear Boy , " Your beloved mother will have informed you of the fine doings we have had here , or , at least , of some of them . But do n't mind ; we 'll manage matters yet , only now I must depend a little more on you . As I have no doubt these agreeable epistles will bring you home double quick time , I shall not enter into any particulars , especially as my doctor pretends that I must yet be careful of my eyes . Keep up your spirits , and let us see you here when you can conveniently manage it . We are beginning to feel your absence , really . " I would not write at all to-day , were it not my desire , as well as my duty , to make one remark to you , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our revolutions . The truth is , I am much altered since you left . Many circumstances have occurred to change my character . Poor Frank 's death was the first and most important . Your own affair with Lord Middleton came so close upon it as to furnish me serious food for reflection . Men have lost their sons before now ; they do every day , and will continue to do so ; but the sudden cutting off of poor Frank in that manner was sufficient to shake and loosen the world 's hold of me . It is an old and trite saying , that life is a dream ; ' but I begin to feel that it is so . I am sixty years old , and the longer I live , the more I see the fleetingness , the nothingness of everything around me , taken by itself . This has led me to a train of thought and to a habit of reading and investigation very different from any I ever had before , and which eventually caused me to look forward through the medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better world , to which we are all so rapidly hastening . I had my doubts at first , but they gradually faded away , and I am of the conviction that , whatever may be the arguments on the other side of the question , they are nothing against those in its favour . The only reason why all men are not Christians is , either that they are wilfully bad and corrupt , or that they are too much engaged with the cares , pleasures , and pursuits of this world to allow of their examining the subject attentively and candidly . Vain speculations in philosophy and empty , visionary views , I have depended on long enough , and found them entirely useless . They are not what the Great Creator has given his creatures to support , guide , and instruct them in their way through this life . I am no enthusiast , my dear Harry . I am more gay , more happy , and cheerful than I was before , nor do I shrink from all the innocent pleasures to which I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate government of a merciful God . On the contrary , while I endure sorrow with more resignation , I should find in prosperity abundant charms . Need I add that , if anything could increase my happiness in meeting my dear boy after so long and eventful and absence , it would be the certainty that he also has really examined the question of Christianity . I say examined , because I am quite satisfied that no one can candidly and cooly examine , at least , no sensible and clear understanding , without becoming a believer in the Holy Scriptures . " Do n't mistake me , my boy : I am not a long-faced bigot , afraid of looking at the world , and flying from mirth and pleasure . I was a broken-hearted , gloomy being after poor Frank 's accident , but this change in my opinions has restored to me my gayety and more than my accustomed happiness . You will find a man can believe in God and our Redeemer without running into any irrational excess or practising the familiarities of some believers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened my understanding  --  grief had nothing to do with changing my opinions  --  it only drove me into an examination ; by taking from me the props and supports of the outward world , it threw me upon myself , and taught me the tremendous truth , that there existed there nothing but darkness and chaos  --  not a place to rest on  --  not one subject which I could bear to reflect on in the long and terrible hours of the wakeful nights . Everything in the universe seemed destroyed , or destined to be so , except Christianity , and I grasped at that , because there was nothing else to save me from infinite destruction and infinite despair . Happily , the more I examined , the more I was convinced . When the great idea had once entered my mind , everything I observed in nature , history , life , and myself , confirmed it . Each moment grew brighter , as at the dawn of a day streaming gradually and gloriously into the windows of a smoky theatre , whose lurid light and false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you have not made the same experience , my son , we will make it together . Doubts will arise . but they will melt away like night-fogs from the solid mountains . If you have not at once the perfect faith of the centurion , you will , at least , say , with the father of the possessed child , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief ! " ' CHAPTER XXXII . Harry 's astonishment , on the perusal of these letters , was too great for expression . He sent instantly for the doctor again , and earnestly pleaded the necessity of immediately starting for New-York . He was met by an inexorable negative . He was too weak to move at all , under six weeks at least , and by no means could he yet venture upon a sea-voyage . The anxiety of the patient , so far from persuading , only confirmed his merry little tyrant of a doctor in his decision . " But what is the affair ? " inquired the doctor . " What has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! Your letters : you have had them too soon . I ought to have delayed them at least a month longer . " " If you knew , doctor , what necessity there is for my going . " " Necessity ! Bah ! There 's no necessity that must not yield to sickness or death . Man ca n't alter predestination . Were you to start in this state , you would probably , in two days , find yourself on your back in some little dirty Gasthof , full of tobacco-smoke and noise , in a fever ten times more dangerous than ever . The result would be , you would leave your bones there , and that would be the end of you . Your news is bad , I perceive . What 's the matter ? You 've something on your mind , and , excuse me if I add , your recovery has been retarded , I fear , by something on your mind . It seems your morale is affected . This figure , this apparition , ma foi ! ce sont des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , some secret . " " There is a secret , certainly . " " Well , so I thought , and , eh ? do n't you think your doctor ought to know ? How do you expect me to cure you , if I treat you for bodily disease while you are all the while wearing away under mental sufferings ? " " My story is sad , " said Harry , " and , perhaps , you ought to know it . I believe my malady is more of the mind than body . " " Well , there ! put this pillow beneath your shoulders ; do n't exert yourself to sit up . Tell me , now , what is the peculiar trouble . You are married  --  hey ? and live unhappily with your wife , eh ? or , rather , do n't live with her at all ? " " I am not a married man ! " said Harry . " My unhappiness has a deeper , more unalterable cause . " " A deeper and more unalternable cause than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling in that very easy manner in which most men ( physicians in particular ) listen to the misfortunes of others . " I should like to know what sort of a trouble that could be . " " I will tell you , " said Harry , " in the fewest possible words . I left a happy , affluent home between nine and ten years ago . " " And ? " said the doctor . " My first blow was the death of a young brother , of whom I was rather fond , in a duel , and under very peculiar circumstances . " " So ? Well , that 's bad , mais  --  ma foi !  --  que voulez vous ? In this world men must die , in one way or other , and others must survive them . " " I should have premised that my mind had been prepared for unhappiness by  --  by the  --  you wo n't think me a fool , doctor , but the fact is , I had an attachment to a young girl , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Put all your descriptions in one single word , " interrupted Doctor B  --  , smiling again , " and say she was your mistress . Of course , there never was , and there never can be , another equal to her in all the  --  the  --  charms and virtues , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera , of mind , manners , person , heart , face , head , feet , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera ! " Harr looked rather grave , and raised his eyes to the countenance of the fat , gay , frisky little man who presumed to jest at the confidence he had required in his professional character , but the doctor looked so equally indifferent to his wrath or his sadness , and so excessively cool and knowing , that his frown changed into a smile , although rather a melancholy one . " There , that 's right ! " said the doctor . " You were going to be angry ; that 's a good symptom  --  sign you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your senses are returning  --  good again : go on with your story . If I jest and take a cheerful view of it , my good friend , believe me it is only to counteract the very gloomy one you have long been accustomed to take of it . Perhaps mine is too light ; probably yours too dark . Truth may lie in the medium ; but be assured I regard the matter as the generality of men will . We should mourn less over our afflictions could we but see them with the eyes of other people . Now what became of this wonderful , enchanting  --  I beg your pardon ! you are looking serious again  --  what became of this young lady ? " " She  --  she did not return my attachment . " " Ah ! " said the doctor , feeling under his chin with the handle of his gold-headed stick . " So , after all , your dulcinea turned out un peu coquette . But men do n't die nowadays from these things . " " I left home and country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance ! " said the doctor . " In Dresden , some years ago , " continued Harry , who felt a certain relief in unbosoming himself , " I met the person who had caused the slaughter of my brother . I called him out and killed him . " " Allons done ! " exclaimed the doctor , more seriously . " He fell beneath my first fire , and died instantly . This circumstance has , I confess , occasionally given me considerable uneasiness . To say the truth , I have never been happy since , never shall , never can be happy again . Death has been ever since almost the only subject of my contemplation . I have travelled far and wide ; I have sought the attractions of society and study . But the world is an altered place to me . Life is a burden ; a secret voice whispers me continually , all is vanity , all a dream , all I love are phantoms . I am myself a phantom . I shall soon die , and sink into annihilation without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living for . " " Ah ! " ejaculated the doctor , arranging his cravat in the mirror as he listened . " I see , I see ! " " The thought of the person whom I have killed seems to grow more distinct with time , instead of fading away , as I hoped it would . The spectre which I have described to you made its appearance first some years since , and has always either come during an illness or has proved the immediate herald of one . In the course of the terrible malady , from which your skill  --  " The doctor slightly bowed . " Has just rescued me , I saw it several times . I know it 's an illusion , but confess it 's not a pleasant one , and I presume I shall be haunted with it as long as I live . " " Well , " said the doctor , looking at his watch , " these are , certainly , rather serious events ; but I do n't see how they make your immediate departure necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doctor  --  bring very bad news ; in short , the total ruin of my family . You know our country is undergoing a commercial crisis . My father , who has never known what it was to want money , has lost his fortune , and I am , I will not say a beggar , for I am master of a profession , but I am a poor man . In staying abroad , I am spending money to which , perhaps , I have no right , and neglecting pressing interests and duties . " " That 's bad , " said the doctor . " And yet the greatest of my misfortunes I have not told . " " And what may that be , pray ? " " It is a certain state of melancholy , of misery into which I have fallen . It is not grief , but it is the result of reflection caused by grief . I have lost my sense of reality in life . I see corruption and decay in all things . I have no respect for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't see what I was made for nor the use of living . If , from habit or forgetfulness , I enjoy anything , I suddenly start , remember what a wretched , worthless insect I am , and despise myself for being duped into content in an existence where only a fool can be contented . The natural desire I feel to improve and cultivate myself , or to love others , is constantly checked by this idea . Why cultivate myself ? why not rather brutify myself as much as possible , since intelligence and virtue only show more clearly the frightful difference between what man might have been and what he is ? And why love even my relations ? Why love even mother , or father , or sister ? since the appearances which we choose to call by those names are , after all , but illusions , as completely as the figures in a magic lantern . I had a brother once : where is he now ? an idea ! a recollection ! Why pour out upon these visions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich treasures of affection , which seem worthy to be poured forth only upon angles ? Were I to marry , I could never love wife or child , except with a cold , dark , and trembling love . I should behold in them but charming shadows . I should see beneath the tender blush of my wife only the dead skeleton . I should imagine the worm had already begun to take up his abode in the eyes of my child , now full only of light , that seems to merit such a different fate . I am going home : but what shall I do there ? With what heart shall I commence my toiling career  --  a career which means nothing , ends in nothing , subject to the merest and most cruel chances , where all that seems holiest and noblest is but a mockery , and where scoundrels and hypocrites carry on their manuvies with perfect impunity , and are as good as other men ? " In short , doctor , I am wretched . I see that the world , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see but that it is left to itself . I do n't believe there is a God ; I ca n't believe it . He would never have created so much evil , so much misery , so much guilt . I do n't understand how the world could have made itself , but , if there be a God , neither can I comprehend how He made himself . Men talk of the order of the universe : certainly , there is order in some things , though not in all . But if order be an evidence of a preexisting intelligence , whence came that pre-existing intelligence ? I have not been able to satisfy myself that there is one . Of course , if the existence of a God be doubtful , our own existence hereafter is more so . I do n't believe in a future : I do n't believe we 're immortal beings . We are but beasts , doctor , but mere beasts , more elevated , but also more unhappy . We have reason , but we have also guilt . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These thoughts , doctor , prey upon me ; they oppress , they pursue , they torment me . In the night I sleep badly , I am quite wretched . I lie on my back , cold and trembling , weak , impotent , cowardly , despicable , contemptible . I hate , I despise myself . Oh how I envy the brown-faced , rough , thoughtless , ignorant peasant . Nay , I envy the beast , the dog , the very calf that goes to the shambles . He does not hope . He does not fear . He does not think . He does not know what a horrible thing death is . He does not look forward and speculate on annihilation . His heart does not bleed when the butcher slaughters his brother . " To conclude my story , I am seriously afraid I shall one day commit suicide . I have a longing for it . I yearn to take the leap at once , and be at rest . I scorn to stand so long shrinking on the brink , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling at times nearly masters me . It accompanies me always . The greatest pleasure I have is studying the most easy kind of death . Sometimes I he awake in the night and form visions of self-murder . Now in fancy I go to Russia , to Siberia , and freeze myself to death . The cold overcomes me ; sleep steals over me , and I delight to picture myself sinking into a slumber from which I am never to awake , and thus escaping intolerable life . Again I go into a hot bath and open a vein . Life flows rapidly forth : I fall painlessly into insensibility and death . Now I blow my brains out , and am destroyed in an instant ; and now I leap , in imagination , from some immense height , and dash myself to pieces . " Were I even prosperous in this world , I could never be happy with these opinions . There are no elements for happiness in this world . All is hollow , all is false . But I am far from being prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end my gloom and horror with one bold stroke . I can not express what I suffer from the recollection of my victim . That dying look haunts me always ; when I am nervous , ill , and alone , it is fearfully distinct , till at times it passes the line of the ideal , and assumes the perfect bodily form and colour of reality . This horrible spectre takes part , too , in nearly all my dreams . I am quite aware it is a mere shape of the imagination ; still it is an almost unendurable misery . " In this state of mind , all those qualities which men call virtues are only in my way , and become disadvantages , if not follies , while the scoundrel is , in some respects , the wise man . Self-sacrifices and self-denials are ridiculous . Selfishness is the true wisdom , and he who plunges into the stream of worldly pleasures , drowns all thought and feeling in dissipation , and lives and dies without a thought or a care , he is your true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I am lost in mystery . I shall one day , I believe , go mad with vain struggles to conceive the meaning , the origin , and the object of life . The deep black which envelops me on all sides , that mighty curtain of midnight shadow which veils the future , against which the human mind has directed all its efforts , from age to age , so vainly , so foolishly , it is that which has so fixed my attention that I can not think of anything else . " Now , doctor , you have my story , I want you to answer me a question . How is it you are so fat , and smooth , and happy ? Have you no disappointment ? Do you never reflect upon the shortness of life ? What do you believe respecting death and our fate hereafter ? " " My young friend , " said the doctor , who discovered a certain irrepressible disposition to smile , although he endeavoured not to do so , " you have done very right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know how to treat you . I 'll tell you frankly and at once what 's the matter with you ; you are hypped . Some of your troubles are serious . The principal one is the loss of your fortune ; the rest are mostly imaginary . You ask if I have never suffered disappointments . To be sure I have , plenty of them . Mais , ma foi ! que voulez vous ? The way Ibear them is , I do n't think of them ; and I keep my stomach in order . That 's the great secret of human happiness . No man whose digestion was good ever bothered himself about what would become of him after death . We are here . We are made . We live and we die . That we know ; the rest we do n't know . It 's all very well for those who can believe the fine things they tell us . There are people who pretend to know  --  so much the better for them . Mais pour nous autres , ma foi ! que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . I have no doubt the supreme principle will manage matters for us after death , as before . It not , ma foi ! que voulez vous ? " Let me , however , as your physician , tell you one thing . Such thoughts as you have disclosed to me , this hankering after things future  --  things veiled from us , is a mere symptom of malady . You must not bore yourself with such subjects . You shall take a course of the Carlsbad waters . Until then , you shall remain here , quietly amusing yourself as well as you can ; and afterward you can go home . I do n't doubt you will find things better than you suppose . You will learn to enjoy life ; to seize the present without worrying yourself about the past or the future . I find in you an extreme delicacy and susceptibility of the nervous system , and an excessive weakness of the organs of digestion . The nerves act on the stomach , and , through the stomach , injure the mind . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are physical . Why grieve over the past , which is gone ? why fret about the future , which is not here ? You have killed a man . You did quite right , if you will only think so . Do n't yield to youthful nursery superstitions . I 'll take care of your phantom ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Leave him to me ! All the reasoning in the world could not lay him , but he wo n't stand one of my pills ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Do n't think , do n't study . Do n't go to plunging into dark , gloomy subjects . Take a glass or two of Champagne every day , follow a generous diet , ride on horseback when you get strong enough , and you shall be well and happy again , although you ca n't penetrate into all the mysteries of nature . " " If I could really think , " said Harry , " that my melancholy was physical , and removable by physical remedies ! " " Bah ! Be assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I know . I have had a hundred such cases . This melancholy , which renders people incapable of enjoying the pleasures of life , is a degree of insanity . Sometimes it terminates in absolute madness . It proceeds from intense thinking , especially upon one subject ; violent passions , love , fear , grief , revenge , solitude  --  ma foi ! half my patients are afflicted in the same way . I see it in your eyes . Your body is inflated , your complexion pale , your pulse slow and weak . The whole functions of your mind are perverted . You are hypped . You think yourself miserable , and therefore you are so . I have had patients who fancied themselves tea-pots . Do you like honey ? " " Yes . " " Take plenty of that ; plenty of compote . Do n't fast long at a time , and let your food be solid and nourshing . Rub yourself well in the morning with a brush or coarse cloth . I have given you a prescription , an excellent preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alimentary canal and promote the secretions . You have been , I perceive , for years undergoing a complicated series of nervous symptoms , which have reduced you to an unusual relaxation and debility . Good-by , good-by . My horses , I see , are getting impatient . Stay where you are till June , and I 'll send you home a well man , although you may not know how the world was formed , or what 's going to become of it . You want nothing but a course of Carlsbad . " CHAPTER XXXIII . Just risen from what he had considered a death-bed , Harry was not in a mood to be particularly impressed with the easy philosophy of the little doctor . He was too serious to see in it anything but shallow worldliness ; fit to content a common mind in the ordinary emergencies of life , but not to be of much use to the really unhappy , far less to the dying . The " mais , ma foi ! que voulez vous ? " of his not very sympathizing friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but now , his yearning for sacred and necessary knowledge required more solid aliment . He passed several days , coolly and seriously reviewing his past life , and reflecting , as he had never done before , on the future , The present , too , which the doctor found so enjoyable , furnished some subjects of meditation . At one time he resolved to start immediately for New-York , and he even went so far as privately to consult another physician . He was told , however , that the plan would prove not only dangerous , but impossible , and that a course of Carlsbad would be of the utmost importance to his future health . On reflecting , he found that , with a slight difference of expense , he could prolong his stay the necessary time ; and he concluded it would be , perhaps , for the best to reject no means within his reach to carry home with him good health , that he might commence in earnest the serious duties of life . He was aided , too , in forming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , received a day or two after from Emmerson . It was written in his usual friendly , confidential , and quiet manner , and alluded to the general confusion of monetary affairs ; but stated that , although his father had been indisposed , and at one time threatened with a disagreeable weakness of the eyes , he was now doing very well , and he had not given up the hope ( although Mr. Lennox himself appeared at one time to have done so ) of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Lennox resume their plan of European travel , which would greatly benefit their health . He added , that they had had a fright respecting money affairs ; but he was persuaded Mr. Lennox would come out of it much better off than he had at first apprehended . Miss Elton ( he stated in a careless way ) was about , at last , to abandon the maiden independence she had prized so highly , in favour of a wealthy gentleman of Charleston , who had long been received as her devoted admirer . She was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of every society , etc. , etc. , etc . This letter determined Harry to remain , and he wrote his father , accordingly , that a slight indisposition would detain him some months longer in Europe , but that in the summer he should at length turn his steps homeward . The next six weeks he spent alone , reading the " History of Christianity , " and the other volumes which his mother had given him . A strange , deep , absorbing curiosity , mingled with a hope inexpressibly cheerful and sublime , urged him on in this new study . He entered upon it with very different emotions from those with which he had undertaken it on board the packet ship , when , with only one faint cloud over his life , he had looked forward to a brilliant tour and perfect happiness . Then he was young , healthy , rich , selfconfident , in the highest possible spirits ; now he was in a far different situation and in a far different mood of mind . Ten years of experience and reflection had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble . Grief had gone into his soul . He had shed blood ; he had felt guilt ; he had seen the strength depart from his limbs and the brightness from his heart ; he had seen , he had felt , he had inflicted death ; he had himself stood on the awful brink , and he now asked of man , of earth , of heaven , and of his own deep soul , what came after , or what resources the Creator had granted mortals to pass through the last dread scene . The belief of an all-wise , all-powerful , benevolent , paternal God had gradually risen up in his mind , even as the morning follows the night ; and it was an immovable foundation on which to erect his new system of philosophy . The extraordinary letter of his father , confessing his change of opinion , he had brooded over with the most inexpressible interest , partly owing to the intrinsic remarkableness of the incident , and partly to the peculiar state of mind in which the intelligence of it found him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groped in darkness , that there was on the earth no single beam of light , and the simple fact , that a mind like his father 's , so clear , bold , and independent , so far above vulgar terror or superstition , had discovered in Christianity a sublime truth , not only startled and bewildered him , but raised in him a very exciting curiosity . Of all volumes which have ever been written in illustration and confirmation of Christianity , the work of Bishop Butler , called the " Analogy of Religion , " is perhaps the most extraordinary . He commenced this book , not as he had before done , with a mere desire to get through with it as a tedious task , but with an intense thirst for truth , now the deepest want of his nature . He had not gone through twenty pages before he perceived he was in the hands of an intellectual giant , whose strength of reasoning he was as unable to resist as he was to oppose the decrees of fate . Not only did he find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unbelief had rested , demonstrated as fallacies , but other arguments in favour of infidelity , which he had never heard of , also advanced , and also reduced to nothing . No poor man examining a deed conveying to him a magnificent estate , ever drank in each sentence and word with more profound interest . As he read , his late sad news , his past anxieties  --  life , death , the world , and all it contained , faded into comparative insignificance beside the stupendous discovery he was making , that Christianity , with all its absurdities , with all its impossibilities , might be true  --  true according to the strictest rules of evidence , true according to the severest principles of philosophy , true beyond the contradiction of the most wilful skeptic , true to reason , true even to Nature , true to the plainest dictates of common sense . In the midst of these studies the period arrived when the doctor gave him leave to visit Carlsbad . CHAPTER XXXIV . It was in the early part of June that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury of a travelling carriage , he reached the superb broad road which leads down the steep mountain , at whose base , hidden in one of the loveliest valleys of Bohemia , lies the town of Carlsbad . The striking scenery of the spot would alone render it remarkable , but it is known to invalids as the monarch of German watering-places , to which , in the fine season , resort pilgrims from distant parts of the globe . The scene which presents itself to the eye of the stranger as , with locked wheel , he winds slowly and carefully down , is exquisite beyond description . The peculiar character of the chausse reveals the various features of the picture with a pomp of display resembling the studied artifice of a theatric exhibition , if , indeed , a theatric exhibition could be so bright and imposing . At first , from the high mountain brow , the stranger beholds nothing but a sea of solitary verdure , waving upon the sides and tops of apparently inaccessible eminences ; but , as he descends towards the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of platforms , each one immediately beneath the other , at every abrupt bend some new portion of the enchanting panorama bursts upon him , till he who has , perhaps , come thousands of miles , in hopes of leaving here some distressing or dangerous malady , feasts his eyes at last on the welcome scene , the green , tender lawns , the pretty river , the broad , leaning hill-sides , the winding walks , the various bridges , the long avenues of trees , and the ancient town , with its crowded , irregularly built , antique-looking houses and picturesque old cathedral  --  a sort of Jerusalem in the visions of the invalid . As Harry followed the course of this zigzag road , he looked from the window upon the ever fresh and beautiful face of nature , and hailed the resplendent scene with an emotion as new as it was delicious and indescribable . He felt as if he were just born . He began , at least , to have an idea what it was to be born again . For years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other than a false and lying cheat , a sweet accident , a fair and cruel illusion . But now it raised far other thoughts and feelings . It was a portion of the works of an Almighty God , and a benevolent , superintending , affectionate father , given to man for his benefit and his delight . It was spread thus splendidly before his eyes as an emblem of virtue and of truth . It was the magnificent path over which he was to travel in his pilgrimage of immortal life . He was not an insect , by chance crawling on its surface , and destined to pass away , unmourned and forgotten , from its bright fields and solemn rocks . He was its lord , its master , treading with celestial feet its beauteous fields , and destined to quit it only for scenes more bright and eternal . It is not our intention to follow the mind of our young hero through its various changes during the six weeks spent at this delightful spot . The subject may be considered by some too serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more interesting or more worthy to be described , in a proper spirit , on all occasions , than the swaying round of an intelligent young mind from youthful skepticism to religious faith . He had , however , already become a Christian . He had not by any means examined the whole subject ; there were often in his mind doubts which he could not explain , and which appeared totally inconsistent with belief . But he had caught a ray of that celestial faith which the sublime Being who appeared on earth to enlighten , purify , and console poor , guilty , weary , and struggling man , demanded of his followers as a sign of sincerity . For the first time in his life , our doubting skeptic saw and felt what it was to have faith . He believed he should become a Christian , and therefore he was one . He could not always disperse every dark cloud of doubt , but he believed they would one day be dispersed . He felt he had been for years plunged into an agony of gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once fairly admitted , was ended forever . The Essay of Butler had clearly convinced him that Christianity was not only not impossible , according to the dictates of the coldest reason , but was as clearly and unanswerably proved as any fact in science , history , or nature . This was an astounding discovery  --  the most tremendous and sublime event of his life ; it thrilled him with unutterable emotion  --  unutterable hope  --  unutterable love ; it gave new action , new vitality to every faculty and attribute of his being that was noble and high , while it checked at once and forever all the puny fears , all the dark doubts , all the grovelling desires and trembling misgivings which had , till now , counteracted the best purposes and chilled the holiest impulses of life . Yes , he was a Christian . The moment he was persuaded Christianity was not impossible , he believed it to be true . It was convincing like the solution of an enigma , which , once spoken , is self-evident . Regarded from this point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a more real  --  a brighter  --  warmer  --  nobler appearance . He looked abroad upon the infinite universe , and far down into his own deep heart , and all that was dark grew bright , and all that was confused and mysterious became intelligible . A flood of rapture rolled in upon him . Immortality ! It was a thought too dazzling , too stupendous . It rescued not only himself from insignificance , destruction , and despair , but it restored to him all those he loved . So long had he been accustomed to regard himself as a worm , to contemplate the grave as his last , only resting-place , to look upon all things around as matters in which he could have no concern , and the skies above him , and the immeasurable future , as secrets locked forever from him as one too contemptible and fleeting ever to know , or have part in them , that this new change in his destiny had in it something overwhelming , and he saw it would require his whole life to rearrange his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions with which , just released from a death-bed and a long confinement to a sick-room , our young traveller saw burst upon him the broad , distant champaign , and the deep , rich valley which greet the stranger on arriving at Carlsbad . CHAPTER XXXV . It happened , at this time , that Dr. K  --  , one of the greatest physicians of Europe , was himself taking the waters . Harry at once placed himself under his care . The second morning after his arrival , Dr. K  --  paid him his first professional visit . " Tell me your symptoms . " Harry explained his bodily sensations . " Let me look at you  --  come to the window . " He obeyed . A stream of light fell upon his face as the eyes of his examiner were fixed upon him . There was something in the appearance of this celebrated man which denoted a remarkable person . His countenance beamed with mind and benevolence . His eyes were large , black , and piercing . His manner full of thought and experience . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an uncommon man . Harry almost blushed as he stood the long , deliberate , searching scrutiny of those eyes , which , piercing into each line and feature , at length seemed to gaze through his own , and to read the secret thoughts of his soul . " Your original disease is in your mind , " said the doctor , after several minutes ' pause . " Your morale has been over-cultivated and consumed . You have long had something preying on your spirits ? " " I have . " " I will not ask farther , but is it removable ? " " That , doctor , " said Harry , " you can tell better than I. " And he proceeded with frankness , as he had done to Doctor B  --  , to relate his feelings and opinions , with the various circumstances of the last ten years which had led to them , and particularly the state of mind into which he had fallen respecting religion . The doctor smiled , but in a very different way from the merry , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint , you prove that the remedy is at hand , and your manner of relating your extremely interesting history induces me to hope you are about to find it . But it is not physical , and can not be cured by physical remedies . In order to ensure in you a more zealous search of it , let me make one remark : I am sixty years old . I have practised my profession forty years . My duties have brought me in contact with all kinds and classes of men , and I have given particular attention to this subject . When I was two-and-twenty I was , also , an infidel . The grave events of life , also , made me re-examine . Upon doing so with more mature mind and greater care , I became convinced that there is nothing more shallow , pert , ignorant , and unreasonable than infidelity , and nothing more rational , wise , tranquillizing , and durable than a full , entire faith in the Bible and in Christianity . Without it , although thoughtless or bad men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves for a time contented , no man can be permanently and truly happy . Go on ! you can not fail to arrive at perfect faith . You never can be happy without it , nor can you ever be perfectly happy with it . The Carlsbad waters will benefit you , but a holy and solemn study of Christianity will cure you . Religion is the proper air , light , and nutriment of the human soul , and it came , believe me , from the hand of God  --  his last , best gift to mortality . " Harry felt an ineffable delight at hearing these words . Young skeptics often find their greatest difficulty a certain shame of being supposed duped by an absurd superstition , and their confidence in the sublime and mysterious truth requires , at first , the support of example , on the part of the enlightened . The infidel example of Harry 's father had produced a powerful influence in his younger years . He had unconsciously stood upon that in his skepticism . Now that it was removed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect became instantly visible in his new desire to examine . A certain intimacy speedily took place between the doctor and his young patient . There was a sympathy which , notwithstanding the difference in their age , could scarcely fail to lead to friendship , especially in a place like Carlsbad , where people are continually together in the open air , and very much thrown upon each other for modes of passing away the time . The doctor was as learned as he was sincerely pious , and was pleased to see an intelligent young mind caring less for the sensual , visible things immediately around it , than for those mighty , invisible truths which most men trouble themselves so little about , and which , nevertheless , at some period or other of all our lives , get to have such a tremendous importance . Harry was charmed to find one so much older and wiser than himself , one stamped by the voice of fame as a man , not only of sense and knowledge , but of genius , regarding his blind gropings after truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy and a friendly desire to assist . In the mean time , Harry went on studying industriously . He read , for the first time , in connexion with the prophecies , a History of the Jews , which filled him , as well it might , with awful amazement . The doctor marked a Bible for-him and designated some German volumes illustrative of it , the perusal of which added to his wonder  --  at the perfect clearness of the subject , and his own complete previous ignorance . In truth , he had before no conception of it whatever . When he came to a difficulty , as he frequently did , the doctor was at hand to solve it , and he was surprised to see how many difficulties apparently inexplicable were made clear as the simplest fact by a new idea or a little closer study . Under such wise direction , this young mind was led along a path of reading , reflection , and observation , very different from the wild and idle wanderings of its earlier days . He passed in regular review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things reaching from the beginning of the world to the present time , and making up , in the whole , one argument , which , viewed together , has been said to resemble the effect of architecture . In the course of his examination he found one remarkable peculiarity . The more closely he examined the more he believed . Each step was a discovery , and always pointing one way . If he ever doubted , it was just in proportion as he receded from the subject . Harry was thus , at last , engaged in a very important investigation , under extremely favourable circumstances . His mind was enlarged by travel , reflection , and study . His heart was purified by grief and softened by self-reproach . He had , for the time , leisure and exemption from those pressing cares which keep most men 's minds for years in one daily routine , and he had at his side a very remarkable man , belonging to a profession not easily led away by enthusiasm , a man of talent , celebrity , calmness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at leisure and ready to reply to his inquiries . Dr. K  --  understood the subject like a theologian , but explained it with the coolness of a man of the world . Few men in these utilitarian days think of examining Christianity ; and those who do , rarely give it the time and attention bestowed by our hero . For several months it had exclusively occupied his mind . He had pursued it with a zealous industry and determination , which men often exhibit in their projects of avarice , revenge , love , or ambition , but ( and is it not strange that it should be so ? ) rarely in things not connected with the little , transitory hour of human existence . Men see themselves more fleeting than the pebbles they walk on and the houses they build . They fall , with every breath , like autumn leaves . Their very hats and coats outlast them , and yet , one in ten thousand , like Harry , and he only when startled into it by an extraordinary chain of events , thinks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life , deeds , and claims of the sublime Being who receives the worship of modern civilization ; at whose name so many adoring nations bend the knee ; whose coming was heralded so many thousand years by the voice of prophecy and the murmur of human expectation ; at whose appearance the most stupendous fabrics of mortal strength dissolved into air , and not only temples and towers , but thrones and systems vanished like vapours before the rising sun ; whose calm words have penetrated to the remotest parts of the earth , and will penetrate to the most distant period of time ; to whom so many millions and millions of dying eyes have been turned when all things else were shrouded in night ; and who has left in men 's possession proofs of his existence , of his power , of his works , of his origin , of his design , as unanswerable as those of any inscrutable truth of science , the sun 's light or the comet 's speed . CHAPTER XXXVI . The waters of Carlsbad , under such propitious circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness , with the exception of some painful thoughts , was in a still more remarkable manner restored by the elevating moral influence of his new opinions . With each delightful day he brought to the doctor some new , or , rather , some old , objection against the Bible , and he continued to be amazed at the satisfactory manner in which all these were explained . The striking and apparently fabulous events of the Scriptures , the crimes of God 's chosen people and his favourite individuals , the cruelties ordered by the Creator , the miracles of the Old and New Testaments , the thousand arguments so naturally urged by an intelligent unbeliever against the whole system , one after the other of these were so satisfactorily replied to , that he could not help wondering he had so long been the passive dupe of fallacies so apparent . One or two plausible arguments against religion still remained . " There are other religions to which some of the arguments used in support of Christianity would equally apply . Once allow miracles , and all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where he represents the followers of Jesus as wrangling with those of the Arabian prophet , and lost in a crowd of other groups who claim the palm of divine honours for Zoroaster , Vishnu , or Brahma . " The doctor replied to this with a smile . " Here is wherein Volney is either deceived or dishonest . Bring before you , for instance , all the evidence in favour of all the other religions ; do you suppose your opinion could be made to waver an instant respecting the absurdity of pretending a divine origin to a single one of them ? Do you believe it could be proved , even sufficiently to raise a single doubt , that Mohammed was other than a man , or that Mars or Neptune were gods , or that fire is the proper object of worship ? Go study these religions , and you will soon be aware that Christianity is as much better founded on reason and nature , as much more incontrovertible when examined by the highest intelligence , and according to the received rules of evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alchymy . God has given to navigation the compass , to moral philosophy the Bible . If any doubt the mysterious wonders of either , let them examine , and they will be convinced . Your great Butler searched into the foundations of Christianity . Do you suppose his Analogy ' could have been written upon any other religion ? " " But confess , " rejoined Harry , " that if Christianity has its Newtons and its Butlers , infidelity has its Humes , Gibbons , Paines , Volneys , and Strausses . " " Truth , " replied the doctor , " can not take its place in the world without opposition ; it is that which tries , tests , and establishes it . In science and philosophy , has it not always been attacked and persecuted ? Can you show that these attacks have destroyed it ? That Christianity would be opposed is one of its own doctrines . Did not Christ predict it ? and was he not crucified ? " " But the small number of really sincere Christians ? " " Another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shall understand , ' and narrow is the gate , and few there be that find it . ' But is not virtue truth , and yet how few are virtuous ? " " But at so late an age , a good man , and a most intelligent one , like Strauss , produces such a book as his Life of Jesus , ' and finds for it so many supporters ! I confess that sometimes startles me . " " Germany , " said the doctor , " is an instrument in the hands of Providence . She is the type of modern , earthly philosophy , and is destined to bring to the unbelieving side all the light of science and all the force of intellect . The nation is going through a process . At present she doubts . She will one day recover from her doubt . She is now in a transition state . From Luther to Strauss is a period in her history . Have you not read the work of Neander on the same subject ? " " No ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Strauss 's work was published , it was proposed to his majesty , the King of Prussia , to prohibit it in his dominions . He referred the matter to Neander , who advised against prohibiting it , with the assurance that it would eventually make more apparent the divine origin of the religion it so powerfully attacks . But this book seems to have made an impression on you ? " " A deep one ; and on you ? " " At first , yes ; but the more I examined it , the more I perceived it was but an ingenious concentration of all that could be said against what is , nevertheless , the truth . The arguments and evidence on the other side still preponderate . " " But there is something convincing , " rejoined Harry , " there is something staggering in the clear , practical , searching , and sensible views of Strauss . The reason and the heart sometimes respond to his appeals . " " This proves , " said the doctor , " that he is a clever man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prove that what he advocates is not an error . I know Strauss very well . He 's an amiable , worthy , honest man ; but he 's made a mistake . He has the wrong side , and it has been very distinctly proved that he has . He begs the question . " " In what way ? " " He says , for instance , whenever there 's a miracle , we may presume a myth . The sophistry of this , when the possibility of miracles is the subject of the debate , is clear . He does not admit the early existence of the Gospels . His whole system is founded on an impossibility as contrary to nature and experience as the very miracles which he dogmatically assumes to be myths . In short , however forcible his reasoning , it falls to the ground the moment we discover his premises are false . There are enthusiasts in infidelity as well as in superstition . This worthy Dr. Strauss is one . " " Yet , " resumed Harry , after a pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I see whole nations , like Germany and France , reject Christianity , and when I see that , after it has been in the world more than eighteen hundred years , such men as Strauss , Hume , Gibbon , and that school , openly ridicule it . " " And , granting it to be really true , do you suppose it could be otherwise ? Do you know there is an astronomer now living who denies the truth of the Copernican system ? and yet this is susceptible of mathematical demonstration . Take any question that arises , in England , for example , any look , any personage , any system of philosophy , there will be an attack and a defence . That Christianity would be attacked , rejected , persecuted , ridiculed , and would , nevertheless , survive , is a remarkable part of Christian prophecy  --  is , in fact , a strong evidence of its Divine origin . But Germany and France , as nations , do not reject it . The ablest refutation of Strauss 's book is from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstructure , has demolished the foundation . Christianity is inextinguishable . It is a part of nature , like air and light . It is a creation , not an invention . It has become a necessary aliment of the human soul . The rich , the great , the learned , the philosopher , and yet more particularly the young , the bad , the selfish , and the thoughtless , may fancy they can do without it . Mankind , as a race , think otherwise . Doubt may come over nations as over individuals , but , nevertheless , it will last till the end of all things . The very fact that , at this age , it requires to be attacked by science and philosophy , and that it is attacked vainly , is an evidence of its indestructibility and truth . We do n't believe any more in Neptune or the nymph of Egeria . No other religion would bear the scrutiny it has received . What said its sublime founder ? The heavens and the earth shall pass away ; but my words shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of Strauss 's book will be to display the uselessness of attacking Christianity . " CHAPTER XXXVII . Our limits , and the plan of this work , do not permit us to follow the various conversations of the learned believer and the young tyro , whose habits of skepticism still sometimes clung to him , who guarded himself as far as possible from every impulse of enthusiasm , and who yielded each lingering doubt only when reason showed it was without foundation . Nor , even could we relate them , did these conversations embrace half the arguments in confirmation of that truth which had dawned upon Harry 's mind the moment he commenced an examination in the right spirit . The attempt to compress all the proofs within a few conversations would be like endeavouring to unfold , in the same space , history , science , and Nature . In the midst of his researches his estimable friend was suddenly struck with a dangerous illness , which in a few days was declared incurable . For a time the physician refused Harry , as well as crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length , when the immediate and fatal termination of the disorder became apparent , they no longer opposed an interview . Harry was , accordingly , admitted to the presence of the person who , but a day or two before , had been striding with him up those bright mountain walks in all the vigour of life . He was altered shockingly , so much so , indeed , as to be scarcely recognisable . His attenuated features , pallid complexion , large , sunken , terrible eyes , were enough to frighten a stouter heart . Harry , for a few moments , felt as if he should be unable to support the approaching awful spectacle . The invalid made one or two attempts to say something , but had not the strength . His desire , however , to make some remark or request was so apparent , that the nurse suggested various observations , to each of which he replied by a scarce perceptible shake of the head . " Do you wish anything ? " " No . " " Would you like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer ? " " No . " " Do you wish to say something ? " An affirmative look . " Shall I leave you , my friend ? " inquired Harry , with tearful eyes . " No . " " Shall I remain with you ? " " Ah ! yes , yes . " " That is what you wished to say ? " " Yes , yes . " And the smile with which he saw that , at length , he was understood , seemed full of peace and happiness . Even while it lingered on his lips he fell asleep . " He will wake in a short time , " said the physician , " but only to pass away . " In an hour he awoke . " Read to me , " he said , in a stronger voice . " What book ? " inquired Harry . " There is but one . " Harry read a part of the Gospel of St. John . The dying man looked up to him gratefully when he had finished . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Study your Bible . It 's the only thing that can help you when you lie here . " 1 He fell back with a smile . The physician closed his eyes . His spirit had passed away , calmly and happily . " And this , " thought Harry , " is Death . This is what I have so much feared , so much misunderstood . This has been the bugbear of my youth , the spectre , the tyrant . Noble friend ! I thank you for obliging me to behold this , the last and the sublimest of all your lessons . " Footnotes These were also the dying words of Sir Walter Scott .  --  Vide Lockhart . CHAPTER XXXVIII . The last day he was to spend at Carlsbad was a bland , still , and most delicious one . All nature appeared bright and promising , full of deep meaning , and ineffable , almost intolerable beauty . Harry was strong and in calm spirits again . His nerves were tranquillized , his head clear , his heart light , his hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting on the dark deed he had committed , but he found in the volume to which he had now been taught to look for consolation and guidance , so many promises of pardon to those who asked it in the proper spirit , that his whole soul floated in an element of pure happiness . For the last time , he wandered about the exquisite promenades of this delightful spot . He mounted the steep hills ; he folded his arms , and gazed in mute rapture on the enchanting views . He entered the solitary , sombre woods , and looked down on the broad tract of splendid scenery which , dotted with towns and villages , lay unrolled beneath his feet like a map . He breathed the fragrant air of the mountains ; he heard the voices of the falling brooks and the warbling birds ; he beheld the streams of sunshine pouring richly into the dark glades and tranquil valleys , the silky clouds scattered in soft groups about in the air , and it seemed to him that his immortal soul , long lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been just returned to him . All his oppressive gloom had passed away . He looked around him with the calm grandeur of an immortal being just setting out in its career of ages , scarcely treading with mortal feet the rolling earth ; destined to soar above death itself , and to continue , in spite of the clouds of earth , its cares or its disappointments , a course of happiness without end . The whole day he remained upon the mountains . He watched the setting sun descend , and the silver moon rise broad and silent from the opposite hills . He beheld the stars one after the other become visible , and he listened to the strains of a band of music which rose softened from below , mingled with the voices of children playing in the fields . We stop . We drop the veil over the mind and heart of him who , through ignorance , error , solitude , and sickness , through grief for the dead , crime , unhappiness , despair , and profound thought , had receded a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall not attempt to penetrate farther the sacred mystery of the process which God grants here and there to a pure heart , by which the things seen " as in a glass , darkly , " become less confused and obscure , and the soul appears to be partly freed from earth before the body is . It has been said that the most interesting of histories would be that of a human heart , but we are not disposed to approach with a too profane familiarity the inner workings of the spirit . We have ventured to trace the exterior events which fixed our hero 's attention to his own nature and destiny , and which , at length , gave to his blind soul the power of vision . There can be , in all the range of human sensations , none so sublime as that of a man who , long accustomed to regard himself as a miserable , passing worm , feels the first foreshadowings of immortality , and sees through the gates of death into the perennial groves beyond . " The sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity ; " and , at length , this unaccustomed blessing descended upon our wanderer , with that deep stillness which the Divine Master has promised to his followers under the name of " rest . " Far be it from us to attempt to depict his emotions . Ever so well described , they could not be comprehended , except by those who have experienced them , and such need no description . He felt himself undergoing a change , and beholding the most stupendous and infinite changes going on around him ; not carried away by that enthusiasm which attends great earthly discoveries and triumphs , but with that silent and sublime attention with which an astronomer , through his glass , gazes on the motions and habits of the heavenly bodies , beholds rings , and moons , and comets , and suns appear and disappear at the command of God . He scarcely felt wonder , for nothing was more wonderful than other things . The Son of man came to bear witness to the truth . Pilate ( and , through his lips , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ? " The Galilean peasant replied not to the worldly Roman magistrate , but to those who seek it , he replies at length by the spiritual light which is shed upon their souls . Harry 's prospects on earth were but sad . He could not be certain that sorrow did not await him at home . He had reason to fear events had stripped him of all his earthly fortune . The object of his affection was , he did not doubt , already united to another . His father was ill . He knew not what painful discoveries awaited him on reaching America , and yet he was calm . His love for each object of affection was increased , but at the same time he had become more brave and more trusting ; he no longer relied on himself . He was no longer tossed by the waves of his own ungovernable passions . He no longer felt himself the sport of chance : a new confidence , a new dignity had entered his soul . Who shall tell the change which had already taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Harry was on the sea . Europe had sunk behind him with its mighty forms and lessons . He had been away ten years . They did seem strangely fleeting when looked back upon . It appeared but yesterday that his mother had made such a remark at breakfast . As the voyage drew near its close , various emotions filled his mind . Since his departure he had learned two grave lessons . First , that he could never be happy without religion ; second , a life spent abroad must be , at least to him , a melancholy one . He felt the want of a thousand nameless influences which exist only at home . There is a breath in the native air which the soul requires . The foot longs to tread the haunts of boyhood ; and alpine cliffs and foreign shores become far less lovely to the eye than the simple fields where the mind caught the first rays of light , and where the heart first opened itself . Let no one who is wise and good choose to live absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happiness . There are yearnings , and pains , and sadnesses , and dis appointments , which they who mourn at the necessi ty of remaining at home have no idea of . To come abroad , and gaze a while on the brilliant and thrilling things unveiled to the traveller , is a rational and great pleasure : but go home before your home is changed  --  before you are changed . Return before friends grow cold and suspicious ; before the place you filled in their hearts is given to others . Live with those who saw your youth , who have watched your course , who know and who love you . He who has passed his life abroad , however warm and true his heart ( and sometimes it becomes warmer and truer in absence ) , returns not the same in person , and , of course , somewhat different in habit and mind . He finds all changed . Children are men and women ; the old have become sensibly older  --  some are fallen , some dead , some have entered into entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they take place with slow transitions , strike him at a glance , and many a friend he only meets to discover he has parted from him forever . These thoughts passed through Harry 's mind as he stood gazing upon the heaving waste of ocean over which he was ploughing his way towards the scenes so cherished in his memory  --  towards persons now beloved more than ever . Let not the reader think he was altogether happy . Dark clouds were sometimes on his mind . Frank 's death . He was hastening back to the grave of his affectionate brother , and there are times when the weak mortal body , in spite of all the cheering promises of faith , can not resist grief for the dead , and , most of all , for those dead in such a manner . The recollection of Middleton 's fate still more appalled him . Oh , why had he not listened to his mother ? why had he not properly examined before ? Here he bore in his bosom a subject of eternal regret . What was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ill ? Would any more be absent from the domestic circle ? He had received no letters within dates later than a year . They had expected him , and had probably , therefore , not written . To what extent had the changes in his father 's pecuniary affairs taken place ? What was the story his mother had referred to concerning Mary ? What had she to say about Emmerson ? Miss Elton , too , was now either married or poor , and living with his family . In the latter case , he was going to inhabit the same roof with her . He compelled himself to repress his strange emotion at this thought . He was surprised to find how he still clung to the image of one who had so clearly manifested her indifference to him ; but she was , doubtless , married , as Emmerson had mentioned her intentions in his last letter . He resolved to admit no thought of her among the tender anticipations and associations of home which now crowded upon him ; but the pang with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ( at length ) chosen husband in Charleston , might have taught him what would be the difficulty of keeping this resolution . Despite his sternest efforts , her image would rise before him . A thousand tender inquiries connected with her pressed themselves upon him . What sort of a person was her husband ? Would she be happy ? Did she  --  could she love him ? Had she married him for his fortune ? It looked like it . He blushed at his ungenerous suspicion , but facts stared him in the face . Had she not encouraged Emmerson ? Had he not himself confessed it ? and yet to reject him for yet another ! Strange character ! cold , fickle , selfish , and yet under a form so attractive , so fair , so noble . Nothing could have convinced him of her complete unworthiness , had not Emmerson himself borne his accidental and unwilling testimony against her . The recollection of Emmerson raised a new train of reflections . He thought he could comprehend his mother 's mysterious hint about him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little romance out of it . His father had taken Emmerson from a state of destitution , had brought him out , and placed him in a career of prosperity . Now that these changes had come over the spirit of their dream , Emmerson had , doubtless , stepped forward , and devoted his talents and his whole life to repay the obligation . Emmerson , in the absence of his benefactor 's sons , had been himself a son  --  had conducted the affairs of the office  --  had relieved him in the period of his illness from all anxiety . He felt almost jealous of so much goodness ; he nearly envied him the pure delight of thus expressing his gratitude . CHAPTER XL . " Land ahead ! " " Whither away ? " " Over the lee bow ! " Ah , the thrilling sound ! Thrilling and sweet to him who has been but a few months away from his native shores , but , to such a wanderer as Harry , an enchantment beyond expression , but full of fearful interest , only calmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because God had breathed upon it a portion of his strength and spirit . It was the brightest day that ever shone  --  at least it seemed so to Harry  --  as the sun began to decline from his noonday glory , and to mingle with his white beams the soft , yellow , Claude-like light of the afternoon . The blue speck grew more definite , and large , and near . Other ships , great and small , were around them , coming and going ; and he was struck by a magnificent steamer on her way to England . No one who has not seen it can conceive how beautiful the sea is at times , or how exquisitely , unutterably beautiful the land is to one approaching it after a long voyage . Men do not know that ivory , and gold , and pearl , and silver are not more resplendent than the simple rocks and common ground , the beach , the shore , the lawn , the field ; and that all the operas of Mozart or Rossini can not compare with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who jumps upon deck with his hands full of newspapers , and his quiet , cool , professional , unagitated look upon the beings who are approaching the land he has just left , with emotions which it never entered his imagination to comprehend . Harry took up a newspaper , but laid it down again ; he could not read it . His eyes were fastened to the advancing shores . Was it possible that long , low point was behind him ? that these leaning meadows were his native land ? that , after looking on Jerusalem and Egypt , he was , at last , close to Staten Island and Long Island ? that the little boat which was cutting the waves so swiftly was not a Spanish felucca , but a newsboat of one of the New-York papers ? He placed himself in the bow . It was a strange and ravishing dream . He felt he was enjoying a moment rarely given to a mortal . Ah , the radiant shore , close on his side ! the grass , the trees , the stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cottage , the ships , motionless and at anchor ! His breath came thick  --  his heart beat violently  --  he was suffering pain . He could no longer distinguish , through his thick-coming tears , the bright-coloured , familiar scenes gliding so tranquilly behind , and rising so silently around him . On and on went the tall , stately ship  --  on and on over the level , silvery flood , her broad white sails all set and filled with a steady , gentle breeze  --  soft as the tide of emotion which swelled his own bosom , while land thoughts pressed on his heart and land odours blew against his face . At length , as the ship went still on and on , a point was turned , and lo ! the city  --  the distant , soft , glittering , bristling city , lying there ever on the limpid tide , over it the thin cloud sent up by the dust , and smoke , and breath of its hundreds of thousands of busy inhabitants , teeming with human thoughts and human passions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love , and vice , and virtue . And there was the forest of crowded masts , and there , buried in verdant foliage and steeped in mellow sunshine , lay Hoboken , that dark  --  dark spot , drenched with the heart 's blood of his poor brother  --  of so many brothers , sons , and husbands . And here , for a time , the bright tide of his thoughts grew black ; and bitter were the recollections of his past life , and his counsels , and infidel opinions freely expressed , and his brother 's early grave , and the mouldering bones of Middleton , cut off by his stern hand in the midst of his follies and his sins . Planted upon the bow , alone , and with his face turned from all who could behold it , the young man long strove in vain with his tears ; but nearer and nearer he came , and calmer and brighter associations relieved him . The city , which he had so often and often seen in his dreams , from which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart so many memories , and hopes , and fears , grew more distinct with all the pride , pomp , and circumstances of a great metropolis . He could scarcely persuade himself it was no vision ; but it came nearer and nearer , more real  --  more true  --  no , it is impossible to paint his feelings . " Would any of the passengers like to go ashore tonight ? " inquired the captain , in a cool , business-like voice . " We shall be up to the dock in the morning . " " In the morning ? " cried Harry . " I shall spring into the water if you do n't send me ashore this moment . In the morning ? My dear captain ! do n't come near me ! I shall commit some assault on you . " " Boat , sir ? " cried a man , a New-York face , who had just clambered up into the ship and jumped down upon the deck . " To be sure ! " " Come this way , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by  --  God bless you , " cried a dozen voices . " I put up at the Astor  --  see you to-morrow  --  good-by  --  God bless you ! " But Harry was already seated in the stern of the little boat , his heart going like a high-pressure steam-engine . " Take care of the oar , sir , " said the man , as he shoved her off . Harry looked back once at the ship . You must have been to sea , good reader , to know how a ship really looks on the outside after you 've come a voyage in her . But we 've no time just here to describe the long , slender , wave-worn , beautiful thing . He was already near the Whitehall wharf , where , ten years ago , he had embarked . The boatman lifts the dripping oars , lays them along the benches , and pulls in with a boathook . " Stop ! Two shillings ! You have n't paid , sir . " This duty speedily accomplished , the wanderer , with years on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far flights , both bodily and mental , stood at length upon his native land , alone , like one in a dream , strongly tempted to burst into tears , but restraining himself with a man 's strength of character . He walked on , staring around him , and drinking in , with intense curiosity , every object , every sight , every sound . He reaches the Battery . A sense of change , of years , of the lapsing away of life , fills his soul . The Battery is diminished in size from the immense tract of land which had been the scene of his boyish sports . But the trees are larger . " Is that State-street ? Is that Broadway ? It is very small . It is strangely foreign-looking , and yet  --  " But he could scarcely speak  --  scarcely think . This is a wild , painful , sweet , oppressive moment . Scarcely feeling the pavement beneath his feet , making his course up Broadway among the crowd , with a prodigious effort to look quiet and unconcerned , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly-recognised point , some newly-awakened recollection , he reached , at length , his own house , and rang the bell . An old negro servant , who had been in the family as long as he could remember , opened the door . " Mr. Lennox ? " said Harry . " Yes , sar . He 's in , sar . Who shall I have de honour to say , sar ? " " What ! old Simon ! you do n't know me ? " " Oh ! my patience ! Oh ! dear life ! Oh Lor ! Massa Harry come home ! Massa Harry come back ! " And the faithful fellow ran up stairs , and then down stairs , screaming " Massa Harry come back ! " and then returning , stopped his way by stooping down to the floor to clasp his legs and kiss his feet , trembling all over with joy and attachment . " What  --  who ? " said a well-known voice , as a lady hastily descended the stairs . Oh ! years were in her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doors were now opened and closed , and the bustle seemed to be general . A beautiful woman , whom Harry for one instant positively did not know , threw herself next into his arms , with " My dearest , beloved brother ! " " What !  --  not Mary ? Is it possible ! " " Where is he ? where is he ? Where 's the young dog ? Let me see him . Hurrah ! hurrah ! Harry , my boy ! my son ! " His father appeared much altered  --  much , much older . " My father ! " And " Harry ! " " My mother ! " " My son ! " " My father ! " " Mary ! " and " Thank God , at last he 's here ! " were words which seemed bursting , in a very agitated way , from various lips . Amid kisses , and clasping of hands , and deep , heart-felt embraces , and broken exclamations of rapture , this trembling family group ascended the stairs , they scarcely knew how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sank on the sofa , and covered his face with his hands , completely overcome . There was a minute 's deep silence . No one moved , only the tears streamed down every face , till Mrs. Lennox 's gentle voice said , " Open the window , my love . He 's fainting . " " No ! " said Harry , starting up . " No ; it 's over . " And then they all fell to embracing again as  --  in short , just as any other kind , affectionate-hearted people would do under the same circumstances . " Harry ! " cried his mother , at length , parting the locks from his forehead ( as she used to do poor Frank 's ) , " before you say another word , have you remembered your parting promise ? Are you a Christian ? " " Mother , I am ! " Mrs. Lennox clasped her hands , and , raising her eyes to Heaven , said , in a low voice , " My God , I thank thee ! " CHAPTER XLI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! by the window , and let me look at you ! " cried Mr. Lennox . " What ! Harry ! It is not possible . I have a son left , then ! But you 're very much altered . " " I told you you would come back a man , " said his mother , gazing at him . " Ah , my dear mother ! I did not know what it was to be a man then . " " And , upon my word , you 're a pretty one , " said Mary . " But how you 're altered ! " repeated Mr. Lennox . " And now , how is it with you all ? " demanded Harry , in a low voice . " You had many things to tell me . Are they good or bad ? " " Good , my boy , " replied his father . " I 'm well , in the first place , and we 've had changes a plenty ; but all has come right at last , and  --  " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Mary , with a very mischievous look . " But bought them again , " added Mrs. Lennox . " And how are all friends ? " " All friends are well , " said Mary . " I presume by all friends ' you mean Miss Elton ! " " Mary ! " said her mother , reprovingly . " The same girl , you see ! " " And we 've had a wedding since you left , sir , " added Mary . " Mrs. Elton , " exclaimed Simon , throwing open the door , and Mrs. Elton flew into Harry 's arms and kissed his forehead with the tenderest affection , her eyes full of tears , and talking all the while exactly as if she had n't left off since he went away ( and probably she had n't ! ) . Behind her , very pale , with her eyes cast down , stood Fanny , changed from a lovely girl into a still lovelier woman , and preceded by a maid , carrying one of the prettiest little babies that ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what a tender and profound love he had continued to cherish for her , and the hopes , false as air , which , despite all he had heard and seen , had still kept possession of his bosom . For a moment anguish and indignation contended within him , for he was suffering one of the keenest pangs he had ever experienced . He recovered himself , however , immediately , and advanced to meet her with very much the same manner as that in which he had bade her farewell . " I am happy to see you , " said he , scarcely touching the hand tremblingly extended to him . He was interrupted by the sudden awakening of the baby , who began to cry  --  of course ! But , what by no means appeared so natural a consequence , he perceived , with new astonishment , that tears had suddenly gushed into the eyes of its mother , which , after vainly endeavouring to repress , she was striving to hide with her hands , and by turning away her face , upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look . The incident occurred while everybody else was talking , and perhaps was not generally observed . In the midst of this little mystery a new comer presented himself  --  a tall , very handsome , very well-dressed , very graceful young man , with a pair of whiskers , becomingly trimmed within the modesty of nature  --  and , stretching forth his hand , he grasped Harry 's with a warmth which astonished the latter , although it did not appear to have that effect upon anybody else . " Confess at once , " said the stranger , " you do n't  --  you know  --  you do n't know me . " " Frankly , " replied Harry , in a respectful manner ; " but for these witnesses , I should say I had never  --  stop ! " he added , as if seized with a faint recollection , " but no  --  and yet  --  it is not possible !  --  I 'm not speaking to little Seth ? " " The same , " cried Seth ; " and , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave or knowledge , to  --  " Harry 's surprise was not diminished by what followed , for Seth , seizing the hand of Mary , raised it passionately to his lips , and implanted upon the same a first-rate , full-sized , unequivocal kiss . " And the great traveller is grown too proud to take the least notice of his little nephew , " cried Mary . " What ! " exclaimed Harry , starting up . " The baby , then , is n't  --  " " Is n't what ? " demanded Mr. Lennox . " What do you mean , sir ? " A sudden peal of laughter announced their discovery of his mistake , which was made more perceptible by the joyful enthusiasm with which he instantly hastened to the side of Miss Elton , and , extending his hand , said , " Fanny , tell me the truth ! Are we friends or enemies ? " " As you please , " said Fanny , with a very bad attempt at perfect indifference . " Well , I please to be friends ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  married ! " echoed Miss Elton , with an astonishment too obvious to leave much doubt on that delicate point . " Nor going to be ? " " You good-for-nothing young dog ! " cried Mr. Lennox , " the girl has refused a dozen of the best matches in town for you ! " " Is that true , Fanny ? " demanded Harry , in an agitation he did not even try to repress . She was silent , and once more turned away her head ; but her distress , her blushes , her tears , revealed in a moment the interesting fact . " And Emmerson , then ? " cried Harry , bewildered . " Is a rascal ! " said Lennox , sternly . " Emmerson ! " exclaimed Harry . " I knew  --  I was sure it was that Mr. Emmerson 's doings , " said Mary . " Fanny , " said Harry , with more calmness , " in the presence of all these beloved ones , hear me declare that , from the first moment I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love you . What error has been between us I can not say ; but I have been given to understand  --  " He stopped . " And I , " said Fanny , " was informed  --  " And she stopped . " And I suppose you were both laid under a promise of secrecy when the sly calumniator whispered his poison , " said Mary . " Did n't I always tell you he was a deceitful , selfish fellow ? " said Seth . " You were going to horsewhip me , you know , sir , for saying so , once upon a time . " " And I 'll horsewhip you now if you say the contrary ! " exclaimed Mr. Lennox . CHAPTER XLII . It would take a very thick volume to tell all the conversation , the confidences , the discoveries , etc. , which gave wings to that night , before the very late ( or , rather , very early ) hour at which the circle separated . Poor Frank was first brought on the tapis , and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been handed him at the dinner table , and which had been found in his pocket when the body was brought home , was produced , and with it two curls of hair , cut from his forehead by the mother , in sportive affection , the evening before his death , and looking as bright and shining as if his careless forehead and flashing eyes were still beaming beneath . The family picture of the dinner-party by Brigham was also taken down . These sad but precious mementoes were gazed at with mournful tears and hearts deeply impressed and awed . But ten years had glided away since the catastrophe , and time softens the keenest sorrow . When all the circumstances which could be remembered were communicated , both respecting him , and Middleton and Glendenning , there was a pause of solemn and deep recollection , which was suddenly interrupted by a scream . ( Mary started , but the reader need not do so , for we have done with horrors for the present . ) The said scream announced the awaking of Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , with a look of intense alarm , clasped her hands and darted out of the room , and was immediately followed by Seth , also in some apparent trepidation  --  true father  --  fashion ! " Let them go , " said Mr. Lennox . " If Master Frank Copely do but sneeze , one would think the world had come to an end at least ! I wonder grandmamma has n't rushed up also to the rescue ! " " Do n't believe him , my son , " said Mrs. Lennox ; " he is by far the worst of us all , and does nothing but spoil the baby the whole day long . But I must seize the occasion of Seth 's absence to tell you a little into his mystery . You must know he is already a celebrated man . " " One of the most promising lawyers at the New-York bar , " said Fanny . " His eloquence  --  you 've no idea ! you ca n't conceive ! " cried Mrs. Elton ; " it is the talk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court-room is invariably crowded . He is destined to a most brilliant career . A more severe student has not been seen . He has been begged to go to Congress , but he refuses , and  --  " " He has already brought back nearly all my business , and is worth five thousand dollars a year , " said Mr. Lennox . " He is making fame and fortune as fast as he can . " " A sweet , noble nature , " remarked Mrs. Lennox . " I always told you , " resumed Mrs. Elton , " that Seth was a dear little fellow , and would do you all honour one of these days . The first time he spoke  --  oh , there is a history well worth telling  --  a real romance  --  you see one day  --  " " But what do you mean by his bringing back your business ? " inquired Harry . " Had you lost your business ? " " You must know , " said Mrs Elton , and she went on with the story , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you , " said his father . " Emmerson , whom I took out of jail , whom I brought forward , who owes everything to me , and whom I trusted as if he had been an angel out of heaven , has shown himself nothing but a deceitful , sly , selfish hypocrite . " " What ! Emmerson ? " " Full of tricks so mean , that their very meanness is in some degree his protection , for people wo n't believe them . " " I can scarcely credit what I hear , " exclaimed Harry . " When I met with my losses , " continued his father " ( for you must know , my dear boy , I am not by one half so rich as I was when you left ) , this man , in proportion as I grew unfortunate , began to manifest his real character , but in a way so wily and cunning that no one would believe he was doing anything wrong . " " Perhaps you have suspected him unjustly , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he has managed so skilfully , that it is very difficult to expose him to any one else as he merits . " " Nor do we wish to do so , " said Mrs. Lennox . " We are out of his reach , I hope  --  so let him go . " " First , " continued Mr. Lennox , " I lost Frank ; then the news of your affair with Lord Middleton reached here , and was much commented upon ; some severe strictures on all of us appeared in the papers . You and Frank were stigmatized as mere brawlers and rous . It was mentioned that you were an intemperate man , and had been seen quite intoxicated in the street , and that I was , at times , deranged , in consequence of grief and shame . By a fortunate accident , which Emmerson little suspects , I have traced these infamous slanders to him . " " You amaze me . " " At length I suffered a series of pecuniary losses , which at one time threatened to ruin me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell dangerously ill . During this time Emmerson had speculated and made his fortune , and , do you believe ? I never knew a word of it , so sly was he . It was at this period that , after having ( as I have ascertained to my satisfaction ) secretly done all in his power to calumniate and injure me  --  it was at this time that , instead of stepping forward to save me and my family from ruin , he chose to suddenly withdraw from a connexion with me . How he managed I can scarcely say , but he did manage to carry with him the greatest part of my business . He stands high . By turning , and winding , and watching , and creeping forward , aided by a keen , sharp , and indefatigable mind , he has acquired , and perhaps he deserves , the reputation of a successful lawyer . There I was , sick , blind , slandered , wretched , threatened with utter destitution , scarcely any business in my office , and no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while pretending the deepest interest in me , visited my family , continually offered advice , and kept up such a bland and affectionate demeanour , that your mother and the girls for a long time would not and could not believe he had ever intended to do us the least wrong . " " And I really can not believe  --  " said Harry . " Stop , " said his father , " till you hear the end . One day I was led into court , to attend a trial which had excited an intense interest throughout the whole state . I was ill and weak  --  nearly blind , too ; but I went and took my place at the table with the rest . The counsel for the defence was a young man who had never been heard of before . He rose to speak . The room was crowded to overflowing . The cause of his client was almost a hopeless one . But he had not addressed the jury half an hour before the audience , excited by eloquence the most remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of rules and prohibitions , greeted him with a burst of clamorous , irrepressible applause . As he proceeded in the conduct of his case , in the examination and cross-examination of the witnesses , in the logical clearness and irresistible reasoning of his closing speech , and the admirable eloquence with which he at length committed his cause to the jury , he displayed a master-mind cultivated in a very high degree . I had never in my life been more moved ; and when the jury brought in a verdict for his client without leaving the box , I heard nothing around me but bursts of delight and admiration , and predictions that the young advocate , if such talents could be retained in so narrow a circle , would assume at once the first place at the New-York bar . Everybody sought to compliment him , to be presented to him , and I among the rest . " You ask to be presented to me , ' he said , with surprise , while I have been longing for years to approach you , but dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  dare not ! ' cried I. " Is it possible you do not recognise me ? ' " Recognise you ! Why , who are you , sir ? ' " What ! you have forgotten little Seth ! ' " Oh ! I thought I should have hugged the young dog in my arms . I had at that time just found out Emmerson , too . " I have no way of repairing my injustice , ' said I. " Yes , you have . ' " And how ? ' " I learn you are at last abandoned by that generous and frank gentleman whose name I wo n't mention , but of whom my opinion remains unchanged . ' " Yes , yes , he has left me . ' " Let me supply his place . ' " You ? ' " I. If study , diligence , perseverance , determination , affection , gratitude , and  --  ' " Stop , sir . Do I understand you to offer to conduct my business ? ' " Yes , yes ; it has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my noble , fine fellow ! ' " We are rather public here , sir , ' replied he , gently ; let me call on you and talk it over . ' " Well , he did so . The first thing I knew , he was installed in my office , and had brought many of my clients back to me . He soon afterward , by a singular accident , procured incontrovertible proof that Emmerson  --  " . " Well , well ! let him go , " said Mrs. Lennox . " You know , my dear husband , you can never speak on this subject without getting too much excited , and you have promised me not to speak of it at all . It is enough that we have suspicions , not hastily conceived , that Mr. Emmerson is a sly and selfish person , and that in secret he has never been our friend , even when we were heaping him with favours , and when he was professing for us the utmost friendship . To put your doubts to rest , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated to you anything respecting Fanny , which caused you to wish to separate yourself from her ? " " He has ; but I am not at liberty to say what . " " I , also , " said Fanny , " have been deceived by him in regard to you , though I , too , am bound not to say how . " " Leave him , then . Shakspeare has already told us it is not a year or so that shows us a man , ' " said Mrs. Lennox . " But to return to Seth , " continued Mr. Lennox . " Each day made his talents more evident and his brilliant success more certain . There was only one thing which displeased me . I could never fix him to any arrangement as to his rights and his portion of the income of the office . One day I called him to account for this , and told him he must not carry generosity to Quixotism . " You mistake me , ' said he . I am not fearful you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant what I require . ' " I was amazed . " What do you require ? ' demanded I. " Your daughter , sir . ' " What Mary ? ' " Even so . ' " And she ? ' " Has done me the honour to refer me to you . ' " In a week they were married . The business of the office increased . Some of my former friends and clients continue cold and estranged , and put all their business into the hands of Emmerson ; but we have , notwithstanding that , more than we can attend to . I recovered a part of the property I had supposed irretrievably gone , just in time to save this house and Rose Hill , and I am once more on safe ground again . Now , sir , if you choose to launch yourself in your profession , never young man had a better career before him . You can look about at your leisure , and find some one to take care of you . In case you do n't succeed , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to have any owner ! I can tell a little historiette , also , on this subject . Since you left we have , somehow or other , discovered  --  " Harry 's eyes here sought those of Fanny , who , with a deep blush and an expression of conscious guilt ( although surely guilt never before looked so interesting ) , rose , stole softly round to Mr. Lennox 's chair , and placed her hand over his mouth . The delighted old gentleman seized it and drew her towards him . Instead , however , of his usual somewhat boisterous mirth , he kissed her affectionately on the forehead , and said , " Fanny , you have heard what this prodigal son of mine has said . He loves you . Be sincere , my girl , and let me reward his constancy by telling him that you have twice had men of fame and fortune at your feet , and rejected them because  --  because  --  in short , because  --  " " She would never bestow her hand without her heart , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as that , " said Fanny , laughing in the most charming confusion imaginable . " And when the little heart is already gone  --  hey ! shall not the hand follow ? " There was a moment 's pause . " Fanny , " said Harry , in a low voice , " ten years ago , in this room , on this spot , I told you I loved you . Despite all my efforts ( and some of yours )  --  despite years , and travel , and grief , and experience , I love you still ! Time has deprived me of many a hope , many an opinion  --  has cast upon me many shadows , many changes ; but , as regards yourself , I am not changed . One word from your lips will convince me that all I have heard , all I have been led to believe , all I have seen , is reconcilable with that pure and steady affection I once hoped from you . Tell me , then , do you love me ? Will you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but gave him her hand . " Heydey ! heydey ! " cried Mr. Lennox . " That 's no way to make love : assert your rights . " Unable longer to restrain her emotion , poor Fanny fairly burst into tears , upon which Harry , with gentle but deep tenderness , caught her to his bosom , and , for the first time , dared to print on her lips the kiss of faithful love , with not more resistance than the established etiquette on such occasions , and the presence of the three spectators , rendered absolutely necessary . " That 's better , " cried his father . " My own Fanny , my sweet wife , " cried Harry , taking the small liberty to repeat the operation . " Hallo , hallo , that 's enough ! " cried Mr. Lennox . " Every one in his turn . I think I 've a small account to settle with this young lady . " And said account was balanced forthwith . " Have I allowed myself to be misled by a scoundrel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feelings ? to remain those long , dark years away from you ? to part from you so coldly while my very heart was breaking ? " " You might have left out your order about the portmanteau ! " said Fanny , looking at him reproachfully . " But confess ! " cried Harry ; " you did set the example . You remember that morning when  --  " " I was but a girl , " said she . " Tut ! tut ! so you are now , " cried Mr. Lennox . It is not necessary to note in detail all the interesting congratulations interchanged between Mr. and Mrs. Lennox and Mrs. Elton during this little denouement , or their manner towards Fanny when her future position was thus summarily settled ; suffice it to say , that embraces , exclamations of delight , diversified occasionally by a few tears of happiness , were the order of the day . The agreeable scene was interrupted by the re-entrance of the parents of Master Copely . " My baby 's asleep , " said Mrs. Copely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! " echoed Mr. Lennox , in the same tone . " The supper 's ready , ladies and gempleman ! " said Simon , entering with his shining ebon countenance , from which beamed forth a prodigious display of white teeth . " But , bless my soul ! " cried Lennox , " it 's three o'clock . Pretty supper-time , indeed ! " " Supper been ready two hours ago  --  called massa fourteen times ! Nobody listen ! " cried Simon , respectfully . Harry took the loved hand which had so unexpectedly become his own , and led Fanny into the dining-room . Dark , sad changes had taken place since last he had seated himself at that table . But , despite the solemn and terrible things of the past ( for thus is constituted the human heart ) , all were happy . Gloomy recollections were banished , or caused to be shed only tears that rose and fell at moments , and came like shadows over the summer hills . Perhaps the supper was n't the most tempting that ever was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , and perhaps there was no popping off of Champagne corks , and perhaps the inflowing upon Harry of this new happiness did n't throw around him a manly grace and dignity which had never been seen in him before , and perhaps Fanny 's eyes did not venture at last , unchecked by fear , to rest upon his face with pride and love , and perhaps he did not think , as he gazed on her countenance and perfect form , that , if it had not been the Christian 's duty to forgive , he could never pardon Emmerson for having cast one instant 's sorrow over that ingenuous and affectionate heart  --  for having once brought tears into those eyes  --  though he could n't but say the moisture occasionally visible there gave them a very curious , and , in fact , rather extraordinary power over his feelings . CONCLUSION . After all , the story is n't half told . There is Randolph , a very good fellow , as the world goes , but who has a fearful account to render one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to shoot any man who looks at him  --  a dashing , gay fellow , much courted in society , and particularly by the women . He never speaks of Frank . What his reflections are , and what they will be as age creeps over him , and the world beings to slip away from him , he will doubtless learn too soon . He has once or twice , by chance , met Mrs. Lennox . But there is something in her glance which checks his gayety and chills his heart . White may be seen any day at the Traveller 's Club in London , or in one of the stalls of the Queen 's Theatre , or driving an extremely handsome horse and cab through the crowds of Hyde Park . He has grown stouter than he was . His countenance is larger and somewhat bloated . Pleasure , the great object of his life , has been found and enjoyed . He has many acquaintances , but no friends . He lives for himself , in a continual round of luxuries , plays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recently discovered that he has the gout . He is considered a rou , an egotist , and a man of the world  --  a person particularly dangerous to insult , but a very pleasant fellow to dine with . Holford , whom the reader may remember as the rival orator of Harry at a public meeting in the earlier part of the story , contrary to Mr. Lennox 's prediction , has " turned out " a great man , and been elected governor of one of the Western States . He has found his emptiness and impudence rather advantageous than otherwise , and has often " taken the shine " off of better men by a bold display of puff , pomposity , and pretension . Whether he will ever be actually president , is more than we can say . He is himself understood not to discountenance the idea . Mr. and Mrs. Henderson , we are sorry to be obliged to state , behaved very improperly to the Lennoxes at the time when they believed themselves ruined . Mr. Henderson had become rich by land speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talking man ) to get out of the scrape and place his large gains in a safe investment just before the crisis . He coldly declined rendering the least assistance to his generous patron when it would have been of great benefit to him , and Mrs. Henderson was very open in expressing her indignation that , under the circumstances , they should have asked it . She had always foreseen and predicted the downfall of the Lennox family  --  such extravagance , pride , folly , etc. , etc. , etc. , really merited a lesson . She acknowledged that she " of all persons " ought not to speak against them , but she found it proper to overcome her personal habits and inclinations , from that sense of imperative duty which often obliges such people to traduce their friends and benefactors  --  particularly in their misfortunes . Emmerson continues to advance in his profession , and has already laid the foundation of a large fortune . He was among the foremost to congratulate Harry on his safe return , and came very often to take tea with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ( when certain it would not be required ) , he earnestly requested that any assistance he could render might be asked for without hesitation , and expressed himself too grateful for past favours to permit of his neglecting any opportunity to repay them . He ( almost ) persuaded both Harry and his wife ( the reader will not require to be more particularly informed , we hope , who Mrs. Harry Lennox had been before her marriage ! ) that they must have been mistaken in him , and there are not wanting people a plenty to this day who believe him to be as honest , kind hearted , and amiable a man as he is a sharp and diligent lawyer . To be sure , Seth , although , in the fulness of his happiness , he has scarcely time to cherish uncharitable feelings , is rather distant and reserved to his extremely bland and polite old master , yet , when the latter takes the baby on his knee and lets him play with his watch-chain , the good-hearted papa acts as if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and makes a courteous apology for the absence of his father-in-law , who , by some inexplicable chance , always happens to step out of the room as Emmerson is announced , and remains absent till he takes his leave , when Fanny runs into the study , and brings him back with the cabalistic words , " He 's gone at last , sir ! " Glendenning , poor fellow , has recently died somewhere in the East . A letter from him was subsequently received by Mrs. Lennox , which agitated and touched her extremely . But the contents have never transpired out of the family . And Harry himself  --  we scarcely dare begin to speak again of him  --  of the changes around him and within him . He never had been gay . The high spirits of his father had in him always been tempered with reflection . Now , perhaps , although happy beyond his wildest expectation , he was still graver . Deep thoughts and high feelings possessed him . He never forgot the great lesson he had learned abroad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if adversity would not have subdued , prosperity could not elate him . He applied himself to his profession with so much zeal that his friends speedily became aware of his splendid talents for the noble career he had chosen , and perhaps the world will hear more of him hereafter . We can answer for him , however , that , whatever befall him , he will be found an honest man , sincere and just in his dealings with all his fellow-creatures , far too wise and good to forget , in the temptations and struggles of his present position , that this world , with all its bliss and all its wo , is but the short path to another , to become worthy of which is his predominant thought . It is said that a very uncommonly pretty little girl , who answers to the name of " Fanny , " has recently been added to the domestic circle . She is a great favourite with Emmerson , and is just learning to call Mrs. Elton grandmamma , which excellent lady , at the last advices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the preceding pages , the writer has altered the names of persons and places , he has not the less endeavoured to give , with an accuracy not greatly deviating from the truth , one of the cloud of dark and bloody associations which , to the shame of a Christian city , hangs over Hoboken .
