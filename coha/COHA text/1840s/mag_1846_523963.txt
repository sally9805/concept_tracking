txt " Txn Civilization of the Age** is one of those large , loose phrases with which all are familiar , but which few take the trouble to understand . What is civilization ? And what share have we Americans in it ? If we were to believe some of our English brethren , both our claims and our prospects are very meagre . The French , having no petty rivalries or old grudges to gratify , and cherishing as they do the comfortable assurance of being at the head of all the world in social culture , treat us with a little more consideration . That both French and English should deem themselves our superiors in civilization , is natural-nay more-is just ; but that the Roman Catholic Irish should affect to look down upon our social and intellectual progress with contempt , is quite too severe a rebuke to our national vanity . A distinguished Irish priest of Philadelphia is reported to have said lately , at a public meeting in his native country , " that the number of educated , enlightened and civilized men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small . " Now , if any word of ours could wound the feelings or depreciate the character of any people or of any individual , the Irish should be the last against whom that word should be uttered . From our hearts we honor the many beautiful and noble traits by which , as a people , they are distinguished . We deeply sym pathize with them , groaning , as they are and long have been , under an accumulation of wrong and insolence and oppression , disgraceful to others , but not to themselves . That they do not excel us in civilization is no fault of theirs ; but in believing that they do not , we hold no strange or singular opinion . The late Dr. Arnold , a fast friend of Ireland and Irish rights , used to say , " There is more to be done in Ireland than in any other corner of the world . I had , at one time , a notion of going over there and taking Irish pupils , to try what one man could do towards civilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentry . " " Whether Ireland remain in its present barabarism , or grow in health and civilization , in either case the downfall of the present establishment is certain ; a savage people will not endure the insult of a hostile religion , a civilized one will reasonably insist on having their own . " But if we are mistaken , and Ireland can furnish a greater proportion of " educated , enlightened and civilized men " than our own country , we shall sincerely rejoice . Next to Ireland herself , no other nation could have so great occasion to congratulate themselves on such a fact as we ; for then , as things are going , we may reasonably hope to be , ere long , thoroughly saturated with the good leaven ourselves . Having referred to this instance chiefly in order to show that the high opinion of // ourselves which we are accustomed unquestioningly to cherish , is far from commanding universal assent , and meets with some very unexpected rebudit from abroad , we dismiss , henceforth , all particular comparison of ourselves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss , in a more general way , the comparative merits and characteristi cs of Cisatlantic and Transatlantic Civilization . But , as men are prone to he such parrots in the use of familiar words , and as few of us have ever thought of giving ourselves a distinct account of what we mean by civilization , and further , as there seems to he such amazing discrepancies of opinion in the application of the term , it may not be inopportune to devote some space to a preliminary inquiry into its true meaning and actual acceptation . Not that we flatter ourselves with being able to give a perfect and satisfactory definition of it , but by considering it in various aspects we may approximate its true idea , and certainly shall be less likely to misunderstand each other . To many minds , one of the first notions suggested by the term , is that of certain conventional forms of social life ; certain styles of eating , drinking , sitting , walking ; of dress , conversation , manners . All these have , indeed , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish our regard for them ; we need , rather , to have it increased . But , so far from constituting civilization , they are the mere form and cut of its garments . Were they all , civilization would be resolved into politeness , or would have somewhat the same relation to society which politeness has to individuals . People sometimes talk of a true and a false politeness , endeavoring to distinguish its show from its substance ; but , after all , the outside , the show , the form , are all the substance there is in it ; and by their merits it must stand or fall . But is there nothing higher , deeper and more solid contained in civilization ? Montezuma held a most splendid court . All the forms of procedure and address were most fastidious and precise . Never , perhaps , was there seen a more pompous ceremonial . Most brilliant , too , was the display of dresses , plumes , gold and jewelry . But were the Mexicans therefore civilized ? Some manners there must be , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituting its essence  --  the Trollopes and Hamiltons  --  the D'Orsays and danc ing-masters , to the contrary notwithstanding . In manners , the Chinese and Japanese are very different from us-in many respects quite the reverse ; yet nothing but vulgar prejudice would deem them altogether uncivilized ; and this vulgar prejudice they return with usury against us " outside barbarians . " Indeed , next to the ridiculousness of their contempt for us is that of ours for them . Another notion often associated with civilization is that of wealth and luxury . Here we must distinguish the case of individuals from that of communities . With respect to individuals , wealth and luxury , it is evident , are not exponents of their relative civilization . Because a man can surround himself with sumptuotis furniture , load his table with delicious viands , array himself in gorgeous apparel and ride in his coach and sixis he therefore more civilized than his neighbors who must live in simpler style , content themselves with coarser fare , and when they go abroad must walk ? Riches take to themselves wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it a thing transferable by bond or mortgage , or recoverable in a suit at law ? Or , because a man buys an elegant piano-forte , has he , of course , a better taste in music than another whose soul is tuned to melody , but whose voice is the only instrument within his reach ? Is the opulent and haughty merchant , with his score of ships pouring wealth into his coffers from every clime , therefore more civilized than the poorscholaror artist who begs a passage in the meanest of those ships , that he may study the literature , manners and arts of other nations , and thus cultivate his mind and taste ? Or , finally , the owner of a magnificent estate , who rides round among his farms or strolls over his beautiful grounds with the proud consciousness , " all this is mine " - is he therefore more civilized than the pious peasant who looks with rapture on the same objects , and exclaims , " My Father made them all "  --  or than the lover of nature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstasy the beauty and enchantments of the sceneor even than the humble student , the botanist or mineralogist who here finds the means of enlarging his knowledge of the kingdoms of nature ? in short , are idleness and dissipation , plethora and gout , avarice and purse-pride , indices of high culture and refinement ? Certainly not . Filling a man 's head with dollars , // his stomach with dainties , or his limbs with diseases , will not civilize him . What more degraded objects can human society present than the miser and the epicure ? And if there is any folly in the world greater than the pride and selfsufficiency of the rich , it is the repining and envy of the comparatively poor we beg pardon-there is one greater folly still : it is that of him who , without the means , endeavors to imitate the vices and the show of wealth , and often , like the frog in the fable , bursts in the unlucky attempt . But if we would ascertain the true relation of wealth to civilization , we ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a class , it must be admitted , the rich are likely to be more highly cultivated than the poor . As will appear by a due consideration of what has been already said , wealth furnishes facilities , means and excitements for social culture , and when a proper use is made of it , civilization is certainly promoted thereby . This effect is still more likely to follow in respect to communities than classes , for though great wealth may not benefit its possessors , it is almost certain to improve society in general , by promoting the various arts that adorn human life and cultivate the human mind . Yet , fully admitting all this , we shall not find that the civilization of different countries has been , or is proportional to their wealth . In wealth , England is greatly superior to France , but according to the unanimous testimony of continental Europe , France has ever been superior to England in civilization . Were the effeminate Lydians , with Crcesus for their king , more civilized than the Spartans with their money of leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true there was always something lacking in the social culture of the Spartans-they were never so highly civilized as their more inquisitive and communicative , though often conquered neighbors , the Athenians-there was always a remnant of rudeness and coarseness in their character ; yet in civilization they were undeniably superior to many far more wealthy conteinporary nations . As for luxury , which is sometimes represented as the highest proof and fairest flower o* ' civilization-it is rather its gangrene and plague-spot . It pre-supposes civilization as death pre-supposes life . It proves the existence of civilizaVOL. 111. - NO . Yr. 40 tion as the fastening of a vampyre proves the presence of a living body . Civilization alone can furnish it its food , but in the act she is drained of her life-blood and dies . If a universal history of the progress of civilization were written , what part would Nineveh with its Sardanapalus , Babylon with its Belshazzar , or Persia with its Artaxerxes and Darii claim therein ? Even those forms of civilization which contained other and immortal elements , elements which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own times , were driven from their ancient seats by luxury . So it was with the Grecian and Roman civilization . So it was with that of the Italian republics in the middle ages , which for a time exhibited an almost miraculous display of genius , courage , activity , prosperity . But commerce and enterprise introduced wealth . They knew not how rightly to use or enjoy it - they fell into luxury and effeminacy , with their accompanying vices , cruelty and selfishness , and so were ruined . In short , all history conspires to teach that great wealth is not an indispensable means , nor is luxury a healthy symptom of a high degree of civilization . But it will be confidently anticipated by many , that in the general and equable distribution of the means of external wellbeing , especially if this be joined with a general diffusion of the elements of useful knowledge , we have the test and measure of the social progress of any community . But if , in the time of Louis XIV. , several countries of Europe be compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly in their favor , though France then stood confessedly at the head of European culture . Sparta was probably ' superior to Athens in these respects , though less highly civilized . So probably are Prussia and the United States at this moment superior to England or France ; yet Prussia will freely acknowledge both England and France to be before her in civilization , and it is hardly worth while for us to contest the point in our favor with the unanimous voice of the civilized world against us . Finally , to bring the question more nearly home to our apprehensions ; compare the population of one of our large cities with the scattered inhabitants of the country in respect to general comfort and intelligence , and we suspect the comparison would turn out in favor of the latter ; yet all will allow that on the whole the cities are the great // centres of civilization . Thus we conclude that though the points referred to are important elements in the progress of social improvement , civilization includes other elements which may more than counterbalance them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religion ? 1'hese play a most noble part in civilization . It can never long exist without them . A perfect religion is a necessary condition to its own perfection . Hence Christianity is unquestionably the highest form which civilization has ever yet assumed . But that the proper civilization of different countries and times is not proportioned to the degree in which religion and virtue prevail , will appear by an appeal to a few facts . Is Switzerland more civilized than France ? Was the Germany of Luther 's time more civilized than is the Germany of the present day ? Was the Athens of Aristides more civilized than that of Demosthenes ? Was the Rome of the elder Brutus , of Cincinnatus , or of iReguIns more civilized than the Rome of Cataline and Augustus ? Common sense answers no ! and we need multiply examples no further . If , then , civilization is proportional neither to the general virtue , nor general intelligence , nor general comfort-if , in some instances , it may go on increasing while these diminish-is it a. thing worth troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let us not be too hasty . It is plain we have an idea of civilization which contains the elements already enumerated ; but it is equally plain they do not constitute its leading or essential character . And further , it is plain that , according to the ideal we form to our minds , civilization is a good thing-most noble and most desirable-though in its imperfect and distorted practical manifestations it contain or be associated with many evils . But these manifestations , though evil when considered in their immediate connection , may in a wider view , in relation to the progress of the human race , be necessary links in the advancement of the good towards its consummation . They may be regulated as transition states-as merely the awkward age in passing from the childish simplicity of rude times to a manly maturity not yet attained . After all , it is true , civilization may be too highly extolled-being displaced from its own subordinate sphere , and elevated to the highest which belongs only to religion-just as good manners may be taught as of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whatever its merits , it plainly contains other elements than have yet been mentioned . Some will think it strange that the claims of Freedom should so long have been overlooked . In this country we are naturally disposed to assign them a very high value  --  and rightly , if our views of freedom are sufficiently elevated and pure . If , by personal freedom , we understand the manly consciousness of power chastened by the attendant consciousness of responsihility ; the due attempering , the healthy unfolding and harmonious action of all the faculties of man , not only as an individual hut as a social being-uncramped by outward restraint , and undistorted by inward perversity :  --  and if , by civil freedom , we understand the harmony of all the social relations , where every man naturally and without any undue obstruction finds the place which , in relation to others , he is best fitted to fill , and where whatever things are just , honest and lovely are encouraged , and whatever things are wrong and unseemly are checked and suppressed : - if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed a most important condition of high attainment in civilization . But if of personal freedom we have merely the gross notion of a lawless caprice-of a consciousness of ihe most perfect individual independence-if we imagine a state of human existence , ( for it can not be called society , ) where everybody does what is right in his own eyes , or what is wrong in his own eyes , if he please , and scarcely acknowledges any superior ; where there is no system of government , or where the ideal of that boasted sort of " government which governs least 's is realized ; where there are scarcely any general laws or general interests ; where each individual is his own law , his own sovereign , and his own god : if such be our idea of personal freedom , so far from such freedom being an element of civilization , it is the very index and characteristic of a savage state . Among savages you have liberty and equality in their unrestrained and perfect form . And if , by civil and political freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a monarchy or an aristocracy-not to say that those forms of themselves by no means exclude despotism and op // pression  --  the history of the world , and the present state of Christendom , conspire to demonstrate that such a type of freedom is essential neither to the progress nor to a high ( observe , we do not say the highest ) advancement of civilization . Little children , in their simplicity , are apt to think their fathers the most important personages in the world : in like manner , there are many among us who have grown up with the fixed idea , that we are not only the freest and happiest , hut the best educated and most civilized nation on earth . In their view , all that now remains to he done is to Americanize the world . We will not offend their prejudices by instituting a comparison between some of the old monarchies of Europe and ourselves . We will merely ask them if republican Switzerland is , in their opinion , more civilized than absolute Prussia , or monarchical France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished more republics , with which to continue the comparison . Over our South American sisters it is pious to throw a veil . But we will ask further , if France made no social progress under the despotic government of Louis XIV. ? or , if she has been going backward ever since the end of the Reign of Terror ? or , if England has remained stationary since Cromwell dismissed the Rump Parliament ? The inquiry here is not whether civilization is a desirable thing-it is only about facts , applying to them the term according to its ordinary and common-sense accepbation : and so applying it , we find that civilization-in the highest state it has yet reached-is not tied to the forms of a popular government . We shall have occasion to recur to this point hereafter , and must now hasten to conclude the answer to our preliminary question . We mention then , finally , as factors and products of civilization , Science , Literature and the Fine Arts , on the one hand ; and Commerce , with the Mechani. cal and Useful Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but its connection with the latter is much less direct than with the former . Its central idea is Science , Literature and the Fine Arts . If it is considered as a process , a becoming civilized , its central idea is progress in these departments ; and if it is considered as a state , a heing civilized , that idea is a high degree of attainment in them . The cultivation of the mind , the unfolding , the discipline , the enlarg ing and strengthening of the intellectual powers , and the refining of the tastes and sensibilities-this is not indeed the whole , but the central idea of civilization . Herein lies the very substance of the thing itself-while Commerce and the Mechanic and Useful Arts are but external mdans , aids , infl ences . The latter are but the leaves of the tree of civilization , while the former , if not the fruits , are at least the flowers . These views are fully borne out by a reference to history and facts . Of the comparative civilization of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grecian and the Roman tower high above all others as we look back over the wide waste of the past . To a hasty view *o other objects are visible . On a closer examination , however , appear evidences of a Jewish , an Egyptian , an Indian , a Saracenic civilization , but we refer them still to the same standard . Nineveb , Babylon , Tyre , Carthage , were immensly rich , immensely powerful ; but they are not known to have made any considerable advances in literature or the fine arts , and men are silent concerning their civilization . The same test we apply to modern nations . Thus we jud0e of the civilization of France , of England , of Germany ; and thus we infer that italy , Spain , and Portugal have been retrograding in later times . But to this point also , we shall have occasion to recur . If now we should venture to give a definition of civilization , it would bethe complete and harmonious development of man in all his appro* iate relations to this world-or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the powers and capacities f man considered as a social being ; espe ially of those higher faculties which characterize man 's proper nature ; and including the refinement of the manners , tastes and feelings . in reference to each man , considered individually , this process might be called humanization , i. e. , the complete drawing out and unfolding of his proper naturemaking him perfectly a man-realizing his ideal character ; ( and hence , with singularly beautiful appropriateness , the proper studies of a liberal education used to be called , not only the Arts , but the Humanities ) . But as the nature of man can be thns completely expanded only in society , the process is rightly called civilization . Man makes society , and society civilizes man . Civilization terminates therefore in the cultivation and // perfecting of individuals ; but it is a social cultivation and perfection . The self-improvement of each individual must go on in living connection with the obAervation and appreciation of the progress made by others . The more extensive these two processes are , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more perfect the result . It is the internal which is to be unfolded , hut it can he untblded only in connection with the external . The subjection is to be guided , corrected , stimulated by the objection : reflection , discipline are to he conjoined with observation , conversation , intercourse  --  the wider the better . This is the way in which war , and one of the ways in which commerce , exert so beneficial an influence on civilization . Hence the debt which modern Europe owes to the Crusades . To nothing is civilization more directly opposed than to narrowmindedness . A man truly civilized is distinguished for breadth and comprehension of view . He has what the Germans call a world-consciousness. lie carries ahout with him the familiar feeling that he is here in a world where there are not only New Englanders , with their peculiar prejudices and institutions - not only Americans and Europeans , but Iliudoos also , and Turks , and Tartars , and Chinese and Japanese , who , like his own neighbors , are all proud of their several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , where there have been Jews , Greeks , Romans , Egyptians and Arabians : in short , his mm is o a certain degree a geographical and historical omnipresence . He feels , moreover , that he is in vital connection with a race which has been , and is , in a process of development wherein he shares , from which he has received , and to which he must contribute . Lie is not a mere isolated individual . In all the fortunes of the race he takes sensible interest . lie is a man  --  and whatever concerns humanity comes home to his bosom . Columbus is said to have discovered America ; though multitudes were on the spot before him . But they knew only of the existence of their own tribes , and of their immediate neighbors , whom they chanced . o meet in war or hunting-they had no history , no future , i. e. , they were savages : they were not properly men ; and hence they are said to have been discovered as if they were mere things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreci ation . It enters with facility into the characters and ideas of other nations , and of more imperfect forms of social culture ; and by impartially judging them , includes and makes them its own . In fine , its idea , its mission is to bring into one , the past , the present and the future-all nations and all generations . Its spirit , therefore , is both conservative and progressive . It keeps up the continuity of the race . Its monuments are enduring . Its apostles live and labor for all time , though often obscure and neglected in their own . What share have we in such a civilization ? What are our claims and prospects as compared with the leading nations of Europe ? We proceed to offer some views in answer to these queries with a deep sense of insufficiency , but at the same time with a clear consciousness of an earnest and impartial spirit . If what shall be said be true and sound as far as it goes , we trust that , in view of the immensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deficiencies . We , Americans , are often accused of indulging a vain and boastful spirit-and not without reason ; though it seems to be quite forgotten by our accusers that we are not altogether singular in this respect-nor are our boasts altogether groundless-nor is it a greater sin to boast than to traduce . If we boast more than others , it is because we have more people among us who take it into their heads that they have a right to think for themselves , and not only for themselves but for the rest of the world-more mouths which are opened not only to utter the minds of their owners , but to serve as the organs of the nation . Every little village newspaper dares to speak in the name of the American people ; and every petty 4th of July orator and Lyceum lecturer , considers himself the pro tempore mouth-piece of the whole country . Now it is certainly assuming more than any considerate man will venture to maintain , to suppose that we can furnish such myriads of men with views equally enlarged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand forth as the representatives of other nations . Among the mass of the people in most other countries , there is probably as deep-seated a feeling of their national superiority as there is among ourselves ; hut this feeling is among them comparatively silent , because there is too little // mental activity to attempt its utterance , and too little consciousness of the mere existence of any rival to furnish so much as a motive for expressing it . Thus much in defence of our alleged habit of selflaudation -- as against others ; yet as among ourselves , far be it from us to say one word in its defence . It is a fault which , so far as it exists , is a symptom of narrow-mindedness , and therefore a drawback to our claims to the true spirit of civilization . But before dismissing this topic , we can not forbear some further comments upon the increasingly contemptuous and insolent tone which British travelers and British criticism , and the British press generally , have chosen to assume towards this country . What are the private griefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-we care not . They may be goaded on in the spirit of denunciation by pecuniary losses or pecuniary rewards ; and the explanation may be admitted in their personal defence , though not much to their personal honor ; but inasmuch as this has become the prevailino* almost universal spirit of the hi* 0hest literary organs of the British nation , it may fairly be assumed as indicating the general tone of English feeling-especially of the higher classes of English society , towards this country . England always felt towards us as a stepmother , and that feeling has not been softened by seeing her own children deprived in our favor of so fair a portion of the paternal inheritance . There was always something irresistibly ludicrous in the lofty bearing which every English writer felt himself entitled to assume towards America-though he had never seen beyond the narrow precincts of his native island  --  and if he had , it made no great difference ; he always carried England with him wherever he went-and though he might be little more than a beardless boy ; yet born himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt authorised and commissioned to assume towards us the office of a schoolmaster . Gravely seating himself in a pedagogue 's chair , he called us before him to take a lesson in manners and morals , and receive a severe castigation for our awkwardness and misdemeanors . English writers have not bantered us as gentlemen and equalsthey have assumed to chastise us as being themselves our acknowledged superiors and tutors . They have dealt not in goodhumored national raillery , but in contemptuous sneers and studied insults . And if we have resented or protested against such treatment , they coolly shrugged their shoulders and assured us we were altogether too thin-skinned . It is true we ought to have had self-respect enough to laugh at such preposter6us airs  --  to return silence for contempt , and pity for insult . But the fact is , we had cherished a reverential regard for England as the home and the burial-place of our common ancestors ; and , forgetting that the present generation of English were no older or more venerable than ourselves , we naturally tr nsferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother country . Hence our soreness . They knew their advantage and they have abused it . Latterly they have seemed determined to cure us of our thin-skinned sensitiveness and childish veneration both together , and we trust by the time they have exhausted their store of vituperation-if , indeed , there is any more ink in the bottle-they will have succeeded to their hearts ' content . As to English travelers-they are the same everywhere . They seem to regard all the rest of the world as made expressly for Englishmen to travel in , and to judge well or ill of it accordiag as it suits their traveling convenience . Every class of creatures is affected by things according to its own nature . The books of English travelers in this country always remind us of the far-traveled stork in the fable , who , when the fox asked of him an account of the foreign lands he had visited , began to name over all the stagnant pools , the bogs and marshes where he had found the most savory worms and the fattest frogs . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition and institutions , but of our very geography . Men moving in the most respectable society in England have not so distinct an idea of the geography of this country as our school-boys ordinarily have of that of Caffiaria or the Barbary States-not to say , of England , for obvious reasons . We have seen a forty shilling atlas , published in London in the year of our Lord 1840 , in which the separate map of the United States exhibited but fourteen States ; one of the old thirteen , New Hampshire , being omitted ; and , of the new States , only Vermont and Kentucky added . The palpable and ludicrous blunders of Alison in his history of the late war between this country and // Great Britain , have already been , in part , exposed in the pages of this Review . They are not lapses of inadvertence , but sins of sheer ignorance . He evidently knew no better than to call New England one of the States of the Unioa by the side of Massachusetts and Connecticut ! Yet Alison is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genemtion . His is no light , ephemeral rroduction , but most grave and elaborate . lIe lays extraordinary claims to accuracy and fairness ; and no historian , since Gibbon , has made so much pretension in the way of rhetoric and philosophy . But in writing about this country , he seems to have thought it unnecessary to possess himself of the merest outline of its geography . The English may think us not worth knowing much about ; hut a well-informed man ought to know more of Abyssinia or Greenland , especially if he undertook to publish a map of it , or write its history . What but the unconscious effrontery of the purest ignorance can account for Alison 's gravely stating and publishing before the whole world , in a history which was to he the great work of his life ; " that one of the last acts of Washington 's life was to carry , by his casting vote in Congress , a commercial treaty with Great Britain ? " This is not merely a downright falsehood in point of fact , but shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , or that he had been too dull to comprehend its simplest provisions . Yet this man-professing great scrupulousness as to the exactness of his information in his statements about countrieshas had the audacity to sit in judgment on our institutions , and visit them with the most absolute and withering condemnation . If it should be said that the blunder above referred to is unimportant in itself , and furnishes no argument either for or against our institutions , we admit the extenuation though it does not cut off our inferences . But what shall be said of expressly basing an argument much to our disadvantage upon the assumed fact , that " all the State Judges , from the highest to the lowest , are elected by the people , and are liable to he displaced by themtheir tenure of office is sometimes for three , sometimes for four , sometimes for six years , but never for life . " And x*'hat shall be said of the incredible and incorrigible stupidity of a late British reviewer , who , after the facts have repeatedly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falsity of almost every word of Alison 's statement , ( for excepting the clause- " sometimes for six years " - every word of it is literally false , ) has been guilty of reiterating the stale slander in the following form , intended to express substantially the same thing , though in more guarded language : " The superiority of judges who are appointed by the President and for life , over the State judges , most of whom are elected by the people , and many hold for short terms , or at will , occasions a general wish to resort to the national courts. *** Now the facts in the case , as nearly as we have the means of ascertaining them at the moment of writing this , are , 1st . In respect to the term of office : the judges of the Supreme Courts- ( and in reference to any other than the Supreme Courts , the statement of the reviewer has no pertinency , ) the judges of the Supreme Courts , in fifteen out of twenty-seven States , hold their office during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances , of a certain age ; varying from seventy to sixty-five years , and , in one instance , being set as low as sixty . Here are a majority of the States , containing about eleven-seventeenths of the population of the whole Union . In eight of the remaining twelve States , the term of office of the highest judges varies from seven to twelve years ; in two States it is six years , in one it is five years , and in one it is one year . 2d . In respect to the mode of appointment ; the judges of the Supreme Courts , in fourteen of the States , are appointed by the Legislature ; in twelve of the States , by the Governor with the advice of a Senate or Council ; and , in one solitary State , they are elected by the people . In no case can they be removed by the direct action of the people . Are all these facts Americanisms ; which simply mean , when expressed in the King 's English- " most of the State judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short terms , or at will ? " Does the reviewer , peradventure , intend to say that , inasmuch as the Legislature are elected by the people , the judges appointed // by them are really though indirectly elected by the people also ? So is the President of the United States virtually and practically elected by the people , for the reviewer himself says truly that the College of Presidential Electors " have no more discretion than an En , , lish Dean and Chapter under a cong* d'aire . They are chosen as mere instruments , pledged to nominate a given candidate . " They are a mere form of returning the popular vote . But what then becomes of the contrast between the State and the national courts ? And who constitute the remainder to the " most ? " In a popular government how else could the judges he appointed , hut directly or indirectly by the people ? Would the Reviewer have the Legislature or the Executive hereditary , in order to make the appointment of judges independent of the people ? Why not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he the shorter and better way . We believe most of the arguments in favor of a hereditary executive and hereditary legislators will apply with equal , and many of them with greater , weight in favor of hereditary judges . Would the Reviewer think the establishment of a hereditary bench an improvement on the system of the English judiciary ? Or , on the other hand , would he think it an improvement on ours , to leave the Chief Justice of the United States , like the Lord High Chancellor of England , to be changed with every change in the political administration ? Or , would he think it a " conservative " innovation in our political system to abolish our glorious and venerable Constitution , and make our Congress , like the Parliament of England , theoretically omnipotent ; superior to all law , courts and constitutions whatever ; with power " to bind our judges at pleasure , and teach our counsellors wisdom ?

Where are the cases of corrupt or unreasonable decisions to he traced to such a dependence ? Have any such been alleged ? Not one . Only this dependence is extremely bad in theory . We think so too ; and where the judges hold their office during good behavior we should desire no change ; though it is very possible our feeling in this particular rests upon prejudice rather than facts . There are certainly some advantages in judges ' holding office for definite terms , provided those terms are not too short ; and the so much dreaded and deprecated dangers of such an arrangement will rarely he realized as long as the mass of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one moment compared with the evils actually arising from the delays of justice which have made the highest courts of England a by-word . That the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States are , as a body , superior to those of any State court in the Union-if not to those of any court in the world-we suppose is a fact . We should think it stran0 and much to be deplored , if it were not a fact . That prosecuting parties often ( not generally ) prefer the national to the State courts , we suppose , is also a fact . But that the reasons for this preference , implied in the statements of the Edinburgh Review , are rarely , if ever , the true reasons , we are assurednot being of the legal profession ourselves-by those who are intimately acquainted with the facts of the case . Indeed , we should seem to be driven to this inference , unless it is found that the disposition to resort to the national courts is greater in the State where the judges are appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people , than in those States where the judges are appointed by the Governors and hold office for life . We have never learned that any such diversity exists .

" // comprehension of the subject , to show our Transatlantic brethren that there are more things in the character and working of Americaa institutions than are dreamt of in their every-day philosophy . They must be content to take for granted , once for all , that the American Union is a phenomenon of some importance in the world-deserving and demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , with a spirit of docility and earnestness . The time is past when their one-sided , offiand , flippant judgments can longer pass current in the world , or quiet their own consciences as men of sense and intelligence . If they would learn what the character and working of our institutions are , they must condescend to go to school to us and study them . Even could they get the principles , they can not get the facts , by instinct . We earnestly advise English writers and critics-as they value their own reputation and characters  --  to take this subject into serious consideration. * Even in regard to " repudiation , " which seems to have excited the ire of our English brethren almost to frenzy , they betray at every step their profound ignorance . They talk and act as if the whole United States , individually and collectively , had " repudiated ' * their debts . They put us all alike under the ban , and treat the whole country as a " brigand confederacy " - one combined set of swindlers and pickpockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything of us if they will say nothing about us . But before John Bull tosses us all quite over the pale of civilization , it were well for him to consider the premises . The insinuated charge is indiscriminate , that America " repudiates " her debts . But how stands the case ? The gross amount of the debts of the several States has somewhat exceeded 200,000,000 of dollars . Aside from the unwise , and in some sense dishonest delay , on the part of a few of the States , under the pressure , it must at the same time be admitted , of extraordinary disappointments and disasters , to pay the annual interest on their debts , the whole business of " repudiation , " about which all this hue and cry has been raised , amounts to this : that , in one or two States , a certain portion of the debt-less , we believe , than $10,000,000 in all-has been declared fraudulent , and payment refused . Let shame rest on those who have perpetrated such an act of baseness and dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end of the country to the other . God forbid we should utter one word in extenuation of the deed . We all feel disgraced by itnot that ' we are in any wise responsible for it , but that we must go by the same name with its authors . But the British invite a comparison with themselves , as showing their vast superiority to us in point of general civilization . They pay their enormous debt , they say , or the interest of it , which is the same thing . But who pay it , and who receive the payment ? Who have the most commanding influence in the English Government , the payers or the payees ? They vote , with singular disinterestedness , that the money shall be paid  --  to whom ? To themselves . They take to themselves great credit for voting money out of other people 's pockets into their own . Out of other people 's pockets , shall we say ? The mass of those from whose sweat and toil the money ( in the last analysis , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed with the luxury of pockets-or of ever having anything in them . It is taken out of their mouths , and the mouths of their children-nay , torn from their very vitals . Let the money be paid , by all means ; but let the burthen fall , at east , as heavily on those who magnanimously vote the payment as on those who have no voice in the matter  --  and then let them boast . The British nation pays its debts . It is well . But at what rate , think you , would consols be quoted tomorrow , should it be announced that , thirty days hence , the question would be submitted , directly or indirectly , to the universal suffrage of the people of the British Empire-Rebeccaites , Chartists , Socialists , wild lrish , and allwhether they would bear their present burdens , or , by one act of national bank * Let us add here , that we should he sorry to seem uncourteous towards the Edinburgh Review . It is usually temperate in its language towards America ; and deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors against , us .

Who would trust in a favorable result from such a vote ? On the other hand , if , when our national debt was at its maximum , or at any other time , such a question had been submitted to the universal suffrage of this whole Union , who can doubt there would have been an overwhelming majority in favor of full and punctual payment ? There is abundant evidence that , at this moment , taking the country as a whole , the sentiments of the mass of our people on this subject are sound , and their action , in any possible event , would be honest and just ; and not only so , but even the delinquent States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses and retrieve their characters-as , indeed , the greater part of them have already done . Now , where is the country on the face of the globe , the mass of whose population are so cultivated and virtuous , that , being placed under similar circumstances , and divided into small , independent portions like our States , such a question could be submitted to them with consequences less disastrous than those which are deplored in this country ? If it be said that , though the general character of our people may be defended , still the fact of " repudiation " remains , and it is impossible to argue it away : that the fault of it must lie somewhere-if not on our people , then on our institutions-we answer , that we do consider it a defect in our political system , that the individual States should be allowed to contract debts without control and without responsibility . And , as we believe that the constitution , properly interpreted , prohibits it , so we could wish that instrument had been more explicit in its prohibitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the right of selfgovernment in order to avoid or remedy such evils as have resulted from this accidental defect in our institutions . Those evils will eventually remedy themselves , and be productive of permanent good . It is highly desirable that the tendency of the States to the contraction of debt should , in some way , be checked . We doubt not they will ultimately pay their present debts , learn a lesson of economy from experience , and if their credit abroad should suffer , it will be an additional security against rash expenditure in future . The English also taunt us with the existence of negro slavery in a portion of our country , as an evidence of our backwardness in civilization . We will not reply with Mr. McDuflle 's paradox : that the slavery of one portion of the community is essential to the freedom and civilization of the rest . It is indeed true , that the most perfect forms of ancient civilization existed in connection with a bloated system of slavery ; yet , if the writer of this might be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has far more sympathy even with the professed abolitionists , than with their professed opponents . But what has the Briton done , that he should consf*itute himself the censor of all the world ? After having grown rich by conquest and extortion , by slavery and the slave-trade , he has indeed compelled his brethren in the colonies to emancipate their negroes , and given them money to pay their debts to himself . That was Briton-like . But what has he done at home ? Are there really no slaves there , as Cowper sung ? According to recent developments , there has been for many years more hard bondage , more grinding servitude , more excruciating misery , in the southern half of the Island of Great Britain  --  to say nothing of poor , plundered Ireland-than there ever was ( we were about to say in the whole West Indies , certainly we may say ) in the whole United States , at any period in the history of Negro Slavery . Let the oligarchy that govern England take care of the millions that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them.t The number of the Edinburgh Review to which we have already referred , con- * Mr. Lyell-whose book on America , by the way , forms an honorable exception to the general tone of British travelers in this country-admits and maintains that it would he certain ruin to submit the question of payin , , the English debt to the decision of universal suffrage ; and even deprecatingly urges this fact , presumed to be undeniable , as a decisive answer to those friends of liberty who inquire why the right of suffrage should not he extended in Great Britain as it is in this country . Such a fact speaks volumes . tThey have begento come up to the work in their fashion . After having so ordered their legislation for centuries as to protect the rich and exhaust the poor , they have at length begun to provide for the latter when it has become no longer safe to neglect them . The English // tains an elaborate article on the subject of legislation for the working classes ; the upshot of which is , that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to starve ; - for to talk to men about exciting industry and economy by throwing them on their own resources , while you allow them nothing to do , or do not pay them enough for their work to furnish them a scanty subsistence from hand to mouth , is only adding insult to injury . The Reviewer , after stating very impartially the advantages and disadvantages of the free working classes as compared with serfs and slaves , and showing how , in Europe , the former condition has gradually taken the place of the latter , adds the following paragraph which we take the liberty to insert entire . " When we contemplate the actual results of the change in question , and compare the state of the working classes in countries where they are free , with the state of a slave class , we find that the only benefits of freedom , which have been fully enjoyed by the laboring classes , are the negative ones ( such as exemption from bodily inflictions and other ill treatment ) ; but that the positive benefits which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less prominent . The positive benefits , which are economical and domestic , which consist in the acquisition , enjoyment and transmission of wealth , and in the development of the family affections , are more remote , and depend on numerous preliminary conditions which hitherto have rarely coexisted in any community . The entire harvest of the chance will not be reaped until civilization has made further progressuntil the providence , industry , intelligence and peaceableness of the working-man are such as to render him altogether fit for selfsupport , and to protect society against the shocks arising from his delusions and violence . " To this we have only to add , by way of comment , that the free working classes rn this country , have already made that " further progress in civilization " for which the Englishman and the European can only sigh ; that they already enjoy and have long enjoyed to the full , the positive as well as the negative benefits of freedom ; so that they would feel indignant at the very thought of being compared with slaves and serfs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . It is also too true . But let it also be remembered , that we have scarcely any police and no standing armies to prevent or suppres* them ; while with all their regiments and systems of police , even the English have not got along without them . Can either France or England point to fifty consecutive years in her history during which she has been freer from mobs than the United States have been for a half century , from the adoption of the Federal Constitution ? Moreover , it is not to be forgotten , that we do not send our refuse population abroad , but , from our liberal character and position , must receive the refuse population of other countries , and share with them our rights and liberties . What , then , must be the transforming character of our people amid institutions , which can so unfailimigly and so speedily change such materials into good citizens , enjoying all the positive as well as negative benefits of freedom  --  and can continue such a process for so long a period with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slavery , mobs-these evils ; we grieve to say , do exist among us . But the whole country is not chargeable with any one of them-they are not distinctive characteristics of our social condition . When the enemies of America and American aristocracy can make a vritue of necessity with as good a grace as anybody we know of . It is stated on the authority of a writer in Blackwoodi 's Magazine , that the number of paupers in Great Britain is four millions , or a seventh part of the population of the empire . At the same time there are 70,000 persons in England whose aggregate annmel income is 200,000,000 of dollars . According to the Parliamentary Reports , ifie money expended for the relief of the poor in England alone , for the last thirty years , has averaged nearly 30,000,000 of dollars annually . Probably all the rest of the world put together , have not expended so great a sum for this purpose . ( See Edinburgh Review , Jan. , 1846 . ) Instead of wondering at the munificence of such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very necessity for it , proves that there is " something rotten " either in the character of the people , or of the institutions underwhich they live . Are such multitudes of the flee-born natives of England so lazy or so stupid that rather than earn their own living , as they might , they will suhfimit to he fed as paupers *t Or , are the political and social conditions under which they live such , that after toiling with the best will , and straining every nerve , they can not obtain the means of keeping body and soul together without the insulilna aid of public charity We do not see how the English can avoid acceptin* on this subS*ct one , , horn or other of the same dilemma which they offer to us o.n the subject of " repudiation . // institutions attack them at these points , they commit , to say the least , a mistake in strategy . These are , by no means , peculiarly our weak points ; we utterly deny their pretended weight as proofs of our comparative inferiority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , if anywhere at all . Not that we are disposed to retract the admission already made , that the English as well as the French are our superiors in civilization , according to the ordinary acceptation of the term ; hut , deferring for the present the consideration of those points in which their superiority consists , we may be permitted to think that this " hrigand confederacy* ' is not quite so deep in the slough of corruption , vulgarity and barbarism-nor is it likely to be-as they would make the world believe . In seeking to ascertain our comparative claims , it was proper , however , first to inquire what is our reputation among foreigners , and on what grounds do they form their opinions ? It is proper also to remember that our general reputation abroad is more in the hands of the English than in any other , except our own . But it is some comfort to know that , notwithstanding all their sneers and denunciations , other foreigners retain a high opinion of us , and indeed , often express views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everywhere , the pensioned authors and salaried agents of arbitrary rule and monarchical institutions say as much evil and as little good of us as they can . Yet they are far from treating us with contempt . They respect and fear us . They deprecate our influence , and endeavor to throw all possible obstructions in its way ; and to this end , it is necessary to keep before the eyes of their people the worst side of us , and that colored and caricatured as strongly as possible ; and especially to ascribe all the evils among us , real or imaginary , to the natural effect of our free institutions , so that , in general , it is to be expected that the judgments which foreign nations pass upon us and our civilization , ( besides being partial as all such mutual judgments are , ) should be highly prejudiced and unjust . N evertheless many well-informed foreigners know better ; and , because their neigh hors go to one extreme rn judging us , they are naturally repelled to the other . They see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive praise . The influence of American civilization on European has been undeniably great- ; it is great still ; and , if we are faithful to ourselves , may yet become immeasurably greater . It is true we enter into comparison with European nations at great disadvantage . It is nothing to our discredit , surely , that our tendencies and efforts are directed rather towards internal iraprovement , ihan external show or effect . We aim rather to be civilized than to appear so . But we have still many deficiencies to be supplied , and faults to be remedied ; and we need -- especially if we would produce an impression abroadmen of higher general culture . We need organs-proper representatives among foreign nations ; men who shall give a favorable idea , not only of our diplomatic address and political sagacity , but of our national , social , and scientific culture . The impression made abroad by Franklin is not yet effaced . As Americans , we still enjoy its benefits . When shall another like him stand forth as the personification of a republican and an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contrasted with European , as something quite diverse or contrary ; rather , the former is the direct offspring , a new phasis and development of the latter . In modern Europe , civilization has assumed a more perfect form than it had ever before attained . Its seed has been planted in America , as in a virgin and more genial soil . It has germinated , has waxed with a rapid and vigorous growth , and put forth magnificent buds of promise ; and , though it has by no means reached the grandeur and maturity of the parent tree , though it is exposed to m*ny casualties and enemies , yet it is the hope of the world ; it contains the best , if not the only , promise of social regeneration for the race . Whatever may be the comparative stage of our present advancement , it is certain that the intelligent friends of human progress and improvement everywhere , are watching our course with profound interest and trembling anxiety . The problem we have to solve is , to It is not meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . Our late minister to Eniand is a sufficient refutation of such a statement . We want more such , and fewer of a very different character . // reconcile a high degree of refinement and culture when attained , with permanence on the one hand and general diffusion on the other . Hitherto , when nations have reached a certaIn point of social progress , there has always been a tendency to general corruption and dissolution . The progress has been partial and one-si ( led , pampering here , stinting there . Its very elements have contained in them the germs of decay . Italy and Spain admonish us , that even the Christian civilization of Europe promises to be no exception to the sad rule . We are to try the experiment under new auspices . And , though we have little occasion for pride and vanity , we have many reasons for gladness and thanksgiving . Indeed , what ground has any nation for boasting ? To all the apostolic rebuke is applicable , " What hast thou which thou didst not receive ? " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under extraordinary responsibilities . These are what we should learn to feel . We not only have duties to ourselves and our posterity to discharge , but we are entrusted with a mission for the whole race ; its destinies , to a fearful extent , are placed in our hands . A lofty ideala glorious goal is set before us . Let us not be high-minded , but run with modesty and circumspection , as well as with vigor and alacrity , lest we fail as others less favored have failed before us . Some of our advantages are-general freedom and freshness , an open field , a youthful spirit and susceptible character ; courage , confidence and hope ; a general diffusion of knowledge and culture , and of the means of external comfort ; a heroic a e in our early settlement and happy revolution ; above all , in erecting our fabric of society , we have no antiquated edifices to remodel , no crumbling walls to prop up , no rubbish to remove ; hut an abundance of new and sound materials all around us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles to improvement in the existing corrupt and unnatural state of English society , says , that " a volume might be written on those words of Harrington , we are living in the dregs of the Gothic Empire . ' It is that the beginnings of things are bad , and when they have not been altered , you may safely say they want altering . But then comes the question whether our fate is not fixed , and whether you could not as well make the muscles and sinew 's of afrdl grown man perform the feats of an Indian juggler . " It is sometimes represented , by various arguments and figures of speech , that those antiquated institutions which have come down from a semi-barbarous age , are useful , and even needful to sustain the new and better institutions in their feeble beginnings and during their slow and gradual growth . This might be true , if they contained in them the germs , or even the recognition , of a higher development ; if they left free scope to the spirit of progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are notoriously the greatest obstacles and the most inveterate enemies of all change for the better .

Has not the spirit of conservatism which possesses them always and everywhere made an uncompromising warfare against every innovation and improvement ? a spirit which , like the venomous reptile , still makes them its abode after they have crumbled to ruins that fill the air with pestilence and death . All the natural elements of society and of humanity , evil as well as good , are among us in a state of commmxture , commotion and contest . This is , indeed , a critical situation ; but herein lies no occasion for dismay or discouragement . Great risk is often the condition of great success . Nature loves variety , and hates monotony . As Guizot has well said : this is the picture of the universe , of humanity itself . Yet nature does not amuse herself with placing in mere juxtaposition , or patching together the members and relics of the part after the life has departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attempted , and are attempting , to do . But she developes her variety , calls forth the struggle , from the living elements of the present , as among us .
