txt THE " bishop of the diocese of Maryland , " formerly professor in the " General Theological Seminary " in New York , is known to theologians as the American editor of Palmer on the Church  --  a book of much learning and much sophistry , the principal design of which seems to be to show that Episcopalians in England and America , Roman * The Body of Christ . A charge delivered to the clergy of the Diocese of Maryland , by William Rollinson Whittingham , Bishop of the Diocese ; at the annual convention in Baltimore , Thursday , June 1st , 1843 . Published by order of the convention . Catholics in the countries included within " the Roman obedience , " and the members of the Greek communion in Russia and the East , constitute the one catholic church , now unhappily divided by mutual misunderstandings , but hereafter to be gloriously reunited ; and that all " dissenters " who have either separated themselves from this catholic body , or have been in due form excluded from it , are without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . The cool atrocity of such a system-*.wrought out with all sorts of sophistry , and propped up with all sorts of authorities-a // system which , without a shudder , consigns to perdition such saints of God , as Owen and Bunyan , Watts and Doddridge , Edwards and Erskine , Fuller and Dwight , Brainerd and Carey , and all , however distin. guished by the fruits of the Spirit , who have dared to trust in Christ without trusting in the intercession of a human priesthood-indicates not only an unsound judgment , but a disordered moral sense , on the part of the Oxford author and his American editor . We have now an opportunity of becoming further acquainted with Bishop Whittingham , as he exhibits himself in a " charge " addressed b1y him to his clergy at Baltimore , in the month of June last . In the marks of scholarship and of a vigorous though erratic mind , it answers well to the reputation of its author ; and on the whole , it leads us to entertain a more respectful opinion both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we had been able to gather from his editorial labors betowed on the volumes of Palmer . It seems important to notice the manifestations of opinion in the Episcopal church , especially such as proceed from men of eminence and of official or personal authority . The interests of pure Christianity may be promoted , by bringing before the public the true points of difference between the system prevalent in that church and the evangelical system . In this point of view , a certain Episco ppi charge recently published in Ne*v England , has an importance which will justify us in reserving it for a distinct and deliberate consideration . A. solemn official announcement of the opinion of the Episcopal church in one of the New England states , on " the errors of the times , " is a document , the value of which in determining the true character and position of that church in relation to evangelical religion , no reasonable man can question . The charge now before us has merits of its own in respect to extent of learning , force of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardwe will not say of Episcopalian , but of episcopal literature . The authority of Dr. Whittingham is not merely official , but personal . Lie speaks not simply as the bishop of a diocese , but as a ripe scholar , a practiced professor , an earnest thinke ; , a zealous and enthusiastic sectarian . In the progress of the controversy now pending between the system of " organized unity , " and the system of " individual responsibility , " we shall expect to hear often from the author of this charge . It is a great mistake , to suppose that the difference between the Episcopal church and other communions called evangelical , is merely or chiefly a difference about organization and forms . As we understand the matter , and as Bishop Whittingham understands it , the difference respects the very nature and being of Christianity . Some Episcopalians , we are aware , do not so understand it . There is a small but respectable party in that church , who are most honest in the belief , that a ministry consisting of prelates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was instituted as such by the Apostleswho hold that every Christian community not taught and governed by such a ministry , is irregularly and imperfectly organized-who heartily adopt the forms of their own church , as on the whole better than any other existing mode of public worship  --  and who , at the same time , hold distinctly and unequivocally , the doctrines of the evangelical system . But these persons do not give character to the Episcopal church . Of some of them it may be said , that though they are in that church , they are hardly of it . In her history , in her constitutional // structure and tendencies , in her liturgy , in her actual position and influence , " the church " as a body is entirely against them . They are Christians more than they are " Churchmen . " The genuine Churchman , who is well grounded in what are called " church princi. pies , " holds a system of religion , which , just in proportion as it is distinctly developed , is directly antagonistic to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of the Episcopalian ministry , hold that system vaguely , in its mere rudiments , and with various incoherent admixtures of the true Gospel . In many such , the truth which they receive counteracts the error which they mix with it , and becomes effectual by the grace of God to their spiritual regeneration , and to the salvation of their souls . In Episcopalian pulpits , and even in those which are episcopal , there is often a vague and obscure way of touching upon the great truths of spiritual religion , which on the one hand , never brings home to the careless conscience , lulled to repose by the steady observance of formalities , the great duty of immediate repentance-and on the other hand , rarely astounds such hearers as may be accustomed to evangelical ideas , with any explicit denial of the doctrines of grace . Sometimes this is simply the legitimate result of vagueness and obscurity in the mind of the preacher . Sometimes , we suspect , it may proceed from a well considered " reserve in the communication of religious knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the Episcopal church , the system of doctrines fairly belonging to that church  --  the actual difference between that sect , as a sect , and the great catholic communion of evangelical Protestants-is to a great extent imperfectly understood . We turn then to Bishop Whittingham 's charge-an official produc tion of a chief dignitary of the Episcopal church ; and we inquire , what is the theory of Christianity held by this learned and able writer ? " THE BODY OF CHRIST . " When we see this phrase in the work of an Episcopalian , we are at no loss to conjecture what the writer is thinking of . It is continually assumed by such writers , that inasmuch as the church is the body of Christ , therefore some definite organized society , under the name of the church , must be exclusively Christ 's body , and membership in that organized society is the only known union of the soul to Christ . In accordance with this assumption , the author before us talks about " the revealed plan of salvation through membership in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no salvation revealed for any who are not subject to the regulations and officers of that particular society , or fraternity of societies , which he recognizes as the only church . In accordance with the same assumption , he affirms that " the Divine commission of the ministry , in apostolical succession , as the authorized dispenser of justifying and sanctifying grace in the sacraments of regeneration , and of the communion of the body and blood of Christ , has been the uninterrupted doctrine of the church , since she received it in and with the Scriptures , down to the present day . " p. 15 . In the same way of reasoning , he sets it down , in language btrrowed from Bishop Beveridge , as the utmost achievement of the " skill and power " of Satan , in his " spite at our church , " " to draw as many as he can from its communion " - that is , from the communion of membership and subjection in that particular organization which is governed by bishops , and ministered to by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schismatics ; that so , being separated from the // body , they may not partake of the spirit that is in it , nor by consequence receive any benefit from this promise of our blessed Savior to the governors of the catholic and apostolic church in all ages , Lo , I am with you always , to the end of the world . ' " p. 16 . In like manner it is declared by our author , that " the Scriptures afford no authority for believing that Christ can be truly preached otherwise than in the church , " ( p. 17 , ) that is , in the church as organized under a prelatical government , professing to have come down , in an uninterrupted succession , from the apostles . In the same way , our author " teaches the reality of the interest in Christ which pertains to membership in his visible Body ; " and he declares , that " of the Body which the sacraments unite and seal as His , it is explicitly revealed that it is His body , into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , and have put on Christ , and in which , eating His flesh , and drinking His blood , we dwell in Him , and He in us. " p. 18 . In the same way , it is declared that the redemption through the cross of Christ , is " applied to the individual believer by the Spirit in the ordinances ; " and that it is " the grace transmitted in the church , from the Root through the branches vitally joined to it by faith , which alone enables them to bear their fruit . " p. 20 . And , not to multiply these quotations unnecessarily , it is said in the same way by this me author ; that the true knowledge of " the Gospel in its fullness , its freeness , and its power , " is " the knowledge of Christ as the Savior of the Body , and therefore of its members as in the Body-of ourselves as members of His body , of His flesh and of His bones , nourished and cherished by his Spirit , ministered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 . These views are not Popery ; al though the Roman Catholic church holds substantially the same views . We have not made these quotations for the sake of stigmatizing them as Popery , or Romanism , or even as Puseyism . Pusey and the Oxford Tractarians hold these views it is true ; but we have yet to learn that these views are peculiar to the writers of that school . Popery , or Romanism , is not the doctrine which the church of Rome holds in common with other bodies of nominal Christians . Puseyism is not that doctrine which the Tractarians hold in common with the formularies and the most honored prelates and authors of the Anglican church , in almost every successive age since the Reformation . What Hobart held , and Seabury-what was held by Sancroft and Laud , by Montague , Cosins and Andrews , by Bancroft and Queen Elizabethwhat stands as it were engraven on a rock in the catechism and offices of the church-is not Puscyism , but " church-of-Englandism . " The quotations which we have given are valuable , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion which is diligently propagated in many portions of our country , and which has much to recommend it to the deceitful and corrupt heart of unregenerate man , but which is not always stated by its advocates with so little reserve . The system may be briefly and methodically summed up in the following propositions . 1 . Christ as a Savior is related , not directly to individual sinners who repent and believe , but only to the church as a visible corporation , and to individuals only as members of that corporation . Consequently , the doctrine of election , as it is commonly called  --  the doctrine which " considers the election of the individual believer as the immediate end of the Divine counsels " - is a great mistake , a piece of " Calvin 's misspent ingefluity. " p. 6 . God 's // chosen people then , " predestinated according to his purpose " - " chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world " - are not the individuals whom he did foreknow , hut are the aggregation , the body corporate , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its ordinances and ceremonies ; and he who is united to that visible church is one of God 's chosen . 2 . The church , as the body of Christ , and as enjoying a priesthood descended by an uninterrupted series of successive ordinations from the Apostles , through bishops ruling over two orders of inferior ministers-the church as a visible corporation related to Christ , is the exclusive possessor of all the grace , and all the hopes and promises of the Gospel ; and membership in the church is the only appointed way of salvation . The church , with " its commission deducible in direct succession from Him whom the Father sent to found it , " is to be recognized " as the witness and keeper of holy writ , the preacher of the Gospel , the conveyer of spiritual life and nourishment , the sealer of the promises . " p. 11. 3 . The grace and salvation which belong to the churcb are communicated to individual members in the ordinances or sacraments . Baptism , rightly administered , makes the recipient a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , and of all actual sins up to that moment ; it regenerates by the communication of supernatural grace , and thus is the commencement of a new life ; hence it is called " the sacrament of regeneration . " In the Lord 's supper , rightly administered - or , to use the language o fthesystem , in " the eucharist , " the bread and wine are not mere symbols and memorials of Christ 's atoning death for us ; they are a real oblation to God ; and it is only by participating in that sacrifice , by eating and drinking at that altar , that the bene fits of Christ 's death can he applied to the individual believer for his sanctification . Eating at that altar , he really and not in a figure-not symbolically only , but in an unsearchable mystery-eats the flesh and drinks the blood of Christ , and thus becomes completely united and incorporated with Christ . In accordance with this theory , our author says that Christ has appointed the sacraments to be to the church " its jOii ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , from Him , the Head . " p. 20. 4 . Yet it is not to he supposed that this system formally dispenses with faith , or with a personal experience of the work of the Holy Spirit on the mind . If we should permit any of our readers to take up such an impression , we sbould feel that we had misrepresented the system which it is our purpose to represent plainly , but with exact fairness . Be it understood , then , that the system in question does not profess to deny the necessity of repentance , faith , and spiritual renovation , in order to the salvation of the soul . It teaches that " formalists and hypocrites have rested in the visible membership , without the witness of the Spirit in the inner man which is its life . " p. 18 . It teaches that " redemption through the cross of Cbrist only , " while it is " applied to the individual believer by the Spirit in the ordinances , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its doctrine of grace is the doctrine of " the grace which , transmitted in the church , from the Root , through the branches vitally joined to it by faith , alone enables them to bear their fruit . " Our author 's Vory of religion is , in his own statement of it , " God in Cbrist ; Christ in the church ; the church in her offices , ordinances and members ; all bound together in one mystic Body , visible in its human members and sensible administra // tions , but vivified and energized by the Spirit of truth , holiness and love , dwelling in the whole Body as its Soul , and thereby r*aking it , as a whole , His temple ; while in each member He also dwells , according to the measure of the gift of each , thereby making the mortal body of the individual a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in him , which he has of God . " " This mystery of grace , " says the Bishop , " is the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 20 , 21 . Jn other words , faith is indeed essential to justification and salvation ; but the church , the priesthood and the sacraments are equally essential . Faith is indeed essential ; but faith itself fastens upon the church , entrusts the soul to the authority and legitimacy of the priesthood , and apprehends Christ and the benefits of his redemption , only as they are exhibited and sealed in valid sacraments . A personal experience of the inward work of the Holy Spirit is essential ; but the Holy Spirit is given only in the true visible ( that is , the E*iscopal ) church , by a legitimately constituted ministry , through valid ordinances . There is indeed a certain " union and communion of the Head with the individual members , " ( p. 23 , ) but it is only a union and communion of the Head with those who are members , not directly of Christ by faith , but of the organized visible church by a participation of the sacraments ; and in the words of our author , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his Lord , independently of his connection with him in the Body , that is , in the Episcopal church , you isolate him from the fount of blessing , and lead him to broken cisterns that will hold no xvater. " * . 23 . This whole scheme of religion seems to originate in the idea that " the church " which Paul frequently calls a body , and which in several instances he calls " the body of Christ , " ( Eph. i , 23 ; iv , 12 ; v , 23 ; Col. i , 18 , 24 ; ) is a visible corporation or society , organized after one particular form , and that therefore there is no membership in Christ 's body , no vital union with Christ , except by a visible membership in that visible society or body politic . If that idea is shown to be unfounded , it will need but little argument to convince a candid man that the whole system is erroneous . And on the other hand , if that idea is warranted by Scripture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is not far out of the way . It is worth while then to inquire , What is the church ' which the Scriptures speak of as " the body of Christ " ? What does the New Testament mean by church , ' in such a connection ? In ascertaining the answer to this inquiry , it is first to be observed that in strict propriety of speech there is no such word as church ' in the New Testament . The word church , ' or some other word identical with it in signification , is found in all the modern languages of Christendom . It is the word which grew up in the middle ages to denote that vast and powerful institution which , centering at Rome , overshadowed the world . It had at the beginnin * , one definite and unequivocal meaning ,  --  a meaning very little differing from that which Bishop Whittingham and those of his way of thinking attach to the same word now . But at the Reformation , when the Bible was translated into the vernacular languages of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to represent some of the meanings of a certain word in the New Testament . Our common translation of the Bible was made in this way ; so that in English the word church ' is a Bible word , and its meaning in popular use has been modified in consequence of its standing in the Bible . The authors of the Geneva version , which King J mes 's version was designed to supersede , // avoided the use of this word from the dialect of the middle ages , wisely judging that if introduced into the Bible it would carry something of its own associations along with it . In this they followed the example of Luther , and this was one of the things which made their version unpalatable to the powers that ruled in England . The word church , ' all redolent of tradition and the middle ages , stands in King James 's version , as the word " Easter " stands there , ( Acts xii , 4 , ) to produce an effect upon the reader , which a literal and exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English Bible merely as it is , if he will read it carefully , comparing Scripture with Scripture , and allowing the sacred record to be its own interpreter , need not be misled . But he who reads carelessly , presuming that the word church in the New Testament has the same meaning which it has in history , or the same meaning which it has in the conversation or the preaching with which he is most familiar , will easily misunderstand the matter . With this explanation , then , we repeat the seeming paradox-There is no such word as church ' in the Bible . Neither the Hebrew language nor the Greek , in the days of the Apostles , contained or could supply any word analogous to the word church ' in English and in other modern languages . The word could not precede the thing . Pursuing our inquiry , we may next remark that the word translated church , ' has , in the New Testament , at least five different meanings . 1 . There is the original and generic meaning , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for whatever purpose , and on whatever occasion . Thus ( Acts xix , 32-41 ) the word is used twice to denote the mob in the theater at Ephesus , and once to denote a regular town-meeting. * 2 . The same word is used to denote an assembly for the worship of God under the Mosaic dispensation . Thus ( Heb. ii , 12 ) it stands in the translation of a verse from the Hebrew of the twenty second Psalm , ( ver . 22 , ) " I will declare thy name to my brethren , in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee : " the allusion being evidently to the worshiping assembly before the tabernacle or in the temple . 3 . The same word is used , as the corresponding Hebrew word is frequently used in the Old Testament , to denote the Hebrew nation or commonwealth . " This is that Moses , " said Stephen , ( Acts vii , 38 , ) " who was in the congregation in the wilderness , " that is , who there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same word is used to denote the meetings or assemblies of believers in Christ , for worship , communion and instruction . A word in the most common use , and of the most extensive signification , a word very much like our word meeting , ' was most naturally employed , first to denote the daily meetings of the disciples at the temple and from house to house in Jerusalem , and afterwards to denote similar meetings in other places. * Whenever the word is so used , the context always determines the signification , just as the word meeting , ' in our langu*e , whenever used to denote a religious assembly , is understood without difficulty . 5 . By a natural transition from the use of the corresponding word in the Old Testament , as one of the designations of the Hebrew nation , the same word congregation ' is used in a figurative sense , to denote the general community of Christ 's followers , the commonwealth of believers.t In this last use of the word its precise meaning varies , just as the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies . The Christian * New Englander , No . III , p. 399. * See the New Englander , No . Ill , p. 398. t Ibid. pp. 399 , 400. 1843.1 551 // community ' may mean the community of those who are known and recognized as Christians . So it is obviously to he understood in the passage , ( 1 Cor. x , 32 , ) " Give none offense , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church congregation of God , " - all men being comprehended by the writer in the three classes of Jews , Gentiles or pagans , and Christians . So in the three passages , ( 1 Cor. xv , 9 ; Gal . i , 13 ; Phil . iii , 6 , ) in which Paul speaks of himself as having " persecuted the church congregation of God ; " - he had been the enemy of all who bore the Christian name . So in another place , ( 1 Cor. xii , 28 , ) Paul says that " In the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God has appointed some to be , in the first place , apostles , secondly , prophets , " &amp;c . These are all the clear instances of this shade of meaning which occur to us . To these we may add the doubtful instance ( Rom. xvi , 23 , ) " Gaius , mine host , and of the whole congregation , " where the apostle may mean to commend the hospitality of the well-beloved Gaius , either as exercised towards the members of some particular congregation , well enough known to those whom he was addressing , or as exercised towards all . Christians . But let the sacred writer be speaking of Christ 's followers , not as such in outward profession and recognition , but as such in spirit and in truth , and then if he has occasion to use the word in question , it assumes a higher and more spiritual tone . In such a connection , it denotes that great spiritual community of chosen , redeemed , forgiven , sanctified souls , of which Christ is the founder and redeemer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not any outward organization , is the true kingdom of Christ  --  the kingdom of God ; it is Christ living and enthroned in the regenerated hearts of ransomed men ; it is God in Christ reigning in the grateful and obedient affection of those whom he has reconciled to himself . It is a community , a kingdom , a congregation on Mount Zion , which includes all those whom God has chosen from eternity to be his own , and whom in time he calls by his word and renews by his Spirit . This is " the church " by the progress of which is " now made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places " - that is , to the angels that rejoice over one sinner that repenteth ,  --  " the manifold wisdom of God . " This is " the church " in which glory is given to God " through Christ Jesus throughout all ages , world without end . " This is " the church " the relation of which to Christ is like the relation of the bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave himself for it , that he might sanctify it with the washing of water by the word , that he might present it to himself a glorious church assembly " of redeemed and sanctified ones , " not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing . " This is " the church " which is " the body of Christ , " and to which Christ is " head over all things . " It may be here observed that almost every instance of this particular use of the word is found either in the epistle to the Ephesians or in that to the Colossians-epistles , the whole scope of which is removed very far ( quam longissim* ) from such topics ns the outward institutions of Christianity . Po that man who imagines that " the church " spoken of in the Scriptures as " the body of Christ , " must be a visible body politic , a certain organized corporation , we say , Read those two epistles carefully , see what it is that fills the apostle 's mind , analyze his arguments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then judge whether the congregation of which he speaks is not identically that of which he speaks in the epistle to the Hebrews , ( xii , // 22-24 , ) " Ye are come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels , to the general assembly and congregation of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven , and to God , the judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect , and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel ? ' Who will tell us that such language as this describes a certain outward corporation , with its prelates , its priests and its ordinances ,  --  a corpotion which includes such men as Leighton and Usher only by a principle which excludes such men as Watts and Bunyan , and which has a place for Henry Martyn only by shutting the door against Gordon Hall and Robert Morrison . That " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is none other than the universal community of penitent and believing souls . Another inquiry connected with the subject is ,  --  In what sense is that church Christ 's body ? It is a body only as the individuals are united by some principle of unity . What is the unity , by virtue of which a countless multitude of individuals , scattered among all nations , and living in successive ages , are the one body of Christ ? That principle , on the theo*ry of the Episcopalian ,  --  or , as he loves to call himself , the Churchman ,  --  . - is the principle of unity in outward organization ; it is the principle of subjection to the divine institution of prelacy , the principle of outward communion with a certain priesthood through operative sacraments . On this theory , as exhibited by " church " authors of standard reputation , the essence of the body of Christ , the uniting principle by virtue of which its many members are one body , is just the difference between Episcopalianism on the one hand and Preshyterianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which , to borrow terms from the dialect of that party , distinguishes all " Churchmen " from all " Dissenters . " It is just that which Bishop Onderdonk and Bishop Doane have in common with the Archbishop of Paris and the Patriarch of Constantinople , and to which Dr. Alexander , Dr. MeAuley , Dr. Merle D'Aubign* , and the missionary Goodell , have no title . It is just that which unites ( ! ) the Anglican , the Roman , and the Oriental branches of the one complex and discordant " Catholicity " - one but manifold , and which separates them , not from each other , but from every body else . This one " Catholic " body-the unity of which , with all its boasted visibility , is about as metaphysical as the unity of three monarchies , two of which are at war with each other , and both with the third ,  --  is the one body of Christ , by virtue of its outward and " perpetually visible " unity ; and it is Christ 's body , because Christ loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a corporation , and endowed it as a corporation with sacraments , priesthood , prelacy , and the grace that is thus administered . Such is the church ' or high church ' theory . According to the opposite or evangelical theory , the church , the congregation or community of Christ 's disciples , is Christ 's body , because all who belong to it belong to him , and are individually and personally united to him . It is their union with him which unites them with each other , and makes them one body ; and it is not their formal union with each other in one visible body , which unites them to their Savior . Christ is the vine and his disciples are the branches , ( see Christ 's own statement on this point , John xv , 1-10 , ) every individual believer is united directly to him , as the branch to the vine ,  --  not indirectly , as the branch to the root , through the trunk ; and the unity of the branches is nothing else than the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reads the New Testarnent in its spiritual and sublime simplicity , without the blind guidance of early tradition and the corrupting glosses of the Fathers , judge for himself which of these theories is scriptural . One question more may help to put the subject in a still clearer light . How does a man become a member of " the body of Christ , " and therefore a member of that church ' which is his body ? What child that reads the Bible , and has not been diligently taught to misunderstand it , can fail to answer this question aright ? Is it by the ordinance of baptism that a man is united to Christ ? Simon Magus was baptized ; and the validity of his baptism was never called in question . But Simon Magus was not a member of Christ 's body . Is it by any formal and complete connection with a particular assembly or visible society of Christ 's disciples , that a man is united to the Redeemer , and is made a branch of the true vine ? Where is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , where is the evidence that they " confirmed " him , or by any form received him to complete and permanent membership in an organized society of Christians-unless they first had reason to believe that Christ had already received him as a disciple , and thus that he was already reconciled to God by virtue of a personal union with the Redeemer ? The man who intelligently and honestly offers himself for membership in a society of Christians , does so not in order to become a Christian , but because he is a Christian , and as such desires the benefits of Christian communion . His presenting himself there , if it is done intelligently and honestly , implies that he comes as one of Christ 's disciples to join himself to the company of his fellow disci ples , and to unite himself in outward relations with those with whom he is already one in the fellowship of the Spirit , and in a living union with the Redeemer of sinners . How then did he become one with Christ , a partaker of the pardon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood for all penitent and believing souls ? Simply by the personal acts of repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ , to which he has been led by the grace and power of the renewing Spirit . Repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ , preached as the conditions of union with the Redeemer and of acceptance with the Father-this is the Gospel . Baptism is the formal declaration and recognition of a fact  --  the fact , that the person baptized belongs to Christ , and has a right through grace to the benefits of the great salvation . Union with a visible church by confirmation , or by whatever form may seem more scriptural , is the profession and recognition of a fact , the fact of a union with the invisible and universal congregation of Christ 's redeemed . This we say is the gospel of the New Testament . But there is another gospel , the gospel of tradition and of " catholicity . " It proposes to unite the sinner to his Redeemer , and to make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Spirit , and to seal him an heir of heaven-by confirmation . It proposes to make the blood of Christ 's atonement efficacious to the cleansing and the life of his soul-by the eucharist . It proposes to make him one of the general assembly and congregation of the first-born-by making him a member of its own schismatic church . ' It propounds the sign as the potent means of producing the thing signified , and builds much on the hystero-proteron of putting the outward profession before the inward // affection which is to be pro . fessed . It is the same system which in its more full development , puts penance in the place of repentance , and the pattering of Latin forms , with the counting of beads , in the place of prayer . These are two gospels , not one in different aspects . In proportion as each is developed , and brought into full consistency with itself , it departs from the other . At one of the New York anniversaries last May , the antagonist position of these two gospels was spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The speaker sketched the character of two editions of Chris . tianity . One deals with men as individuals ; it makes every man stand alone before God as a sinner - alone before the cross , to believe and be forgiven , or to reject the atonement and perish . The other takes men in masses , and proposes to save them as connected with a visible organization . The one puts nothing between the sinner and his Savior . The other puts the priest there , and the church , and the sacraments . The great idea of the one is individual responsibility and spiritual freedom . The great idea of the other is organized unity and spiritual dominion . These two gospels are now in conflict , not here and there , as factions , for ascendency in a parish , a city , or a nation ; but every where , as principles and systems of thought , for dominion over the world . The world 's destiny is to turn upon the issue of this conflict . The author of the charge before us quotes from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put . He tells us , that " individual responsibility ' separated from organized unity , ' becomes a fearful source of danger , a snare and an undoing , to those who thus virtually put man out of Christ , to stand before God alone ' " He says , " the difference " between these two systems , " is real . It is immense . It has been not untruly characterized , as being all the difference between spurious and true . " This charge then helps us to understand on which side , in the conflict between these two gospels , the American branch of the Anglican church is likely to be found .
