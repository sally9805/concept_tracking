txt The first edition of this treatise was prepared at the suggestion of some friends and other gentlemen ; it was intended for use more particularly in Massachusetts and the neighboring States . It has had a more extensive circulation , and , from questions proposed to me from distant States in this Union , as also by direct request , I have been induced to prepare a second , enlarged by notes of my own , explanatory of the first , and by copious extracts from such sources as would present most , if not all , of the various conflicting views respecting the cultivation of the grape . In giving the opinions of others , it has been my endeavor to embrace as great a period of time as possible , that the diflFerence in those now held , if any , might be seen ; to attain this object , when , by so doing , I could retain the ideas of those quoted , such parts have been extracted as contained selections from previous authors . In the remarks on these opinions and systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been mainly considered , and they have been made with the object of conveying information , and not witli the idea of criticising them . Circumstances of climate , or location , may render a practice successful in one country , that may be highly improper in one differently situated . In the first edition , it Avas the plan to give a concise account of my own practice , as a system to be foUoAved by others , without giving the reasons therefor . It was well known , in the vicinity of the city , where my residence was , and where it was presumed this treatise would circulate /z/ chiefly ; that , for several years , I had been experlmentmg upon the different plans recommended , ( and which had caused me so much perplexity in the selecting of the most suitable for this climate , ) in order that I could fix upon one worthy of general adoption . To spare other cultivators this perplexity , very little was said of soils and manures ; a compost was recommended as suitable , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not readily be obtained . Of the systems of training and pruning , all that could be of use was given , and the advantages and disadvantages appertaining to each were noticed . In the present edition , it has been my plan to give all shades of opinion , for every variety of climate ; that , wherever located , some remarks might be found appropriate to the situation , provided it is within the latitude suited to grape culture . My own opinions are fuUy expressed , and , as the views of others have been added , also , and wherein we differ freely stated , the reader can select , for his own adoption , that system which recommends itself as the best to his mind . This treatise is not offered to the public as containing any thing new , but simply as recommending a plan which has operated well with the author ; it is intended as a guide to the person entirely unacquainted with the grape culture , and for the benefit more especially of those living remote from cities , in newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appear to the experienced of small account , have been so particularly noticed ; it has given occasion to some repetition also , but I thought it best to err on this side , than that there should be any want of plain explanation of my meaning . Rules have been given for the propagation of the vine , the planting out , pruning , training , and other routine duties . Views of grape-houses , with minute descriptions of the manner of building and warming them , and every little matter which could be supposed to occur to one unaccustomed to the subject have been added . /z/ The subject of soils and manures has received the largest share of attention ; pruning and training , when compared with the above , are secondary affairs , as the vine , if well located , in suitable compost , will do well under any system judiciously practised . In treatmg these matters , I have endeavored to keep distinct the subjects of compost for the border of the grape-house , and the soil suitable for the vineyard . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of much consequence , for what is suitable in the one case , can hardly be injurious in the other ; it is not to be presumed , however , that the same labor and care will be bestowed on the preparation of the soil for the vineyard , that one would give to the border for the grapery . The material of the former edition , which is simply the details of my practice , is , in this , unchanged ; when necessary , rather than alter the original , notes explanatory have been added . I will state here , as an explanation for any repetition , or for the want of more system in the arrangement of the matter , that the work has been performed little by little , as I could spare an hour from other labors ; and , the present edition being an enlargement of the former , the matter now added is introduced where it could best be under these circumstances . /z/ There are several works published in England , written by practical men , giving ample directions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate of the Northern States of America is so different from that of England , that , however well calculated these directions may be for the latter , they can hardly be expected to suit the former . The temperature of England is milder , and is not subject to the great extremes of heat and cold which we experience . The searching northwesterly winds , which prevail with us in New England in the Avinter and early spring months , with the mercury often at zero , and even below that point , and the sudden changes we are liable to , in this season of the year , often equal to forty degrees in a few hours , render the care requisite , for the successful forced culture of fruit , very great , and the process a more difficult one , in this country , than in England. * . /z/ Do not Luild a grapery vmder the erroneous impression , that , having done so , and planted the vines , jou have secured to yourself , without further labor , a bountiful supply of fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed . Probably there is no plant so sure of yielding an annual crop as the grape , under right management ; but this is absolutely necessary , to ensure success . The attempt has been made to give plain rules , which may be easily understood , and the practical operation of which can be carried out with as little labor as the proper cultivation of the grape , under glass , will permit . The following directions are intended for those who may desire to cultivate this fruit , for their own pleasure or convenience , and do not wish to incur the expense of a regularly at sunrise , you must have the flues , or water-pipes , hot ; as soon as the sun shines , as it frequently does in winter as well as in the summer , with great brilliancy upon the glass , the heat rapidly accumulates , and the mercury is soon at or T*he temperature in the open air may be at zero , or from that point up to Now , here is the difficulty : if the top lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a current of this cold air to flow over the vines , the fruit thus exposed will perish , and if you sufl'er this very high temperature , when or is the highest point you should allow , the vines will be unduly excited , aaid consequently very liable to a check , when the temperature falls . The foliage may not show , at the time , any bad effects from this cold air , but soon the young bunches will turn yellow and drop . " What is the matter with my vines ? " ( is a question which is often put to me , ) " they pushed very strong , and showed fine bunches of fruit , but the most of them have dried up and dropped ; " they have at some time received a check to the flow of the sap , and the effect of this , in the first seventy days of forcing , will always be the loss of the crop . " Having small ventilators , and opening the lights but very little , with every precaution that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the too much heat , and the admission of a current of the cold air , is the only way to avoid any ill effects from such causes . Mr. A. Forsyth , in a diary of the culture of the grape in a forcing-house , at East Barnet , in Herts , published in Loudon 's Magazine , page 548 , vol. 10th , makes these remarks relative to the weather : " December the 15lh , weather favorable ; the nights often or ; seldom under We have had only four frosts ; the most intense , as low as A diary of the forcing-house kept by myself , on the fifteen first days of December , has five or six days when the cold is said to be very severe , below zero or about it ; and several days , when it was mild by day , the mercury fell to and 18 ' - ' at night . In any degree of cold at night , if the heating arrangements are suitable , the temperature , with proper care , can be easily regulated . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercury ranges from to above zero , or when it is as low as or below , any one having had experience in such matters will readily admit . t ) INTKODUCTION. educated gardener , and wlio have felt the want of a concise and simple explanation of the process , and the rules by which these operations of forcing and of growing grapes , under glass structures , can be carried out . The treatment recommended is such as has been found to be the best , after many years ' experience , in its cultivation ; during which time , the different systems of pruning have been all tried , and many of the vineyards in France , and on the Rhine , in Italy , and other countries have been visited , and the manner of pruning , the varieties of soil , and the amount of fruit which a vine is permitted to ripen , have been examined and ascertained . The disadvantages we labor under , in this country , in forcing fruit , from the extreme coldness of the weather in winter , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun , and consequent dryness of the atmosphere , at the time of ripening , which give a flavor to the fruit , such as it can rarely be made to attain , in the moist , dull , and cloudy Aveather of England. * The variations of the temperature are always indicated by a Fahrenheit thermometer . * I find that I have not always been here rightly understood . The idea intended to be expressed is , that the natural advantages of our climate over that of England , in respect to the atmosphere , are very much in our favor . Most seasons , the grapes produced in this country in houses without fire heat , are equally well flavored as those grov/n with artificial heat . The forced fruits of England , grapes , pine apples , and cherries , are very superior . I have never , in any country , eaten better , particularly the pine apples , which are richer in flavor than any I have ever tasted in the East Indies . /z/ The vine is known to have existed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from diiferent sources , giving its history and the time and manner of its introduction into Europe , are annexed . The variety of the grape from which have originated all the kinds cultivated as European sorts in this country , came first from Asia . For many centuries it has been cultivated in the warm and temperate latitudes of Europe . The vine is also indigenous to America ; it is found , in its wild state , over a very large extent of country in great variety , and growing to the tops of the highest trees , in the seOr son of inflorescence filling the air with its perfume . In America , we cultivate , generally , two species of the grape , the Vitis vinefera , which is the type of what we call the European varieties ; and the Vitis labrusca ,  --  of this species are the Isabella and Catawba , native sorts . The grape has been cultivated in all ages , and held in high estimation . The generally-received opinion of the manner of its introduction into Europe , is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , the Phoenicians first carrying it to the islands there , from whence it spread into Italy , Spain , France , and Portugal , and thence north through France , Switzerland , England , &c.; &c.; ; from all these countries we have received varieties of this species . It lives to a great age , and forms wood capable of being serviceable in the arts . The cultivation of the grape , in its northern extent , is not confined to a certain parallel of latitude . It has been observed in Europe , that , as you go east , /z/ the cultivation of this plant extends to the north . Arthur Young says , that , in France , the difference is of heat in the same parallel . In the United States of America , the difference of climate is also found , but operating in a reversed manner . In the same latitude , as we go west , is found a milder climate , particularly after passing the Alleghanies , and , on the Pacific , it is yet more mild . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , the temperature is so mild that , in whiter , the mercury falls but a few times below freezing . " Grape Vine . Vitis . " The generic name is derived from vincire , to bind . Every part of the Scriptures mentions the ine as being held in the highest estimation . Noah planted vineyards and made wine . They are mentioned among the blessings of the promised land , ' a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , ' etc . " At what exact period the vine was first cultivated in England , is uncertain ; but we conclude it was as early as about the tenth year , A. D. , as , at that time , the Romans had possession of a great part of this island , and had introduced the luxuries of Italy Avherever they settled . Many authors are of opinion that it was not introduced into this country until about the year 280 . " That we are indebted to the Romans for the first introduction of the vine is generally allowed , although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period than we have stated , as the Phoenicians are said to have planted the vine in the isles of the Mediterranean Sea , as well as in several parts of Europe and Africa ; and as we have accounts of their trading to Britain , for tin , they might have planted it on the English coast also . But this must remain a matter of conjecture any farther than as it confirms the vine to have been originally brought from Palestine . In the Book of Numbers , we find that the men , whom Moses had sent to spy the land of Canaan , returned with a bunch of grapes which they bare between two , upon a staff . /z/ " The Damascus grapes , at the present time , are often found to - weigh upwards of twentj-five pounds the bunch . In the accounts of gidius Van Egmont , envoy from the States to the King of Naples , and John Heyman , professor of the oriental languages in the university of Leyden , who have published their observations on the present state of Asia Minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sedonijah , which is four hours ' journey from Damascus , some of the grapes were as large as pigeons ' eggs , and of a very exquisite taste . From these circumstances , we may fairly conclude that the vine is a native of Syria . " Although wine is not made in Egypt , vines are much cultivated , and the grapes have a delicious perfume . " Pliny concludes that the vine was very rare in Italy , in the time of Numa , and , to encourage the pruning of vines , he prohibited the use of any Tvdnes , in sacrifices to the gods , that were cut from vines which had not been pruned . " It was not until about the year 270 , that the vine was planted in the northern parts of Gaul , and about the rivers Rhine , Maine , and Moselle , and in Himgary . " The various wines made from the grape are very numerous . Pliny says , in his day there were eighty kinds of the best . " The island of Madeira was planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the year 1420 , when the island was first discovered . The Rhenish vine has also been planted there . " The Cape of Good Hope has been planted Avith vines from the Rhine , Persia , and other countries . " The juice of the ripe grape ( says Dr. Darwin ) is a nutritive and agreeable food , consisting chiefly of sugar and mucilage . The chemical process of fermentation converts the sugar into spirit ; converts food into poison . " It has been observed , that all the vineyards in Germany , beyond the 51st degree of latitude , are duljious. "  --  Pldlli/ps 's Companion to the Orchard . London. , 7iew ed. 1831. /z/ " Plinj states that the vines in Italy would climb to the very top and even out-top the highest poplars ; on which account the grape-gatherers , in time of vintage , put a clause in the covenant of their bargains when they were hired , that , in case their foot should slip and their necks be broken , their masters should give orders for their funeral fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern travellers agree in their accounts of the long life and immense size to which the vine attains in its wild state . Statues have been carved from its wood , pillars have been made from it , and the large doors of the cathedral of Ravenna are also made from this wood . Large tables have been made of a single plank . Pliny gives an account of a vine six hundred years old . "  --  Chaptal , p. 142 . " Miller says , of the vines in Italy , that , in some parts of that country , a vine is considered young at one hundred years , and that there are plants in existence which have been cultivated three hundred years . "  --  Chaptal . " The Burgundy wine has been celebrated for its superior quality certainly as far back as the 13th century . The kings of France have interested themselves in the planting of anes in their domains . There is proof that Charlemagne had attached , to the palaces which he inhabited , vineyards , and the necessary instruments for making wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of the management Avith the overseer . " The garden of the Louvre , as of the other royal houses , has contained vines since the year 1160 . Louis the young allowed annually , from their produce , six hogsheads of wine to the rector of St. Nicholas . " Philippe Augustus , as shown by the account of the revenues for the year 1200 , reported by Bussel , possessed vineyards in Bourges , Soisons , Compeigne , Laon , Beauvais , Auxerne , Corbeil , Betise , Orleans , Moret , Poissi , Gien , Anet , Charlevane , Verberries , Fontainebleau , Rurecour , Mili , and several other parts of France . "  --  Cliaptal. /z/ " The vine was introduced by the Phoenicians into cultivation in Europe by the way of the Mediterranean islands , Italy , and Marseilles . "  --  ChajJtal . " From the remotest records of antiquity , the vine has been celebrated as the type of plenty and the symbol of happiness . The pages of Scripture abound with allusions to the fertility of the vine , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing the peaceful and flourishing state of the kingdom of Israel , duruag the reign of Solomon , that ' Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree . ' It is supposed to have been introduced into Britain at the commencement of the Christian era , and history amply proves that , for a long series of ages , vineyards were very common in the southern parts of the island , and that the quantity of wine produced from them was so great as to be considered one of the staple products of the land . "  --  Clement Hoare . London , 1837 . Konisburgh , in north latitude , nearly is considered the limit at which the grape will ripen in Europe . Humboldt has observed , that the best wines are produced from vineyards situated in the interior , away from the seaboard , and remarks , that the cause does not alone reside in the lower summer temperature of the coasts , but attributes the difference to the light , from a clearer state of the heavens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only must the mean annual temperature exceed 55 ' , but that the mean winter cold must not fall quite to the freezing point , 4 ' , and this must be followed by a mean summer heat of at least /z/ First in order , and of the utmost importance , is the situation of the house . It must be so located , that stagnant water will not remain on the border , or within reach of the roots of the vine . If you can not avoid building the house where water is found to stand two or three feet under the surface , then the soil should be throAvn out , the whole length and breadth of the border , eighteen inches deep , and the bottom paved with stone or brick , so as effectually to prevent the roots penetrating through it to the Avater . Make the border on this , as directed hereafter ; this will raise the top of the soil eighteen inches above the level of the adjoining surface . /z/ The house should front the south ; a slight variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the morning sun , will be no objection. * In the Gardeners ' Chronicle of 1847 , page 734 , is an account of some grapes exhibited at the Horticultural Show , * Cultivators of the grape have usually advised this position for the front of the house ; several persons , who have had practical experience , would prefer that it should front south ten or fifteen degrees east , or even south-southeast . " Every house for the purpose of forcing or growing fruit should stand on a foundation naturally dry or effectually- drained . As to aspect , the standard principle is , to set the front directly to the south . "  --  Abercrombie. /z/ " raised in the city of London , under a glass case , without fire heat , in an aspect nearly northwest , and where they received only about one hour 's sun in the latter part , of the day ; they were a small black kind , and well colored , a fact corroborative of the opinion now entertained , that grapes should be sheltered from the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hovey , the Editor of the Magazine of Horticulture , does not agree with me , in the opinion before expressed , relative to the aspect for the grapery . In a notice of the first edition of this work , he says , " Not so , however , ( all important , ) the direction , ' that the house should front the south , " or ' a slight variation , provided it is to the east . ' If forcing was only to be the object , this would hold true ; but , for the ordinary culture of the grape , either with or without heat , it is by no means necessary . In our bright climate , any position but a northern one will enable the cultivator to produce the most delicious grapes . " I have houses fronting northeast and southwest , ( of course , with such aspect , the houses are glass on all sides , ) east and west , southeast and northwest , and the other intervening points of the compass . I have carefully noted the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , recommend the aspect of south , inclining a little to east , as the best . Southeast is the next best ; and east-southeast is preferable to southwest . The front of a house exposed to the west winds ( which are our coldest in winter and spring , ) is liable , when such winds prevail , to a very low temperature till the sun suddenly shines upon it , and then comes a sudden and rapid accumulation of heat , very prejudicial to the welfare of the vines . I do not wish to be understood as saying that grapes can not be grown in any but just such a position ; I know that they can be ; but the care requisite , and the chances of failure , are greater in ratio as the house in its aspect deviates from the best position . These remarks apply particularly to the northern states ; in the middle and southern , it may be advantageous /z/ to avoid the great heat of the sun , if it is intended to grow grapes under glass , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the graperj may be west-northwest. /z/ The common lean-to house is the best for forcing ; from thirteen to fifteen feet high on the back , four feet on the front , and twelve feet wide on the inside , are suitable proportions ; the length of it can be as desired , from twenty to one hvindred feet , or more . The front of the house should be framed , the sills standing on , and secured to , stone , or locust posts , set four or five feet under ground , and eight feet apart , thus giving the roots freedom to roam at their pleasure . The floor of the house should be on a level with the surface of the border . The back wall may be either of brick or wood . If the house is to be used for forcing fruit , it should have a double wall on the back . A span-roofed house is the best for a cold grapery. * It should be , above the sills , on all sides of glass , and of the following dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired ; the upright sides above the sills , six feet high ; the * " In a span-roofed house sixty feet long , the south side glazed , the north , wood and asphalte , vines will not do well under the latter . Better glaze the north span ; but , depend upon it , you would do better still were you to add another sixty feet to the length , and so form one hundred and twenty feet of roof facing the south , instead of employing the same quantity of glass for a house half the length with a double aspect ; and the more especially , if it is intended for early forcing . "  --  Gardeners Chronicle , p. 696 , Oct. 1846 . A house of this construction is not suitable for forcing grapes , it being all of glass , and consecjuently so open to the admittance of air in very cold , windy weather , that it is very difficult to avoid such extremes of temperature as will be injurious to vines . If peaches or cherries are to be forced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of pot plants , no better can be had . With respect to the correctness of the opinion expressed above , that it is better to build a house of double the length , with the same quantity of glass , it depends upon what uses the house is to be put to . As a cold grapery , and as a house where the vines are aided by artificial heat , ( but not forced , ) it is superior in its arrangements to the lean-to house , and , under the same circumstances , will perfect its crop ten or fifteen days sooner , and will yield a larger amount of fruit on a given space . It is more liable to damage from hail and frost . ( See description of one of my span-roofed houses. ) /z/ rafters should be twelve feet long ; this will make the height of the house , at the ridge-pole , or centre , on the inside , fourteen feet . The sills must be secured to stone , or locust posts , placed eight feet apart , and sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being thrown by the frost . Place the house fronting south-southeast . You may plant three sets of vines ,  --  one in the centre , and one on each side . Upon a house of this description , the sun 's rays will rest from morning until evening , and the crop will come rapidly to maturity . At the time of writing the above , I had a span grapery twenty-two feet wide on the inside , ( see view of this house , ) which had four sets of vines planted in it ; at that time , it was a matter of doubt with me whether or not the vines were too much crowded ; since then , they have matured a fine crop of grapes , and the fruit on the two inside sets of vines was fully equal in quality and quantity to those where the roots were in the open border , and had more room to ramble and extend themselves . The present summer , these inside vines have upon them a very heavy crop ; each vine having shown from fifty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to mature more than from six bunches for the Syrian , up to twenty for the Hamburgh , being only in the fourth season . When the vines are fully established , the grapes will hang from the sill to the ridgepole , and present a beautiful appearance . If there is ample room , I would substitute this house for the one twenty feet wide , and with only three sets of vines . /z/ Glass houses , for horticultural purposes , may be constructed in a great variety of forms , to suit the particular circumstances of the place , or ground where it is to be located . It is important to have as Httle obstruction to the admission of light , and as little solid wood work , as is consistent with a proper degree of strength in the frame and sashes which are /z/ to support the glass , as possible . It is also important , in frigid climates , to guard against the admission of cold , or the escape of heat ; consequently , the ends and the back , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood , stone , or brick . Oiled paper and cloth , and other preparations on cloth , have been used for covering the roof , but with no good result ; glass is the only article that can be used to advantage . To admit air , which is essential to the flavor of the fruit , and the well-being of the plant , the front lights , or windows , as also the upper part of the roof-sashes , are made to open out , or to run on rollers . The curvilinear roof is approved by many . The following description of some houses of my own , which answer the purpose for which they were constructed perfectly well , and the manner of building them , together with the cost , accompanied with a view of these , is deemed sufficient for this treatise . The account of the cost of two houses , built by other gentlemen , that are so very unlike mine in their dimensions , has been added , as they may be the means of affording the information wanted , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan and the manner of building of the span-roofed grapery , which is represented in the drawing as in full fruit , in September. * This is not heated by artificial means , and is what is usually called a cold house . After the border was prepared , the stone posts were placed upright , the bottoms of them being three to four feet deep in the soil , and eight feet apart . Holes are drilled about one and a half inches in the sides of these stones , to which the sills are secured by pieces of iron , with the head flattened so as to be nailed to the timber , and the end bent to hook into the hole ; the posts should not be less than six inches square . ( Wooden posts , or brick piers , may be substituted for the stone ; the former will soon decay , and , if the latter are used , /z/ they should be eight by twelve inches ; the stones are best . ) The dimensions of this house are as follows : twentj-two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside , at the ridge-pole ; and a little short of eighty feet in length . On the posts arc placed the sills , ( as above described , ) which are six or eight inches above the top of the ground ; to the sill is nailed , covering about two inches of it and going down two inches into the earth , thick plank , finished with a bevel , like a water table . This , from the top of the sill to the earth , makes a solid Avork of at least twelve inches , which is necessary , as glass so near the earth would be very liable to be broken , and would also be covered with the soil spattered up by the rain . In winter , it will be prudent to tack or otherwise secure above this , boards , one foot in Avidth , to prevent the breakage of the glass from the ice and snow falling from the roof . The sills are of timber six inches square . All the measurements are after the work is finished . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is immediately over the sill , and called the plate , is five inches thick by six inches wide . The studs , or upright pieces , which support this plate , are of plank two inches thick by six inches wide , and are mortised into the sill and plate , and secured by wooden pins . The sill and plate are carried round the four sides of the house on a level , and are secured together ; this makes the frame , thus far , very firm , and prevents the two ends from pressing in or out from any cause . Before the roof was put on , the plate was strengthened and braced , and kept in place by iron rods one inch thick and about fifteen feet apart , which are run through it and fastened by nuts , and crossing the house . A cleat , five eighths of an inch in thickness and one inch wide , was nailed on the sill , and plate , and studs , to form a rabbet for the sashes ; these are placed in , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , are on the same line with the outside of the studs . The corner posts are six inches /z/ square . The height of the studs , between the sill and the plate , is six feet one inch . ( They must be made longer , to allow for the part used in the mortise . ) The upright sashes are three feet ten inches wide , and six feet one inch long , and glazed with six by eight glass . The stiles , or side-pieces of the sashes , are two and one fourth inches wide , and one and three eighths inches thick , and the rails , or top and bottom pieces , are two and three fourths wide ; the inside pieces , of which there are four , are one and three eighths inches Avide , and seven eighths of an inch thick ; they are rabbeted to take the glass ; they go from top to bottom . There are no cross-pieces used for glazing , but this is begun at the bottom of the sash , and the next glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( not any more , as it is more likely to break , ) and so on , one above the other ; all the sashes are glazed in this manner ; there are five rows of glass to a sash . The sashes are strengthened in the middle by a piece of iron , one inch wide and one fourth of an inch thick , which is cut in even with the surface of the sash , on the inside , and secured with a screw in each stile and inside piece which supports the glass . These sashes are hung on hinges at the top , and open out , and are fastened on the inside with pieces of iron one fourth of an inch thick and one inch wide . This is about fourteen inches long , and it is secured to the rail of the sash by a staple ; and , to hold the sash closed or open at any desired distance from two to ten inches , another staple is driven into the sill ; the iron plate has holes drilled in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to secure the sash , when shut , that it can be kept open to allow the air to enter the house as wanted , in greater or smaller quantity ; an iron pin secures this plate to the staple . On the ends , the lower sashes are made like the side ones , but they are all stationary . ( In this house , only every other one of the sashes are made to open ; they can all be so , if desired . ) The sashes above the plate are made to fit the inclination of the roof . /z/ The roof is formed by rafters made of plank ; they are about thirteen feet long , two inches thick , and nine inches wide . A strip of wood , the length of the lower sash , is nailed to the rafter to support this on the roof . Another piece is nailed on the upper part to support the other sash ; this must be put on in a line with the lip on the lower sash to allow the upper to run over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch thick . On the top of the lower sash is a piece of hard pine for the rollers of the upper to run over , of which rollers there are two on each side of the upper sash ; they are of cast iron , secured to an iron plate , and screwed on the under part of the stile . The roof-sashes are not of the same length , the top ones being made shorter than the lower to run up and down more easily , the difference being about two feet . The bottom rail of the lower sash of the roof is four and one half inches wide ; the top rail is two and three fourths inches ; the stile is two and one fourth inches wide , and one and three eighths thick ; this is nailed at the bottom to the plate , and on the side to the rafters . In the upper sash , the stiles are the same as in the under , and the rails are both alike ,  --  two and three fourths inches wide ; the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upright ones , and , in all , are bevelled off , instead of a moulding , to about three eighths of an inch in the centre . Both sashes are strengthened with iron rods , let in even with the surface of the under part of the wood work , and screwed to each stile and inside piece , as are the upright ones ; the glass is glazed in the same Avay . The centre , or ridge-piece , to which the rafters are let hi and secured , is a plank two inches thick and ten inches wide ; the groove for each rafter to rest in is about three eighths of an inch deep ; they are fastened together by nails ; between the rafters , for the sash to rest on , is a piece of plank . As the means of lowering or shutting the upper light , or sash , a staple is placed in the ridge-piece , to which is fastened the end of a hne , that is then led through a side pulley on the /z/ sasli , and thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it is secured . ( Or , what is better , have a weight of six , eight , or ten pounds attached , as may be necessary . ) The pulleys are of iron , and screwed on to the wood . The finish of the ridge-piece is with a capping of boards , that are of a width to cover the upper part , or about an inch of the sash . The wood work of the house is simply planed smooth , and painted ; there are no beads or mouldings . On the rafters , after the sashes are fitted in place , to make a finish , are capping Ijoards of suitable width . Two doors , two feet eight inches wide , are placed opposite to each other at the ends ; they are of glass , and are made like the upright sashes . The above is a description of the manner of building the ends and one side of the grapery ; the other half is made , in every respect , in the same way . The expense of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is fifty feet wide , and the vines , some of which , being rare , cost high , was about $1,000 . The following is a description of the manner of constructing a lean-to house " with a room extending the whole length of it on the back , or north side , to be used for the furnace , or other purposes . ( See cut . ) The sill should be set on posts of stone , ( both of which must be six inches square , ) and to extend around on all sides of the house alike ; the posts should be three or four feet in the earth , and eight feet apart , and the tops of them eight to twelve inches above the surface , to keep the sill from rotting . On this should be nailed a plank , extending into the soil an inch or two . You . may make the width of this house twelve or fourteen feet ; that is , the part of it which is to be covered with glass , and the back room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A partition which is to be made here will require a sill and posts , in the same manner as the other parts of the building . The front plate should be four feet from the top of the /z/ posts , and four inches tliick by six inches - wide ; the upright sashes , two feet four inches high , and about three feet ten inches wide , and one and one fourth inches thick , hung on the top with hinges , and made to open out . The studs which support the plate are to be of a length proportionate to the sashes , and the wood work below them , and mortised in . The whole finish of the front , and the make of the sashes , and the manner of fastening them on the front and on the roof , are to be the same as detailed for the span house ; the roUers on the windows , and the irons to secure the front Lean-to Grapery. sashes , are made exactly in the same manner , and put on in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen inches of solid wood work joining on to the plank which goes from the sill to the earth . The rafters should be about seventeen feet long , and ten inches deep by two inches thick , to be finished and let into the ridge-pole , in the same way as in the span-roofed house . The back of the house should be framed , boarded , shingled , and plastered on the inside . The back roof , which is to decline at a proper pitch , should be boarded , shingled , and i ) las- /z/ tered . Under the ridge-pole must be the studs to support this , and these shoukl be twelve feet in the clear between the ridgepole and the sill , and here should be a dou ) le partition of plaster to separate the front of the house from the back . The rafters and the ridge-pole must be finished - with a capping board . There are to be two doors , one at each end , two feet eight inches wide , of glass ; the ends are also best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gutters may be placed under the roof to lead the rainwater where desired . Sohd brick work may be substituted for the support of the sills , leaving spaces six inches s. uare for the stems of the vines to be brought through . The back wall may also be built of brick or stone , but they would be more costly constructed in this way . A house built , as above described , on stone posts , in the plainest manner , but of good materials and workmanship , and well painted , would cost about eight dollars per running foot . The heating apparatus would be in addition ; also , the expense of preparing the border , purchasing the vines , and the planting of them out . The cost of the border , and of the heating apparatus , must vary according to the natural soil , and the purposes to which the house is to be put . Making a border twenty-five or thirty feet wide , and three feet deep , is an expensive work , and will vary from one to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the heating of the house ; a grapery forced in winter , ( that is , in December , ) will , in a severely cold climate , require a very expensive apparatus ; a furnace and flue , for forwarding and protecting the vines in the spring or autumn , is a simple and cheap aifair , and the cost will vary , according to the amount of heat required , from one dollar to three dollars per foot . I think ten dollars the running foot is the lowest price at which a plain grapery , with a simple furnace , can be built , with vines planted , and all complete ; and this cost can be increased , /z/ according to the material used in the construction of the building , and the finish put upon it , to twenty dollars the foot . The foUowino ; is an account of the cost of a house constructed on the most economical principle , furnished me by a friend residing in a city adjoining Boston :  --  " I send you the account of the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve feet in width , and thirteen feet high on the back , and three feet on the front ; and this front is wood work , supported by wooden posts . " Cost of sashes , $25 00 " " glass , 14 00 " " glazing , 21 00 " " frame , painting , &c.,; ... 75 00 " " flue , 50 00 " " border , 40 00 Whole cost , $225 00 - ' My grapery is placed against the back part of my house , which would make some difference in the expense . I have not included the vines , nor the wires for the vines to be trained to . " It will be noticed , that the cost of the back of the house is saved in this instance . This would vary according to the finish and kind of back used ; if of the cheapest kind , wood and shingles , and plastered on the inside , with a small furnace room , it might be built for seventy-five dollars ; but , if a room for the furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grapery , which would be proper in a cold climate , if the house was to be used for forcing , the expense would be considerably greater . The cost of a house of this kind , with the back wall , would not be less than ten dollars the running foot , and this would include every thing , the vines of common kinds , and the wires or rods for the trellis . The price of labor , in different places , would cause some variation in this sum , and a more extensive furnace room or /z/ building on the rear - would add from one to two dollars per foot to the cost , accordhig to the kind of room or wall constructed . The following is an account of the cost of a small graperj , on all sides of glass , with a brick foundation , furnished me by a gentleman of Salem :  --  " All the space which could be spared for the purpose was seventeen square feet . The house is seventeen feet in length bj nine feet in width . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , ( with four hanging windows in front , of three panes each , seven by nine glass , ) on which is placed a sill six inches deep . There are five rafters , with a corresponding number of posts on the back of the house , framed into a plate at the top . The inclined sashes are permanent ; the angle of inclination is fifty degrees . The vertical sashes on the back side are nine feet in length . The ventilation is from the back , the ends , and the front . " The border is eight feet wide , well elevated , fifteen inches deep , exclusive of a substratum of bones , nine inches deep . " There are five front vines , which are planted on the outside ; four back vines in the alternate spaces , and one vine at each end , are planted on the inside . The entrance is at the end of the house by a porch projecting three feet , and containing an inner lattice door for ventilation . " The house would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in width . The border also , if possible , should have been twelve or fifteen feet wide , which would obviate the necessity of an annual manuring with guano , in order to carry oflf the crop well . " One hundred and twenty-five pounds of well-ripened gi'apes can be safely calculated upon from such a house as the above , as a permanent annual crop ; say five front vines at fifteen pounds each , seven back and end vines at seven pounds each . With a wider border , the front vines would ripen equally well twenty pounds each . " Cost of the whole , including vines , preparation of border , /z/ and all expenses , two hundred and seventy-five dollars ; or , about sixteen dollars the running foot . The grapery is not heated by artificial means . " This house is built on a brick foundation , and the finish is of the most complete kind ; fifty or seventy-five dollars might have been saved , if desired , in the labor bestowed on the wood work . " /z/ In remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace and flue are , at all times , a valuable aid in the grapery . They are of easy construction , and may be made of these dimensions , and after this plan . The furnace should be sunk in the earth so that the top of it may not be over ten or twelve inches above the floor of the house . It should be so placed , that the whole of the heat may be given out in the grapery , the door and end being in the furnace-room , so that the smoke and dust from the flues may not injure the foliage of the vines . The pit for the furnace should be about four feet wide , and three or four feet deep , and of convenient length for working the fire . The furnace should be two feet or two feet six inches wide , and about three feet in length . The ground should be paved with stone or brick for the foundation ; on this build the furnace , leaving ten inches in height in the centre , and of the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See end view of a greenhouse furnace . ) Now set the grate , which will require about two and a half inches of space ; build up the brick work , leaving a space for the fire of about twelve or thirteen inches high by ten or twelve inches wide , and two feet four inches deep on the inside . The door should be of cast iron , and on a cast iron frame , which should be set in the masonry in building . The grate endures the heat from the anthracite coal better if cast in separate pieces , half an inch thick , and two and a half inches deep , with two spaces of about /z/ an inch in length , at proper distances from the ends , where the thickness is three fourths of an inch , the ends , also , being of this size . The sides of the fireplace must be built of fire brick ; the top must be covered , also , with tile , or brick of this material , if coal is to be used . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more courses of brick . My furnaces have five or six , to retain and prevent too great escape of the heat . In the cut , the top of the furnace is represented as arched ; this is not necessary , but it may slope from the front to the back , where it enters the flue , three or four inches , with benefit to the draft . At the further end of the furnace , the flue should commence , and should have a rising of certainly two to three feet from the grate , to insure a good draft ; the flue should run to the front of the house , and thence along this , at the distance of twelve inches from the wall . This flue should be of brick , carefully made , to prevent the escape of smoke or gas ; it may be eight to ten inches square on the outside , or it may be fourteen inches wide , and eight inches deep , and covered with tiles ; either answers perfectly well . If the house is a very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flue may return on the back of the house , and the smoke be carried ofi " by the chimney near the furnace . If the house is over twenty feet in length , the better way will be to continue it around the end to the back Avail , and up by a chimney out of the roof , as represented in the cut of the lean-to house . The flue , for the first twelve feet after leaving the furnace , should be built on two or three courses of brick , ( or a stone foundation may be substituted , ) from thence to the chinmey either on plank , ( which is preferable on account of dryness , ) or on bricks laid one to two inches apart ; one course of brick is suSicient for the floor of the flue . I usually have the first few feet of the sides of the flue built with the bricks laid flat , and , after this , on their sides , as represented in the lean-to house . /z/ When the house is to be heated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steady heat is required through the whole winter , ) the furnace and flue should he built and arranged in the same way as detailed in the preceding article ; but , instead of covering the furnace with tile and brick , the boiler may be used . This may be of cast iron , or of sheet copper , and of proper size for the furnace . It is necessary to have fifteen or eighteen inches depth to this , that ample space may be allowed for the pipes , one above the other , on the side . The lower one should enter as near the bottom as possible , and the upper one as near the top . The principle upon which the water acts is this , that hot water is lighter than cold ; consequently , when this becomes heated by the fire , it rises to the top and thence to the pipe ; the cold water in the lower pipe comes in to fill the space of that heated , and the circulation commences , and is more rapid when the boiler contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always full , which they must be . But it is essential for a rapid circulation that ample distance be allowed between the pipes , which may be from four to six inches in diameter ; the lower one should be arranged first , and supported and kept in place on a perfect level , by brick or stone . Above this , should be the upper and warmest one , properly levelled and arranged . You may place the pipes on either side of the furnace , but the side next the front of the house is usually the one considered best ; I would recommend four to six inches for the space between them . I have in my houses , at the extreme end , a tank containing thirty gallons or more of water , to which the pipes are attached , in the same manner as to the boiler ; but this is not necessary , though preferable . The pipes may connect at the end by an elbow , and they work equally well ; but a tank at this place with a quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this is the coldest part of the /z/ house . An opening must be provided on the top of the boiler , or tank , to fill these with the water . /z/ Much discussion has been held of late in England , relative to this mode of heating green and other houses for horticultural purposes , and some curiosity has been excited in this comitrj as to what the system is . The principle is similar to that upon which many of our churches and dwelling-houses have , for many years , been warmed . It is the same with air as with water ,  --  the heated becomes the lighter and ascends ; consequently the cold or heavier descends , and fills the place vacated . In the view of the furnace which is given , * the Polmaise system is attached , the arrows showing the current of heated air over the furnace , and the bending one the rushing in of the cold air to fill the space , and thus the circulation is kept up while the heat is in the furnace . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dotted places in this are the openings for the cold air . The side view shows also the smoke-flue and the finish of the furnace , with a dead air chamber to receive any ashes that may pass from this and prevent their entering the flue . One opening in the covering of the Polmaise , for the escape of the heated air , is shown , and this covering may be continued as desired , and the heat led by brick , or copper , or other pipes to any spot desired . In the hot-air chamber may be placed pans to contain water , that the heated air may have the required moisture ; these can be regulated at pleasure , having more or less , or none at all , as the state of the house requires . For instance , in the early stages of forcing , you would require all the moisture that could be obtained in this way . If , with such an apparatus , a fire was made to preserve the fruit from frost or other causes after it was ripe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had attached to a furnace already constructed , ( and that has been some time in use , ) of dimensions similar to the one described , a system of circulation of the air which has proved very successful . It is very simple . The furnace has been enclosed , on the three sides within the house , with brick work , leaving two or three inches of space only for the hotair chamber on all sides , and this brick enclosure is continued along the sides of the flue , ( where the heat is great , ) for about ten feet . The whole of this brick work is then covered with stones , placed two inches above the furnace , and the heat is led into any part of the house by a brick flue , covered on the top with stones and closed at the ends , with two openings near the extremity for the hot air to flow out on each side . An opening is left , about three inches square , on the level of the floor on each side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back wall of the house , to admit the cold air , which commences to rush in as soon as the furnace and flue become warmed ; and this circulation continues for hours after the fire has burnt out , the brick work retaining the heat a great length of time . The cost of this apparatus was about twenty-five dollars additional . /z/ The border should be twenty feet wide , for each set of vines ,  --  if thirty feet , the better ,  --  and two and a half or three feet deep ; if you have but little room , you can manage to grow very fair grapes with twelve feet of border ; but , in this case , you must not plant the vines so close together , * The following course is recommended in preparing the border :  --  If the soil is a good loam , begin at one end and trench it ; mark off " ten feet the entire width ; throw out the soil two /z/ feet deep ; if bones , or the carcasses of animals can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are not readily procured , slaughter-house manure may be substituted ; * mark off ten feet more of the border , and cover this manure with part of the soil from it ; upon this , put an inch or two of oyster shells , or old lime rubbish , mixed with broken bricks ; over this , put some soil from the border ; then a good covering of cow manure ; upon this , a slight covering of loam again , followed with a good portion of oyster shells , or the substitute ; and over this , a thick covering of stable manure , well rotted ; finish with a covering of the loam.f The Avhole length is to be made m this manner , in alternate spaces of ten feet each trenching . After it is finished , the border should be three feet six inches deep ; it will settle to less than three feet in a few months ; any soil left , after it is finished , can be carried off . J * See Manures. t Drain for the Border .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan : the main one to be of brick , extending the whole length of , and on the outside of the border , the bottom of this being covered with stones not less than one foot deep . On these , every six feet , should be smaller drains of brick , tile , or stone , leading to the main one , and this can be carried to any convenient point . I have never found it necessary to form these under any border , stones at the bottom answering every purpose . Verj ' few situations can require them in this countrj ' . Dr. Lindley is of opinion , that , in the draining of the border , the improvement is more by the admission of air and heat than by the removal of water .  --  Gardeners ' Chronicle , 1847 , p. 651 . X The above is the method by which I have twelve thousand square feet of border prepared . After throwing out the soil , the materials are placed in the border , and following each other in these proportions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or the carcasses of animals , or bones , etc .. ) four inches of soil , two inches of shells , four inches of soil , six inches of cow manure , four inches of soil , three inches of shells , four or five inches of stable manure , and six inches of soil . These articles were thrown as roughly as possible into place , and not levelled ; the first manure , for instance , in some places , would be only six inches deep , and in others , ten or twelve , or more , just as it would happen to fall from the shovel , the above measurements being near what they would have been , if on a level . Avoiding , as much as possible , the forming of layers , which , at first sight , would seem to be the case , but the juices of the strong manures would be all imbibed by the soil placed amongst them , and rendered rich accordingly . In the strong manure , at the bottom of the border , no care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this border , are one half loam , one fourth hones , or other strong manure , one eighth oyster shells , or lime and brick rubbish , and one eighth rotten stable manure . Before planting the vines , the border should be spaded over , to mix well the top substances , being careful not to disturb the strong manures at bottom , as these substances , when decomposing , would destroy any of the roots of the vine with which they came in contact . Should the soil be poor , decrease the proportion used in preparing the border , and , in the same ratio , increase the manures , or substitute the top soil of a loamy pasture . If the soil is very poor , or unsuitable for the purpose , so as to require to be removed entirely , then a compost , prepared thus , is recommended :  --  one half to be the top soil of an old pasture ; one quarter to be bones , or some other strong masame material throughout ; but , as they could be procured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( before they became offensive . ) If the carcass of an animal was had , it was simply quartered , and laid in and covered with the soil . If the entire skeleton of the horse was had , ( of which there are , iu this border , at least fort ' , ) it was similarly placed , as also die slaughter-house manure ; but when , as was the case in some parts , bones were used which had been boiled , the floor of the border was covered with these from two to four inches deep , and the freshest cow manure which could be had was placed to the depth of from two to four inches upon them , and this again was covered with a like quantitj ' of bones , which were stuck into the manure in every direction , care being had that they should not lie flat on its surface ; the object in view , being to have as rich a material in this case , as when the other manures were employed . Sometimes , old mortar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with them . In preparing this border , there was found a diflercnce in the natural soil , part of il being a very rich yellow loam , several feet deep , and part of it a gravelly or slaty soil , not more than two feet deep , upon a bottom of rotten rock . The rich soil did not require as much manure as the thin , and received less , but more shells , and old mortar , and bricks ; and the thin slaty soil received more than the above proportions of manures , and less of the shells , etc . This border is on a hill-side , and these arc the extremes of soils at the top and bottom . Thus situated , there was no occasion for rocks , or any kind of drainage at the bottom of the border , and , consequently , none was used . In a border since made , to the above ingredients I have added a good proportion of charcoal screenings , and , when they can be had convenicnth , they should alwa3 's form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending to kecj ) the soil porous and light , and , also , as affording moisture in seasons of drought , and as absorbents of ammonia from the atmosphere . /z/ nure ; one eighth oyster shells , or lime and brick rubbish ; one eighth rotten manure ; these articles thrown together in a heap , and so to remain until decomposed and amalgamated , when they should be placed in the border , and thrown loosely together . It is unnecessary to attempt to give rules for every kind of soil . One must use his own judgment , and make his border to consist , as near as can be , of the above ingredients . He must bear in mind that , if his soil is a stiff , clayey loam , he must add freely of such materials as will lighten and give permeability to it . If the soil is light , sandy , or gravelly , with the manure should be added a proportion of clay or of clayey loam . The rich alluvion soil , abounding in our Westem and South Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any thing is requisite to improve them , it must be shells , charcoal , leaves , small stones , or gravel ,  - -  such materials as will loosen the soil . If a compost is to be prepared , as is usually recommended by European writers on the cultivation of the grape , by taking the top soil of an old pasture , &c.,; and throwing them into a heap untU decomposed , two or three years are required before the border is in readiness for the vines ; whereas , by the plan which I have adopted , the vines may be planted immediately , making due allowance in the placing of the vine for its settling , which will be in proportion to the freshness of the manures , or the carcasses of animals that enter into its compost , which , in dissolving , diminish greatly , and this in ratio to the flesh upon them ; the large bones will change but little for many years . What is wanted in a grape border , is a rich , permeable soil , enduring in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely . Too much water will injure the fruit ; a deficiency of moisture will prevent its swelling off properly . The following account of Soils and Manures , as recommended by several eminent cultivators , is annexed :  --  /z/ SpeecUy recommends " the soil to be one fourth part of garden mould , a strong loam ; one fourth , of the swarth or turf from a pasture where the soil is a sandy loam ; one fourth , of the sweepings and scrapings of pavements and hard roads ; one eighth , of rotten cow and stable-yard dung mixed ; and one eighth , of vegetable mould from reduced and decayed oak leaves . The swarth should be laid on a heap , till the grass roots are in a state of decay , and then turned over and broken with a spade ; let it then be put to the other materials and the whole worked together , till the separate parts become uniformly mixed . " A garden , and consequently the hothouse , is sometimes so happily situated in regard to soil that it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine . The soil in which I have known the vine to prosper in a superlative degree , without artificial aid , was a kind of rich , sandy loam , intermixed with thin beds of materials , like jointed slate or stones , and so very soft in its nature as almost to be capable of being crumbled between the fingers . The following extract from Virgil , on this topic , will be deemed neither inapplicable nor disagreeable to the candid reader :  --  ' But where the soil , with fat'ning moisture fill 'd , Is clothed with grass , and fruitful to be till 'd ; Such as in cheerful vales we view from high , Which dripping rocks with rolling streams supply , And feed with ouze ; where rising hillocks run In length , and open to the southern sun ; Where fern succeeds , ungrateful to the plough . That gentle ground to generous grapes allow . ' " As the vegetable mould from decayed leaves can not always be obtained , by reason that the leaves require to lie two years before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substitute some other ingredient in lieu of this part of the compost . Rotten wood reduced to a fine mould ; the scrapings of the ground in old woods , where the trees grow thick together ; mould out of hollow trees , and sawdust reduced to a fine mould , provided it be not from /z/ wood of a resinous kind , are , in part , of a similar nature with vegetable mould from decayed leaves , but are neither so rich nor powerful . It is very probable that there are various other kinds of manure , that may be introduced into a compost suitable for the vine with as much effect as the former ; as blood , the offal of animals or shambles , horn shavings , old rags , hair , shavings of leather , and bone dust . This last is exceedingly proper , as , at the same time that it gives a lightness to the soil , it contributes to its fertility . I may also add to the former the dung of deer and sheep , as , likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that many , if not all , of the above-recited manures will require time to meliorate , before they can be introduced and incorporated with the other part of the compost . The dust , or dirt , from roads consists principally of the following particulars : first , the soil of the vicinity ; secondly , the dung and urine of horses , and other animals ; and thirdly , the materials of the road itself , when pulverized . " After having specified manures known to be friendly to the vine , it may not be improper to name some that seem hurtful to it . Soot , wood ashes , pigeon and hen dung , would all , I think , be too hot for the roots of the vine . These are manures that come immediately into action , and are more properly calculated for top dressing . Pond mud and moor earth would probably be too cold , and the latter might canker the roots of the vine , and therefore , on that account , had better be omitted . " In the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured by the frost , they should be mulched to the thickness of three or four inches with strawy manure . A little very rotten manure may be spread all over the border . This is to be done the first season after planting . " By the end of the second year after planting , the vines will have extended their roots to almost every part of the border ; and as , at this tender age , the roots are very liable to receive injury by severe frosts , I would advise the borders to /z/ be covered the thickness of three or four mches with long , dead , strawy dung . This is to be removed in the spring ; a little of the very rotten may be permitted to remain , as this , with the addition of a little rotten cow dung , should be worked into the border every spring . " Extract by Speedily from Marshall 's Travels , which he introduces by saying that he hopes will prove acceptable , as the kind of manure , and the best time of applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My landlord told me , that he had an intimate acquaintance , a vigneron , at Verzenay , who was reckoned one of the most careful managers in all the country , and that he would give me a letter to him , requesting him to give me all the information I desired . This I readily accepted , and proceeded to Verzenay , where I inquired for the vigneron the landlord at Chalons had wrote to . We walked directly into his vineyard , which was dunging , in trenches made for that purpose . The season for this , most approved here , is directly after the vintage , and to be finished before the winter sets in . It is all carried in on the heads of women and children in baskets , and they empty their baskets in trenches dug for that purpose , which are doing at the same time , and others spread it in the trenches , and cover it with mould immediately . Sometimes the trenches are made along the centre of the intervals , at others , they are dug between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cow dung , that is , the cleanings of the cow-houses , which are well littered with straw or stubble for that purpose ; horse dung is also used , but only on stiff soils . They reckon that five to eight hundred baskets are necessary for an acre of vines . The baskets , I reckon , hold about half a bushel , and this manuring is repeated every four or five years . Making dung is so much attended to throughout all the wine country , that every means are used to increase the quantity . Much cattle are kept , especially cows , and housed as much as possible . These are fed by every means that can be taken . Every weed , every /z/ blade of grass that arises , is saved - with as much care as the grapes , and given to the cows . Dung is , however , sometimes laid on in JNIarch , but it is not thought so proper for that work as autumn . Over-manuring is thought prejudicial . But this depends on the soil ; for some lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are manured more than commonly , they will not yield a crop ; they lay a thousand baskets , and sometimes even twelve hundred on such . " Speedily says that the vine requires " a plentiful supply of water during summer , particularly in a hot , dry season . " ' It was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine . '  --  Ezekiel , xvii. 8 . " In hot countries , the vine is said to grow the most luxuriant in a situation which is near the water , but it is generally allowed , that the flavor of the grape from vines in such a situation is much inferior to that of grapes growing in a dry soil . " During winter , I have frequently Avatered the vine border with a thick , black liquor , the drainage of the dunghills ; and , though this practice was intended solely to enrich the soil , yet it is not improbable but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may communicate a warmth to the roots of the vine during the winter , and thereby prove serviceable in that respect also . However that may be , from the uncommon vigor of the vines , I have been led into a belief of the utility of this practice . But let me at the same time observe , that I have always applied this powerful manure , ( if I may so call it , ) with great caution . I have found the beginning of winter the most proper time for using this kind of manure ; and then I only venture to give two or three plentiful waterings , fearing that , if this were to be applied either in the spring or the summer , or even in too great quantities , it might tend , from its great power , to cause the leaves of the vine to change from a green to a yellow hue . The drainage of the dunghill is the very strength and power of the dung ; for water , constantly filtering through stable yard /z/ dung , certainlj robs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly abounds , when newly made ; and especially such dung as has lain a considerable time in the stable , and imbibed a large portion of the urine of the horses . The saline particles are increased by the fermentation , therefore the first extract obtained from the dung , after it has undergone its fermentation , may be justly considered as the essence of the manure . " Although soils of different qualities admit of improvement by various modes of practice , yet , without the aid of manure , the farmer would find his utmost exertions of but little value . And though some have endeavored to prove that the earth , when duly pulverized by the action of the plough , does not require manure , ( Mr , Tull , in his New Husbandry , tells us that , where the ground is properly managed , manure is an useless article : but his opinion is now generally and justly exploded ; ) yet experience tells us that it is the very life and soul of husbandry ; and , when judiciously applied on almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of the farmer . " By an experienced grape grower .  --  This person says the border " should be from thirty to forty feet in width , and should be formed of loamy soil , sharp sand , and at least a fourth part of well rotted horse dung .

Forsyth .  --  " At the back wall of the grapery , the soil is prepared to the depth of six feet ; and at the further extremity of the border , ( sixteen feet wide , ) there are three and a half feet of soil composed of equal parts of the following soils : turfy loam , ( the top spit of a very old undisturbed piece of pasture , occupied as a rick yard , ) two parts ; rotten dung , one part ; lime rubbish , one part ; gritty mud , ( the same as road drift , ) one part .

The best bottom , in my opinion , is one formed of large fiat stones got from the top of a lime rock , which is of a nature that would assist the growth of the vines when they reached it . The border ought not to be deeper than from two feet to three feet ; as , if it is more , the roots of the vines will get away from the action of the summer weather , and the good of the manure that may be put on the surface . I would have the border formed of decomposed turf and good black earth , with a sufficient quantity of decomposed cow dung , vegetable mould , and slaked lime , well mixed by frequently turning it , and which should be allowed to lie for two years , if convenient . " With regard to the surface manuring of the border , as soon as the wood of the vine is fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches deep , with a blunt dung-fork , and six inches of the best cow dung should be put on . To supply liquid manure for the border of one house , get one bushel of common salt , as much black soap , and a quantity of the drainings of stable yard dung , all put into a large cask , and allow it to stand for a week ; after which , mix it with a large quantity of rainwater , and put it regularly over the border ; then put on as much common earth as will completely cover the dung , but no more . "  --  Loudon ' ' s Magazinc , 6. 12th , p. 244 . Mr. Loudon , in his Encyclopedia of Gardening , after quoting the composts , as recommended by Speedily , Abercrombie , McPhail , Nicol , Griffin , and Judd , adds these words : " The depth of the border must be regulated , in all cases , by the subsoil , and the climate . Where the former is moist , and the latter is cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , where the subsoil is perfectly dry , and the climate hot , as in the south of France , the depth may be unlimited .

" An excellent vine border may be formed upon an impervious dry bottom , two feet deep , and composed of liglit , ricli , loamy earth , enriched with rotten manure , ground bones , and lime . It is better to extend the border in breadth than in depth . "  --  Charles Mcintosh , London , 1839 . Clement Hoare , in an after-edition of his work on the Grape Vine , recommends that , for winter-forcing , the vines be planted on the inside of the grapery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil should be removed from the mside of the house , which is to be supported by a Avail of solid masonry on all sides to prevent the roots of the vines penetrating it to the outside . After the soil is removed , his plan is to pave the ground A " ith brick , set in cement , and this space is intersected with brick Avork , with openings occasionally , for the roots to penetrate and ramble . This brick work is to be a support for the bricks Avhich are to cover the Avhole , after completion . The substances , in which the vines are to groAV , are broken bricks , lumps of mortar , charcoal , and bones , in equal proportions , soaked in urine . His idea is , that these materials , once moistened and then placed in the situation prepared as above , can never become diy ; that the moisture of the earth will keep the whole mass sufficiently supplied with water , and that it never can have an excess . In planting the Aines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all soil . It is advised to have two pieces of woolen blanket , which are to be first soaked in soap suds , to jilant the vines in ,  --  one to be spread on the bottom and the roots laid on this , and the other to cover them ; when this is done , cover over with the compost above named , and , when the Avhole is paved over on the top , the work is complete . This , it will be observed , is planting without a particle of soil . I have never attempted to grow vines after this plan , and most surely shall not ; still , it is to be presumed , occasionally , a plant may succeed . Where the soil is very Avet , the plan , vith the ad-/z/ dition of one half of good loam to the compost , doubtless would do well . In the damp clhnate of England , this compost would probably retain sufficient moisture , and never become dry , as Mr. Hoare says ; but , in the severe droughts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . In preparing a suitable soil for fruit trees in general , De la Quintiney says : " The best earth for this use is a sort of rich sandy loam , which may be taken from near the surface of some rich pasture-ground , where cattle have been fed or fothered , or of some rich sheep-walk , where there is a depth of earth , and if it is mixed with a little old mellow earth , or the like , it may do well ; or cow or horse dung may likewise do well , if it is quite rotten , so as to be like earth ; but of this a small quantity , as one part in four or five , and thoroughly rotted . " page 9 . New earths he also recommends as suitable for trees , &c.; ; these he defines as being " such as have never served for the nourishment of any plant , or else have been a long time built upon , &c.; ; likewise , earth from some rich pasture-ground , of a sandy , loamy nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of excellent use for most sorts of plants ; especially if it has been thrown up in heaps to meliorate , and has taken the - winter frosts , it will be so much the better . " p. 17 . " Now since the great defects of earth are too much moisture , coldness , and heaviness , also lightness , and an inclination to parching , so amongst dungs , some are fat and cooling , as that of oxen and cows ; others , hot and light , as that of sheep , horses , pigeons , &c.; And whereas the remedy must have virtue contrary to the distemper it is to cure , therefore , hot and dry dungs must be used in cold , moist , heavy earths , and oxen and cow dung in clean , dry , light earths , to make them fatter and closer . Not that these two sorts , though the principal , are the only materials for the amendment of earth ; for , upon farm lands , all sorts of stuffs , linen , flesh , skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine , excrements , wood , /z/ fruit , leaves , ashes , straw , all manner of corn or grain , soot , &c.; ; in short , all that is upon or in the earth , ( except stones and minerals , ) serve to amend and better it , " p. 29 .

Saul , Exotic Nursery , Chelsea : ' 1847 , p. 639 . " Vineries at Bishop 's Stortford .  --  The borders are admirably constructed . The houses are built on the side of a low hill , with a gravelly bottom . On the surface of the natural ground , which was coated with concrete , the border has been formed three and a half feet deep at the l ) aclv , and two and a half feet deep in the front , so that it slopes from back to front , wdiere it is rounded oif . No rain can ever lodge there . It was formed with burnt clay , ( the bottom of some old brickkilns , ) loamy turf from an old pasture , plasterer 's rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from the tan yards , and an enormous quantity of thoroughly rotten stable manure ,  --  the last border alone consumed a barge load of forty tons of such manure . All these materials , after being thrown together , were tlioroughly incorporated . They form so loose a bed that a stick may be easily pushed through it to the very bottom . Every November , these borders receive a good mulching of stable manure , which remains to rot in the succeeding summer ; so that the surface is always covered by a rich decaying material which absorbs heat from the sun , and detains the natural dampness of the border . The vines are managed upon Mr. Crawshay 's plan . " These vines were planted in 1843 , cut back in 1844 , when each at once made the whole of the single rod that furnishes the crop . These rods are now , on an average , five and a half inches in circumference , and run straight up the centre of each light , so that the leaves and bunches are exposed to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fruit produced by this practice is represented as being very fine , the bunches not remarkably large , but the berries are said to be beautiful , and the fruit equally distributed on the vines throughout the house .

I would bottom with rough sandstone , or some material which would secure perfect drainage ; and I would cover the latter Avith thin turf , or peat , to prevent it from being choked up . As compost , I would recommend , one fourth , old mortar , bones , and charcoal ,  --  the bones and charcoal to be broken , but not too small ; one fourth , decomposed tree leaves ; and the remaining half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , which should have lain eighteen months in a heap , and frequently turned and exposed to the frost . The whole being well incorporated , fill in the border , taking care to tread as little as possible . " 1847 , p. 685 . " In our opinion , it is doubtful whether any material like slaughter-house manure is fit for vine borders . Its effect is to cause excessive growth , and , for a little while , largo quantities of grapes ; but the effect is transient , and plants suffer finally . It is much better to employ bones , hair , woolen rags , skin , tanners ' fleshings , and similar substances . See Mr. Nash 's border , Bishop 's Stortford . " 1847 , p. 736 . Here the question naturally arises . What is slaughterhouse manure ? or , of what does it consist ? It is to be presumed that this manure varies very much , in its component parts , in different countries , being effected by local customs . Wliat I meant by the substance , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recommend as a substitute for the carcasses of animals , or bones , ) consists mainly of the intestines , with the manures which were in the animals at the time they were killed , all the heads , horns , and feet of sheep , and a good share of bones , and other refuse of other animals . The half of the bulk and weight of the manures has been the heads , the lovt'er half of the legs , and other bones , with some flesh , and skin , and hair , etc. , upon a large part of them . Now all these articles are very powerful manures , and very lasting in their nature , and should not be placed in the border until decomposed in some measure , or , which is better , put at the bottom of the border , where the roots of the vine will find /z/ them the second or third year . A large part of the fleshy matter , in its decomposition , turns to a liquid , and the soil near by imbibes this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Avhcn in this state of decomposition , if they come in contact Avith the roots of the vine , vill instantly destroy the part touched , and this is " why I place it at the bottom of the border , to be there for the future use of the one , and out of the way of doing mischief . If this material is to be used as a top dressing , it should remain in the compost heap till it is entirely decomposed . I consider it , when placed as directed , at the bottom of the border , a most valuable material for the nourishment of the grape vine ; but , if whole bones of animals can be obtained in sufficient quantities , I give them the preference ; not that they are more valuable , but because the slaughter-house manure is ( let it be ever so fresh , ) ahvays an unpleasant and disagreeable object . In countries ( as I presume is the case in England. ) where the heads and bones of animals are considered too valuable to be thrown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , for this purpose , the part constituting its properties for Avhich it has been recommended are wanting , and it is of no more value than any other stimulating manure . " As some difference of opinion exists respecting the proper covering for vine borders , I have ventured to give the material I use , which answers ( under the cu-cumstances , ) as well as any thing I have seen recommended . At the first appearance of frost , I cover the border with dry beech or oak leaves , ( two feet or more in tliickness , ) newly fallen from the trees if I can get them ; cover with a little litter to keep them from blowing away . In spring , as soon as fine weather sets in , I remove the leaves entirely , fork the border over lightly , and add a nice top dressing of rotten manure mixed with the best soil I can procure . " In making the border , I have followed Mr. Iloare 's plan , as far as possible . The foundation is flagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside . I laid on the flags eighteen // inches of broken bricks , lumps of old mortar , &c.,; a little small on the top , on which I put a three-inch sod ( grassy side down , ) to prevent the compost from getting down amongst the bricks . The principal part of the compost consisted of rich turfy loam , leaf mould , and rotten dung , with lime rubbish and gravel to keep it open , and plenty of whole bones and a little carrion to make it durable .  --  A /Subscriber : 1847 , p. 837 . Renovation of Vine Borders .  --  After stating that these must be legion , ( if Ave may judge by the number of complaints , ) Avhich require this remedy , and that the cause mainly is stagnation , it is recommended to enlarge or renew the drains , Avhich are supposed to be inefficient or improperly arranged , or to have become choked up by age . There is added : " Now even a border made of loam ,  --  unless what is termed sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Avould become in time too much closed up to suit the natural habits of the vine ; Iioav much more , then , a three-feet-deep border , in which decomposing organic matter constitutes nearly one half its volume !

Remarks on the Cultivation of the Vine .  --  By James Hutchinson , Gardener at Cranston Hill , near Glasgow . After some remarks relative to spur and other systems of pruning the vine , this writer goes on to recommend the long cane system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully and stated the objections to it , I shall not repeat here his remarks , but shall give what he says relative to the temperature of the house and border where the vines are to be forced . In my opinion , they are Avell worthy of careful attention . " I commence forcing about the end of February , or beginning of March ; previously to which , I cover the vine qwq /z/ morning in order to raise the mercurj in the thermometer to about during the day , and allow the fire to burn out towards night . The temperature in the daytime , from the commencement of forcing , should be regulated , in some measure , by the heat of the vinehouse during the night . For example , if the house has been colder during the night than I could wish , I keep up a greater heat than usual during the following day ; and , if it has been warmer during the night than I consider requisite , I give less fire during the day than usual ; or more air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may object to the lowness of the temperature that I have recommended during the night , when the grapes are in flower ; but all the kinds cultivated here , including the Tokay , Black Hamburgh , White Sweetwater , &c.,; uniformly set well with the heat above mentioned . Indeed , when the nights have been frosty , during the time my vines were in flower , I have seen the thermometer as low as in the morning , and I never observed that they sustained the least injury by this low temperature . Too much dependence has hitherto been placed on the influence of fire heat in the forcino ' of hothouses . The o ; reat art is to do with as little fire heat as possible , and to take the utmost advantage of the heat derivable from the sun 's rays , consistent with giving a sufficient quantity of air . The legitimate use of fire heat is to prevent the bad effects of frosts , snows , and inclement weather . " I may now say a few words on giving air . In clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taken away early in the afternoon . For example , let a small portion of air be given between eight and nine o'clock in the morning , and , if the day continue clear , give more between ten and eleven , and take it all away at three o'clock . I seldom let air into my vinehouses after three o'clock in the afternoon . If air be admitted until the house is completely cooled , a large fire may be necessary to support the requisite temperature ; and it is evident that sun heat is better and cheaper than fire heat . "  --  Sept. , 1838. /z/ By the foregoing , it would appear that the plan of covering the border with heating substances , for the purpose of raising the temperature of the border , was suggested and practised before Mr. Roberts 's book appeared. * It differs from his plan in not recommending the continuance of this heat by renewing of the fermenting materials , which renewal , in my opinion , is unnecessary . Mr. A. Forsyth , in a diary of the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vol. 10 , page 548 , also gives directions relative to the covering of the border , as follows :  --  " Nov. 25th , 1833 . Forked the border about three inches deep ; laid on turfy loam and old lime mortar about two inches deep ; then old hotbed dung , well rotted , two inches deep ; the roots being near the surface , having been planted as shallow as possible . 27th . Laid leaves on the vine border one foot thick , and fresh hot dung one foot : protected the above from rains , &c.,; by reed covers , used at other times for pine pits . Dec. 1st . Fire heat applied . Jan. 5th , 1834 . Heat of dung on the border , 19th . Heat of dung on the border , Feb. 1st . Dung on the border nearly cold . March 12th . Dung , leaves , &c.; cleared off the border to admit sun heat , &c.; ; the border was forked over . April 12th .

Grrapes exhibited at the gardens of the London Horticultural Society , for which the large gold medal was awarded , the berries measurmg three and a half and four inches round . " I can not agree with Mr. Hutchinson in the propriety of his giving fixed hours for opening and closing the lights for the purpose of giving air . These directions may be good for a certain house , and very unsuitable for another . They may be , and probably were , intended as apphcable to a house - vdth a front due south . Now , if the front should be to the southeast , the house thus situated would be exposed to a very great heat one or two hours before the time specified , and , in the /z/ months of May and June , the lights in bright weather would require to be opened much earlier . Again , if the fronting of the house inclines to the west , eight or nine o'clock would be , perhaps , too early . His principle , as applied to the forcinghouse , is correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , when he should have substituted the range of the mercury as a guide . In this country , in May and frequently in the summer months , the mercury ranges in the daytime from to in the shade . At such times , how misuitable for the welfare of the vines would be the closing of the windows of the grapery at an early hour ! Culture of the Vine under Glass .  --  By James Eoberts . London , 1842 . This work is very concise , and , for the climate of England , * unsurpassed m its directions for the preparation of the border , etc. ; yet there are objections to it , particularly as concerns the cultivation in this country . It is divided into six short chapters . In the preface , Mr. Roberts states " that it has been his study to bring the vine into a bearing state earlier than what is commonly practised . " The first chapter treats of the border ; the opinion of the author upon the different compost as recommended by Speechly , Abercrombie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , which is as follows :  --  " The borders outside the houses ought to be twenty-four feet wide , cleared out to the depth of three feet six inches upon a bottom of retentive clay , Avell prepared , with a fall of one foot from back to front . A main drain ought to run along the extremity of the border , one foot six inches deep , with cross drains , in an oblique direction , leading into it , so as to have perfect command in draining oiF superfluous water , which I consider an essential point to attend to , so as to lay them dry ( more particularly where the climate is humid ) ; " If we can judge from the result of the practice , as detailed by the author , whose statements , as regards the crop of fruit and its fine quality , are corroborated by the Gardeners ' Chronicle . /z/ I then laid upon the bottom thus formed , broken stones and lime rubbish to the depth of one foot , leaving a depth for compost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every six or eight feet square , I have placed large limestones , of the same nature as the far-famed Skip ton rock , which I have no doubt contribute to retain moisture in a dry season , and to facihtate the drainage in a wet one . The compost and manures I most recommend , and which I made use of , are , two parts the parings of a piece of old pasture land , a strongloam , laid up one year , ( or till the sward is half decomposed , ) in the form of a potato hod , close covered in with soil , and never turned ; one part , the turf with four inches of the soil , of a looser texture , laid up for the same period , and not turned , as before ; an eighth part , scrapings of the highways formed from limestone , or other hard material ; and the other eighth part , half-decomposed horse or cow dung . I am not an advocate for turning over and mixing the materials promiscuously together , as , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great portion of its fertilizing property by such repeated intermixture ; and , unless it be of a very sandy , loose texture , the border will , in a few years , become impervious both to water and to atmospheric air , which are of incalculable benefit to the growth of the vine . I would recommend the autumn , if the weather be dry , to prepare to fill in your border . A month previous to filling your border , provide a quantity of carrion , cattle dying by accident , disease , &c.,; which , I am sorry to say , has , of late years , been too common an occurrence . If you have collected it sometime beforehand , have it cut into small pieces and laid up in soil , till the time of using . It emits a very nauseous efiluvia , but this must be borne , for this is the pabulum to produce the nectar of Bacchus . When all is ready , and the weather favorable , proceed at one end of your border , wheehng in and mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my previous directions , on no account breaking the materials in mixing , but turn them in as rough as possible , adding /z/ one good-sized horse or cow carcass to every ten or twelve square yards , using caution , and not bringing it to the surface of the border within one foot , as its assistance is not wanted the first year . What I have here recommended , is my practice adopted at this place , the result of which , I dare presume to say , has surprised all , both gentlemen and practical gardeners , who have witnessed it . " Mr. Roberts then goes on to say : " Still , an improvement might be made on this border , particularly where a cool and humid atmosphere prevails , as it does , to a great extent , in the northern parts of these kingdoms . " To obviate this defect , I should recommend , instead of a border two feet six inches deep , with one huge stone every six or eight feet square , to put four or five in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled , to be from fifteen to eighteen inches deep , and to plant the vines as near upon the surface as possible ; you would then be better able to add a top dressing to your border every autumn , so as to feed and keep the roots of your vines near the surface . " The second chapter treats of the kind of grapes for the vinery , etc. , and of the different methods of propagating the ine ; his plan is by the single eye , as follows :  --  " Choose bold , prominent buds , taking two inches of wood ; on each side cut a little sloping , opposite the eye ; then pot singly , in thirty-two sized pots , using leaf mould and sandy loam in equal parts , " prepared fourteen days before placing in the pit . " When your pit is ready , having been filled with stable dung and tree leaves , so as to command a bottom heat of or which you can easily ascertain by inserting a Fahrenheit 's thermometer to the depth of a foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may safely do , being rather sparing of water the first fortnight or three weeks , and never using the water at a lower temperature than the heat of the bed . The temperature of the pit must not exceed by day , and may be allowed to fall to in the night , until the buds are in motion . They will then require the raising of /z/ the heat gradually uutil it reaches by night , by the time the first leaves are fully expanded ; allowing them ten or fifteen degrees more by day , or sun heat , keeping a moist temperature , syringing , and shutting up early in the afternoon . By the time they have grown a foot , or eighteen inches , they will require removal to larger pots . " In the third chapter , the method of planting is detailed , etc . " For a vinery , some authors recommend inside planting , with which I do n't agree , except for the back wall , or for a succession crop , intended to be trained below the rafters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and properly settled , as advised in a former part of this work , in the month of March or April , carefully turn your young vine out of the pot , taking its top through an opening in the sill left for its insertion , leaving two buds clear inside the house ; this will leave the ball three or four feet from the front of the vinery . Open the soil opposite to each rafter . Then jDroceed to single out the roots with great care , spreading them out in the fan manner , filhng in amongst them with the compost of leaf mould and sandy loam , keeping them as near the surface as possible , laying in the young cane forward to the wall , and not allowing it to be buried more than three inches . A little water would be of service , at the time of planting , in Avashing in the soil , to the benefit of the roots , mulching them over with a little litter . In the course of a week from the time of planting , lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stems , stable litter and leaves in a good state of fermentation , to the width of eight feet , and two feet six inches thick , which will prove of great benefit to the young plant by putting its roots in motion , and cause that part of the stem that is layered to emit healthy roots in abundance , not employing artificial heat inside , but giving plenty of air , which still continue , untn you perceive the buds in motion , allowing the house to rise to or by sun heat ; syringing the buds and steaming the house , as the heat rises in the fore part of the day , closing early in the afternoon , and allowing the house to cool down , as night approaches , to or /z/ " When your shoots have sprung three or four mches , make choice of the best , and rub the other oif . As the shoots elongate , tie them carefully to the wires , taking off all tendrils and laterals as they appear . I may be allowed to say , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine into a permanent bearing state the soonest , is by single rod , on the spur principle . As the foliage becomes fully expanded , raise the temperature in the night gradually to as I consider or a sufficiently high night temperature for the young vine , in its first season of growth . The temperature in the day may be allowed to rise or higher , by solar heat , keeping up a very humid atmosphere . If the heat of the leaves and litter has begun to decline , work them up again with some good hot stable litter , covering the border two feet wider . If the heat at the root can be maintained at or your prospects will be the more cheering , as , by keeping a low temperature in the house through the night , the roots of your vines , at that season , will be in active work , preparing and gathering food for the following day . " As the season advances , your vines will be fast approaching maturity ; keep your house less humid than before . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manure at the root , taking away the whole as your vine ripens towards the extremity , as it will have performed its good offices to your satisfaction ; but you had better leave two or three inches of the shortest dung , or else lay on a few decomposed leaves , as you will perceive the heat of the dungwill have kept and encouraged the roots , on and near the surface of the border . By the time the wood has attained a good brown russet color at the extremity , you may prepare them for next year , as they will bear pruning , though the leaves may not drop for weeks , any time Avithout danger . " My practice is , to disbud the cane as soon as the wood is ripe . You may proceed thus : beginning at the bottom of the vine , leaving a bud you think is well placed and on the /z/ side of the shoot , then cut clean out the two following , leaving the fourth , taking out the next two , and so on till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that length the cane must be cut hack ; proceed again at the bottom , disbudding the other side in the same manner , so that , in that length , you will be able to leave eight or ten permanent eyes , to form fruit-bearing spurs for the following year , or five on each side . Having cleared your border of the superfluous manure , which will be the case by the beginning of July , during that month and August I keep my border nearly exposed to the full rays of the sun and air , by which means the majority of the roots having been kept on the surface , by the heat added as before mentioned , are more perfectly ripened , so that in September I am enabled to give them a light top dressing ( though only the first season , ) of ground bones , loamy soil , rotten manure , and decayed carrion ,  --  these manures are all , I have proved , great fertilizers of the vine ,  --  covering the whole with an inch or two of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines planted on the inside of the house will require attention at the root ; they want great support as their foliage becomes fully developed . I make use of liquid manure diluted , and clear rainwater , alternately , but always in a tepid state . I never allow a vine border inside the house to be watered with cold water after vegetation commences , until the fruit or wood is ripe . " Chapter 4th . " Presuming that all has gone on favorably the last season , you may expect a nice sprinkling of grapes from your young vines only planted one year ; but I caution the tyro not to be anxious in wishing to produce very early grapes ; if too sanguine , he Yill do this at the expense , and to the great detriment , of the future welfare of his young vines . The first , or middle of March , I consider sufficiently soon to begin forcing , the second year . A few days previous to commencing , lay on the border , to the width of twelve or fourteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth as mentioned for last season . The time your vines will /z/ take to break will be a fortnight or three weeks . ( Previous to forcing , the vines must be washed with a composition of soap , sulphur , etc . ) I generally keep my vines tied horizontally along the front until every bud is in motion . Keep a low temperature in the night , say till you perceive them all moving ; or higher in the day will do no harm , by sun heat , syringing them morning , noon , and night , and keeping a very humid atmosphere . When the buds are fully broken , tie them up to the roof ; you may raise the temperature gradually in the night , up to their time of showing fruit , or ; the same by day , observing to keep up a very humid atmosphere . Syringe lightly , and close your houses early in the afternoon . Your vines Avill now be showing three or four bunches at every eye left at winter-pruning ; by no means leave more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading shoot . My practice is to stop the shoot on the spurs at one eye beyond the bunch , taking off all laterals and tendrils as they appear . The leading shoot must be kept neatly tied up , divesting it of laterals , &c.,; as for last season , until it reaches the top of the house ; you may then stop it , leaving a lateral or two to keep it in check , as well as on each spur , if danger is to be apprehended from the breaking of the natural buds . As they approach the time of blooming , raise the night temperature gradually to or increasing the day temperature in the same ratio , keeping the house , when the vines are in bloom , rather dry . " After the grapes have set , and are thinned , the temperature of the house is to be , at night , " say ; and or in the day , with a very humid atmosphere . " If cloudy , cool weather should intervene , keep up a brisk heat , by stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to midday , keeping up to or with a very humid atmosphere , allowing your fires , or boilers , to cool down in the after part of the day ; it is my practice to give heat with light , and to reduce it with approaching darkness . A vine , after vegetation is commenced until the fruit is ripe , should /z/ never receive any check . We will presume , by this time , the grapes are stoned , and changing color . Again examine your outside border ; if the heat has much declined , take part away , adding more fresh in its place , working all well up together to cause a brisk heat , which should be kept up till your grapes are nearly colored ; by keeping the roots in a somewhat corresponding temperature with that to which the top is exposed , shanking and shrivelling have been discarded , and the effect produced noble specimens of grapes without a shanked berry upon them , no matter whether a wet or dry season . After the fruit has done swelhng , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discontinue the humidity of the house , keeping up a brisk heat with plenty of air , so as to color the fruit more perfectly , after which time you may lower the house by degrees , keeping it cool and dry . " If , by this time , your wood appears ripe , though the leaves may not have changed color , you may disbud your leading shoot , as mentioned for last pruning season , shortening it so as the joint of two years growth may reach fifteen or sixteen feet ; likewise , as the fruit is cleared , you may prune your spurs , cutting them into two eyes . Give your border a top dressing , and in all other respects follow what was recommended for the previous autumn . " Chapter 5th . " As the season approaches to start your yomig vines , with their wood the growth of two years , many would object to letting them carry a heavy crop of fruit , but content themselves with a light sprinkling , knowing it to be so averse to the old-received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken deep root for years in only a moderate soil , is bad to eradicate . However , it has been my intention in these pages to point out the errors , and improve upon the practice , of by-gone times , and I have been able to show by experience that every success will attend grape-growers , if the foregoing instructions be implicitly followed , and that they will have the pleasure of seeing , from vines the gi-owth of two years , a noble crop of fruit , free from /z/ shanking or slirivelling , ( as has been frequently witnessed at this place , by many gentlemen , gardeners and amateurs , ) is not commonly seen till the fourth or fifth year after planting . Presuming your vines were turned out last autumn , * your border renovated , &c.,; the middle of February will be soon enough to start your young canes this season , as it AYOuld be very injurious to them to carry a heavy crop of fruit , and be started very early . Use caution , begin steadily , and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in succeeding years , begin a few weeks earlier each year , by practising which , you will bring them steadily into a proper state , by degrees , for early forcing . " Proceed as before advised , and lay on , to the depth of two feet or two feet six inches , and four feet wider than you think the extremity of the root reaches , of hot stable manure and collected leaves ; the leaves will assist the manure in giving out a more steady heat , and not so likely to vary with the weather , and , if thatched with straw or covered - with any other light material , would retain its heat much longer . Let the temperature at night be kept low , say 45 ' or ; it may range in the day or higher by sun heat , with air , syringing the canes with tepid water three or four times in the day , maintaining a very humid atmosphere , by throwing water on the pipes or flues , and sprinkling the pathways . I caution to work steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young wood , ( there will be no doubt of the spurs , ) for , bear in mind , you , at winter pruning , left no more eyes than you absolutely wanted ; therefore , proceed cautiously ,  --  you can not afford to leave one unbroken ; if that were the case , they might break the next season , but they would leave an unsightly and perceptible gap the whole of this year . If all has gone on well , in the course of three weeks or a month , your buds will be in motion , and , as soon as you fairly perceive that , sling them up to the wires , two feet from the glass , raising the extremity of the lead within /z/ one foot ; it Avill cause the lower buds to break more boldly : lower the lead as you see occasion . I generally let the vines remain in that position until all the side shoots are stopped , out of bloom , and want thinning , especially the first house , as , by that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost . Up to the time the grapes are commencmg to bloom , keep up a very humid temperature by day , gradually raising the night temperature to or at the time of blooming , raising the day temperature in proportion . I always keep the house humid and close from the time the buds have sprung two or three inches until they are changing color ; ( when in bloom they will require to be kept dryer . ) I never give air , after the shoots are stopped , up to the fruit changing color , till the thermometer attains and this being a humid and cold climate , in dull weather I have the boilers worked in the fore part of the day , letting them cool down in the afternoon , so that I use little or no fire in the night ; but , as I said before , give heat with light , and allow the house to get cool with darkness , the very reverse of the old practice in forcing the vine . " As your fruit proceeds in swelling , keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the berries are stoned ; you may then rise a few degrees , but at no period do I exceed in the night . They will now swell apace ; take ofi " all laterals , keeping the house very humid ; you may allow the temperature to rise , by sun heat , to or or even higher , so that you keep a very moist atmosphere . Examine your border when the fruit is stoned ; if the heat has greatly declined , add more fermenting material , for upon this , in an equal degree as on the temperature of the house , depends the success of noble swelled fruit . Your vines , if any are planted on the back wall , or otherwise inside the house , must have every attention paid them as to moisture at the root , summer pruning , and , in other respects , be treated as the roof vines . When the foliage is fully expanded and the fruit is swelling , they will require water at the root twice /z/ or three times a - vveek , given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a - warm state along with the drainage of the dunghill . If all has gone on well , the berries - will soon begin to change color ; be cautious they do not receive a check , to avoid which , keep up the heat and moisture in the day . As the grapes approach ripeness , suspend , by degrees , the humidity of the house , keeping up a brisk heat and giving llenty of air . Examine the heat at the roots at the time the grapes are changing color ; if it has begun to decline , renovate it , keeping up a heat at the roots as high or higher than the temperature inside the house . You will see the benefit from this , in the grapes swelling to an uncommon size , with no fear of that pest , shanking and shrivelling . After your grapes are ripe , lower the heat of your house by degrees , keeping it cool and dry , removing the dung from the roots , as recommended in previous parts of this work . " On the coloring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly ripe , many are not well colored , black grapes more than white ; the loss of color , in my opinion , is by an over-abundant crop . By the old method of forcing the vine , it is the general practice in June to put out the fires , and to use little or none until September or October ; the change may happen at the time the fruit is changing color ; the house is then lowered in temperature , and kept cool and dry ; by such practice , black grapes will attain a good color , ( if a light or moderate crop , ) subject to shankmg , and at the expense of size ; and Black Hamburghs no more answer to their name , as regards the shape of the berry , than a Black Prince resembles a Black Damascus ; you will always find that they are small finger , or oval shaped , whereas , groAvn by the practice I recommend , they are large , and nearly globu. lar . It is quite practicable to grow fine , noble swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which , you must not aUow the vines to carry too heavy a crop , keeping the temperature as recommended in all their stages of growth through this work . In giving an opinion on the defect in the /z/ coloring of grapes , it is not given as the sole cause , for , at the time I am now writing , I have Hamburgh , Muscat , and other vines , carrying forty , fifty , and even sixty pounds weight of noble and good colored fruit , and have never had a shanked berry on them , though the vines were only planted three years in April last . " Pruning . It is my intention , in laying my practice before the public , to show that single rod and spur-pruning , in preference to long rod , will bring a vine the soonest to bear a permanent crop of fruit . We will presume your vines ready for the pruning knife ; the foliage having shown indications of dropping , you may cut back your lead to within one foot of the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; having disbudded it some time ago , you will only have left two eyes for spurs , and the leading one proceed to prune downwards on the vine , pruning your spurs to two , three , or four eyes , choosing a bold , prominent eye , or bud , ( many may say they look unsightly , but you will be repaid with noble bunches on that head , ) leaving the uppermost eye for fruit , cutting clean out the others with the exception of the one at the base , which is to be retained , but on no account to bear fruit , as it is intended to prune back to it the following year , so as to bring the spur nearer home . I must not omit to mention , that I have generally my bud singled out on each spur at the time I recommend for disbudding the lead , that is , taking off every bud above and below , ( not injuring the leaf , ) with the exception of the one intended to bear fruit , and the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the wounds are healed after pruning , cover every cut you have made with a little mild paint . " You will have removed the dung from the roots at the time mentioned for last season . You will bear in mind the renovation of the border , and the protection , if required , from frost . " Chapter 6th . " Presuming the season is again approaching for the development of your young vines , provided you /z/ started them the latter end of February , last year , and you wish to have early fruit , you may begin three Aveeks or a month earher , but by no means sooner , as it will be found the most conducive to their health and fruitfulness not to break in upon their habits too rashly . I can not give , at present , ( though I have some experiments in course of trial , ) better instructions for the management of this and succeeding years , than by following out the comprehensive culture the whole of the season as plainly laid down in the foregoing pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as therein stated , by close attention to which , success will certainly follow . " Conclusion . In this attempt to lay down my practice in as clear and plain a light as I am able , I hope I shall be excused the repetitions , almost unavoidable , on such a subject . It will be found plam language and plain practice , ( pirated from no one , ) from which I have had great success . I am aware that , in presenting these hints to the pubhc , I expose myself either to the smile or the frown of the critic ; Avhether he be lenient or severe , I must bear with patience the part allotted me , and only hope this work may be useful to some of my readers . " This is the plan as practised by Mr. Koberts ; the rest of the book consists of the author 's views upon the different systems of pruning , thinning , and of propagating the vine , with remarks upon the border as formerly made . A description of several kinds of grapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his own system praised and recommended as superior to any other . MemarJcs relating to Mr. Roherts 's System .  --  From what experience I have had in fruiting the vine , it is my opinion that the plant is weakened and permanently mjured by allowing it to bear fruit thus early . To show how this can be done , however , is one of Mr. Roberts 's objects in writing his book ; there is no difficulty , where the border has been properly prepared , in fruiting vines the second season after planting ; but /z/ is it advisable so to do ? My own plan is not to fruit them till the third , and this , and the following years , suffering but a moderate number of bunches to remain on the vine ; by this plan , and by judicious thinning of the berries , the plant will be gaining strength yearly , and , if capable of producing more fruit than the limited crop you have left to mature , the bunches and berries will swell accordingly , and the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vine , and the fruit of the colored kinds will be as black as possible , and the flavor rich , vinous , and delicious , in striking contrast to that from a plant which has been taxed to its utmost in its efforts to ripen an over-abundant crop . A plant of the Esperione variety of the grape , obtained from Messrs . Hovey &; Co. in the summer of 1843 , grown from a single eye that same spring , and planted out when grown three or four inches only , made a remarkable growth ; had it been allowed , and had there have been in the grapery room to have permitted it to have grown , I do not doubt the entire length of the cane would have been fifty feet ; it was stopped at about thirteen feet early in August , and several times cut back after this , during this month and September , which caused the eyes on the upper part of the cane to break ; these produced very large bunches of fruit-buds , which were cut away in pruning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Avere also cut away , and , when the foliage was destroyed , the last of October , by frost , a third crop was on the vines , which had been allowed to remain , and the berries of which were of sufficient size to thin . In this case , we have an instance of a vine which , in seven months from an eye , would have ripened fruit , had it have been allowed . There was no artificial heating of the border , and no uncommon care bestowed upon the preparation of it . The soil used was , one half , loam from the garden , from the spot where the border was made , which had been well manured for several years , the other half was coarse manure from a barn-yard , where horses and oxen were kept ; all the /z/ litter , and pieces of cornstalks , ( Indian corn , ) were mixed with it , and it was considered very coarse for the purpose ; the depth of the soil was about eighteen inches , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet one . I have frequently suffered vines of the Black Hamburgh , White and Grizzly Frontignan , Zinfindal , and other sorts , to bear fruit the second year from the eye , and have exhibited bunches of the last named variety at the rooms of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society , thus grown , which have weighed between two and three pounds . Vines from Europe , after growing one season only , have also been fruited , when it has been particularly desired to prove the correctness of the plant . But , in almost every instance , the vines have been injured by it ; the imported ones the most so . The border , he recommends , should be prepared in a diiferent manner from that advised by myself . But it must be remembered , that , although we have more rain in this country than they have in England , yet the wet , cloudy , and foggy weather there is very much greater than in the United States of America ; ( the foggy weather in the province of New Brunswick undoubtedly approaches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable utihty , the plan of main and cross drains . In America , the proportion of bright sunshiny days is much greater , also , than in England , producing severe droughts ; * and , as the vine can not succeed in producing su- * In Loudon 's Magazine , page 303 , for the year 1833 , is a horticultural diary . By this , it appears that , at the place of record in England , the weather of that year was 132 fine clear days , 83 cloudy , and 130 when it rained or snowed some part of the day . At Salem , the average of fliree years is , 219 fine clear days , 66 cloudy , 80 rainy or snowy , showing the difference , in the United States , of 66 days more of sunshine , 30 days less rainy or snowy , and 17 days less of cloudy weather . Notwithstanding this difference in the weather , the average quantity of rain which annually falls is greater in the United States than in England ; there , the mean average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , 39 inches . The time of the year in which the grape is usually ripening , under glass structures , embraces seven months , say from March to November ; during this period , in 184 ; 5 , there fell , at Salem , 24 61-100 inches ; in 1846 , 16 97-100 inches ; in 1847 , 27 49-100 inches . Li the month of September , 1847 , there fell 6 inches , the greatest quantity /z/ perior fruit without a proper supply of moisture , it is advisable to resort to some other method of avoiding too much wet . This can be done by using in the border a due proportion of broken bricks , oyster or any other shells , old mortar and small stones , fine charcoal , etc. ; all these articles have a tendency to keep the soil open , and to cause the water , when superabundant , to pass off ; they also are porous and retentive , and very serviceable in yielding to the vine , in a season of drought , the desired moisture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border ; not ( as advised by this gentleman , ) laid in a mass of one foot depth at the bottom . The material in the compost of the soil for the border is unexceptionable , and the manner of preparing it , with the exception of the carcasses of animals , which should be obtained at the time of preparing the border ; or , whole bones substituted for them . Slaughter-house manure may be used instead of both of these articles , when it can be had of a suitable quality , that is , when it consists mainly of the offal of the slaughter-house , sheep 's heads , hoofs , &c.,; with a good proportion of bones . The system of growing the plants from single eyes , and the manner of planting them in the border , is the common method as practised by gardeners generally , at the present time . Soon after planting the vines commences the operation of heating the border by manure piled over the roots . This is relied upon by Mr. Roberts as the great good . The necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in in any month ; and the effect upon the grapes was bad , a large part of them suffering from the rot . In England , there fell , during " 1845 , 23 33-100 inches ; in 1846 , 27 71-100 inches 5 in 1847 , 16 25-100 inches , the smallest quantity that has fallen in any year since the present century . "  --  Gardeners ' Chronicle , 1848 , p. 24 . A great difference is here shown in the year 1847 . In seven months of that year , in Salem , there fell 27 49-100 inches , when , in the whole year , but 16 25-100 fell in England . qwq /z/ the United States , nor in the southern states at any season . A great objection to it is the excessive stimulus to the plant from such a quantity of manure , which must be kept up every year , ( after the vine has become accustomed to it , ) or the plant will languish and cease to yield its fruit . In England , it unquestionably has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of heating the border , the roots are spreading with rapidity , and it seems inevitable that the time must come , when the roots have so extended themselves , that they will suffer for the want of further protection . Wliere grapes are grown under glass on an extensive scale , it would be dij0 &cult; to obtain fresh stable manure in sufficient quantities ( in most parts of our country it would be impossible , ) to make it practicable , and the expense of so doing would be more than the value of the crop would warrant . In the vicinity of large cities , and occasionally in other localities , this manure may be obtained cheaply , and in sufficient quantities for the purpose ; where this is the case , the objection to it , on the score of expense , is obviated . A grapery one hundred feet long would require a border one hundred and ten feet in length and twenty-four feet wide . As , by Mr. Roberts 's plan , the border is to be covered with this heating manure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend , and two and a half feet deep , in a few years , or as soon as the vines have become established , it follows , that the enormous quantity of GSxrr cords of manure would be required , to cover , in this manner , the border where the roots are now presumed to have extended themselves ; thus , one hundred and twenty feet long , twenty-eight feet wide , and two and a half feet deep . In our cold winter , I found it necessary to renew the heat by adding one fourth part of new manure , and working it in with the old , every three or four weeks . On a border to a house winter-forced , that is , where forcing commences in December , this quantity of manure would be doubled by the renewals . It is true that you would have about half the /z/ original bulk of the manure in the summer for other uses , but much of the strength of it will have escaped by evaporation , or have been - washed into the earth ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the cost of working and making this heat , and removing it after the fruit has ripened , will be very nearly equal to its value . The cost of this manure at Salem , Mass. , is $4.50 the cord ; the expense of carting , from 50 cents to $1.00 per cord , according to the distance it has to be carried ; making the whole cost of the quantity required as above , in round numbers , $700 . On the rafters of a house of this length of border , which is to be winter-forced , eight hundred pounds of grapes would be a VERY LARGE AVERAGE CROP . On the back wall of the house , but which would not be pounds . affected by this heat on the border , one third of this quantity would be as much as could be i ng rounds relied upon , and this is more than is usually produced in most graperies ; but my experience warrants me in placing it at about this amount . To judge of the practicability of the plan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the border , . . . $700 00 Interest* on the forcing-house , at a cost of $15 the running foot , 100 feet , cost $1500 , at six per cent. , 90 00 Annual breakage of glass and other wear , furnaces , &c.,; 4 , . . . . . . 60 00 Cost of fuel , 70 00 Labor on fires , watering , manuring , trimming , and thinning grapes , . . . . . 200 00 " VMiole cost of the crop of grapes , . . . $1120 00 /z/ The value of the crop of grapes , 1067 pounds , would not net the producer more than the cost , and the probability is , that there would be a loss to him . A very few pounds of grapes are sold in Boston , in April , at $2 the pound , and in May , at $1.50 to $2 ; but the main part of the crop would not sell at over $1 to $1.25 . The cost of sending the fruit to market , and the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In England , the prices are so much higher that this process can be resorted to with reason. * I have found the plan of covering the border with litter , ( as directed in my remarks on forcing , ) to answer every purpose , and at a much less expense . I have a small stove or winter-forcing house , where the border is covered with movable glass , which is taken off as soon as the grapes are ripe , or the weather becomes warm in * To show the relative prices of grapes and forced fruits in the two countries , I here add a memorandum , from Loudon 's Magazine , of prices at Covent Garden Market , vol. for 1834 , April , page 191 : hothouse grapes , per pound , from 10s. to 15s . Grapes are spoken of as being remarkably early , 28th of March .

Gd . to 3s. 6d. per ounce , and hothouse grapes at 10s. per pound . The same year , in April , page 272 , strawberries are quoted at from Is. to 2s. per ounce , and grapes at from 10s. to per pound . In May , page 328 , strawberries were at the same price , and grapes at from Gs . to 12s. per pound ; nectarines and peaches at from 2s. to 3s. per dozen ; cherries , per pound , from to 10s . In June , page 383 , grapes were quoted at from 4s. to 8s. per pound ; peaches and nectarines at from 15s. to 4s. per doz. ; and cherries at from 4s. to 8s. per pound . In August , page 498 , hothouse grapes are quoted as at 3s. to 5s. per pomid . The highest price for hothouse grapes is in March , and by this standard , and in our currency , this is 8.47 per pound , and the value is constantly lessening till September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.21 per pound . At Boston , in March , they sell at g2 the pound , and this price is gradually falling until August and September , when they can be bouglit at 33 cents to 62 cents per pomid . Forced peaches , nectarines , cherries , and strawberries , are at the same relative prices as grapes ; and , indeed , neither of these last-named fruits can be grown for market in this country , under glass , to yield the cost of production , at the prices customarily paid for them . The Gardeners ' Chronicle for this year , 1848 , quotes them at lower prices , %3 per pound being the highest mentioned . In Boston , in July , this year , they have been sold by the quantity as low as 50 cents , which is less than the cost . /z/ spring ; the border , under this , is covered with six or eight inches of coarse litter and leaves in autumn , and , on the outside , with the same materials , so as , in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , but in no way better than the plan alluded to above . On this border and under this glass covering I tried this system of hot manure in 1843 . The only advantage I derived from it was the ripening of the fruit a few days earlier than usual . But the steam from the manure , when freshly made up , forced itself through the front of the house , by the sides of the sashes , &c.,; and destroyed the foliage of the " dnes , where it came immediately in contact with them . It is true that this would not have happened had the border not have been covered . But the cost was more than the value of the crop , and the system has not been tried since for the purpose of forcing . In the summer of 1843 , I built a grapery . The border was made according to the plan given by me in the first part of this work . It was not begun tUl August , and the vines were planted the last of that month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different ages , some only two and three months from the eye , and others one and two years old ; they all came into fruit at the same time , and I never have been able to notice any difference in their growth , or in their produce , since the first year . As these vines were planted at so late a period , I was fearful that they might not become sufficiently estabhshed in their new situation to survive the winter . To induce a rapid and promote a late growth , this method of heat upon the border was resorted to , and with the desired effect generally . Owing to the situation of the grapery , which is on a gentle slope , a few of the vines at the bottom of this were killed by the too powerful juices of the manure , which , after a heavy rain , soaked down to them . A second and third set were planted and killed also , and it was only by removing the manure that I was able to make vines grow there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and unnecessary in , this country . In some situations , where the ground is very cold and wet , and it is particularly desired to grow grapes without regard to the expense , then it may be found advantageous . The disbudding of the cane is not advisable ; in England , it may be serviceable on account of admitting light into the grapery ; by Mr. Roberts 's plan , a vine is never to have but twenty-one or twenty-three spurs . I prefer to have forty spurs , and , if the fruit is cut away from half of them , so much the better , for they can then be fruited alternately . It will be noticed , that it is recommended never to give air in the middle stages of forcing until the thermometer attains eighty degrees ; this is not my practice . In our climate , I would much prefer to give air gradually by opening the lights , or ventilators , a little , as soon as the mercury begins to rise from the influence of the sun 's rays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest heat from 10 o'clock , A. M. , to 2 o'clock , P. M. ; the same rule to regulate the closing of the windows in the after part of the day . The general remarks , as regards the heat from artificial means and the temperature of the house by night and day , are perfectly correct , and the advice given as to forcing , and the care requisite to prevent a check , are well worthy careful attention . It will be necessary to make due allowance for difference of climate , if it is intended to follow out his plan entirely . For instance , he states that it has formerly been the practice to put out the fires in June in the grapery , even if the grapes were not ripe , and attributes to this cause some of the evils to which this fruit is subject under glass , and disapproves of this management , and goes on to say that the fires must be kept up until the fruit is ripe . It would be absurd , in this climate , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frequently in June , we have very warm weather , the mercury rising to and sometimes to in the open air ; at these times , the heat of the grapery can not /z/ be kept under - w- hile the sun is sliining upon the house , and any heat m the flue , or boiler and pipes , would increase the difficulty . The fact is , such adice will not do ; you must regulate the heat by the thermometer , and , in warm weather , at this season of the year , make , or omit to make , the fires , as the temperature of the external air may be . Mr. Roberts says , " that shanking and shrivelling have been discarded by his plan of keeping the roots of the me in a somewhat corresponding temperature with that to which the top is exposed . " It has occurred to me , that the great excitement given to the roots of the vine , by the manure heaped upon them , and consequent vigor of the vme , may have been the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea may be the correct one , and yet shanking and shrivelling be avoided without using this method . If it is true , as Mr. R. states , that this difficulty is caused by too low a temperature at the roots of the vine , as compared with that in which the tops are situated , may not this be avoided by having a lower temperature in the grapery , particularly in the night ? I have , for many years , thought that this evil was often caused by too great heat , followed by too low a temperature . I can , at any time , cause these troubles in the forcing-house to appear , but am not always able to avoid them . A grapery without artificial heat is more subject to shanking than the forcing-house , notwithstanding the temperature of the earth , at the season of the year when such a house is hable to the attacks of this disease , is much higher , and the roots of the vine are enjoying a temperature relatively to the tops almost correspondent with vines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house where there was no means of warming it by fires , the crop of fruit has suffered most when , after a continuance of hot , bright , and dry weather , in August , or early in September , we have had a succession of cold , dark , and rainy days . In this case , the cause is , appa- /z/ rentlj , too low a temperature at the top of the plant , causing stagnation of the sap . A brisk heat from a flue , or any other artificial means that will give a free circulation to the air throughout the house , and raise it to a temperature near which it has been during the hot weather , will prevent its spread . The cold rain will have reduced the temperature at the roots of the vine , but in a much less degree than that to which the tops have been exposed , so that now the tops are relatively to the roots in a proportionately warmer atmosphere than during the hot weather . It does not appear to me , that want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the difiiculty . These varieties of the foreign grapes which , in the grapery , are now so much affected by this change in the weather , when in the open air , and growing in the same soil , do not suffer in the least from this shanking . It therefore appears evident , that the cause of the difficulty must be looked for in the temperature and ventilation of the grapery . And these causes are , in my opinion , too great and sudden changes in the temperature , and , perhaps , too great heat at night relatively to V the day . '  --  - ' ' A low temperature at night is not injurious to the vine , * on the contrary , it is probably beneficial . But the vine under glass , when the sun is shining , is subject to great heat , which rapidly accumulates , and , on the obscuration of the sun 's rays , as rapidly decreases . Here is the cause of the trouble : vines in the open air do not suffer from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited thereby , and , when cool , cloudy weather follows a warm , bright season , * In 1836 , when visiting the vineyards near the Rhine , and on the border of the Lakes of Neufchatel and Geneva , I found the weather very cool , as compared with the temperature of that season of the year in Massachusetts , the thermometer , during August and September , var3'ing from the lowest point at night , to and , by day . the highest point being in the shade . Notwithstanding the low point at which the mercury fell during the night , the grapes ripened finely . The vines here , though subject to an intense heat when the sun shone upon the vineyards upon the side of the hills , were , nevertheless , in an atmosphere which did not vary more than or in the daytime , excepting when the sun was shining upon them , and , being in the open air , there was no confined heat there . /z/ The Catawba grape , a native variety , is so subject to shanking under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , it would not be practicable . If the grapery , though not intended to be forced , is provided with a furnace and flue , or the Polmaise system of heating is introduced into the house , to be used when occasion may reqmre it , ( and there is nothing to be apprehended from this evil excepting when the grapes are changing color and taking their last swell , ) there will be no danger of any serious loss of fruit , provided every other care is given to the house and crop as directed . But where the house is not provided with the means of artificial heat , promoting a free circulation of air in bright days , by throwing open freely the doors and windows , and keeping as low a temperature as possible in warm weather , is the safest mode of procedure . The desire to ripen the fruit early , causes the house to be kept warmer than prudence dictates . In our climate , we are not always subject to this pest ; when the month of September is dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been assigned as the cause of shanking and shrivelling of grapes , by different gardeners , and as frequently a certain remedy has been recommended ; stiU , the evil exists . The term shanking is used when the stem of the bunch is affected , and shrivelling when only the footstalk of the berries is attacked . As this is the worst enemy the cultivator of this fruit has to contend with , I shall , in their own words , give the opinions of some practical people , extracted principally from Loudon 's Magazine :  --  Vol. 10 , page 19 , a writer thinks it caused by too great heat at night . Page 267 , an experienced grape-grower thinks it caused by damp , and recommends a good fire in the daytime , and to /z/ give abundance of air , to expel it , by which means the moisture evaporated is carried off . Page 137 . Mr. J. D. Parkes , F. H. S. , Nurseryman , Dartford . " A variety of causes have been assigned for that disease in forced grapes which produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more especially in the Frontignans and Muscats . Some consider that it proceeds from the roots being too deep in the ground ; others think that it is occasioned by the temperature of the earth in which the root grows ( when vines are planted outside the house ) being so much lower than that of the atmosphere within ; and some attribute the disease to a want of air . " Having observed that early-forced grapes are , in general , free from this disease , and that it never occurs to grapes grown in the open air , and having found , in a house under my care , that some bunches immediately over a steam-pipe were free from it , I have come to the conclusion that the cause is stagnation of cold moist air ; and the remedy , the application of artificial heat , to such an extent ( even in summer , when the weather is cloudy , ) as to admit , every warm day , of opening the windows sufficiently to occasion a free circulation of air . A gardener , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has practised my plan , every year since , with the most complete success . " Vol. 11 , p. 493 , the same author remarks : " In the paper sent you and printed in vol. 10 , page 137 , you omitted to insert what I think the most important matter . In the paper alluded to , I considered it was from the footstalk of the berry not being grown sufficiently firm and hard , which I believe is the only cause . If the grape is grown in a humid atmosphere , it elongates the footstalk , and causes it to be of a slender , thin , dehcate texture , and , in case of a sudden change , even for a short time , the footstalk is easily affected . When this injury takes place , as I beheve , from the delicacy of the footstalk , the sap ceases to circulate in the manner required . I think this disease may be remedied by keeping the early- /z/ forced grapes wtli less humidity in the house than some use when the crop is young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes , if there were more air admitted , or artificial heat kept up in cold damp weather , either would remedy the disease ; but , as I stated in my former paper , give air and artificial heat at the same time . As I am making this second attempt to impress on the mind of the reader that the cause is really in the footstalk , I can and will advance a few thuags to make it more evident . " I was asked this season , by a gardener , what I would say to a vinery being left a little open all night at top ; my reply was , I had not tried it , but I would not hesitate in saying it was more likely to do good than harm . He said that there were the finest grapes in a house so treated that he had seen all the season . I was asking a gardener , about Christmas , how his grapes had done this year ; his reply was , Very well ; I adopted your plan , ( except one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of air . The grapes under the light , which I could not move , were not so good as the others . In a house I had this disease take the crop , with the exception of a vine at the end , where the steam-pipe entered , producing a great and drying heat ; and there was a door , with a ventilator over it , which all aided to keep off the disease . This vine alone was always free from it : this speaks for itself . Perhaps many may think I am too sangmne on this subject ; but should I be right in my opinion , and in the means of producing a remedy , I shall be vain enough to think I have done some real good . Should any person really find the correctness of it , I hope they will do me the favor to acknowledge it in your magazine , which will be attended with some good ; and should it be fairly proved my idea is wrong , I invite the same insertion from those who may have proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one trial , and fair ones , for I have no desii-e to mislead . " Vol. 11 , page 603 . " Having been troubled with the shrinldng or shrivelling of grapes , more or less , for several /z/ years , I am determined to add my testimony to tliat of Mr. Parks , that some good may be effected by leaving air in the house all night , &c.; &c."; This writer agrees with Mr. Parks in the plan of giving air as the remedy , but does not admit that the length of the footstalk can be the cause . Vol. 12 , page 244 . Mr. Jasper Wallace thinks that " the principal cause of the shrinking of grapes is owing to the ROOTS BEING OVERHEATED and not having sufficient moisture , when planted in the inside border . " Vol. 13 , page 261 . Mr. J. Robertson , Nurseryman , says : " There has been much discussion in your magazine on the cause of , and remedy for , the frequent shrivelhng of grapes , about the period of ripening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own ill success , to offer an opinion , I must attribute it , in my case , ( for I think it may proceed from various causes , ) to their being enveloped , at that season , in the warm , humid atmosphere generally maintained in stoves . " In my former communication on the shrivelling of grapes , ( vol. 11 , page 603 , ) I fancied I had hit on a plan that , in some degree , prevented the footstalks of the berries from turning black , but now , after another year 's practice , chance , as it often does , has thrown in my way something which I never could have discovered without it . I am convinced , that too moist an atmosphere is not the cause of the shrivelling of grapes , but that it arises from the inability of the vine to provide a sufficient quantity of nourishment for the berries . The inability of the vine to provide for its fruit may arise from different causes , such as overcropping , the foliage being too crowded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( Mosely Hall . ) " Several articles have appeared , at different times , in the Gardeners ' Magazine , on the shrivelling of grapes . I have tried every one of them , as they made their appearance , but without the least success . In Dr. Lindley 's Theory of Horticulture , article Bottom Heat , it is there stated that the cause is , /z/ that , the roots being in a colder medium than the branches , the supply of sap is consumed quicker than the roots can furnish it , and this brings on the disease . Dr. Lindlej , every one must allow , is very high authority ; still I doubt this being the cause of the blacking of the footstalks , which is the disease that I particularly wish to refer to . I have the management of three houses in which grapes are grown . One , I begin forcing the first of January , one , the first of February , and one , the first of March . The first house ripens its fruit in May , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first and second , there shall be no shrivelled berries , in the third , if the weather is cloudy , there shall be a great many . The covering is taken off the borders about the beginning of April , and , if the coldness of the borders was the cause , I should suppose that those which ripened in May and June would be more subject to the disease than the July one , for the earth undoubtedly gets warmer as the summer advances . I have been a grape-grower for more than twenty years , and , durmg that time , the disease has particularly engaged my attention , as I have always been more or less subject to it , and I am fully convinced that it is caused by the borders being made too rich and stimulating , and by a deficiency of light . ISlj borders are all prepared in the same way , and of the richest materials , and the one that I commence forcing in March produces foliage of the most luxuriant description ; those large leaves require more light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if light is deficient , the sap is not properly prepared for the healthy nourishment of the fruit , and this brings on the disease . I have known vineries where borders have been made inside of the house , and vines planted against the back wall , and borders made outside , and vines trained up the rafters . The grapes upon the back wall have , every one of them , shrivelled until the vines upon the rafters had been shortened so as to admit the light upon the back wall , and then the grapes have done well , plainly proving that want of light was the cause , and not the want of heat in the border . /z/ In earl J forcing , I have covered one half of the border with hot dung and leaves , two feet thick , the other half , six inches , and I never could discover the least difference in the growth of the vines inside , or in the fruit . The larger the leaves are the more light they require to assimilate and decompose the sap ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why early forced vines do not shrivel , their leaves scarcely ever being more than half the size of those begun in March , and the light in May and June is commonly greater than that of July , which is , in general , a dull and showery month . After trying every thing that I had seen recommended as a remedy , and feeling fully convinced , in my own mind , that want of light was one of the causes , I thought I would try what effect proportioning the heat to the light would do . This I have practised for several years , and with a success beyond my expectation . " In dull weather , I keep the house cool , and , when the grapes begin to color , if the weather is warm , I leave the top and front Ughts a little open , so as to keep up a regular circulation of air in the house night and day ; and , if the weather is cold and wet , I shut the front lights , and a little fire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to circulate , but nothing like forcing is attempted . By this simple mode of management , I have so far conquered the disease , that , instead of losing half the bunches , I now only lose a few berries here and there in some of the bunches , and a few at the points of some of them , but not any of any consequence . I never expect to get entirely rid of it , as the great fault lies in the formation of the border . We consider the vine to be a gross feeder , and therefore think that it is impossible to make the border too rich , but this is certainly a great error . " Vol. 17 , page 45 . By Robert Wilson , Gardener . " There has been so much discussion on the shrivelHng of grapes , that I make bold to give my humble opinion also , more especially as I consider our friend W. H. ( vol. for 1840 , page 598 , ) not altogether correct in thinking that the shrivelling proceeds from the border being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injurious , as far as preventing free access to light and air . Nor do I acquiesce with our learned friend Dr. Lindlej , in supposing that it proceeds from the roots being too cold for the internal atmosphere . I had vines under my care at Edgerston , in Roxburghshire , in the spring of 1837 , when the thermometer stood at out of doors , and the internal atmosphere was The vines were planted on the outside of the house , with their stems wrapped up with moss , and the border mulched . They were planted in a compost of strong hazelly loam , formed from the sward of a pasture thoroughly decomposed , and one fourth vegetable mould of decayed tree leaves , one sixth of good rotten horse and butcher 's grub dung , and a little sheep dung , with a moderate quantity of powdered bones and lime rubbish . The borders were frequently watered with liquid manure water from the drainings of a dunghill , and we never had a shrivelled grape during the three years I was there ; and these grapes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch at the Jedburgh Horticultural Society , for many years past ; and there are vkieries in this neighborhood that have borders not above three feet deep , upon a gravelly bottom , which have not been renewed these fifty years , that have had abundance of shrivelled grapes in them every year lately . I think the foregoing remarks prove that it is neither the coldness nor the richness of the border that is the occasion of the shrivelling . Now , in my opinion , damp , stagnant air is very much , if not altogether , the cause of the shrivelling of grapes after they commence their second swelling . If there should not be a free circulation of air in the house , they will shrivel , and , if the weather be wet or cloudy , they will not do with high forcmg . I am certain , from experience , that W. H. is perfectly correct as to the air , and keeping a dry atmosphere . " Vol. 17 , page 47 . Another writer says , " Never thin out the berries until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and press each other close when ripe ; " this , he says , will prevent all shanking. /z/ Vol. 17 , pages 47 and 48 , J. W. B. says , want of food is the sole cause , and " this deficiency of nutriment might arise from various causes , but , undoubtedly , the principal one is a bad border ; under which head , I include not only poor hungry soils , that are incapable of supporting a plant in vigor , but those deep and narrow pits of rich earth in which vines are generally planted , and even borders of proper dimensions , if the subsoil is wet and the drainage imperfect . Depend upon it , the most essential condition in vine culture is a border so constructed as to insure a ready passage of superabundant moisture in the wettest seasons . The young fibrous roots of vines are exceedingly tender , and soon rot when soddened in cold wet soil ; consequently , the plant , being thus deprived of its mouths , may starve in the midst of plenty . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will the fruit suffer . On the same principle , ( deficient nutrition , ) over-cropping will produce the same result , even when the roots are in a healthy state . " Any quantity of extracts might be added to these , but the above are sufficient to show the extent of the disease , and the principal reasons assigned for its cause by practical men . The Frontignans and Muscats are more subject to the evil than any other varieties , and the cause in these cases undoubtedly often may be , injury to the roots from too much moisture ; for these vines will not succeed in any situation but where the roots can be kept dry , at the approach of the period for the maturation of the fruit . Nor will they succeed thus situated , unless they have a free circulation of hot air around their tops ; and , when the fruit is ripe , this circulation of air must be continued , and attention given to keeping it as dry as possible , otherwise the fruit will soon decay . In conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , that shanking or shrivelUng is a disease peculiar to the grape in its culture under glass structures , caused by a deficiency of nourishment , which deficiency is occasioned principally by a defective atmosphere in the house , causing /z/ stagnation in the flow of the sap ; and this difficulty may be increased , and the spread of the ei promoted , by various causes ,  --  such as a poor border , general weakness of the vines , overcropping , and chiefly by not paying due care to the ventilation of the house . Wliere the person in charge of the grapery has command of artificial heat , by following , to the letter , all the directions as given by me for the culture of this fruit , and constantly causing the temperature of the grapery to be as directed , he will have little to apprehend from this trouble . If it is intended to plant vines , to be trained on the back wall , the soil , on the inside of the house , must be prepared , as directed for the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same border is recommended . Peaches do not require a rich border , and , for them , the natural soil will be suitable . To improve a poorly made , or exhausted border , in a house already built , where the vines do not succeed well , the following process is recommended as best adapted to cure the original defect :  --  In the spring , have the border covered with two or three inches of lime rubbish , or oyster shells ; let this be forked into , and well mixed with , the soil ; after this , have the whole border covered , two feet deep , with fresh stable manure ,  - -  the newer the better ; the object being to cause a strong heat above the roots of the vine , thus dra-wdng them to the surface . This should remain on the border two months , when it may be removed . It is probable , the young roots will have penetrated the border , and be growing in the under part of the manure ; if so , these must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit expected from the operation would be lost ; when it is found that this is the case , that part of the manure must remain on . After removing the manure , the border should have a top dressing of three or four inches of well decomposed cow or hog-pen manure . /z/ In planting , which is the next operation , open a hole sufficiently wide to admit of the roots being spread out to their entire length ; care must he taken to spread out all the roots separately , without injury to the small ones , and do not let them overlay or interfere with each other ; make the soil fine , and cover them with an inch or two of it ; with a rose watering-pot , settle the soil and roots , by giving them a thorough watering ; finish covering , and do not water them again. * They should be planted about three inches under the surface , and three feet apart ; if the border is only twelve feet wide , five feet is near enough . If the house has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the vine , after planting , be three inches from the front , on the inside ,  --  the roots being on the outside . If the vines are planted in the fall , they should be cut back to three eyes immediately ; but , if planted in the spring , they must be allowed to grow until the shoots are one inch long , when rub off all but the three lower shoots . f * I recommend the planting of vines for tiie crop of fruit on the back wall as being the most likely to give satisfaction ; for , although they do not give as large crops as the rafter vines , yet they yield better fruit than the peach ; the fig does well thus situated . When the house is strongly and early forced , peaches and cherries do not succeed ; the fruit of the latter , if it was sure , would be desirable , but it requires more air in setting than is good for the grapes . " Vines do better with their roots inside the house than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil in which they grow . "  --  Gardeners ' Chronicle , p. 080 , Oct. 1846 . I am willing to admit , that vines do as well , thus planted , when , as it is said , they are " well managed , " but they require more care in watering , etc . I am not willing to allow that they do better , and never would advise the rafter vines to be thus placed , miless they cmi roam at pleasure in the open border ; when the vines are planted on the inside , the roots will grow with rapidity , and push as straight as possible for the border outside of the house , thus proving that they prefer to be under the influence of the full effects of the sun , air , and rain upon the soil . Do not shake the vine after planting , as sometimes advised 5 it CcUi do no good , and will probably break some of the rootlets. /z/ The vines for planting should be in pots , and one or . two years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days , as the roots are more easily separated . If the plants are growing , leave off watering them until they begin to droop , when you can plant them out ; the risk of injuring them will be lessened , and the free watering , after the roots are spread out , will immediately settle them in their position , and they will grow rapidly . If grown on the place , or to be obtained near , young plants , in pots , just rooted , can be used . Turn them out with the ball of earth entire , and plant , without disturbing the roots , on the inside , near the front of the house. * I have planted such vines , and they have come into bearing as soon as older ones ; they are to be preferred to old vines , as the latter are very much injured in transplanting , if they have been growuig in the open border ; if in pots , the roots are so matted together , that , in separating them , many will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a paper read to the Horticultural Society , in September , 1821 , says , " I selected three cuttings of the Black Hamburgh grape , each having at its base one joint of two years ' wood ; these were inserted in , or rather fitted to , branches of nearly the same size , but of greater age , and all succeeded most perfectly . The clay which surrounded the base of the grafts was kept constantly moist ; and the moisture thus suppHed to the grafts operated very beneficially , at least , if it was not essential to the success of the operation . " Mr. J. D. Parks says , " the best time for grafting is when the stock is far advanced in growth as the setting of the fi-uit. /z/ The stock should then be cut down , the scion having been kept in a dormant state . "  --  Loudo7i 's Magazine , ) age 494 , vol. 12th . In grafting vines , I have cut them off at the surface of the ground , and with a knife have split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in a wedge shape ; they have always grown . ( See grafting , as practised by Mr. Cleveland and Dr. Sidney Weller. ) /z/ First Year . The first year , they should not be forced , but allowed to push naturally as the season advances .

If the weather is dry , and the vines are not growing well , give them * Perhaps it is best to allow all the lateral shoots to grow , the first three months of the first season after planting , to guard against accident to the leading shoots , as any check to the growth of the top is felt , in a corresponding degree , by the roots . For instance , if only one shoot is beuig trained up , and this should be broken out , and the vine should make a second , it would be but a weak one , and a loss of one year in the fruiting would be the result . /z/ A , is the vine after it has been cut back at planting .

If your border is poor , liquid manure should be given occasionally . After the leaves have fallen , which will be in October , or early in November , cut back the two spurs to one eye , or bud , each , and the long cane to two eyes . If any insect has been troublesome , to destroy them , or their eggs , wash the vines carefully with soap suds , moderately strong . The first of December , protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Russia mats ; the border must also be covered with seaweed , or coarse litter , to protect the roots from frost . This completes the management for the first year . Second Year . The second year , as the spring advances , and the power of the sun increases , open the wmdows and doors of the house to let the heat escape , and to prevent the vines bursting their buds , shutting up again before night ; do not hasten the push , ing of the vines , but rather keep the house cool until the tenth of April , when it will be best to uncover them ; promote a free circulation of air in bright weather ; give some ventilation on cloudy days ; shut up the house before the sun sets . About the middle or last of May , the four eyes will have grown , each , one or two feet ; train up the strongest of the two on last year 's wood , and shorten back the other three , by pinching off the ends of the shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine weather , and shut up the house at night . The best way of training the vines is by iron rods , parallel with the rafters , having three of them ; a centre one , to which should be tied the cane , and one on each side of this , about eight inches distant , to tie the bearing shoot to ; in a cold house , they should be ten inches from the glass , and , in a forcing one , fourteen inches. * /z/ As the leading cane grows , tie it carefully to the rod , or trelUs ; stop all the laterals as they appear at one eye or leaf ; continue to check them , as they push again , in the same way . The second shoot on last year 's wood may be cut entirely out in June , or , as soon as it is certain that no accident to the leading cane will require the use of this as a substitute ; the shoots on the spurs of the old wood must be stopped , as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stop the leading cane when it has grown about fifteen feet , and before it reaches the top of the house ; allow the upper lateral to grow ; this will prevent the eyes on the upper part of the cane from bursting . This lateral should be cut back to one eye , after it has grovii three or four feet ; if it still continue growing strong , check it again . Early in July , dust sulphur on the floor of the house , to prevent mildew ; to be effectual , one pound should be used for every twenty square feet of the house . If mildew should make its appearance , and continue to increase , syringe the vines at evening , and dust the foliage also with it. * method used in the houses which I have recently erected . On the front , or upright part , there should be two of these ; the first about eig-hteen inches from the ground , the second at the proper distance ( ten or 14 inches , ) from the roof 5 on the rafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the plate , and the last , or upper one , at about fifteen inches from the ridge-pole ; the intervening ones may be at distances of three or four feet , as deemed best . With this method of training , small wires , rumiing parallel with the rafters , should be attached to the ridge-pole , or upper rod , and , resting on the other rods , be brought down and secured to tiie sill , one on each side of the stem of the vine , at about si.x inches from it , to support the lateral , or fruit bunches . The rods should be of one quarter inch iron , secured at the ends to the wood work by screws . In the interior , they must be fastened to the rafters by iron pieces , which should be three eighths of an inch in thickness , and five or six inches long ; these are secured by two screws ( on a flattened end , ) into the rafters , with a socket on the other for the rod to rest in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insertion . Vines on the back wall may be trained on wire , or other trellis , as may be most convenient . ( See trellis for out-door training. ) * Nathaniel Silsbee , Jr. , Esq. , informs me , that , in his grapery , which is a cold house , he covers the floor twice , every summer , with the sulphur , and recommends its application in the middle of the day , as , at that time , part of it will rise and settle on the vine , but , in such small particles , as to do no injury . He has foiuid this efiectua ! in preventing mildew , if this fungus makes its appearance before the sulphur is /z/ Mildew is a fungus , which perfects its seed in a very short time , and spreads rapidly over the fruit and foliage , if not destroyed .

Another evil , a disease to which the grape is subject , appears on the vines and destroys more or less of the fohage at the same season of the year , and with the same weather ; it is called the blight . The two are often confounded , and considered as the same . I know of no remedy for it . The mildcAv is promoted in its growth by dampness , and by the east winds . It operates singularly . A vine in the open air in my garden , trained on the south of the house , is very little injured by it ; branches of this vine , extending round the corner of the house to the east side , are yearly so badly affected that the fruit is valueless . Downing , in the Horticulturist , says , " that giving the soil a plentiful supply of plaster of Paris , and this turned under immediately , is a complete protection against mildew in the open air . " Other persons have recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the soil , as a certain preventive . The rust on grapes , which seems to trouble English cultivators , does not prevail to any extent in the northern states of America . What little there is , usually is produced by the grapes coming in contact with the moisture of the hand , or the hair . When the grapery has back and end walls , washing them with Hme and sulphur is useful as a preventive against mildew . In September , begin at the lower part of the cane , and , with a sharp knife , cut clean out all the laterals for eight or nine feet , leaving those on the upper part of the cane to be applied , it will be more difficult to suppress its growth . It has been very troublesome , in late houses , this July , ( 1848 , ) and I had to dust the foliage and fruit before it was checked , and the quantity used was much greater than that named above . In early houses , I never have it . /z/ cut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , not to injure the bud or the leaf of the cane where you cut , for from this eye your fruit is to come next summer . As soon as the leaves are falling , cut back the cane to eight or nine feet , and the two spurs to one eye , each . AVith a painters ' brush , put on the vines a composition of soft soap and sulphur , in the proportion of four pounds sulphur to two pounds of soap ; be sure to cover all the wood , and particularly around the eyes . To prepare this wash , mix the two substances well together when cold , and pour hot water upon them ; it should be of the consistency of cream when put on the vine . The first of December , lay do-vn tiie vines , horizontally , near the ground on the front of the house , and cover them from the sun , Russia mats are the best for this purpose ; cover the border as last year . This will end the second season of their growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold one , or without fire heat ; if the vines have been planted in a greenliouse , and a fire kept up , then they will have started in February or March ; * if they are so situated , let the house be kept at as low a temperature , night and day , as the safety of the plants will admit ; the treatment should be the same for the season , except the covering of them with mats , which would be unnecessary . Third Year . The third season , air the house , as directed the last year ; uncover the vines from the first to the middle of April , as the * The only serious objection to growing grapes in a greenhouse is the trouble caused from insects which infest the plants in the pots , and spread , not unfrequently , over the vines . The red spider is the most injurious , and , in the autumn , the insects , ( if any. ) when the leaves drop , are , by these means , conveyed to the plants again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules for priming , thinning , &c.,; must be followed . As regards temperature , etc. , they must be subject to the treatment given to the plants , so long as the plants arc in the house . It will be the better plan to keep the vines from pushing , as long as possible , in spring , by having as low a temperature as the plants will thrive in. /z/ spring may be mild or cool ; keep them in their horizontal position , until the eyes have all pushed ; have a moist atmosphere , by sprinkhng the vines and the floor several times every day . About the twentieth of April , or the first of May , they will have pushed their buds so as to be all ready to be put to the rods , or trellis . During the season , give air freely when the sun shines ; shut up the windows towards night , as the sun recedes from the house . The mercury should not rise above seventy-five , until the blossom is over ; after that has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harm ; occasionally , wet the floor of the house in the afternoon ; the inside border must be watered as often as the roots of the vine require ; continue this treatment for the season . As the grapes begin to color , be cautious in watering , and , after they are fully colored , do not give water at all until the grapes are all cut , leaving open some of the hghts at night , unless there is danger of frost , or rain . About the last of May , the shoots will be from one to three feet long ; train up the leading one the same as last year , and cut back the others to one leaf beyond the bunch of fruit to be retained for ripening ; the bunch nearest the cane is the one usually left on for this purpose ; * cut off all the others ; never leave more than one bunch on a spur , and cut away all the fruit from every alternate spur ; when this is done , and there is still more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these will be quite enough for the vhae to mature the first year of bearing ; if the bunches are very large , you must cut off still more ; do not allow over ten pounds of fruit to ripen on each vine ; they probably will average not less than one pound to the bunch . Occasionally , it will be necessary to go over the vmes and stop the laterals that push on the leading cane and on the spurs , by cutting them back to one eye ; it will be found a /z/ saving of labor , to perform this pruning at regular intervals of a fortnight during the season ; continue this until they cease growing ; the leading cane should be stopped as soon as it reaches the top of the house , leaving one or two laterals at the top to grow a few days , when you should cut back one of them , and leave the other a few days longer , when that must be cut back also . I do not syringe the vines after they are trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided the house is kept moist by watering . The vines will begin to bloom early in June ; when the berries are as large as peas , begin to thin them ; cut out all the small ones first ; no rule can be laid down as to the number to be taken out of each bunch , for the same kinds set their fruit more or less thickly in different years , and in different situations . Of Black Hamburgh , I usually cut three out of five berries ; of Zinfindal , eight out of ten ; of Chasselas , when they set well , five out of ten : experience will soon teach one what is proper to be done . If the shoots from the spurs have not been tied to the rods , they should be as soon as the thimiing is over ; do this carefully , and let them be at equal distances ; a little attention to this Avill improve the appearance of the vines very much . Examine the bunch as the grapes swell ; if they are pressing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries . In thinning , avoid touching the grapes with the hand ; the moisture of the flesh causes rust ; if it is necessary to handle the bunch , gloves should be worn . After they begin to change color , if it is necessary to thin them more , the scissors must be used cautiously , in order not to injure the bloom , and thereby destroy the beauty of the bunch . Early in July , spread the sulphur , as directed the last year . The grapes will begin to change color in August , and to ripen about the middle of September . " If the fruit-bearing branch be not very vigorous , it ought , in July , to be cut ofi " close to the fruit . In the heat of summer , some leaves are necessary over the fruit to shelter it /z/ from the sunbeams until it is half ripe , and then bareness* is requisite to bring it to maturity .

"  --  Ibid , 157 . When ripening off , if the berries do not swell or color well , and , in black varieties , are of a pale red color , feeling soft , if touched , you may be assured the vines are not strong enough to ripen the crop ; cut off the lower part of the bunch of some , and the whole of others , selecting , for this purpose , the bunches which are the most affected in this way , and reducing the quantity on the vine one tliird , or one half , and do so as soon as you suspect this is the case ; by these means , you may save the residue of the crop , and , at the same time , relieve the vine from the exhaustmg effort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by overcropping , and is entirely distinct from what is usually termed shanking ; f for this disease , after it has once taken hold of the bunch , there is no remedy ; the part affected must be lost . In September , cut out all the laterals from the new cane , as directed last year . * The leaves on the shoot bearing the fruit must never , on any consideration , be removed ; if necessary to let in air and light , prune out the laterals and cut back to the bmich . The whole tenor of this remark is only applicable to European culture ; with our American varieties , this practice would be highly improper . It would be better never to prune or stop a shoot than to do thus . I would advise the opposite , and say , if a shoot is very vigorous , and is drawing an undue share of the sap to itself , to the detriment of other parts of the vine , check it by stopping the end of the branch , to promote the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes is caused by a disease on the skin of the footstalk , or stem of the bunch ; in either case , it causes the fruit beyond the affected spot to shrivel , turn acid , and become worthless . When only the foootstalk is injured , it is termed shrivel ; when a shoulder , or part of the main bunch , it is said to be shanked . When it first appears , it is of a brown color , and is on one side of the stem only ; at this time , removing the spot witli a sharp knife will often stay its progress ; when this is not done , it will soon spread around and meet , thus girdling the part affected , and as completely destroying the fruit beyond , as if it had been cut otf. /z/ This treatment of the vine will give you delicious fruit , well-colored , and , consequently , high-flavored ; in black grapes , it may be laid down as a general rule , that , when fully ripe , the blacker the grape , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pound are usually better ripened than larger ones . The berries of the Black Hamburgh , grown by these rules , will measure three and four inches round . This grape is often grown of a slightly reddish tinge , and sometimes with very large berries , very sweet , indeed , but deficient in flavor . This is a simple process , but the practical operation of it involves much labor and unremitted attention . After all is done that is required by pruning , thinning , watering , &c.,; much depends upon the proper ventilation and heat of the house ; this must be opened and shut as the weather changes ; if clouds are constantly passing during the day , and the sun alternately obscured or shining , it will be difiicult to regulate the temperature ; a partial opening of the top lights will allow the heat to escape , and prevent too great an accumulation of it ; the person having charge will soon , by attention , ascertain how much ventilation is required under such circumstances . It will be preferable to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by having the house closed , the heat raised , for even a very short time , to one hundred , or one hundred and twenty , which would be the case in changeable weather , should the sun shine forth suddenly , and the house be entirely closed . This must never be allowed , but , as soon as there is a prospect of the sun shining , open the lights a little , and continue opening as the heat increases . Avoid sudden changes of the temperature as much as possible , and the air should , at all times , be admitted gradually. * /z/ Never allow any of the leaves of the vine to be taken off for the purpose of admittmg the sun to the grapes . If aphis , or the vine-fretter , appear on the vine , fumigating the house with tobacco will destroy them . If red spiders are troublesome , moisture and sulphur are the only remedies ; syringing the vines at evening , and dusting the leaves with flour of sulphur . In September , all but the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves are off , early in November , cut back the leading cane , leaving four feet only of the new , or this year 's growth ; this will now make the entire length of the cane twelve or thirteen feet ; cut back , close to the old wood , the spurs that have fruited this year ; those that have not , cut back to one eye , or bud , to bear fruit the coming season : clean and put over the vines the soap and sulphur , as before : and , the first of December , lay them dovn and cover them , as last season . If the spurs are too close together , you can cut out those that are not wanted ; they should not be nearer together than four inches ; this would make them eight inches apart on each side the cane , and closer than they are often grown ; if nearer , they would obstruct the light . little by little , as the mercury rises ; by this method , your vines will not be exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case , if you allowed Ihe windows and doors to remain closed until the sun shone full and strong upon it 5 in such management , upon admitting air , the temperature would be loered in consequence , which , with an increasing of the sim 's rays , would be highly improper , and should never be allowed . Some sudden change may render this rise of temperature , in a degree , unavoidable ; if this should occur , air must be allowed to enter at once , in sufficient quantity to prevent any further accumulation of it . In a grapery without artificial heat , it is best to accustom the vines to a plenty of air , and a temperature somewhat in consonance with that without . Should you , in bright and fine weather , use them to a very high temperature , the vine would be made to require this , and , at the time of ripening of the fruit , when the climate is always cooler , should the weather be cloudy , or otherwise unpropitious , you would have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence would be a loss of part of the fruit by shrivel and shanking. /z/ Fourth Year . The fourth year , follow the same directions for ventilating , giving air , and watering the vines and the floor of the house as heretofore . After the vines are secured to the trellis , and the shoots are one or two inches long , rub out , from the spurs which were cut close , all but one shoot ; this you must leave to grow for future use ; do not allow it to bear fruit this season . If the vines are strong , and were not injured by overbearing last year , you can now leave on each vine fifteen bunches , that will weigh one pound each , to ripen this season ; let the bunches be distributed , at proper distances , over the vine . The leading cane should not be allowed to bear fruit until it has become established at the length desired for permanent use , when it can be fruited as well as the other shoots . Very strong , healthy vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty to one hundred bunches ; and it requires some firmness , in an inexperienced person , to cut out in this free manner. * * Grapes under glass , and in the open air , almost invariably do well the first and second year of fruiting . This is undoubtedl ' to be attributed to the fresh soil having , in its constituent parts , all the requisite ingredients . The cause of their bearing fruit in a diminished degree after this may be , that some substance was supplied in a small quantity , and has become exhausted , or , it may be that the vine has been too highly excited by stimulating manures , given too freel ' at first , and not continued ; but more frequently , I apprehend , by suffering the vine to mature too much fruit . Pruning .  --  " In your leading article , on the subject of the vineries at Bishop 's Stortford , you concluded by saying , that the vines there were pruned on Mr. Crawshay 's system . This is giving a new and improper name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in France , and is known as the close-spur system of pruning , its proper appellation . I presume , from that general allusion , that the system is well imderstood by professional gardeners ; but I rather think it is not as universally known as it would seem to deserve , if it can be proved to be certain and successful . In all treatises I have read on pruning the me , from Speechly downwards , I have never met with any which has detailed this mode of treatment , or recommended its adoption . I have heard it , in conversation , described as the ' walking-stick system , ' because its principle consists in giving very much that appearance to the main stem , which is always preserved . At each autumnal pruning , the whole of the new wood is cut off to within an eighth of an inch of the old stem . So small , indeed , is the spur left , that the growth of the wood of the following year nearl ' le-els it with the old wood . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stem , one or more buds are developed , which , in the succeeding 3'ear , become the shoots upon which the fruit is produced . The old fashioned grape-grower sees with dismay . /z/ Prune at the same time , and in the same way , as last year ; and , at the autumn trimming , leave four feet more of the new cane ; this will now be sixteen or seventeen feet long , and of sufficient length to bear as large crops as the vine should ever be required to do . In November , clean and place the vines , and protect them from frost , as heretofore . Fifth Year . Fifth year , the same general treatment is to be pursued ; the leading cane must be stopped at the top of the house , leaving two or three of the extreme laterals to grow a short time , and stopping them at intervals of four or five days , the top one first . Yon may now allow the vines to bear twenty pounds of fruit , and , as they grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five pounds . I have never seen more than this quantity ripened on a vine , in this country , ( under ordinary circumstances , ) without injuring the crop the year after . It is true , we often hear of much larger crops , but my experience will not warrant any thing of the kind . Remarkable Vines .  --  In England , there are two very remarkable vines , which are said to produce , yearly , over two in this system , all the buds of the year which have grown and ripened under the influence of a summer and autumn 's sun , annihilated ' at one fell swoop , ' and stares , when told that he is to trust entirely , for his crop of next year , to a bud which he can hardly see . Might I ask your contributors who delight in vine culture , whether the success of this plan depends upon the great power working at the roots ,  --  the forty barge loads of manure , such as our friend at Bishop 's Stortford supplies to the gluttony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in ordinary circumstances , would be at best but a weak wood bud , to the production of the finest fruit ? Is this mode of pruning likely to be generally successful ' ? There are , undoubtedly , many advantages in it . Amongst others , it does seem more consistent with nature , and with all our ideas of rendering culture subservient to her laws , to retain the main stem of the tree which furnishes the largest capacity for the flow of the sap ; it also enables us to keep both fruit and foliage close under the rafters , and thereby to secure the greater quantity of light flowing into our houses .

The fall pruning of the fourth year wiU leave the vine estabhshed at the proper length at which it may ever remain ; the fall trimming the fifth year , and ever after , will be the same as that of the fourth ,  --  cutting the leading cane back to the dormant eyes . If , after a series of years , the cane should become too long , it can then be cut back to the next spur from the top . /z/ " The horticulturist , when he steps into this department , aspires to the top and mastership of his art . A full acquaintance with what his predecessors knew , as principle ,  --  a vigilant attention to what his contemporaries ofier as improvements , with a capacity to estimate new practices ,  --  a considerable personal share of intelligence , experience , and invention ,  --  will not more than qualify him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of forcing-house , are not indiscriminately applied to the same description of place by practical men in general ; nor is this a distinction without a difference . " A hothouse may be considered as constructed to sustain /z/ plants wliich are too tender to live in the open air of the country in which it is employed . A forcing-house may be defined to be an artificial garden for plants which will grow in the open air , by its aid to obtain a crop sooner than the natural operation of the seasons will mature ; the former is a substitute for a given hot climate ; the latter is an anticipation of the local summer . The heat of the former is permanent and more uniform , resembling the steady elevation of temperature which prevails in the regions nearest the line ; that of the latter fluctuates farther from a common medium ; but , whether raised or reduced , it is equally directed to an imitation of nature 's course in some climate . The forcing-house , however , is frequently so assimilated in its construction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite for plants of a mixed nature that the difference vanishes . But both the separation and the interchange may be accounted for by the nature of any given plant . Thus the cherry will ripen its fruit perfectly in the open air ; the forcing-house , for the cherry , is far removed from the hothouse . Few kinds of the grape , however favored by aspect and shelter , come to maturity under the influence of our natural summer ( the climate of England ) ; and most of the sorts which are forced would never ripen under it ; the grape forcing-house and the hothouse are , therefore , convertible things . "  --  Eneyclopcedia . If it be intended to winter-force , you must not commence the process , the first year , before the first of March ; the second year , you may begin the middle of February ; the third year , the first of February , and so on , fifteen days earlier every year , until you reach the first of December ; beyond this you can hardly go , as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has gone into rest . The first of March is recommended as the best time to commence fire-heat for the main crop of grapes ; this can hardly be considered as forcing ; it is a simple protection and aid to the natural growth , and as heavy crops can be matured as in a cold house . /z/ In a house that is forced in December or January , every year , ten pounds of grapes are quite as much as each vine perfect , on an average of years . Before making the fires , the border must be attended to ; if it was covered in the autumn with coarse litter or leaves , as directed , it should now have a quantity of fresh strawy stable manure added , and well mixed with the litter ; cover the whole border to the depth of eighteen inches , and protect this from the cold rain and snow with boards ; this will eifectually prevent the frost from penetrating to the roots . The management of the vine will be the same as directed for the cold house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in the same manner . Forcing , earlier than the first March , is attended with much more risk of failure ; the expense and trouble are more , and these are all increased in proportion as you begin before this time , and the amount of fruit which a vine is able to mature is diminished in a similar ratio . /z/ Commence forcing your house with a temperature of at night , by day ; admit air freely when the sun shines ; upon the furnace and the flues , place pans of Avater ; the vines should be kept in a horizontal position until they are pushing strong ; syringe or wet them repeatedly during the day , and keep the air of the house moist by watering the floor . After ten days , raise the temperature to by night , by sunshine ; continue to keep the house moist until the vines have all broken well , and have been put up to the trellis , when you can lessen gradually the watering ; let the pans of water , on the furnace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after they begin to color , lessen the number of pans of water gradually , and the moisture of the house , and ripen ofi " the fruit in a dry atmosphere . Vines do not appear to be seriously injured by bleeding , /z/ however severe this may be . The only effect from it , wliich I have been able to discover , is a tendency to retard the pushing of the buds , and , on long canes or spurs , the causing of the last eye to be blind . It can not be of any advantage to the vine , that is certain , and it should be guarded against by early pruning . In the Gardeners ' Chronicle for 1846 , page 771 , there is an account of vines which had been winter-forced , and which had ripened a crop of fruit ; as it was intended to remove the vines , the causing them to bear a second crop was attempted ; to effect this , the vines were severely pruned the first of May ; they bled excessively ; notwithstanding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October . The wood , also , was well ripened , round , and firm , with full eyes , and , so well did it appear , that the idea of throwing away the yines was abandoned . They had previously been troublesome from overluxuriance. qwq The shrivel in grapes is caused , frequently , by too large a crop ; sometimes by too much moisture at the roots , and often by a sudden change of air , or too low a temperature ; the /z/ best preventive for the two latter troubles is a constant free circulation of warm air. * In the management of your house , aim to imitate nature , by a regular increase of heat , as in spring . Early in October , you may cut back the spurs to two eyes , if you think the ayoocI is not ripening well ; be careful and do not cut , or otherwise injure , the remaining eyes , or their leaves ; this will admit more sun to the house , and promote a free circulation of air , and strengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open air , frequently falls to zero , and sometimes six and ten below , with a liigh wind blowing at the same time . In January , February , and the early part of March , for weeks together , it will be found , during the night , ranging from ten above , down to , zero . In such a climate , a powerful and steady heat is necessary . The boiler and pipe to circulate hot water around the house , on the level principle , together with the furnace and flue , are recommended as the best and safest heating apparatus . A furnace and flue will not heat more than twenty-five feet of a grapery that is forced in the winter months , and , for any additional length of the house , other furnaces must be added , in the like proportion , or the hot water apparatus substituted. ! The followmg is a memorandum of the regulation of the heat , with the dates on which the different operations were performed , in a house forced in the winter of 1846 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every alternate spur was cut at one eye to fruit ; the others were cut close , as there were more spurs than the strength of the vine would admit of fruiting the coming season . When the vines were not of sufficient length for the rafters , * See Remarks on Shrivel. // we retained as much of the new cane as was required , or as the strength of the vine would allow . The loose bark was rubbed off , and the vines painted over with the composition of soap and sulphur . The border was covered with litter . The first of December , the vines were placed in a horizontal position , near the front of the house , and covered with Russia mats ; those on the back of the house were laid down and covered in the same manner . December 20th.  --  The fires were made , and forcing commenced ; the temperature of the house was kept at at night , by day ; fresh stable manure was put on the border , and well mixed with the litter already there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were repeatedly watered , and pans of water placed on the furnace and flues ; this temperature was kept up , and the watering continued , until  --  January 1st , 1847 ,  --  when the temperature was raised to at night , by day , and air freely admitted , when the sun shone ; wetting the house and vines continued .

The mercury , in the open air , last night , was at zero ; in the house , at 9 , P. M. , it was ; at 7 , A. M. , with as large fires as the furnace would allow .

THE CULTURE OF THE GRAPE . Ill grapes were all ripening in every part of the house , and have colored well ; all the pans of water were now removed , and the house kept as drj as possible . June 1st.  --  The weather now being warm , the making of fires was omitted , excepting in wet weather , when small fires were made in the daytime , and the house was opened for ventilation . June 10th.  --  Half the crop was fully ripe , and the residue colored . After the grapes were all cut , the sashes were kept open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until cool weather , when it will be best to close the sashes and doors at night , to exclude hard frosts . In July , there is every probability that the red spider may appear on the vines of a house that has been winter-forced ; to destroy them , syringe the vines in the afternoon frequently , and dust sulphur all over them ; if this does not kill them , wet the flues and the floor of the house thoroughly , and dust both of them well with the sulphur ; make a fire in the furnace to cause the sulphur to send out strong fumes ; you may melt it , but by no means allow it to burn ; shut up the house close , and give it a good steaming ; open it early in the morning ; this should be done in the afternoon , before the sun has ceased to shine upon the house . /z/ Grapes may be grown successfully in pots , proper attention being paid to watering them ; doing this judiciously is the most difficult part of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water in excess will cause the spongioles , around the sides of the pot , to decay , and , if this happens , the crop of fruit will fail . The soil should be rich ; sods well rotted , leaf mould , and old cow-manure , with a small quantity of fine charcoal and lime rubbish , will form an excellent compost for this purpose . Air-slacked hme can be used instead of the rubbish , if more convenient . These materials /z/ should be mixed together a few weeks before using , and in these proportions : sods , three parts ; leaf mould , two parts ; cow-dung , two parts ; rubbish and charcoal , one part . There should be one or two inches of broken pots , stones , or shells , at the bottom , for drainage . A vine in a twelve-inch pot may mature from five to ten bunches . I prefer a wooden box , or the half of a large keg , as the soil is less Hable to dry and form into a lump ; when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away by the sides of the pot , between these and the soil , leaving the middle of the soil perfectly dry . In the autumn , after a vine has fruited , it should be taken out of the pot and the soil shaken from the roots ; with a sharp knife , prune back the longest of these , and repot in fresh compost . During the winter , they must be kept from the frost , and the only care necessary will be to see that the soil has just enough moisture to prevent the roots from drying up . The next summer they must not be fruited , but proper care must be bestowed upon them that they may produce good bearing wood for the year after . Vines grown by single eyes , or such as would be used for the border , are suitable for planting in pots . You may force these vines to advantage as early as November , if you have a proper temperature . Liquid manure may be given when the grapes commence swelling off . This may be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine in bottles , and any of those may be selected for use , as is most convenient , or as may be thought best . If guano is used , four pounds to thirty-three gallons of water is quite strong enough . A writer in the Gardeners ' Chronicle says , four pounds to twelve gallons ; another , one pound to one gallon . You may train and prune the vines by any of the plans given for the house . /z/ The retarding house should be built upon the same plan as the forcing-house ; it is not necessary that it should be so wide , or so high on the back . The pruning and training of the vine are the same as in the cold house ; the thinning of the berries will be performed later than in any other house , and care should be had that it is thoroughly done , and more severely than in any other way of growing them . Early in March , the sun must be excluded from the house ; this can be done by spreading sails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights must be open day and night , when the temperature is above freezing . In May , when the vines push their buds , the covering must be removed from the glass ; keep the temperature as low as possible , night and day , during the summer ; the end of May , or early in June , the vines should be put to the rods , or trellis . Early in July , the grapes will be in blossom ; apply the sulphur now to the floor of the house , and observe the vines carefully during this and the next month ; if the mildew appear on the wood , fruit , or fohage , shut the house at night , and apply more sulphur . Never allow it to remain on the fruit ; if , by accident , any should get on , brush it off immediately ,  --  opening the house by day , as in any grapery . Early in August , the grapes will require to be thinned . In October , when the nights become cool , close the doors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of mildetv , ' ) giving as much air , and keeping as low a temperature , ( when the sun shines , ' ) by day , as possible . In November , small fires must be made and kept up in the night-time , and in cloudy weather . In the retarding house , where you can not prune the vines early , it is best to disbud them ; to do this , a sharp knife is necessary , cutting out every eye but the lower one on the /z/ spur , being careful not to destroy the leaf ; this will throw all the strength of the shoot into the eye which is to produce the fruit the coming season . Care must be had not to perform this too early in the autumn ; November , probably , is the best time ; if done before the vine is nearly at rest , there might be danger of breaking the eye . The fruit will be ripe the last of November and in December ; after which , the house must be kept as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frost . After the fruit and foliage are off , prune the vines , and protect them from the frost . The following list is recommended for planting in the retarding house , and in the proportions named . If the number of vines to be planted is greater than these , you can increase them by adding of varieties that ripen late , or those of the list given in greatest numbers :  --  Black Hamburgh , five vines , including , with this variety , the Wilmot 's New Black Hamburgh . Muscat of Alexandria , two vines . Zinfindal , two vines . Black Lombardy , five vines . Charlsworth Tokay , two vines . Whortley Hall Seedling , three vines . Portion Noir , two vines . Tottenham Park Muscat , three vines . Syrian , one vine . Red Chasselas , one vine . Black Prince , one vine . St. Peter 's , ( old , ) five mes . Black Frontignan , one vine . Cannon Hall Muscat , one vine . Bordelais , one vine . Escholata Muscat , one vine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine . Queen of Nice , one vine . Josling 's St. Albans , one vine . /z/ For planting , I would recommend the different varieties of the Black Hamburgh grape as the best for the greatest number of vines . The Grizzly , the White and the Black Frontignan are all admired by those persons who like the Muscat flavor ; they are liable to shrivel , and are more delicate than other grapes , and do not keep well when ripe ; the Grizzly is the earliest of them . The Muscat of Alexandria is a large oval grape ; it does not set well under glass , and requires artificial impregnation ; * it is a firm-fleshed or breaking grape , and , when well ripened , can not be exceeded in richness . The Tottenham Park and the Canon Hall Muscat are very like the above , but they are not so high flavored ; they set the berries better . Portuguese Muscat is like the three above , but is more highly musk flavored . Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube is a fine white grape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather small berries , but is very early and good . Syrian , white , has very large bunches , sometimes weighing twenty pounds . Verdelho is a small oval white grape , very good , and a great bearer . Black Lombardy and the St. Peter 's ( Black , ) are late grapes , and will hang a long time after they are ripe . The list of grapes annexed will enable any one to select such sorts as his taste may dictate . For a cold house , I would recommend the following , and in * Otis Johnson , Esq. , of Lynn , a successful cultivator of the grape , the past j'ear , allowed the shoots of this variety to grow at random until the fruit was swelling , and he thinks the result of the experiment was favorable : the fruit set remarkably well . /z/ proportion to the number named to eacli sort . The most desirable , are the first named :  - -  Black Hamburgh , ten vines . Wilmot 's New Black Hamburgh , ten vines . " VVilmot 's No. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old variety . Victoria Hamburgh , ten vines . White Frontignan , two vines . Grizzly Frontignan , two vines . Josling 's St. Albans , one vine . Pitmaston Wliite Cluster , one vine . Golden Chasselas , two vines . Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube , one vine . Rose Chasselas , one vine . Red Chasselas , one vine . White Gascoigne , one vine . Royal Muscadine , one vine . Red Traminer , one vine . White Risshng , one vine . The last seven are equally valuable , and there are many others as much so , as may be seen by referring to the varieties . For a forcing-house :  --  The Black Hamburghs , in Golden Chasselas , variety , " White Gascoigne , The Red , and the Rose Royal Muscadine , Chasselas , Muscat of Alexandria , Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube , Tottenham Park , White Frontignan , Zinfindal , Black Frontignan , Cannon Hall Muscat , Grizzly Frontignan , Red Traminer , Pitmaston White Cluster , Joslmg 's St. Albans . The Early Black July may be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a small grape , of a pleasant flavor , but no earlier than the Pitmaston , and only desirable for its color . They will both , if planted in the warmest situation , come on together , and much before the Black Hamburgh . The Grizzly Frontignan is also an early grape . /z/ The list above embraces a good number of the best varieties ; there are several new kinds well spoken of , but which have not been sufficiently tried , in this country , to prove their qualities . The Chasselas Musque cracks very much , thus far , and , if it should habitually do so , will not be worth cultivation . The Muscat Blanc Hatif ( Early White Muscat , ) is particularly recommended abroad ; it is not unlikely that this will prove to be the same as the Chasselas Musque . There are five or six more kinds which will be fully proved in two or three years , but it is hardly probable there will be any thing better produced , for cultivation under glass , than the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost any number of kinds may be added . The Garden of the Luxembourg , at Paris , numbers about five hundred varieties , many of them worthless , and a great number only differing very little in foliage , or in the time of ripening . Luxembourg Cf-ardens , Paris .  --  " Grape vines occupy a prominent part in this horticultural school , the kinds being very numerous , and the plants taking up a considerable proportion of the ground . Here are now assembled all the varieties of vine known to be cultivated in France , or , I may say , in Europe . To the best of my recollection , nearly three hundred varieties are named , and as many more without names , which are regarded by M. Bosc as possessing characters sufficiently marked to entitle them to rank as distinct. * In general , there is only one plant of each variety ; but the Chasselas de Fontainebleau is an exception , there being a long row of this on one side of the garden . It is the favorite variety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence , ' of the French . At Fontainebleau , the vines grow on a light sandy soil , and the grapes are sweeter than those produced on a heavy soil . The varieties of table grapes are few in number , perhaps scarcely exceeding twenty ; the great mass of kinds consisting of sorts cultivated in the vignobles , in the various depart- /z/ ments of Erance , in Italy , Spain , and Germany . Many of these approacli in character very near to each other ; and it frequently happens , as with our orchard fruits , that the same kind is known under different names in different districts . "  - -  Horticultural Tour , Edinburgh . The following list* contains the new varieties , with some older ones , which have recently been brought to notice , part of which have not yet been proved in this country :  --  Blach Samhurgli.  --  The bunches are large and shouldered , the berries black and roundish ; it is unnecessary to say more , as it is miiversally known to be the best variety for general cultivation under glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muscat of Alexandria .

Madelaine of Vibert.  --  Has berries of medium size and oval . Cfrosse Perle Blanche de Semis .  --  Seedling of Vibert ; said to have very large bunches , and the berries uncommonly large and nearly round . Two other varieties , from seed , by M. Vibert , with black-colored fruit , which he calls Nos. 3 and 4 , are early ; but , as he does not mention them as particularly good , it may be presumed that their quaUty is not remarkable . H Lomhardy , Red .  --  This is a late grape , with very large bunches , and is the same as the flame-colored Tokay . H Zinfindal.  --  The bunches are large , often with two shoulders on the same side nearly as large as the main bunch ; the berries are medium size , round , and very black , with a thick bloom ; requires to hang several weeks after coloring before it is ripe . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his treatise , mentions , as a new grape from Hmigary , one named Zinfardel ; this may be the same . /z/ Blach Damascus .  --  The berries are large , round , and of a black color ; does not set well , otherwise it would be a most valuable kind . H Dutch Sweetwater .  --  The berries are large , round , and of a white color ; when exposed to the sun , of a russet tinge ; it is a pleasant grape. * H White Tohay.  --  The berries incline to an oval figure ; in flavor , like the Chasselas . The underside of the leaf has a fine down . Not so early as the Chasselas . Raisin de Oaldbre.  --  A white grape , of a musk flavor , valuable for hanging late .

A late variety . H Tottenham Park Muscat .  --  Is like the above , but sets its fruit better . H Sweetwater , White .  --  The bunch is open , the berries are round , the skin is thin ; this is a good grape , but does not always set well . H Syrian .  --  The bunches are very large , sometimes weighing twenty pounds . The berries are oval , and the flesh firm , and , when allowed to hang until of an amber color , very good . It requires a long time to perfect its fruit . H Verdelho.  --  This is a small , oval , white grape , of the finest quality . The vine is a very strong grower , and bears great crops . It is a favorite variety for the table , as well as for wine , in Madeira and the Azores . It is a later grape than the Black Hamburgh . Blanche .  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval berries , thin skinned and sweet . White Grascoigne.  --  A fine white grape ; the bunches are /z/ quite large and compact , with shoulders ; the berries are inclining to oval , are subject to crack in moist weather , and do not keep well after fullj ripe . Bordelais or Bourdelas.  --  A very delicate grape that requires a high temperature , and a long season to bring it to maturity ; the berries are oblong , and the bunches are very large . Muscat Blanc Hatif.  --  A grape by this name , lately received as a new kind from France , has proved very Uke the Chasselas Musque . I could discover no difference in the fruit of the two ; the vine did not grow with the same vigor as the Chasselas Musque , but this may have been owing to the situation . Black Tokay.  --  A wine grape . Alexandrian Ciotat.  --  The bunches are large ; the berries are white , of an oval form , with a thin skin . This is a sweet grape , but sets badly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it may prove valuable , for open culture , in the southern states . Black Cluster .  --  The bunches and the berries are small ; the latter vary in shape ,  --  oval and round are usually found in the same bunch ; they grow very close together , ( as is the case with all cluster grapes , ) and often , by their own pressure , burst the skin , causing rot , which soon spreads through the whole bunch . Black July .  --  Very much like the Black Cluster . An early variety . Miller 's Burgundy .  --  The fruit is Hke the two preceding , but it is distinguishable from the above by the white down on its leaves , from the mealy appearance of which it has derived its name . Of the three preceding varieties , Mr. Thompson gives eighty-four synonymes , and adds two varieties as distinct : the Scarlet-leaved Black Cluster , a wine grape of poor quality , and the Black Cluster , nice , which he represents as loose growing . These three , the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as the fruit is concerned , may /z/ be considered the same ; they color early and rapidly , and , when perfectly black , are as sour as any one could wish ; by hanging four or five weeks , they become very good ; but they are so small , and require so much thinning , and usually having five large seeds , that they can hardly be deemed worthy a place in the grapery . H Black Prince .  --  The bunches are long , and often shouldered ; the berries are oval , of a good size , and color well ; this is a good grape , and hangs long after it is ripe ; it sometimes cracks ; the skin is thick , and , in this respect , is inferior to the Black St. Peter 's . Black St. Peter ' ' s.  --  The bunches are large , long , and sometimes shouldered ; the berries color well , and have a thin skin ; this grape also sometimes cracks . It hangs well after it is ripe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable grown in the grapery . White Bual.  --  The bunch is compact ; the berries obovate , white , and thick skinned . Knighfs Variegated Chassdas.  --  This is said to resemble the Aleppo ; the bunches are loose , and the berries are round and sweet , with a thin skin ; it is of second quality . H Chasselas , Rose or Violet .  --  This is a good grape ; in the appearance of the bunch , and in every other respect but color , resembling the Chasselas of Fontainebleau ; when ripe , it is of a rich red , or rose color . II Chasselas de Bar Sur Auhe.  --  This grape has very large , long bunches ; the berries are round , of medium size , and , when fully ripe , of an amber color . " When pruned upon the long-cane system , I have had bunches measuring fourteen inches in length ; it seldom shoulders . H Chasselas of Fontainebleau and the White Chasselas appear to be alike in every particular . They difier from the above in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3fuscadine.  --  This grape , in respect to the size , color , and flavor of the fruit , or berry , corresponds exactly with the Chasselas de Bar Sur Aube , Chasselas of Fontaine- /z/ bleau , and with the Early White Muscadine of the French , yet , in the size of the bunch , it is quite distinct ; the Royal Muscadine growing to a very large size , and having large shoulders , the bunches often weighing four , five , and six pounds . H Early White Muscadine.  --  This is a variety of the Chasselas , and in no way distinguishable from the White , or Chasselas of Fontainebleau , except in the time of ripening , which may be ten days earlier . I have cultivated several other varieties of French grapes , sent over as distinct , but can not discover any difference in them from the above ; all the White Chasselas grapes , when perfectly matured , change to a golden , or amber hue , if grown in a situation fully exposed to the sun . Mr. Thompson gives twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontainebleau and White Chasselas with them . But there is no question that the grapes , cultivated in this country under the names of Royal Muscadine and Chasselas de Fontainebleau , are quite distinct . Josling ' ' s St. Albans .  --  This was first described in the Gardeners ' Chronicle for 1845 . It was raised from seed by Mr. Robert Josling , seedsman , &c.,; St. Albans , from seed sown about 1840 . The bunch is long and tapering , with strong shoulders ; the berries are about the size of the White Frontignan , round , with a greenish white color , changing to a golden , when well ripened ; flesh , firmer than that of the Frontignans , but not so firm as that of the Muscat of Alexandria . It appears to have been an accidental seedling , springing from the Muscat of Alexandria , impregnated by the White Nice , as these two kinds grew side by side . In flavor , it approaches the Frontignan more than any other grape . It is said not to shank or shrivel as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring ( 1848 , ) from England as of this variety , resembles very closely a grape cultivated in my retarding house as the Charlsworth Tokay . Saldbee.  --  An East Indian variety , introduced to the Hor- /z/ ticultural Society 's Garden , Turnham Green , by Col. Sykes . It is stated to be an abundant bearer . The bunches are said to be large , shouldered like the Black Hamburgh , and quite as handsome ; the berries are oval , about the size of the Muscats , Yithout that flavor , and have a fine rosy tinge on the side next the sun .  --  G-ardeners ' Chronicle , 1847 , page 511 . The color of this grape corresponds somewhat with that of the grape described as Queen of Nice . A Seedling grape , exhibited by Mr. Josling at the Horticultural Show , September seven , is said to be very early , resembling the Grove End Sweetwater.  --  Ibid . Bowher.  --  This is a grape raised in the garden of Joel Bowker , Esq. , of Salem , Massachusetts , from the seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great bearer , the fruit handsome , the bunch large , closely set , berries roundish , inclining to oval , white , and of a pleasant flavor , without any musk . It is quite as handsome as the White Hamburgh , and a better fruit . Corinth , Black .  --  This is a small round grape , of second quality , from which is made the black currant of commerce . Corinth , White .  --  This is also small ; the color is white ; from this grape is made the Sultana , or Seedless raisin . Accordmg to Mr. Thompson , there are fifteen synonymes of this . Coriiichon Blanc.  --  A grape of second quality ; it is said to keep well ; the skin is thick , the flavor sweet , and the bunch large and loose ; form of the berries elliptical . Mr. Thompson gives fourteen synonymes of this variety , and Mr. Prince , five . De Candolle.  --  This grape has a round berry , and is of a reddish purple color . It is valuable as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ferrar , Black .  --  This grape was received from Portugal . The bunches are quite large ; the berries are oval , compact , and very black , of medium size ; the flavor is peculiar , not unHke that of the cherry ; the flesh is breaking , or crisp ; it is not generally esteemed , but very much liked by some . It is a very handsome variety . /z/ H Blaeh Frontignan .  --  This is a fine early grape , of Iuscat flavor ; the bunch is long , the berry is round and black , and of medium size . Mr. Thompson gives thirteen synonymes of it . Blue Frontignan .  --  This is a good grape , of a slightly Muscat flavor ; the berries are roundish , and not so large as the Grizzly , or White Frontignan . The Violet Frontignan and Black Constantia are synonymes of this . H G-rizzly Frontignan .  --  The bunches are of a good size ; the berries are round and colored , as the name designates ; it ripens early , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson , there are thirteen synonymes to this . IF White Frontignan .  --  This variety has bunches often quite large ; the berries are round , and , when fully ripened in an exposure to the sun , are of an amber color . The Black , AVhite , and the Grizzly , are , in flavor , very much alike , when grown under the most favorable circumstances , so far as respects quahty ; but , for a variety in color , it is desirable to have the three ; the Grizzly is the earliest of them . The synonymes are twenty-two in number . Gros Rouge de Provence .  --  The bunches are loose ; the berries roundish and black , and of second quality . Fetersburgh.  --  A black grape , with loose bunches ; the berries are round , the skin thick , and the flavor sweet . Lechmere ' s Seedling . Cfrosse Cruillaume . Longford s Incomparable . Sckiras.  --  This is said to be a very fine grape lately received from Persia . Poonah.  --  This is a large , late black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3Iolinet , or 3Iorinet.  --  A grape recently received from France . It has a long , loose bunch , with oval , white berries ; fruited , in 1848 , in the collection of Messrs . Hovey &; Co . U 3Iacready s Early White .  --  This is a new variety ; it has /z/ been fruited , the present and last season , by Messrs . Hovey &; Co. , in their greenhouse . It is a white grape , with an oval and rather small berry . I do not consider it any better , if as good , as the Pitmaston . Portuguese 3Iuscat.  --  A variety of the Muscat of Alexandria ; it is more musque-flavored , and sets its fruit better . Propagating New Kinds from Seed .  --  If the trial to produce new sorts be persevered with in all sections of this country , unquestionably , varieties will be produced that will be hardy , and , at the same time , free from the hard pulp and foxy flavor , that render the American sorts , in the opmion of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generally the kinds that withstand our climate in Massachusetts , blossom fourteen days earlier than the Chasselas , or Early Black July . The Muscat of Alexandria is a few days later still in flowering . To remedy this difficulty , and to obtain the different kinds in flower at the same time , resort must be had to retarding the former by some process of shading , or of promoting the flowering of the European sorts by protecting them with glass , or some other covering , or the farina may be saved in a tin box , or glass bottle , from the grapery until the vines are in bloom . I have an Isabella in the grapery growing principally for the purpose of impregnation , and I may , one of these days , produce something new from it . This difference of the flowering calls in question the accounts of seedlings having been the result of a natural cross between our native sorts and foreign ones ; under usual circumstances , it could not have taken place . " Mr. Van Mons added a remark which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings , that , by sowing the seeds of new varieties of fruits , we may expect with much greater probability to obtain other new kinds of good quality , than by employing the seeds of the best old established sorts . "  --  Hort . Tour , Edinburgh , 1823 . The Van Mons theory is , that , when the seed of a new /z/ variety of fruit has been planted , there is less liability to return to the wild state , than when the seed of an old variety has been used , and he advises the sowing the first seeds of the newest varieties of fruits , as the surest method of producing kinds more and more excellent . Seeds matured by the most healthy and vigorous plants are presumed to be best for planting , to obtain new kinds . The applying the pollen , or farina , of one variety to the pistil , or stigma , of another , is the surer method of proceeding to obtain new sorts in the shortest time , and this is called hybridizing . Flower of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be acted on should be thinned of three quarters of the buds ; the lower part should be cut away entirely , ( immediately before inflorescence ) ; the strongest buds always to be left . Observe them closely , and , as soon as the flowers open , with sharp scissors clip the anthers , being careful not to injure the pistil ; with a soft brush , apply the pollen from the kind to be used in impregnation , or , the whole bunch Avhich is to fur- * The left hand figure is a magnified representation of the bud of the grape ; the middle one is the blossom . The change from the bud to the blossom is usually rapid , and takes place about 30 to 40 days after the shoot appears in the spring which bears the fruit . This bud which forms the blossom consists of a covering , or cap , and the embryo berry with five anthers , which , when the time for inflorescence has come , is raised , or lifted , by the anthers , and the wind blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or embryo grape , with the anthers clipped and deprived of their farina ; on the top of the embryo is the pistil ; upon this is to be placed the farina , or pollen , of the male plant ; when this is done , impregnation takes place , cind the embryo rapidly swells off . If ( he operation has not been eflectual , the berry will remain as it is . When the grape has attained one third or one half of its size , it remains stationary two or three weeks , and , at this time , it is perfecting the seed . When this is done , the fruit begins growing again ; thus it appears the seed will vegetate , even if the fruit does not ripen sufficiently to be eatable. /z/ nisli the pollen may be cut from the vine , and gently rubbed or applied to the bunch , by frequently striking them together on every side . This should be repeated several days , until it is evident the fruit is all impregnated ; a fresh bunch , with the pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . The pollen must be dry , and in a falling condition , to be fit for the purpose . If your vines are so situated that a branch to be acted upon can be brought into contact with the branch of another kind , and the bunches interlaced , this will be a good method of proceeding ,  --  cutting away the male part of the blossom from the kind that is to ripen the seed for the new kinds . To obtain hardy grapes , in new varieties , I should recommend the Catawba , or the Isabella , to be impregnated with the Frontignan , the Black July , the Golden Chasselas , the Pitmaston Wliite Cluster , the Black Hamburgh , and Esperione ; a hybrid from any of these would probably be a grape ripening in less time than the first two . To obtain varieties for the glass-house : the Muscat of Alexandria to be impregnated with any of the kinds that ripen their fruit in a shorter time . A hybrid from any of these would probably have the musk flavor , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some two of the kinds free from this flavor must be selected . The Esperione and Black Hamburghs , being always good setters , are the best for the male plants . The Golden Chasselas , a very beautiful fruit , but often setting poorly , would make a suitable kind to be acted upon . The August Muscat , being very early , could be used as the female also . This variety might be used with the American sorts , with a prospect of producing a plant that would be both hardy and speedy in ripening the fruit . The Scuppernong , bearing fruit only a few berries in a bunch , is objected to as a parent for a new sort for the greenhouse on that account . If Mr. Van Mons 's system of producing new kinds by seeds from wildings be attempted , it would be best to try seed from all kinds , the very small , as well as the good-sized berries . /z/ Insects .  --  In Massachusetts , there are but few insects that feed upon the grape leaf . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been troublesome , and , in some sections of the United States , they are very much so ; being sometimes so numerous as to eat , in a few days , every cluster of fruit buds , or of blossoms , upon the vine . The most effectual method of destroying them is by hand ; covering them ( when wet with dew in the morning , ) with wood ashes , or lime is said to answer , repeating the apphcation two or three times . Spreading a cloth over the vine , and filling the space around under this with tobacco smoke , will cause them to fall , when they can be destroyed by pouring suds made from whale-oil soap upon them . The large green worm ( commonly called the potato worm , ) is , in some localities , very injurious later in the season ; when in large numbers , it is such a voracious creature it will soon eat all the fohage of a vine . When it is known to be at work , which will be by the leaves being rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought for and destroyed . It will be found , commonly , on the under part of the leaf next to the one last eaten ; it is usually of the same color as the leaf , and , unless you observe carefully , it will escape you . The thrips , small white insects that infest the under side of the leaves , are not so injurious as would seem by the spotted appearance of the leaf . Smoking , or syringing with tobaccowater , will destroy them ; they injure the looks of the vine , giving the foliage a diseased appearance . Wide-mouthed bottles hung amongst the branches , ( one every two square feet , ) and filled with sweetened water , - will collect and destroy large quantities of moths , and other insects . These will require to be emptied every few days , or the dead insects on the surface removed . In the grapery , the two years past , the common red caterpillar has been exceedingly annoying . The white moth lays its eggs on the under part of the leaf , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you discover small spots eaten in the leaf ; on examination , you will now find the young caterpillar , one fourth of an inch in length , spread over the leaves ; you must destroy all you can find at once , and , every day , examine the vine anew ; notwithstanding all this care , some of them will probably escape you , and grow to a good size . If these are very numerous , and are on more than one or two vines , it will be best to fumigate the grapery with tobacco leaves , or stems . This will be necessary , if thrips , or the aphis or green fly appear in the house . In smoking , care must be had that the foliage is not injured by the heat from the tobacco ; this should be moist , so that it can not burn with a blaze ; embers and ashes should be placed upon it , and the tobacco allowed to smoulder , causing smoke and not heat . ViTis Labrusca.  --  There are several American species of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives over one hundred varieties of these species . For general cultivation , the first two on the list are the most valuable ones . Isabella .  --  This is a native of South Carolina . Mr. Prince , in his Treatise on the Vine , says that this grape is named in honor of Mrs. Isabella Gibbs , who introduced it into cultivation in New York . The berries are black and oval ; the bunches are of a medium size ; it has a foxy flavor . H Catatoba.  --  This grape is said , by Mr. Adlum , to be a native of Maryland . It is one of the hardiest and most productive of the American varieties . The berries are red , or purple , inclining to black . These two varieties are now so extensively cultivated , and their good qualities as table fruit and for wine are so well established , that it is unnecessary to say more of them . It also has the foxy flavor , and requires a longer season than the Isabella . Bland .  --  This is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxy flavor than the Isabella and Catawba ; it is not a great bearer , and will not ripen in Massachusetts . /z/ Diana .  --  A seedling raised in Massachusetts from the Catawba ; but it is probably a small bearer , as we Lave lost sight of the fruit the past two years . It resembles its parent , and is said to be ten days earlier . Eldnhurgh.  --  A good-flavored , very small grape . This is valued by many for the table ; it is free from the foxy flavor . Lenoir.  --  " A very excellent table grape ; perhaps siiperior to any of those described . It is believed to be a seedling of the Burgundy grape . It has very much the habit of a foreign vine . The bunches are very handsome , large , compact , and not much shouldered. "  --  Dotiming 's Fruits and Fruit Trees of America . This grape is not known much in Massachusetts . Norton 's Virginia .  --  Vitis Nortoni , Prince , ( small ) . A native of Richmond , Virginia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Burgundy ; it was raised by Dr. N. Norton . Mr. Downing says it is very productive in the garden , or vineyard , especially at the south , where many kinds rot . In Massachusetts , it is a small bearer compared with the Isabella ; this may be owing to the wood of the vine not ripenmg perfectly , in consequence of the shortness of the season . Oldo.  --  This grape has been introduced into cultivation by N. Longworth , Esq. , of Cincinnati . The bunches are large and long , the berries small , round , and black , the flesh tender , juicy and sweet . Scuppernong .  --  Is a distinct species found growing wild from Virginia to Florida ; there are two kinds , the black and white . The bunches are small , usually of five or six berries , which are large and round . It is quite tender , and will not live at the north . See description of this in North Carolina vineyard account . Missouri .  --  Vitis 3Iissouriensis , Prince . A grape used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for making wine . Alexander's.  --  ' A wine grape , native of Pennsylvania . Sage .  --  This grape was found by Mr. Henry E. Sage , of Portland , Connecticut , growing wild on the margin of a small /z/ stream , and was removed by him to his garden , as early as 1811 . It is represented to be near a lilac color . From Mr. William Leonard , of the Shaker Society , I received two vines , and an account of the fruit and of the well-established reputation which it has in the vicinity where it was found . Mr. Leonard made a visit to the place , and saw the plant in fruit ; he measured some berries , which he found four inches in circumference . At the nurseries of the Shaker Society , Harvard , vines of this grape may be found on sale , and , probably , at the farm of Mr. Sage , Portland , Connecticut . The foliage blighted badly in my garden in July , 1848. * * The following are extracts from two letters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc : -  --  " Portland , Oct. st , 1846.  --  The vine was taken from the margin of a small stream , in quite a secluded spot , some thirty-five years since , and has been a constant bearer many seasons , yielding in great profusion . " Perhaps I shall be considered selfish , but must say they are the richest flavored grapes I have ever tasted . The pulp is very soft and juicy . The ' commenced ripening about two weeks since , and are now dead ripe ; they will not drop from the vine when ripe , as many grapes do , but will remain ( unless gathered , ) until the ' get perfectly dry , and their flavor is so very rich , that a few bunches , in a room , will perfume it for months . For making jelly , they are not surpassed . H. E. Sage . " " Portland , April 8th , 1848.  --  I this day received your line requesting information about the ' Sage Grape . ' In answer to your inquiry , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say it is a constant bearer , and would be a prolific one , were it not for the rose bugs , which have almost wholly destroyed them for some years ; it always blossomsyw/q/ , and , just at this stage , the bugs appear to make their havoc . " Seasons when not destroyed , the vine has been borne down with the fruit , probabl ' as many as twenty bushels have been gathered from the vine which you saw ; the bunches , in such seasons , are large and full ; the berries very round , and their average girth three inches , and many of them much larger . " The soil of my garden is rather of a dry , loamy nature , and brings forth vegetation pretty early . I have never used any kind of manure for my vine , and have scarcely taken the trouble to build a place for it to run upon . I am confident , were it in some hands , it would surpass any thing of the grape kind in this country . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a situation where the sim would strike it fair ; the south side of a building would be preferable , and , if the soil is rich , I think it will do as well without manure as with it . I believe the dryer the soil , the sweeter will be the fruit . " A vine which was cultivated from a plant from my garden , four years ago , bore profusely last season , and flourishes beyond calculation ; it is placed on the south side of a house , and forms an arbor to the entrance of two tenements . " In great haste , dear sir , I believe I have answered your inquiries . I speak in confidence , when I say that the Sage grape , properly cultivated , will surpass any thing of the grape kind in this country . Henry E. Sage . " /z/ iShurtleff 's Seedlmg.  --  The description of this grape is in the words of Dr. ShurtlefF , who furnished the account , at my request , for this purpose . A gentleman who fruited this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It came up in my garden in Brookline , in 1837 . The plant was of a delicate and slow growth ; it fruited on the fourth year , and , on the fifth , it bore about four quarts of grapes of superior flavor ; and the berry was of a good size , perfectly round , about the size of a Muscadine ; the bunches of moderate bigness , and well set ( unlike the zvildfox grape ; the stem , pressed out like the Isabella ; the color black , with a peculiar ray , like the spokes of a wheel , running from the stem to the eye of a hghter shade , the whole grape covered with a bloom ; it puts out two or three weeks later than the Isabella , and ripens two or three weeks earlier . The vine is a small grower , and lives with me without protection ; it is situated on a southeast angle of my house . The third year of bearing , it was , unfortunately , split near the ground , and the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will probably bear this year . The fruit is free from any foxy taste or pulp . I think it far superior to any native grape that I have seen . I do not know from what seed it originated , whether from native or imported ; it appears to partake of the Sweetwater and Isabella in its rich flavor . S. A. Shurtleff . " The foliage of this grape would indicate that it originated from an American variety . Dr. Shurtleff has another grape . It originated at Carver , on a farm belonging to this gentleman ( and which has always been in the possession of his ancestors , since the settlement of the country ) . It was found in the woods , far from any other vine . The foliage indicates this to be a seedling from an American variety . Naumkeag.  --  A seedling grape raised from the Isabella by Mr. Bowker , of Salem , which fruited , the first time , this season , ( 1848 , ) appears to have good qualities . It bore a large /z/ crop , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in form and flavor ; it has a pulp also ; the berries are above medium size , round , and of a clear red , with a shght bloom . There are several other native American seedlings in this vicinity , which are recommended by persons who have eaten the fruit . As they have not been proved in garden cultivation , it is deemed best not to enumerate them . /z/ The mildew at the north , and the rot at the south , render the cultivation of foreign varieties of the grape , in the open air , in this country , almost useless . The difficulty is not with the season ; this is long enough to ripen many kinds , were it not for the above trouble . I have seen , in my garden , the Early Black July perfectly colored the first of September ; but the leaf was so injured by mildew that the grapes did not sweeten , or obtain any flavor. * In some of our cities , they occasionally ripen very well . If it is desired to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the same way as directed for house culture ; they may be trained by any of the systems described ; prune them , and thin the berries in the same manner as if in the house . The Pitmaston White Cluster , Early Black July , Golden Chasselas , and Esperione are recommended as the best for cultivation in the vicinity of Boston ; further south , the Black Hamburgh and Frontignans may be added to the list ; and south of north latitude , the Muscat of Alexandria and other late sorts may be tried . The August Muscat is the * Application , to the foliage of the vine , of sulphur , in a free manner , is the only effectual remedy of which I can speak practically ; other remedies have been recommended , such as lime , ashes , etc. , to the soil . Apply the sulphur early in the morning when the leaves are wet , and renew it as often as the rain washes it away . /z/ earliest of any grape , and can be tried , as it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In November , the vines must be laid down and well covered with straw , or litter , to protect them from the frost , when cultivated in the northern states . In Hovey 's Magazine of Horticulture , vol. 12th , is a communication by Mr. J. W. Russel , gardener to Horace Gray , Esq. , on the cultivation of the grape , in which he gives the foUomng receipt to prevent mildew . Having found the application of sulphur to the floor of the house all that was necessary in cultivating the grape under glass , I have never used this preparation , but , for their cultivation in the open air , I would strongly advise its trial ; it should be applied in July , or earher , if there is any appearance of mildew on the fruit , wood , or fohage . Receipt .  --  " To one peck of quick lime , add half a pound of sulphur ; put them into a tight barrel , and pour boiling hot water over them sufficient to slake all the hme , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best possible manner ; then pour on to the top of it three gallons of soft water , and stir it well together , leaving it to settle ; in about twenty-four hours , the water on the top will be perfectly clear . " This should be taken off " as clear as possible , and put into a stone jar , there to remain until wanted . Half a pint of this mixture will be sufficient for three gallons of water . " This wash will not injure either the fruit or leaves , and no person could tell that any thing but clean water had been used , only that it leaves a stain on white paint , which will wear off " in a little time . This is a sure remedy for the mildew , and , therefore , worth knowing to every grape cultivator. " * * Prince 's Treatise on the Grape contains this receipt , and it is there stated , that the application of it , in the garden of Capt . Smith , of Newport , R. I. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material part left , after drawing the clear liquid off , may be used for washing the wall , or trellis , upon which the vine is trained . /z/ The Isabella , a native grape , succeeds better in the open air than any other variety in this vicinity ; the border should be well made , and in a dry situation ; the training must be different from that of the foreign kinds ; it will not bear the severe pruning which is necessary for them ; the summer shoots should be tied to the trellis ; leading up or out , in different directions , shoots to be partially retained , at the winter prmiing , for the extension of the vine . In August or September , cut back the ends of all the shoots made this year to check the growth , and let the sun and air have access to the vine . Winter-pnine , in February , on the spur system , leaving an addition to the extreme shoots of about two feet of the new wood , and when this cane grows too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter pruning , to any length desirable , and lead up a new shoot the coming season to take its place . The quantity of fruit that a vine of this variety will ripen , when it has arrived at maturity , under proper management , and is favorably situated , is remarkably large ; two bunches on a spur may be allowed to ripen ; the berries do not require the thinning that foreign ones do ; the small ones only should be cut out . When gathered in perfectly dry weather , and put away in a cool place , just above the freezing point , and packed in layers of cotton , they will often keep good until March . Before packing , each bunch should be examined , and any defective berry cut out . The Catawba will not ripen as far north as Boston . Pond 's Seedling is one of the best native varieties ; the fruit , however , is but seldom seen , and it is therefore presumed to be a shy bearer . Bland 's Virginian will not ripen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation . The Ohio grape is tender , and , at the north , requires the same protection as foreign kinds ; the bunches are large and long , but the berries very small . The vineyard cultivation of the native varieties of the /z/ grape , in the United States , is attracting more attention yearly . On the banks of the Ohio River , the planting is increasing rapidly , and , on the hills near Reading , Pa. , are vineyards for the purpose of making wine . The first attempt to grow the vine in our western country , to any extent , for the purpose of making wine , is generally credited to a party of Swiss , who commenced their operations at Vevay , on the Ohio River . According to Mr. Longworth , it has not been successful . This gentleman is interested in this culture , and , by statements of his in Downing 's Fruits and Fruit Trees of America , he had , in 1845 , seventy acres planted with vines , and divided into fourteen vinej ' ards , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catawba as the best variety for the west . The European kinds have not succeeded with him . The following are his remarks : " The grape requires a good soil , and is benefited by well-rotted manure . For aspect , I prefer the sides of hills , but our native grapes would not succeed well in a dry sandy soil , particularly the Catawba . The north sides of our hills are the richest , and I believe they will , as our summers are warm , in the majority of seasons , produce the best crops . " Deep ploughing is the better preparation of the land for the vines . Where a hill is steep , trenching and walling , or sod-terracing , is necessary . " We generally leave six feet between the rows , and use the plough , setting the plants three to four feet apart , and training them to stakes about six feet high . "  --  Downing ' 8 Fruits and Fruit Trees , page 251 . It has been considered of sufficient importance to give the views of European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of culture pursued there . The American kinds of the grape , requiring a different plan of pruning , will render many of the practices , particularly the close pruning ( in summer , ) and planting of the vines , impracticable here ; still , the remarks on manures and soil , and details of some of /z/ the plans of training , will be worthy of notice by American grape growers . First comes the exposition . It is the established opinion , in vineyard culture , that the best fruit is produced where the vine receives the most sun , not upon the fruit , but upon the foliage . Prince says , " Theibaut de Berneaud remarks , that an eastern aspect would be preferable to all others , if it did not expose the plants , during the first warm days of spring , to be blasted by the burning rays of the sun operating upon the small icicles , each of which acts as a lens . A southern exposure ( he continues , ) is generally too hot in a warm climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the plant there receives a direct heat after the early hours of the day have abstracted the moisture , and , therefore , dries and bums it ; and he recommends , as a general rule , that , in southern regions , an eastern aspect should have the preference , and , in northern ones , that a southern exposure should be selected . "  --  Prince 's Treatise , page 46 . Yet there are exceptions to these rules . Vineyards with northern exposures have become celebrated , probably owing to favorable circumstances of soil . In the southern part of the United States , it will be best to try every situation , as the retarding of vegetation a short time might be the means of saving the fruit , either from being destroyed by a late frost , or from excessive rains , at the time of inflorescence , or from rot , caused by too much wet , at a later period . The plan pursued by American horticulturists in vineyard and garden culture , in some instances in their own language , is described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our native grapes ( different varieties succeeding in var rious sections of the country , ) answer every purpose of vineyard culture , there does not appear to be any occasion to try any others , excepting on a small scale for the dessert . Mr. Hoare says , " In the choice of a good aspect , therefore , shelter from high Avinds , and those aspects that are the least exposed to their effects , and that receive a full portion /z/ of the solar rays , may be deemed the best . The best aspects in the southern parts of England are those that range from the eastern to the southeastern , the last of which may be considered the very best . The next best are those which follow in succession from southeast to south . An aspect due south is undoubtedly a very good one , but its exposure to those strong winds which frequently blow from the southwest forms a great drawback . The remaining aspects are those which range successively from due south to due west . These are all good ones provided they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of the high winds above mentioned . North of the western point , the maturation of the wood and fruit of the vine becomes uncertain . East by north is a very good one . North of this point , the solar rays are not sufficiently powerful to mature either the wood or fruit . "  --  Treatise on the Grrape hy Clement Hoare . 1837 . Chaptal says , " That the middle of a hill side produces the best wine , the upper part the second best , and the bottom of the hill the most inferior ; " showing , apparently , that the middle location contains the essential nourishment required , that , in the upper part , there is a lack of this , and at the foot of the hill there is either too much of it , or too much moisture . Monsieur de la Quintiney says of the Muscat grapes , that they " require a temperate country and the expositions of the south and east , and always a light ground ; we seldom see any good in pure earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravelly and sandy grounds . " Page 229 . The Penny Cyclopaedia says of the aspect : " On the steep slopes of hills towards the south , and sheltered from the northeast , the grapes attam the greatest maturity , and the vintage is most certain . So great an influence has a favorable exposure , that in the same vineyard the greatest difference exists between the wine made from one part and that made from another , merely because there is a turn round the hill , and the aspect varies a very few degrees . A change of soil produces a similar effect . The famous Rhine wine , called /z/ Johannisberg , when made from the grapes which grow near the castle , is worth twice as much as that made a few hundred yards farther off . Here both soil and aspect change . The Clos de Vougeau , which produces the finest Burgundy , is confined to a few acres ; beyond a certain wall , the Avine is a common Burgundy , good , but without extraordinary merit . " At Bourdeaux , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a southwest ; in some places , a northern exposure is thought best , as the danger from late frosts is less . Chaptal is considered as the best French authority on the vine . His object , in his Treatise on the Grape , was to promote the improvement of the quality of the wine , and to discourage the use of manures , as one of ihe main causes of this inferiority . The practical ideas of this treatise are mostly attributed to the Abbe Rosier , of whom it is said , " that , retiring to the home of his fathers , he , for a long time , practised agriculture , not only studying all previous systems of vine culture , but comparing the old with his experience , the local practices with the laws of natural philosophy , to bring the culture of the vine to its highest state of perfection was his particular object . " In the introduction , he asks , " Why is it , that so large a number of the wines of France , formerly celebrated , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of so ordinary a quality , whilst those of another district have acquired and preserved a merited reputation ? On reflection , we can not attribute the difference entirely to the situation , the chmate , or the soil . Is it not , then , to the little care of the cultivators , to the following of a blind routine , or to the ignorance of the laws of nature , or to the preference that is given to vines that abound in juice of a gross nature , above those which produce wines of a better quality ? " Page 6 . " The laws of vegetation , regarding the vine , will show you that a rich soil will produce the most vigorous shoots , but that the sap thus communicated from the vine to the grape would not be sufficiently elaborated ; the wine would be in- /z/ sipid and weak . It is necessary to diminish the vigor of the vine to obtain a wine of good quality ; to do this , the soil best suited for the purpose must be selected , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attended to , and the most favorable time for the vintage . From chemistry , he must learn the elements of wine , and the manner to direct the fermentation , etc . He must follow tiature ; in all his operations , she should be his study ; he should be tractable to her lessons ; she alone never deceives . " Pages 7 and 8 , introduction . " In France , it is only necessary to cultivate the sheltered hill-sides , and soils granitic and calcareous , or sandy , and generally the poorest , such as are not suitable for pasture or grain . " Page 29 . " The earth , the most suitable for vegetation in general , is that composed of a mixture of flint , of clay , ( alumine , ) and of lime , in such proportions as readily to imbibe moisture , and so to retain it that it may be constantly and insensibly evaporated by the warmth , giving enough nourishment to the plants until a renewed rain has again filled the reservoirs . When there is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To constitute a good vegetative soil , it is not sufficient that barely the top layer of earth shall be thus composed ; it must be of good depth . " Page 197 . " In time , the good soil will wear out , become exhausted , and one can not hope to reap a continued advantage , unless by depositing , from time to time , new principles of nourishment ,  --  of oxygen , of hydrogen , and of carbon . These can be found in proper quantities in the manures of animals , and decomposed vegetable matter . One may also usefully employ certain minerals , not as manure , but as a rectifier : for instance , fossils and marl , which , from the effect of moisture and heat , ferment and cause the small lumps of earth to separate , and render the whole mass more permeable to the substances which form the sap . " Page 198 . " The nutritive principles required from the soil , for the /z/ cultivation of the grape , are the same as those named as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient supply of moisture , the vine will not prosper . " Page 219 . " The kind of earth regarded as the most suitable for the cultivation of the vine varies with the climate in which the culture of this plant is introduced . We do not speak here of the superior layers of soil , which would make such an assertion hazardous . Experience has demonstrated , that , in the southerly ( meridionaux ) departments , the vine flourishes in volcanic earth , in the ( freestone ) grit , and in the granitic gravel , mixed with vegetable earth and with some claj , ( alumine ) . Towards the centre of France , they succeed in the schistes , ( slaty ) and above all in the calcareous rock , which crumbles on exposure to the air . At the north , they prefer the coarse gravel combined with calcareous earth . But every where you may make use of collections of earths and stones ( almost monstrous , ) of all kinds , provided that the mass be permeable to water , and retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good earth for the vine , is , that it should possess a mixture of quartz , of flint , and coarse gravel . The rays of the sun penetrate these stones and furnish warmth during the day , and distribute it to the plants by night . This is not all : in earths exceedingly porous , they yet serve , by the effect of their solidity and quantity , to diminish the too rapid evaporation of the moisture . Besides , ( finally , ) it is by the vegetables that the soil produces that we can best judge of its quality , and of the temperature of the climate . Wherever the cultivator shall see the peach tree prosper naturally , he may conclude the situation is favorable for the culture of the vine . " Page 246. * " If the earth where you propose to plant a vineyard is cultivated already , the best preparation for so doing is to plant , for two or three years , the soil - flith vegetables , giving /z/ the preference to such as require the most working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this operation , and the manures bj which they are made to thrive , prepares , Hghtens , and enriches it . The dung , in general so adverse to the vine , so prejudicial to the quality of the fruit , incorporated into the soil in advance , can have only good effects ; it has become freed of the carbonic acid in excess , and the vegetable substances become united with the under surface of the earth ; the soil , thus prepared , is suitable for the vine in every age , but more particularly in its infancy . " Page 251 . Remarks quoted by Dr. Lindley in the controversy relating to manures for vines :  --  " The same reasons may be used against the system of the vine-growers of the north , who think it advantageous to manure their vines . By this means , indeed , they obtain larger crops , and more Avine , but it is of bad quality , it will not keep ; and its smell often reminds me , when dranh , of the disgusting substances which produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nutritious juice , reduced to gas , and received by the mouths of the capillary roots , and by the air-vessels of the leaves , penetrates and circulates in the sap-vessels , forms the wood of the plant , and furnishes the substance out of which the shoots , leaves , flowers , and fruit are developed ; the more abundant the nutritive matter , the more the diameter of the vessels distends , the more rapid is the circulation of the sap , because the channels through which it passes have more capacity . This causes the sap to circulate in a less state of elaboration , the result of which must be , that the wine is flat , insipid , and destitute of all the principles of alcohol . Nevertheless , the abundant crop thus obtained , and the brilliant vegetatio7i , are , after all , in some measure deceptive , FOR THEY CAN BE BUT TRANSITORY . In vineyards where manuring is practised , they only manure once in ten years . It is not to be doubted , that the effect is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vines , but , in the succeeding years , the plants begin to languish ; no longer find- /z/ ing that abundance of nourisliment to which they have been accustomed , they suifer m consequence , and often fall victims to the want of it . Thus a part of the plants are lost , either by too much or too little nourishment . But vines can receive , and it is often advantageous to give them , such manure as will make good the poverty of the soil , its exhaustion , or what is required otherwise for this sort of cultivation . No manure suits vines better than what is properly called vegetable earth , obtained by the decomposition of plants . Mosses , leaves , and turf , mixed together , thrown up in great heaps , and left for about two years to ferment , make the very best manure of this sort . " Page 333 . These remarks follow the above , quoted by Dr. Lindley , and may be considered essential to the proper understanding of the matter :  --  " Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient quantities , these ( decomposed vegetables , ) substances , intelligent cultivators have recourse to such as can be had from the bottom of rivers , ponds , and ditches , and the sweepings of the roads and streets ; these are made up in heaps , composed alternately of a layer of these articles and a layer of old dung from the cow or ox , the horse or sheep . This is left to winter in this condition ; it is then spaded over , on all sides , and this is repeated often during a year ; after this , it is ready to be applied to the vines . Manures diifer in quality , and it can not be positively said which is best for a place , unless the quahty of the earth which is to receive it is known . A manure may be destructive to a vine in one part of a vineyard , and yet be highly invigorating to some other part even of the same vineyard . " To improve a soil that is too moist , spread gravel upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of humus , and shells , and marl , and other calcareous substances . You may also give for manure , ashes , soot , pigeon 's dvmg , and other powerful substances , but it is necessary that these should be for a long time exposed to the air and reduced /z/ to poudrette . These should be mixed with good loam , to render the effect more durable . Where the soil is excessively - vet , it will be best to apply manure without any other mixture ; in this case , spread a handful of the substance , as you sow the seed broadcast on the land . " Vegetable matter alone is sufficient to invigorate , for many years , the vine which has been suffering in poor soil near the top of a declivity . Thus , to manure and improve a soil understandingly , you must be acquainted with the effects of the different manures , and of the proper proportion in which to apply these , to the necessities of the different kinds of earth . " Some cultivators have employed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofs and feet of sheep , and others , again , of the pieces of woolen clothes . " All these matters succeed as manures for the vine ; they contain much hydrogen and carbon , two of the chief agents in vegetation . Buried in the earth , their decomposition is slow , nearly insensible ; but , as it is impossible to obtain these in large quantities , it is not necessary to discuss the effect of them at large ; perhaps they may have the effect to give a peculiar taste to the mne . " Pages 335 and 337 . " Fresh dung , the manures obtained from the depositories for carrion , etc. , and other powerful matters not yet converted into poudrette , are not the only substances which give a bad taste to the wine . The vine absorbs with much vigor all vapory substances suspended in the air . "  --  Traite siir la Culture de la Vigne , page 340 . The soil of the celebrated vineyards which produces the Constantia wine at the Cape of Good Hope is a decomposed sandstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very steep , and is terraced ; the soil is of a dark rocky nature . The soil of Johannisberg , on the Rhine , is argillaceous schist , with a proportion of mica , and , in one place , is a reddish quartz . This is mixed with diluvial and alluvial deposits , /z/ in most parts . The exposure is southwest , vnth. a slope of fifteen degrees . The grape generally cultivated near the Rhine is the ( Riesling , ) White Rissling . The soil of Leistenwein and Steinwein vineyards , on the Main , is similar , being argillaceous with calcareous portions , especially fragments of hme . The Leistenwein is regarded as the second finest wine of southern Germany ; but , as the quantity made is very small , it is seldom to be purchased . The grapes grown here are mostly the White Rissling and the Traminer . The soil of the hill of the Hermitage , where is made the celebrated wine of this name , is variable . Dr. Bushby says the hill is of considerable height , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks to the south , may contain three hundred acres , and of this , even the middle region does not produce the finest wines . " The gentleman , Avhose property we were traversing , pointed out to me the direction in which a belt of calcareous soil crossed the ordinary granitic soil of the mountain , and he said it requires the grapes of these soils to be mixed , in order to produce the finest quality of Hermitage . "  --  James Bushhy , London . " Between Chagny and Beaune , in France , the plain lying to the southeast of the range of hills , which , from the value of their produce , give the name of Cote d'Or to the department , is extremely rich , and , to all appearance , capable of yielding golden harvests of corn , as the hills do of wine . The greater portion of it , however , was planted with vines on both sides of the road . Near Chagny , it appeared lighter , with a larger admixture of stones , and , on approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ihid . " At the vineyard of Chambertin , the soil varies extremely , even in the distance of one hundred yards ; that nearest the road is of a brown loam of sufficient consistency , but full of gravel , and , consequently , very friable . The gravel consists of small broken pieces of the whitish hmestone , of Avhich the hill is partly formed . At the highest limit to Avhich the /z/ ground has been broken up , it is a light-colored clayish-looking soil , with a subsoil of marl , and abundance of small shells . Both of these soils effervesced strongly with an acid , but the light-colored evidently contains a far greater proportion of lime . The soils of Beze , another first-rate vineyard of the commune of Gevray , were exactly similar to that of the lower part of Chambertin. "  --  Ibid . Several other vineyards are described as having the same soil . Ay , the centre of the district which produces the Champaig-ne wine , is a small town on the river Marne . " The range of hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , except where the exposure is varied by recesses in the range ; it consequently produces wine of the finest quaUty , and very superior to that of Epernay , which is produced on hills exposed to the north . The soil is strongly calcareous , full of small pieces of chalk and of stones . Near the top of the hill , the soil is more argillaceous. "  --  Ibid . " At Argenteuil , the vignerons pay the utmost attention to their plantations ; indeed , their mode of cultivation , at least as relates to productiveness , may be regarded as approaching to the perfection of the art . " They apply manure very freely ; but this practice , though it swells their ? ' ecoIte , is thought to deteriorate the quality of the grapes . Poudrette is much used , which is neither more nor less than night-soil dried and reduced to powder . " Poudrette , we understand , was first recommended by the celebrated Parmentier , about thirty years ago , ( 1790 , ) as a top dressing for various field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compost with the weeds and refuse of the garden , and some marly loam , or light mould ; the poudrette being spread on the compost bed , in the proportion of half an inch to six inches of weeds and earth . Such compost is considered as well adapted for stimulating the roots of fruit trees , especially cherries , figs , and vines . " The offensive smell is , to a considerable degree , removed /z/ bj the addition of quicklime. "  --  Horticultural Tour , Edinburgh , /z/ From Abercrombie 's Practical Gardener . London , 1823 . " Although vines will succeed as plants in any common garden earth , it is advisable to allot them a dryish , warm , melloAv , unexhausted soil , rich in good loam , or improved with suitable manure , to the depth of three or four feet . A dry bottom is requisite to keep the fruit from degenerating in flavor . " " Once a week , drainings of the dunghill may be mixed with water , and applied to the roots when the grapes are swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine out of doors would not so often make poor returns in fruit , were the soil kept warm and rich by an annual dressing when the plant is at rest . Among the manures found of great avail in supporting or recovering the fertility of vines , may be reckoned rabbit 's dung , duck 's dung , sheep 's dung , sheep 's urine , drainings of a common dunghill , vegetable mould , a compost in which warm dry elements rather preponderate , a little hog 's blood , or bullock 's blood , or the general oflfal of a slaughterhouse , with a qualifying portion of lime , or shell marl , fresh loam , and sharp sand . Whether it be a fluid manure , or part of the old earth be dug out and a compost substituted , the application is chiefly to be made at the extremity of the roots . The roots of old plants , in a yielding soil , are sometimes found to have travelled to a wonderful distance in quest of nourishment . " In preparing the border for forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " top spit sandy loam from an upland pasture , one third part ; unexhausted brown loam from a garden , one fourth part ; scrapings of roads , free from clay , and repaired with gravel or slate , one sixth part ; vegetable mould , or old tan reduced to earth , or old stable manure , one sixth part ; shell marl , or mild hme , one twelfth part . From the time the buds rise , until the fruit is set , manure the border , once in ten days , with the drainings of the dunghill , poured over the roots of the plants . /z/ " The border should be kept , at all times , clear from weeds . When it is necessary to recruit the soil , work in such a compost as has been described , or similar . The dung out of a cow-house , perfectly rotted , is a fine manure for the vine . " Forsyth , in his book on the Culture of Fruit Trees , says that " the best manure for vmes is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loam turf ; and all this should be thrown in a heap , and frequently turned , for a year or two , before it is used . " Page 219 . London , 1824 . The following I found in Loudon 's Magazine , vol. 17th , page 646 ; it is there credited to the Gardeners ' Chronicle , vol. 1st , page 413 :  --  " Mr. Hayward 's manure for grapes . I have tried a great variety of compounds as food , and have found that one quart of cider , or cider grounds , added to two gallons of water , brings a grape vine to a more perfect prolific state than any thing else . Tliis mixture must be supplied in such quantity as will saturate the earth , like water , to the depth of the roots , and all over the surface occupied by the roots . It must only be given once in the year ; and , if repeated the second year , its good effects will be sustained for several years afterwards without further supplies . " Hoare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the vine , etc. , is a rich , light , sandy loam , not more than eighteen inches in depth , on a dry bottom of gravel , stones , or rocks . " Of those manures that may be mixed with the soil when the border is first made , the best are such as possess the two valuable qualities of affording to the roots of the vine the highest degree of nourishment combined with the greatest ' permanency of duration . Of this description are bones , horns and hoofs of cattle , bone dust , the entire carcasses of animals , cuttings of leather , woolen rags , feathers , and hair . Bones , however , on account of their prolonged effect , are by far the most valuable manure that can be deposited in a vine border . /z/ " In the year 1826 , several vines were planted . In the following year , a quantity of bones , the largest of which was the blade bone of a calf , was digged into the border , five or six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the border was opened , in order to ascertain to what extent the roots of the vine were nourished by these bones . It was found that the roots had branched out in every possible direction amongst them , the surfaces of which were completely covered with their fibres . " Bone dust is a very powerful manure , producing immediate effect , and is lasting in its duration . " Liquid manure is highly valuable , where immediate effect is required . The most powerful are urine , sootwater , blood , the drainings of dungheaps , and soap suds . The first of these , on account of its saline qualities , is better calculated to promote the fertility of the vine than any other liquid . " For the purpose of top dressing , and to be forked into the border when requisite , may be named , as highly enriching manures , night-soil , fish , stable manure , and the excrements of every description of birds and animals . It is necessary further to observe , with respect to the application of liquid manures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the surface of the border too rich . " After the vine has become established , Mr. Hoare says : " The winter being the proper time to manure the border , let it now be lightly forked up , and a good coating of manure laid over it about six inches deep , which will answer the twofold purpose of enriching the border , and protecting the roots of the vine . " According to Mr. Hoare , grapes may be grown in perfection in England , and to a great extent ( by following his directions , ) on walls and espaliers , and he gives a scale of measurement of the vine , by which to regulate the crop , as follows : A vine of three inches in circumference may bear five pounds ; a vine of three and a half inches in circumference may bear ten pounds ; and advancing in this ratio to ten inches circum- /z/ ference , and , for every half inch of increase , allowing the vine to ripen five pounds additional of fruit , so that the highest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done , and he tells us that he gives the result of his practice , it - would seem that the question was settled . But it appears that there are those holding different opinions . In the Gardeners ' Chronicle of June 10th , 1847 , is the following , on an article relative to planting the banks of railways with vines :  --  " We entertain no doubt that S07 ? ie of the traditions current in this country , as to vineyards having once been profitable , are true , although others are apocryphal ; but we altogether disbeheve the statement that the wines of England were ever of good , or even tolerable , quality . " Upon all such points , we have to depend upon assertions , whose value can not now be determined , and a question like that of vineyard cultivation in England must be decided upon better grounds than tradition , and the reports of persons whose taste was wholly unlike our own . The fact evidently is , that , where nations had very bad internal communications , and slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general consumption should be made in every possible place ; especially a commodity so heavy , bulky , and difficult of transport as wine . This , we conceive , quite accounts for the numerous attempts that were formerly made to obtain wine in the north of Europe , and for what is called the success attending such endeavors . But , as communications between country and country became easy , such a necessity ceased to exist ; people 's taste , moreover , became refined , and , by degrees , all such cultivation as that of the vine , in English vineyards , was discontinued . If this was not the reason of vineyards being abandoned , we are at a loss to know what it could have been . It would hardly have been abandoned , if profitable ; and , if it was unprofitable formerly , how much more so must it be at the present day . " But it is alleged , that an ' improved climate , greater skill /z/ in cultivation , and general advancement in science , ' would cause vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerlj . May be ; not that we know any thing of the alleged improvement in climate . No one can have greater respect for the skill of English gardeners than we have ; we are perfectly ready to recognize the claims of science , and the advantages that have attended its application to rural economy ; l3ut there are things which neither horticultural skill nor science can effect : and among them is included an exercise of control over seasons . We can not raise the temperature of our summer the minutest fraction of a degree ; we can not increase the heating power of the solar rays ; we can not prolong their period of action ; in short , we can not give Kent the climate even of Normandy . And yet we must do all these things if we would grow wine as good as even that of the environs of Paris . " The fact is , that the vine can not be profitably cultivated in vineyards beyond 50*-* north latitude , and only so high as that latitude in very favorable inland situations . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . In saying this , we by no means intend to assert that , by the selection of such inferior but early varieties as the Black Cluster , or Miller 's Burgundy , ( not Black Muscadine , ) grapes can not sometimes be imperfectly ripened in vineyards in England ; no doubt they sometimes will come to that sort of maturity which persons , who do not distinguish correctly between sugar and vinegar , are accustomed to call ripeness ; as for example last year . But we have no hesitation in expressing a decided opinion that to expect a profit from ripe grapes in English vineyards , on even an average of years , is hopeless . "  --  G-ardeners ' CJironicle , 1847 , page 403 . Trowell , Chapter on the Vine , page 91 , says : " They require a light sandy ground to be planted in ; if it is a little stony , it will thrive in it , if lying to the south , or southeast , and if the bottom is chalky or gravelly under the surface , where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dry , if it /z/ is not addicted to lieatli ; but if brambles , it is a good sign . Where that shrub grows , such a ground is the most proper for a vineyard ; and the declivity of a hill still better . " Thus much for the situation and soil in the natural state . He then goes on to say : " If your land is too rich , it only permits the roots to shoot out the branches and leaves , but less fruit ; the barren does not admit the roots to be so luxuriant , neither do they enter the earth so deep , by which means they spread more towards the surface , and so give the tender fibrous roots the benefit of receiving the natural sweet and gentle showers , dews , &c.,; which imparts a pregnancy to this plant , and do receive the cherishing warmth of the sun , and is more impregnated with the volatile salts , which is drunk by the delicate pores and apertures of the latent roots , whilst those buried deeper are deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insipid leaves without fruit , and produces long and unbearing branches , whose joints admit of no produce ; whereas the other will produce fruitful joints , being very short , like to a joint of a man 's finger , which are the bearing branches . Now when you plant your vineyard , let it be east and west , for the other position , north and south , is not so good . " When you plant , dig your trench near a foot deep , and about a yard asunder , for the more ease of going between them to do the necessary work that is required in the several seasons of the year ; then set your plants ,  --  let them be about a cubit long , having three or four eyes of the young wood on them ; then plant them in the bottom of the trench , a little sloping ; when done , cover them three or four inches with the mould ; then level your ridges , that your sets may just appear above the surface ; plant your sets something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strew some of the manure along the ridges , not too thick , which will preserve them . Keep them weeded and hoed ; when they begin to shoot , then set your props , of what wood you please , of about four feet in length , and the thickness of a common broomstick , placed on the north side of the plant . " /z/ After giving directions for pruning , etc. , for the first three years , he says , at the fourth year , your " plants may be expected to bear a quantity of fruit ; then you may leave three or four shoots to each plant , with about four eyes ; but , when older , you may leave six or more from a strong root . " Now when your vineyards want amendment , as all lands will , strew some of the manure ( liveings , ) on the ridges and about the ground between the rows , in the month of November . Use no more than sixteen bushels of the manure to an acre . " Now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , you may keep them to what height you please , as the place will permit , etc . " When your vine that is planted against your walls , house , &c.,; wants refreshment , you may water it with about two quarts of the lixivium of the manure , when the vine begins to put forth ; you may do the same about midsummer , when the grapes are small ; all which invigorates the roots of your vines , and makes them yield a much greater plenty of fruit . "  --  New Treatise of Crardening , ly Samuel Troivell . London 1739 . The varieties Trowell mentions as cultivated in the vineyard are Burgundy , Champaigne , and Frontlniack , what we now know , pro1 ) ably , as the small black grapes like Miller 's Burgundy , White Sweetwater , and Frontignan . The manure spoken of here is described as a very concentrated substance , equal in strength to guano . " When a vine is to be first established on any spot wherenone grew before , the first thing is to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil might be carried away by rains in winter , or spring , terraces are formed by building massive stone walls along the slope , and levelling the soil behind them . The walls serve to reflect the heat , and form a shelter to the vine below . Thus a whole hill is sometimes covered with terraces from top to bottom , and there the wine is generally good , if the exposure is favorable . Limestone , gravel , or coarse sand , with a small mixture of clay , /z/ forms a good soil for a vine ; vegetable substances alone should be used to enrich it , such as the leaves and tendrils of the vine , the residue of the grape when pressed , and , failing these , the leaves of trees collected when green and formed into a compost with earth . The ground should be Avell trenched , if it will admit of it , or loosened with the mattock and pickaxe . The different parts of the soil should be intimately mixed , keeping some fine soil at top to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes are dug in rows four or five feet wide , at the same distance from each other , so as to alternate ; some of the finest of the soil is put into each hole , and the vine plants , which have been rooted in a nursery , or else simple cuttings , are carefully inserted , pressing the mould round the roots , and levelhng the earth . Rooted plants will bear the second or third year , but cuttings take a much longer time . The usual instrument of tillage in stony and rocky soils is a two-pronged fork fixed in a short handle , at an angle less than a right angle with the prongs , which are a foot long , and very strong , like a double pickaxe . This is struck into the ground , and then drawn towards the workman , wliile the handle is lifted , which acts as a lever in raising the soil . The next year , it is usual to prune the young vine down to one , or , at most , two eyes or buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second year , by which , although the vine will not be so forward in fruiting , it will be much strengthened , and fully repay the apparent loss of time in the end . In the third year , the vine is trained ; that is , the shoots are tied to upright stakes planted at each root , or they are laid in an arch and tied from one root to another along the ground. * " When vineyards are established in the plains , where , sometimes , as those of Medoc , they produce very good wine , the intervals between the plants can be stirred by the plough , although forking and digging by hand is more common ; hoeing /z/ is as necessary in a vineyard to destroy weeds , as it is in a field of turnips , or any other crop sown in rows . The pruning of a vine in bearing , the object of which is to produce much fruit without weakening the plant , can only be learnt by experience and practice ; much of the success of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no manure is used , except that which we mentioned before , of leaves and tendrils ; but some soils require to be recruited , and , without manure , would produce little or no wine . In this case , there is no alternative , and composts must be formed , as is done in common cultivation , with animal and vegetable substances mLxed and decomposed . Horse dung should be avoided , if possilile ; * cow dung is cooler and more nearly of a vegetable nature ; this should be mixed with as much virgin earth from pastures and meadows as can be procured , and laid in small heaps in the intervals between the rows . It may be left a little while , if it has any rank smell , and then forked in round the roots ; the more it is decomposed the better . Many a vineyard has lost its reputation after having been abundantly manured . The Johannisberg was much reduced in value , after having been dunged , while in the possession of General Kellerman . After a certain time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive from the exhaustion of the soil , as is the case when the same crops are repeatedly sown in the same ground ; this depends on the depth of the soil . All perennial plants shoot out their roots farther and farther every year in search of fresh earth , and it is by this means that trees flourish for a long time on the same spot ; but if the roots are prevented from spreading , or the plants being too crowded , their roots interfere , a diminution of vigor is the consequence . So it is with the vine . In this case , the remedy is the same as for land bearing com . A rest is necessary , together with the addition of such manures as shall restore the lost fertility . "  --  Penny Cyclopcedia. /z/ The superior quality of wines from celebrated vineyards , where , it is said , no manure is ever used , is , in some measure , owing to the limiting of the amount of fruit which a vine is allowed to mature , and to the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keeping the soil constantly worked and loose , and in harvesting the grapes , being careful not to gather any but what are perfectly ripe , and never allowing any defective berries to be put in the press ( which , in common wine-maldng , usually receives but little attention , all sound and defective often going in to the press together ) . At Johannisberg , the vineyard is surrounded by a stone wall ten feet high , thus promoting the ripening of the fruit . " Some local influences produce effects which are ahke inexplicable and inimitable . These , though generally attributed to the soil , are not always or solely owing to its composition and qualities . In. ome instances , the soil is the main cause oLdifference , as seen in the Constantia of the Cape . The climate there is most favorable to the growth of the vine ; yet , in one small space only , is a tolerable wine produced ; the two contiguous farms of the great and little Constantia yielding , the former the red sweet wine , the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is decomposed sandstone . "  --  Penny Cyclopcedia . " The Montillado , of Spain , is the produce of a white soil , containing seventy per cent , of carbonate of lime , with alumina , silica , and a little magnesia , while the Mandanilla is the produce of the red and sandy earths ; yet the wines do not greatly differ in taste or flavor . More importance is attached to the soil than it deserves ; its physical properties are of more importance than its chemical . Chaptal was clearly of this opinion , for he maintains that , provided it is porous , free , and light , its component parts are of little consequence . " Where some peculiar strong-smelling substance exists in the soil , an odor is communicated to the Avine which renders it unpleasant . This is the case when stinkstein ( a variety of sub-carbonate of Hme , called pierre puante , ) is present . /z/ Even wine tainted with this , though at first repulsive , is ultimately relished . The vine-growers of France and Portugal have so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it deteriorates the jflavor of the wine , that , in the latter country , at least in the port-yielding district of the Alto Douro , the use of manure is forljidden by law . This seems to be a prejudice , for the German cultivators manure the vines very freely , and no wines are more esteemed for bouquet than those of the Rhine , and Browner justifies the practice , not only with fresh cow dung , but with pieces of woolen cloth steeped in Hquid manure and dried , which is found greatly to augment the produce . Professor Rau bears testimony to its utility . Even the proprietors of the vineyards near Bourdeaux , which produce the highly-prized clarets , employ manure once every four or five years . But the same vines will yield a wine having very different qualities , at least as to flavor and perfume , in different seasons . " The color of any wine is not dependant on the color of the grape from which it is prepared . Champaigne is the produce of a red grape . The coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tentilla , ( the French Teintur rier , or I'Ahcant , ) which is entirely penetrated by the coloring principle . "  --  Ibid . Dr. Bushby says that in Spain they vary , as in other countries , in the practice of manuring vines . At a vineyard in the environs of Xeres , he says : " There was a dunghill of fresh horse dung collected outside the vineyard , and though we were uncertain whether we understood each other 's meaning , we supposed him to say that they manured each plant annually . " At another , he says : " The vines are regularly manured with any kind of dung , in general , strong stable dung ; not every year , because , said the vinador who accompanied us , they could not procure it . " At some vineyards , he makes no mention of the practice at all ; at some , they manure once in four or five years , and say that is often enough . /z/ In France , Dr. Busliby states the same general practice ; at some vinejards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at others , for instance , under date of Montpelier , he says : " Notwithstanding the apparent richness of the soil , I observed them every where digging in large quantities of dung , and this , as well as the mode of pruning , indicated that they were more anxious for the quantity , than the quality , of the produce . The - vines of this district are almost universally converted into brandy . " All the small proprietors manure their vines with strong stable dung ; they make no distinction , using that of horses and that of coavs . It would appear that the question , Are vineyards manured ? might be put to rest as an estalhshed fact that they are . Unquestionably , there are places where nothing but loam and vegetable substances are used for this purpose . But , from the observations of travellers , and the writings of agriculturists , and from my own observation , I have no douljt of the fact . In many of the grape countries of Europe , manure is so valuable , that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children are frequently on the lookout for the droppings from the post and other horses that may be passing by . Many a time have I seen eight or ten women , scrabbling for this purpose , come very near a pitched battle . In Switzerland , and parts of Germany , as well as in some parts of France , also , the farmers have , next the road , in front of their houses , a large hole , or tank , dug in the earth , into which is thrown the manure and all the refuse matter of every kind , solid and liquid ; the solid matter is heaped up in the middle ; the rainwater is led into this hole from the vicinity , and this liquid is carried , by women , in long buckets strapped to their backs , and spread broadcast over the land . This I have seen applied in Avet weather , not only to grass land , but to vineyards and other crops ,  --  a practice more beneficial to the land , than agreeable to the traveller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor that /z/ he could give but little manure to his vineyard , has been circulated within a few years , and is often referred to , verbally , as proof of the uselessness of the practice . The account went on to say , that , finally , having no manure at all , as the yield of the vineyard was less and less , from the constantly diminished quantity of manure given to the vines , and he becoming poorer and poorer in consequence , being almost in despair at the prospect of starvation for himself and family , the thought occurred to him that the trimmings of the vines might be of service ; accordingly , the young shoots and leaves were cut into pieces and dug into the earth . The result of this application was a fine yield of fruit . I do not question the correctness of this story : it is not improbable . But , in my estimation , it is proof of the correctness of some of my statements regarding manures , and is evidence of the importance of rich soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of the practice of manuring vineyards , for it was the deficiency of the manure which caused this vineyard to give fruit in a less quantity , when it had been accustomed to this annual stimulant . According to the story , the vines , at last , almost ceased to bear fruit ; as this occurred the year previous to the manuring the land with the trimmings of the grape , it is not unreasonable to suppose that , by this cessation , the plants were strengthened , and enabled , the coming spring , to show a good crop ; and , having been kept without any stimulant the year previous , and but little , if any , the year before that , this application , at midsummer , just at the moment when the juices being washed to the roots by the rains at this most suitable time , would have the most beneficial effect . It is , unquestionably , evidence of the value of the trimmings of the vine , but , also , at the same time , of the value of manures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good loam should be sought ; one that is readily worked , and made permeable to the effects of sun and air . If it were of a clayey nature , the incorporating of a good proportion of shells , old lime rubbish and bricks , bones , and charcoal screenings would improve /z/ it , using all , or only part of the substances , as tliey are more or less difficult to obtain . If it is intended to form a vineyard on a gravelly hill , or other spot with such soil , I would use , of these , bones and charcoal , and as much loam from an old pasture , which had been enriched for years by the droppings of sheep and cattle , as could be obtained . If none of the articles above named , for the purpose of keeping the earth loose , can be had , other , the best substitute , must be used ; vegetable mould , leaves , straw , shavings , and chips of wood , &c.,; are suitable . With regard to manures for enriching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into which should be incorporated , with reference to the ease of obtaining them , any and every article of animal or vegetable matter capable of decomposition . In applying them to the land , the condition of the soil must be taken into consideration , giving more or less according to its richness , or the reverse . The purpose for Avhich the grapes are to be grown must be considered ; if for dessert , more nourishment will be required ; if for wine , a less quantity will answer . After a vineyard has become established , ( which will be in five years , according to Chaptal , ) if manures are scarce , they may be more economically used by spreading and digging them in , when new ; but it is necessary to be cautious in applying new and raw manures to all fruit-bearing plants ; inexperienced persons should never apply any but manures from the compost heap , or that have been meliorated by age . If guano is to be used , it is safer to do so by forming a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liquid manure , it is serviceable , using four pounds , at most , to a barrel of I water . The grape vine requires from four to six months , according to the kinds , to perfect its fruit . ( See August Muscat . ) Where the season is free from severe frosts this length of time , and there are no other obstacles , as mildew , bhglit , &c.,; the vine may be cultivated . In hot climates , near the equa- /z/ tor , there is too much rain ; and , were it not for this trouble , it is not likely the vine would succeed , as it requires a season of rest , and enough of cold to cause the leaves to fall . - ' " The same latitude does not always allow the grape to ripen its fruit in an equal degree of perfection . The south of England has the same latitude with some of the vineyards on and near the Rhine which give good wine ; but the greater humidity and obscuration of the sun prevent the ripening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved that the ripening of fruits depends more on the illuminating rays than on the calorific or chemical rays . " L Planting the Vines .  --  If rooted vines are to be planted in the vineyard , this operation may be performed at the most convenient time after the fall of the leaf , and the ground is in a good working condition . It should be done with care , spreading the roots cautiously out . If scions of the vine are to be planted , and where the frosts are not very severe , they may be put , immediately on cutting , into the earth where they are to remain . If it is considered necessary to guard them , during the winter , from the frost , they should then be put into boxes with sand or coarse earth , and kept in a cool place , just above the freezing point , and then plant them out as early in the spring as possible . The system of Priming and Training the American varieties of the G-rape , in gardens on houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' require very different summer treatment from the European kinds . The system of training them which I should recommend as the best , is the one Speedily advises for espaliers . It is having eight upright canes permanently established , instead of one , as advised by myself , for the grapery . The vine is to be established in this form , by the same process as Mr. Hoare gives for his , ( see Hoare 's plan , ) and is , in fact , restoring this to its original and most judicious system . After it has once become established , the fall or winter pruning will only be to cut back the present year 's /z/ wood to the spur , leaving one or two eyes , as you may think best . This plan is illustrated by a view of some vines trained as above described , and represented as in full growth in summer . The only pruning recommended for the summer , is to stop the leading , or any other shoot , that may be growing too strong , and thereby weakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , stop the shoots by cutting or pinching off their ends . The foliage is hable to be injured by bHght in some sections of the country ; as a remedy for this evil , promote a good stock as a reserve . After the fruit is set , and is as large as peas , it will be time to tie the shoots into the trellis . In the view , it will be observed that this has upright j ) ieces three feet apart ; the shoots from the spurs can be secured to these , or hghter supports may be placed half-way between them for this purpose . A vine should be six or eight years old before it be allowed to cover so much wall as represented in the cut . The first year of bearing , these upright shoots may be pruned to about six feet , permitting them to extend themselves two feet every year , until the wall is covered . If the spurs are too close together , some of them must be pruned out , so that every spur and shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spur , when the wall is full , may be led along the top of the trellis till it has grown five or six feet , when it can be pruned back to about three feet , leaving the lateral to grow , which can be stopped , if it grows too strong , in two or three weeks ; if not , let it grow till the shoots are stopped in September . In the winter pruning , this must be cut back , as are the other shoots , to the one or two eyes . This trellis is made with three horizontal pieces of boards , two inches wide by one and a quarter thick . The first one is fifteen inches from the ground , the second in the middle , and the the 'd near the roof ; these are secured firmly , fourteen inches from the house , by board cleats , quite stout , which are nailed to the trellis and house . On these horizon- /z/ tal pieces are nailed the upright ones ; they should be one inch thick by two inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between them should be three feet from centre to centre . The lower , or horizontal limbs of the vine , must be trained to the lower horizontal strip , and the upright branches trained one to each upright piece , and well secured by tying . ( See cut . ) R. T. Underhill , M. D. , of the city of New York , has a vineyard on the Hudson , where he raises large quantities of the Isabella and Catawba for the table , which are sent to the New York market for sale . January 17th , 1842.  --  This gentleman wrote an account of his ' ineyard , for the " Orchardist 's Companion , " in which he states , " that he has been , for more than ten years , extensively engaged in the cultivation of some of our native grapes . " At this time he considered the Isabella and Catawba the preferable kinds for cultivation . Under date of February 22d , 1848 , he writes me , that he is still of this opinion , and " that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , I am not prepared to give any native vine I have ever tried , a preference over them . I have twenty acres of these grapes under successful cultivation , and am making preparation for putting out four acres more , the coming spring . I plant on the side of hills and level surfaces ; either answer equally well in this climate. * The mildew , which was , at a former period , troublesome , has , with the generally improved character and quality of the fruit , disappeared . They do not suffer from the rot , save in confined situations , during very warm , rainy seasons . My Isabella grapes , which have improved so much in quality by cultivation , during the past twelve years , mature earher , and are far less subject to injury from climate or other causes , than formerly . Indeed , an Isabella grape vineyard properly planted , with acchmated dnes , and cultivated as they should be , will , in this climate give a more certain annual crop than Indian corn . ' ' /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Underhill has more fully expressed his opinion as to the improvement in the quality of the Isabella and Catawba , which were growing in the wild state about forty years since , ( time of writing 1842 . ) He says , " the quality of my fruit has changed very much within a few years ; the clusters and berries are much larger and sweeter , the skin thinner , and the ) m7j ) has nearly disappeared . But I do not wish to be understood as conveying the idea that others , having a suitable situation , and good vines , with properly directed efforts in planting , pruning , &c.,; can not succeed in raising as fine fruit as grows upon Croton Point . " The native grapes of Massachusetts do not improve by cultivation upon removal to the garden ; the bunch and berry can be enlarged , but the strong foxy flavor still remains which renders them unsuited for the dessert . The improvement in the quality of the Isabella and Catawba , spoken of by Dr. Underhill , under his cultivation , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cropping In its wild state , this fruit would be taxed to its utmost , in its efforts to mature the abundant crop which it naturally produces , consequently , the fruit would be small , and the flavor deficient . Under cultivation , one quarter of the fruit which the vine would set , is as much as it would be allowed to mature . This would enlarge the bunch and the berry , and hasten the period of maturation , and improve the flavor . I believe it is generally admitted to be the case , with all fruit trees , that a small or limited crop , is the highest flavored . The summer of 1847 was an unpropitious one for grapes , in the open air , in Massachusetts , the fruit ripening on but very few vines . On vines exposed to the due south , where the soil was dry , or well drained , the fruit ripened when the vines were judiciously pruned , and curtailed of their overabundance of fruit ; in wet situations , it failed entirely . The effect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise , /z/ and the shoots to put forth earlj m the spring , and generally influencing the early ripening of the fruit . This fact , when acted upon , in situations where the climate is sufficiently mild , caai be made of service in lengthening the season for this fruit ; as , by planting vines in wet situations also , you will have a succession of fruit . - H. W. S. Cleveland , Esq. , of Burlington , N. J. , has a vineyard of the Isabella , and is increasing it largely . The following is Mr. Cleveland 's account of his vineyard , furnished me for publication , at my request :  --  " My vineyard comprises between two and three acres , and is situated on the south side of the Delaware River , one mile above Burlington . The land is level , and is a rich mellow loam . The vines were planted by the former proprietors of the farm , in 1840 , and I am told , by a laborer , who assisted in planting them , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the vines are now ten inches in circumference at the surface of the ground . The rows of vines are eight feet apart , and the vines sixteen feet apart in the rows . They are trained on trellises six feet high , the posts of which are eight feet apart , and the lowest slat of the trellis two feet from the ground , the next four , and the next six . Part of the trellis is made with lath , an inch thick and two inches wide , and part with No. 12 wire . The latter is decidedly best . It costs , in the first place , but half as much as the lath , will , no doubt , last much longer , makes less shade , and saves much labor of tying up the vines , as the tendrils seize upon the wires , and save the necessity of strings . My plan of training is , to lay in a shoot from each vine on each side , to meet the corresponding one from the next vine , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two more in the same way , on the next slat . These are never cut out , and the fruiting shoots are grown on this old wood , raising new ones every year , and cutting out those which have borne . I begin pruning as soon as the leaves fall , and work at it in all mild weather , through the winter . /z/ I have pruned , in every Aveek , from twentieth October till tenth March , and never have been able , with the most careful observation , to perceive any difference in the time of starting , or the vigor and health of the vine or fruit . The late pruned ones are certainly more hable to bleed , but , if the bleeding hurts them , the injury is not yet perceptible on my vines . I leave from three to five buds on my fruiting shoots , according to their strength . More than half the vines in this vineyard are Isabella , the rest are Catawba , Elsinboro , Black Madeira , Norton 's Seedhng , and one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Isabella is the most certain . The Catawba I think the finest grape , but it is much more liable to rot and mildew than the Isabella . Twenty pounds to a vine is a fair crop for either of these . The Elsinboro is very highly esteemed in this vicinity . Its size is that of a large pea , and the seeds are large , but its flavor is pleasant , the pulp melting , and it has less of the foxy flavor than any of our native grapes . The grape which I have called the Black Madeira , I am inchned to think , must be the Lenoir . A gardener , who worked for the former OAvner of my farm , told me it was ' Black Madeira , '  --  but I can find no description of such a grape , and it certainly is not ' Bland 's Madeira , ' which is but a synonyme of the Alexander . Downing 's description of the Lenoir , answers to the grape which I have called Black Madeira . It ripens a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape . Norton 's Seedling is third rate with us ; it bears well , and ripens well , but is foxy and sour . " I planted a new Aneyard last spring , ( 1847 , ) near my old one , and on a similar soil , though the ground has a very gentle slope to the southwest . Six months previously , I advertised , in our village paper , for bones and refuse animal matter of every description , which set the boys to collecting them , and before spring I had procured about three tons . I had a pit prepared , in which they were thrown , and every fresh deposit immediately covered with old sod , of which I /z/ had collected a great quantity , from along fences , &c.,; before the ground froze . The field where my vines were to be planted , had been in clover the previous year , and all the second crop of the clover had been suffered to die on the ground . As soon as the ground would do to plough , I spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evenly as possible over the ground , breaking the skulls and largest bones with a sledge . I then run a furrow across the field , as deep as the plough could go , and then another plough in the same furrow , which threw out the sub-soil to the depth of sixteen inches . The first plough then commenced a second furrow , and of course turned the slice of sward , with the bones on it , into the bottom of the first , and the second plough then threw the subsoil over it , and so on till the whole field was thus trenched . The vines were then planted in rows , six feet apart , except , that between every third and fourth row , a space of nine feet was left , to admit a cart with manure . These vines were put but six feet apart in the rows . " G-rafting Vines .  --  In December , 1843 , being about planting a quantity of foreign vines , in a green-house which was built by the former owner of the farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I could graft upon old vines . The difiiculty was in removing the old vines . I had some Isabella vines of four years old , which I had been obliged to remove the year before , and these I judged best to make the attempt with . I took twelve of them , not one of which was less than an inch in diameter , at the surface of the ground , and in taking them from the ground I used the greatest care to preserve every root . I first took a trowel and dug down beside the vine , till I came to a root , and then followed it out to its - extremity , and then went to the next root , and so on , so that I was sometimes an hour digging up a single one . I then planted them outside the house , carried the stem to the inside , under ground , sawed it off two or three inches below the surface , split the stock , and inserted two scions in each , pressed the earth as tight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them , however , were left till March before grafting , but I did not perceive any difference in their growth . As soon as the eyes had pushed enough to be tied , I pulled out the scion which had the weakest shoot , and trained the other up under the rafters . They all grew that season to the top of the roof , fourteen feet , and were there stopped . In the fall , there were ten of them which I judged to be stout enough for fruit , and I cut them down to five buds each . They bore , and ripened their fruit well , and have continued to bear , more and more , the two seasons since . I allowed one , the past season , to bear twenty pounds , which was too much , and it was not well colored . The rest bore about twelve pounds each , and ripened it well . Two of them made rather long-jointed wood the first season , and were cut down to one bud in the fall , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buds got broken off by accident , and I immediately cut off the stem , under ground , and grafted a second scion into the first . This was in June . It grew perfectly well , and has fruited for two seasons past . The kinds I engrafted were the Black Hamburgh , Victoria , Black Prince , and White Sweetwater . I have been unable to perceive any difference between the size , color , or flavor , of the fruit , from that of vines on their own stocks . " The insects which breed in our light soil , are a great trouble here . The rose-bugs attack them while in blossom , and , unless a direct attack is made upon them , they soon destroy a large crop of bloom . I have boys , with tin cups , with a little spirits of turpentine in them , who go through the vineyards every morning , during the three weeks or thereabouts , that this bug exists , collecting them into these cups , where they are instantly killed . I have been troubled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often destroys a wiole bunch , boring from one berry to another . It is a little grey maggot , about one eighth of an inch in length . In the vineyard formed last spring , I planted three thousand vines , all Isabellas . Formerly , I used to be careful in my summer /z/ pruning , l3ut , after experiment , I was convinced that the vines are best let alone , as the leaves get so much injured by storms and insects , that all that are left are needed for ripening the fruit . I therefore train up the growmg shoots to the trellis , and as the side-shoots and stragglers push out , so as to be in the way , I simply trim them off with a pair of hedge shears . " I have been carrying out the plan I told you of last fall ,  - -  the covering of the ground of my vineyard with tan , shavings , and pine leaves , and the advantages expected to be derived from it are as follows : that it will keep the weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wiU prevent the lower bunches of grapes from getting spattered with the earth , when it rains , which has always been a serious trouble when the earth was kept loose , by ploughing ; it will keep the earth cool , and prevent an early starting of the buds , which sometimes causes serious loss from late frosts ; and , lastly , I hope it may prove , in some degree , a guard against those insects which breed in the ground , and are most formidable enemies . " Horace W. S. Cleveland . Oatlands , Burlington , 1848 . In a subsequent letter , Mr. Cleveland writes : " We are daily fighting rose-bugs , which made their appearance on the twenty-fifth May , but in that part of the vineyard , the ground of which I covered , very few are yet to be found , though they have , heretofore , always been most numerous there . " The fruit in the above vineyard is grown for the dessert . The amount of twenty pounds per vine , where the plants are so wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vines seven or eight years old , of the Isabella or Catawba varieties . It is , unquestionably , a good plan to limit the plant to this quantity when young , and no one can judge so well , what a vine is capa1 ) le of producing , without injury , as the one having it in charge . Culture of the Crrape in North Carolina .  --  The following /z/ is a condensed account of the grape culture in North Carolina , originally written for the November number of De Bow 's Commercial Review , by Dr. Sidney Weller , of North Carolina : /z/ " North Carolina is ahead of all her sister states , in the wine product , by some thousands of gallons , according to the agricultural census of 1840 ; and , as far as I know , my vineyard is the largest in this state , and , I suppose , in the south , and perhaps the most productive ; since , besides entertaining hundreds of visitors , and disposing of quantities of grapes carried away , I made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of product has been , annually , for a few years past , about ten barrels . " Of our native Scuppernong , the grape for the south , I make wines that readily bring me , in different markets , $1 to $4 per gallon , according to quality . " Encouraged by patronage , I have , for years past , cultivated the choicest varieties , ( selected from every part of our country , ) in the nursery to be well rooted , and ready for market ; and more of the Scuppernong than any other variety , not only as the best southern grape , all things considered , but that it can not be propagated , successfully , by cuttings , but by layers , or grafting . " I started with a pretty large number of Scuppernong , and other native cuttings  --  of the Scuppernong mostly . The cuttings of this grape all put out in the spring , but , as usual with them , they all died in the summer . It is best for the American vintner to start his vineyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuttings , or from layers . Even in grafting , it is better to begin in the nursery , and tranfer into the vineyard , after a year 's growth ; this is a common method with me ; though I have a very pretty portion of vineyard acquired by searching the woods , late in the spring , when vines are in the leaf , and getting stocks of the Fox , and other common kinds , an inch or upwards in diameter , grafting them , wedge-fashion , and then transplanting , ten feet /z/ each way . The scions ( having been kept back , in a cool place , from sprouting , ) were Weller 's Halifax and Norton 's Virginia Seedhng . Thej are kinds I esteem next to the Scuppernong , as free from the propensity to rot , and in other respects good . " It is the uniform result of long experience , that , if grafting is effected on stocks procured or dug up from the woods , success , with due pains-taking , will surely follow , if done at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until late in spring , or even summer , when the scion can be kept back from sprouting . But if the graft be on stocks not dug up , or stands where it is to remain , it must be done in the fall , or early part of winter , to insure success . In this way , I readily changed my foreign , and other rotting kinds , into unexceptionable native varieties . No clay , or any other covering of the grafted part , is necessary in grafting grape vines even with the ground . All that is to be done , is to saw off your stock and put in your scion , ( with two or three buds thereon , ) wedge-fashion , as in cleft-grafting fruit trees , and then draw earth around a few inches high , leaving one or two buds above ground ; or , where the stock is very large , and inconvenient to split , I have made a gimlet hole , and inserted the scion , spoil-fashion , and then drawn the earth around . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble and attention is required in the grafting process , to pull off sprouts from the old stock , as they spring forth to rob the graft , than in the process itself ; and this is far more the case in grafting to stocks standing in their original place , than in those procured from the woods . To compensate for this , however , the growth from the former is much greater than from the latter , viz : eight or ten feet a season , in the one case , but thirty feet , not uncommonly , in the other . Grafts often bear some fine clusters the first season of growth , and pretty considerably the second . " Mr. Weller is of the opinion , " that , while American vineyards far ex- /z/ ceed European iu yield , yet they fall far short in strength of the juice yielded , and therefore corresponding keeping ingredients must be used . " He is in the habit of adding " a plenty of sugar , or brandy , or both , " with these ingredients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly unripe ; this is what he says of it : " made , September seventeenth , thirty-three gallons , composed as follows  --  of five bushels of White Scuppernong grapes , half green ones , two bushels of Purple Scuppernong , two and a half bushels of common or bunch grapes of the woods ; fermented , after mashing ( with a machine of two wooden rollers , ) two hours ; juice strained through folds of a woolen blanket , as it run from the press ; twenty pounds of common brown sugar then added , and eight gallons of good apple brandy , and turned into a new cask , fumigated with a sulphur match . " This wine " sold readily , after being racked off , for two dollars a gallon , under the name of Weller 's Scuppernong Champaigne . " He further says of the quality : " my wine , with no other ingredient than sugar , or pure spirit , ever added , circulated in this region , and other parts of our country , is pronounced by the best judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than any foreign . Persons in delicate health have found essential benefit from its use ; and , I add , that the wine made with pure spirits , as a medicated medicine , is more generally approved , than that made with sugar . " " Mr. Weller 's plan of planting and training has been , to plant the vines , the Scuppernong , twenty feet apart , and other kinds , ten ; " to lead them up on posts , six or eight feet high , and then sideways , on trellises and scaffolding , so that , at length , underneath the canopies , nothing is to be seen , for six or eight feet from the ground , but the main vine stems and supportmg posts . " He adds : " but I now consider twenty feet too near , for the Scuppernongs , thirty or forty being better , unless it is intended to remove every other one , before they become too large . " He saves all the leaves of the vines , and digs them into the vineyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true American system of training the vine . The principle of allowing the vine to spread and range freely , during summer , is , undoubtedly , correct , as applied to the American species , and it is what I have recommended for many years . But the system of training up the vine by posts , and then spreading them on flat framework , six or eight feet high from the earth , is as much a European plan as the training of them to sticks , &c.; I have seen many vineyards thus trained , in Italy , and other countries. * In speaking of the great size of the vine , he says : " I measured to-day , a Scuppernong , fourteen years old from planting , and it covers an area whose diameter is fifty feet . Another runs thirty feet on scaffolding , and then ascends an aspen tree , spreading over its branches to the height of about forty feet ; the tree full of grapes . A vine in the lower part of this state , near the Scuppernong Island , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produces its annual yield of five barrels of wine , I am most credibly informed . " The berries of this grape are very large . I have frequently measured selected ones , and found them to be three and a half , and some few , four inches round . They are more easily gathered than other kinds . A large sheet , with poles fastened to two sides , is held under the canopy , and a third person shakes the canopy above , with a forked pole , and all the ripe grapes fall into the sheet , and the green ones remain on . They are ripening here about two months ; and that period ensures successive gatherings , and the most delicious of grape fruit . It is a peculiarly southern grape ; and for the south it is , doubtless , the best grape in the world , considered in all respects . I learn this grape does well everywhere * " The vineyards are much more beautiful than the German fields of stakes . The vines grow over a frame , higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stone pillars . They interlace and form a complete leafy screen , while the clusters hang below . "  --  Page 237 . This was on the Italian side of the Alps . Views A-Foot , by J. Bayard Taylor . New York , 184 ; . /z/ south of latitude 37 " N. , when properly managed , and this is , to trim enough , in the first stages of its growth , to prevent its becoming bushy , and afterwards , ( say fifty years , or no telling how long a vine will flourish , ) to keep , by scaffolding , the canopies clear underneath of all straggling or hanging down branches , six or eight feet high . This being not done , the vines will surely fail to bear well , and to have the fruit in perfection . " My Hahfax , I estimate next to the Scuppernong grape . It runs or spreads to a great extent . From my study , I see the top of an apple tree covered with fine large clusters , and by measurement , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant from where the main stem of the vine stands , to the ground , and the tree is twenty feet high . The berry is as large as a common bullet , and the clusters of uncommon size . It changes its color to a bright purple , long before it ripens , and is a good table grape . The Norton Virginia Seedhng , next in excellence , is a good eating grape , or for wine , as soon as it changes to a dark purple . " Grapes for Cultivation at the South .  --  Of one hundred and fifty varieties of grapes , I have not more than about twenty I consider good and unexceptionable in all respects , for Amerieafi culture . My foreign grapes , after trial , I cut down as worthless , and of some , even noted natives , I cut down all but a few , and grafted other kinds upon their stocks . Of the Catawba , Isabella , Herbemont 's Madeira , and the Ohio , or Segar Box , and others , I retained a few as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot , which is about one season in three , with me ; though I see , from the Patent Office report , that the Isabella and Catawba are not so prone to rot in the state of Ohio , and that , more northerly , they are still less prone . The rot is a grand difficulty at the south , owing , I suppose , to the heat of the climate , and the vines prone to it , are worse , in this respect , by age . This season has been uncommonly fatal to the kinds in question . Till a few days past , we have had rain continued for two /z/ weeks ; even some grapes in the woods rotted . But , to close this essay , I will briefly report those varieties , in my vineyards , rotting and not rotting . The Isabella , Catawba , Herbemont 's Madeira , Longworth 's Ohio , Elsinburgh , Norton 's Large Purple , and a number of other kinds , pretty much all rotted , some others , about half . The Vine Arbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed of the Halifax , a most excellent grape , ) Brinkleyville , and a few others ; some few rotted on part of the vines . The kinds least prone to rot , are Scuppernong , Weller 's Halifax , Norton 's Virginia Seedling , Lenoir , North Carolina , Hunterville , Franklin , and some other varieties , good in every respect , and none of which rotted this season . " Sidney Weller . BrinkleyviUe , Halifax County , North Carolina . It is only by such tests as the above , that the grapes which are suitable for a certain climate , can be ascertained . It appears that the Scuppernong is the most valuable for the south ,  --  this is of no value whatever , at the north , being more tender than the foreign kinds . In Massachusetts , thus far , the Isabella is the only kind that has really done well in all situations ; at the south , this rots badly . The Syrian , Portion Noir , White Nice , Muscat of Alexandria , and Verdelho , varieties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other sorts , should be tried at the south , as well as the kinds which ripen early . Tliis difference may cause some of them to escape damage , from heavy rains , or other evils . The cluster grapes , as Black July , Miller 's Burgundy , Pitmaston , and others , are more liable to suffer from the rot than the loose growing kinds . Training them high , as in Italy , from tree to tree , may be the means of preserving them from the rot and blight . If this plan is tried , plant the vine at a distance from the tree , so that the roots of the two may not interfere . The vines may be trained , the two or three first years , to a pole in the earth , and thence carried by a cord , ( or any other way that may recommend itself , ) to /z/ the tree ; thence up the trunk , and around the three sides , resting upon a limb , over to the second tree , and there secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees ; the spur-pruning of this is advised . Another plan of training is , to let the vine run up a single tree , and branch off among the limbs which may be well thinned of its branches , to admit the sun and air , and the vine can be pruned so as to be kept within reach . prevent the in Grayes.  --  By a Jerseyman . Dear sir ,  --  You will , probably , call to mind a conversation between us , when I was at Newburgh , in 1846 . I laid before you an account of the disease which had then made its appearance in our native grapes ,  --  the Isabella and Catawba . It commences about the first of July , in the form of a dark spot upon a few berries . These , afterwards , become entirely spoiled by the disease ; and this rot spreads , from berry to berry , till a large part of the bunch , or , in many cases , whole bunches , are entirely spoiled by it . Wet seasons , unsuitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but , as yet , to my mind , no satisfactory explanation has been given . " You advised me , at that time , to apply sulphur and lime in the form of gypsum , or common ground plaster of Paris ; and you also advised me to use the leaves and prunings of the vines for manure . " This is the second season of my trying your advice ; and , as I received it with the promise of making known the results , I accordingly send you a brief statement , which , I think , proves that the advice was good . " I have about twenty vines of the Isabella and Catawba grape , in a full-bearing state , trained on upright trellises . In the month of June , ( latter part , ) 1846 , at the time I made the summer pruning of the vines ,  --  cutting off the side shoots , two joints above the fruit ,  --  I opened shallow trenches , say four or five inches deep , at the roots of the vines to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves and young /z/ stems cut off , were laid in these trenches , sprinkled with sufficient gypsum or plaster , to whiten the foliage , ( from a pint to a quart per plant , ) and the whole trodden doAvn and buried in the trench . " As soon as the leaves fell in the autumn , I repeated the process ,  --  raking up the leaves and burying them around the roots of the vines , after dusting them over with plaster , as before . " In June , 1848 , the present season , I repeated the same operation at the summer pruning . " Now the result is as follows :  --  " Although the season is remarkable for the prevalence of the rot , not a berry on any of these six vines , so treated , is affected ; the crop being , on the contrary , very good ,  --  the fruit large , and increasing in size . The vines , too , are remarkably healthy and vigorous . " On the other hand , the remaining vines , fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  some of them very badly ; and , even on those least affected , ten per cent , of the berries are destroyed by this disease . " I can not , therefore , escape the conviction , that the treatment you proposed has , so far , been effectual , in preventing this disease . " I ought to add , that the vines of my neighbors , generally , are much affected by the rot , this season , and that I have seen no Isabellas or Catawbas , this season , that surpass , in appearance , those on the six vines alluded to you . " The ' rot ' is a disease that has only appeared within five years , in this part of the country . At the south , I am told , it has always existed . On the Ohio , as I gather from Mr. Longworth 's remarks , in your journal , it is quite troublesome in the vineyards ; and it appears to be on the increase , through the country generally . A remedy for this disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send you the above remarks , for publication , if you deem them worthy . Your friend , A Jekseyman . " August , 1848. /z/  --  We thank a ' Jerseyman , ' for his account of the , apparently , quite successful experiment . Our advice was based on two considerations ; in the first place , we supposed that the rot might be owing to the want of some inorganic substance in the soil , necessary for the perfect maturation of the grape ; and , secondly , perhaps , to the use of crude animal manures . As sulphur and lime are large constituents of those volcanic soils abroad , where the grape thrives best , we recommended the use of a common substance  --  gypsum  - -  likely to supply them ; and as the foliage and shoots of the vine are well known to afford the most perfect food for the growth of that plant , we recommended the use of the prunings and fallen leaves , buried in the soil , for manure . " It is worth while , now , to repeat the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , accordingly , recommend it again to the vine-dressers on the Ohio , with a similar request for a statement , when they are ready to ' report progress . '  --  Editor of the Horticulturist . " Vol. 3 , p. 121 . I have never had the rot attack a grape in the open air . In the grapery with too much dampness , or in very wet weather , it sometimes appears , and is easily checked by fires , drying the air of the house . It shows itself first on the White Frontignan , in small brown dots , very minute ; they soon spread and meet ; a break in the skin follows ; the berry then soon rots , affects its neighbor , and more or less or the whole of the bunch is destroyed . Excess of moisture at the root will promote if not produce it . If it is prevented by the application , as stated in the communication above , it must be a different disease from that I am acquainted with . Mr. Downing says , " sulphur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the grape thrives best ; " but I have always understood , that , if the weather was too wet , even in those countries , they suffered from this evil , particularly when the wet weather came when the fruit was ripening , or ripe . /z/ Indiana Cultivation .  --  Mr. Jolm Davis , of Indiana , ten miles from Louisville , Kentucky , in 1842 , had a vineyard of seven acres , but , at that time , one and a half acres only of it was in bearing . The vines were planted in rows , six feet apart , and three feet from each other in the rows . The editors of the Louisville papers say , that , in September , the vines in bearing , presented the appearance of almost " solid walls of fruit . " Presuming that the information , from this vineyard , would be valuable , as detailing the result of several years ' experience , in comparatively a new section of grape-growing , in this country , I addressed , the past spring , a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired statements , ) to the proprietor of the place . The letter Avas received by the owner of the vineyard , Mr. Amos Goodwin , who , in the best spirit , gave me all the desired answers . The most of his letter is published in his oayu words , as follows :  --  " I have about eight acres in cultivation ; the vines are planted in rows , about six feet apart , and at the distance of four feet in the rows . Mj system of pruning consists simply in shortening in the wood of the past year 's growth , from one to a dozen eyes , according to the condition of the vine , and afterwards tying up the new growth to the trelhs , from time to time , as it may seem to require support . Stout stakes , about five and a half feet high , with narrow strips of board nailed on them , constitute the best trellis . I tried Avire , but the sun heated it to such an extent , that it killed the tendrils of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My grapes are principally Catawba ; I have a few of the Isabella , but do not use them for wine . The Catawba , as a wine grape , has , in my opinion , no equal among grapes that can be successfully cultivated in our climate . " We have , occasionally , had the leaves of our vines eaten in places , by an insect , but never to an extent sufficient to be injurious . The rot is the great enemy we have to contend with ; some seasons , twenty gallons of wine per acre , can /z/ hardly be realized from our vineyards , in consequence of it . I have noticed , that , whenever wheat is injured by the rust , the grape is , to a proportionate extent , affected by the rot . They , doubtless , originate from a common cause . As to what that cause is , great diversity of opinion exists . My observation does not enable me to give , with confidence , any opinion on the subject . The young shoots , in spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fact is now beginning to be understood by our farmers , and the highest ground is selected , for both vineyards and orchards . " I have never tried any of the foreign varieties , Mr. Longworth 's experience having satisfied me , that it would be but a waste of time and money . " There are a considerable number of vineyards in our county ,  --  I can not , of course , speak with entire accuracy ,  - -  but I think I can not be far wrong , in estimating the quantity of land devoted , at present , to the culture of the grape , in this county , at from one hundred to one hundred and twenty acres . In this estimate , I do not mean to include small portions grown merely for family use , but vineyards intended for the manufacture of wine . This quantity will , probably , be doubled in the course of two years more . The vineyards on the hills seem to do much better than those immediately on the river- In the rich , alluvial bottoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotting . " With regard to the profit , a careful cultivator may safely calculate on two hundred gallons of wine per acre , one year with another ; he may , with as much certainty , calculate on selhng the juice at the press , at from sixty to eighty cents per gallon , making the proceeds , per acre , from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and sixty dollars . The same labor that will cultivate twenty acres of corn , will sufiice for ten acres of grapes . The twenty acres of corn , when gathered , may , at the best prices and best crops , be worth two hundred and fifty dollars ; the ten acres of grapes , from twelve hundred to sixteen hundred dollars . This , however , /z/ can not be expected to last long ; as vineyards increase , and they are doing so rapidly , the price of Avine must come down ; it can be manufactured and sold at fifteen cents per bottle , and then pay the producer better than any other crop he can raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , in my judgment , to the best European brands . I do not manufacture my own wine , but sell the juice to the vintners . " Amos Goodwin . Near Charlestown , Clark County , Indiaiia , 1848 . In a subsequent letter from this gentleman , dated in June , he says , " our grape crop looks remarkably well this season ; the most trying time , however , is yet to come , from the middle of July to the period of ripening . " " Permit me to describe a method of grafting the grape upon old roots , that I have never seen in print . Cut the old root off , some two inches below the ground , by a horizontal cut ; then choose a gimlet just the size of the scion to be inserted , and bore from one to three or four holes , according to the size of the root , and insert the scions , first removing the loose bark ; the holes should be two or three inches in depth , and the scions should fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old kinds may thus be changed in two years . If the operation is performed so late in the season , that the root shows a disposition to bleed , grafting cement must be used . The holes should be in the direction of the grain of the wood . I have never known this method fail , and I have never succeeded with any other , though I have frequently tried both cleft and split grafting . " Amos Goodwin . Mr. Charles E. Grant , of Roxbury , who has produced very beautiful Isabella grapes , informs me , that the vine which bore them , is situated at the south of his house , and is trained on a treUis . The soil is that thrown out by digging for the v /z/ cellar , previous to building the house ; it is a clayey loam ; this was enriched by the addition of stable manure , old leather , &c.,; and , immediately under where the vine Avas plantedj about ten pounds of glue , which had beem damaged , was placed , and covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting away , freely , the bunches , and thinning the berries also . The spur-pruning is followed . The following account of the vineyards in Pennsylvania was furnished me , at my request , by H. W. S. Cleveland , Esq. , who obtained the information from the best authority , one of the largest cultivators of Reading :  --  " O n the mou ntains in the vicinity of Reading , Pennsylvania , the grape is extensively cultivated by the German inhabitants . I am told , there are about one hundred and forty acres planted with vines , in that neighborhood ; some of the vineyards are fifteen years old . The soil is a red slate ; limestone soils are avoided , as , they say , the grapes on such soils , are more apt to mildew , and do not ripen so well . This , I have been assured of , by men of much experience in vineyard culture , and it certainly is a very important fact , if it is a fact . The aspect is the southern side of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting , the land is trenched , by running three ploughs , successively , in the same furrow . The rows of vines are five feet apart , and the vines six feet in the rows . The vines are trained to stakes , five or six feet high , and are cut close to the surface of the ground , raising new shoots from the stump , every year for fruit , which are left two or three feet long , and then cut ojGF at the stump , after fruiting . They prune any time between the fall of the leaf and first of March . The only grapes cultivated , are the Isalella and Catawba . Till within a foAV years past , they have only used the grapes for wine , which is universally drank by the Germans in that vicinity , and sells readily , at Avholesale , for seventy-five cents the gallon . They calculate that twelve pounds of grapes will make a gallon of wine , and /z/ an average yield will give twenty barrels per acre . No spirit or sugar is added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the pure fermented juice of the grape . ' ithin a few years , some of the cultivators have begun sending the grapes to Philadelphia , for the table , where they sell them , at wholesale , for eight cents per pound . They are packed in boxes holding one hundred pounds and upwards , with alternate layers of grape leaves , and are sent by railroad , fifty or sixty miles . " Horace " VV . S. Cleveland . Propagating Vines for Planting .  --  The custom of planting cuttings , immediately in the vineyard rows , where they are to remain , has been , heretofore , the practice , and is still so , in most countries ; the cutting consisting of well-ripened wood of the current season , with a small part of the old , or two yeais wood , the form being that of a small mallet . The wood of the vine roots freely , and cuttings of one season , if well ripened , I have always found to grow . The best method of raising vines , is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch of wood on each side of the eye . This method requires a bottom heat , to meet with good success. * The cuttings of my vines , which are made at the autumn pruning , I usually mix with the leaves , manure , and litter , with which the border is covered , and they , though placed there as manure , root freely , and we are constantly weeding them up , during summer . It is said that the Scuppernong , and some other kinds of American grapes , do not do well from cuttings . With such varieties , the process of layering must be resorted to , and , to make the most of the cane , in this case , the shoot to be layered , should be cut between each eye , obliquely , two-thirds through the wood , and a piece of shell , or glass , or hard wood , put in the cut , to prevent its closing . Roots will be thus readily made , and the vines may be taken oflf , and planted out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's directions , for this plan of growing vines . /z/ This drawing represents a vine after it has become established in the grapery , and has been planted six or more years , and has been pruned agreeably to the plan which I have adopted , and described , pages 85 to 99 , inclusive . The lateral shoots , which proceed from every leaf , or eye , on the current year 's wood , are not represented . /z/ Ho are 's Plan .  --  After planting , the vine must be cut back to two eyes . The first year , if more than two shoots push , rub the others off , and train the two shoots to the trelhs . As soon as it appears probable , that no accident will happen to the strongest of these shoots , cut out the other ; this will be about the first of July ; continue to secure the shoot to the trellis , from time to time , as it grows , pruning in the laterals , to one eye . In November , cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , train exactly in the same manner , and if any fruit appear , take it off . Early in November , cut the vine down to three eyes , thus : The third year , train up the three shoots , and rub out all others ; in July , prune out the weakest one ; stop all laterals as before ; continue to train the other two carefully , during the season . About the first of September , pinch off the ends of the shoots . In November , cut back the two shoots to seven buds each , and prune out , carefully , all the laterals , close to the buds . The fourth year , early in February , cut out of each shoot , the first , second , fourth , fifth , and sixth buds ; then bend the /z/ two shoots carefully down , and secure them in a horizontal position , thus :  --  Train the shoots that push from the eyes , three and seven , in the manner indicated by the dotted lines , and if more fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut it off after the berries have set ; the same treatment of the vine is to be pursued , during the season , as last year . In September , stop the top of the shoots . In October , as soon as the fruit is gathered , cut back the first and third shoots , to as many buds as may be deemed necessary to produce the quantity of fruit which the vine can muture , the next year , and the second and fourth shoots , to the lowermost bud , each ; cut out the lateral shoots close to the buds . The fifth year , train the two canes in the manner represented on the next page ; and the two shoots , which will push from the spurs H , H , train also in the same way . The vine has now assumed the form which it is permanently to retain , and it may be considered as the commencement of a system of alternately fruiting two shoots , and of training two , at full length , for bearing wood to fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without alteration , until the vine is able to mature more fruit , when the arms may be extended , and as many more upright or bearing canes added , as are required . This plan may do for the Isabella , or other native kinds ; /z/ it might answer on the back trellis of a house , but , for the roof , it would not succeed so well , as the shoots would occupy too much space . /z/ It is liable to the same objections that all the long cane systems of training are. * * Extracts from a Journal of a Horticultural Tour . By a Deputation of the Caledonian Horticultural Society , lol7- Edinburgh , 1823 :  --  Ghent , seat of the Baron de Vrocylande . " There are two small vineries , which did not afford lis much satisfaction . The - ines are planted in front , on the outside of the house . Every 3'ear , a new set of wood is taken into the vinery ; the wood produced this 3'ear , is trained upright , on an exterior trellis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloping trellis , and made to jield its fruit within the house . " The wood which has once been forced , is cut entirely out ; and from the same roots , new upright shoots are , annually , required . The shoots which had ben forced , still remained , and a bare inspection was sufficient to satisfy any one , that they could have afforded but very few grapes . The exterior , upright shoots , of this season , were , at the same time , in a very backward state , and there was ( sixteenth August , ) little prospect of their acquiring maturity this year . " The natural soil of the garden is represented as light and sandy ; but no mention is made of the border for the vines . At the seat of Madame Vilain Quatorze , also , at Ghent , the same method of forcing the grape is pursued , and the result is , sickly and weak vines . At Brussels also , they found similar training and pruning , and with no better success . This plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , where this is adopted and continued for many years , the effect must be to weaken the vine . /z/ The long , or succession mode of pruning , is recommended by Mr. Loudon , and many others . It is thus :  --  The first year , one shoot only is allowed to grow , which is cut down , at the autumn pruning , to the second or third eye . The second year , two shoots are encouraged , the strongest of which must be stopped three or four buds beyond the middle of the roof , the weaker one after growing three or four feet . At the fall of the leaf , the shoots are to be reduced ; the main one must be pruned back to the middle of the roof , and the lower one to the third eye . The tJiird year , one leading shoot is to be trained in from each cane , and , from the main cane , fruit-bearing side shoots will be produced ; one bunch only on a shoot should be retained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No side shoots should be allowed to grow from the spur or cane which was cut back , the leading shoot from which is to become a fruit-bearing cane the next year . In November , the shoot from the end of the fruit-bearing cane must be cut at the top of the rafters , or within a foot of the top , and the shoot from the spur must be pruned back to the middle of the rafter , and all the spurs that bore the fruit must be pruned out . The fourth year , a crop will be produced , both in the upper and lower part of the house , the long cane-bearing on the upper part , and the shorter on its whole length ; a leading shoot must be trained from the short cane , and another , a new cane , from a spur below . In pruning , at the fall of the leaf , the long cane must be taken entirely away , and replaced by the cane that bore the fruit on the lower part ; the spurs on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and the new cane brought up this year , must be cut back to the middle of the rafters ; a spur must be left below , to lead up a new cane from , the next year . By this system , you have the whole length of rafters fruited by two canes , and a third one is to be growing for the next /z/ year , to supply the place of the one which is to be cut out at the fall pruning . This is , unquestionably , the best system of pruning , on the long cane principle , and it is explained here by a representation of the vine in the successive years . a , is the vine after planting . b , is the vine cut back , at the close of the first year of growth . c , is the vine cut back , at the close of the second year . d , is the vine as it will be , after pruning , at the end of the third year . e , shows the vine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruiting the ne.xt year ; every successive year , the long shoot must be cut out , and its place supplied , as above directed . Another system , practised in this country , is , to train a new cane , every year , the whole length of the rafter , to fruit the successive season ; the cane , which bore the fruit , being pruned back to one eye , in November . This is more simple than the former plan ; but an objection to this , and all other long cane pruning and training is , that it requires the vine to produce and ripen a large crop of fruit , and a great extent of wood also , every year . The result of this plan would be , that , in a few years , the vine would evidently be less and less vigorous , and the new cane would be constantly growing smaller , until the vine would not bear any fruit , when a year of rest would be required to enable it to ripen a crop again . /z/ By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , if it is true , that large bunches are not so good as smaller ones , ( which I hold to be the fact , ) then there is no advantage in this . There is no difficulty in having a great abundance of fruit show itself , under any judicious pruning ; the only fear is , that you will leave more on the vine than can be ripened properly , and this risk is increased by having very large bunches . Another plan is , to have one long cane the length required , and to be spur-pruned , as recommended as the best system of pruning , diffisring from that , however , in the cutting of the spur clean out , at the fall pruning , and not at one eye , as there directed . The reason for preferring to cut at one eye is , that , at the base or crown of the spur , are a large number of dormant eyes , which will all , or a great many of them , push when close pruning is practised ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trouble of rubbing out these is considerable ; but when one eye on the spur pushes , it will prevent these from growing ; and if , at any time , the eye , from injury , does not push , then the dormant eyes will , and you can retain a shoot , and when this system of pruning has been carried out many years , and the spur becomes too long for convenience , or unsightly , then you can train one of the shoots that are constantly pushing on the bare wood of the spur , and prune back on that , in the autumn , to one eye . Another plan of spur-pruning , which is recommended to be practised , when the object desired is to grow large bunches , and the regularity and neatness of the vine are not considered , is to prime the shoot at any length , cutting so as to leave a full , strong eye at the end , for fruiting ; all the intervening eyes , excepting the one at the base , are to be pruned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next season , and is to be pruned , at the autumn trimming , at the prominent eye ; the shoot which has fruited , and all the back wood on the spur , should be cut out entirely . /z/ Still another method of spur-pruning , when the object is large bunches , as above , is to have four or five spurs only , on each side of the cane , fruiting , each year , the alternate spur ; the cane on every other spur is to be pruned back to one eye , and the alternate cane to two or three feet , and five or six bunches allowed to ripen on each ; the cane which ripened the crop the first year , must now , at the fall pruning , be cut back to one eye , and the cane which is to fruit the coming season , should be pruned to two or three feet . These are several of the most approved and generally adopted systems of training the grape . Whatever method is used , should be persevered in for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the result will be unsatisfactory . If the border has been well made , and the vines have never been over-cropped , and the temperature of the house , with the thinning of the berries , and summer pruning of the shoots , have been properly attended to , crops of fine grapes can be had from vines pruned in any of the methods described . The plan recommended and adopted by myself , is considered the most simple , and a , are the fruiting spurs . b , the spurs on which the shoots are growing for the next year . the one taxmg the vine the least of any to ripen additional /z/ ; it is easily kept - within narrow limits , giving ample room for the light to be admitted . In the best vineyards , where the richest wines are made , they limit the crop a plant may bear to a small number of bunches , usually from eight to twenty-five in number , and in weight to from ten to twenty pounds ; in some parts of France , where they plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Xeres , in Spain , the sherry wine district , two or three mother branches are trained up with one spur on each to fruit , and the vines are planted five feet apart each way . The crop is limited to eight or nine bunches , weighing about fourteen or sixteen pounds . At other vineyards in Spain , where poor wines are made , the vine is allowed to bear twenty-five or thirty pounds . In the vicinity of Malaga , where the Muscat of Alexandria grape is grown for the purpose of making raisins , they prune close to the old wood every autumn , and the plant is kept close to the surface of the soil , which is a rotten slate ; the shoots are not tied up , but hang , or lie upon the earth . The fruit also lies on the ground , and , if it were not so gravelly , it would rot ; the average yield , per vine , here , is from seven to fifteen pounds ; this grape makes the best , or Muscadel raisin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an inferior kind , and the grape of commerce a still more ordinary one ; these are grown in the interior , and the vines are allowed to ripen from ten to twenty-five pounds . Near Perpignan , in France , the vine is trimmed at about six inches from the ground ; from the spurs , at this height , the bearing shoots proceed , and are not supported at all ; the close spur-pruning is followed ; from three to eight spurs are allowed on a vine , according to its age and strength . Near Marseilles , they sometimes prune to three eyes on a spur , and each vine is allowed to bear from eight to twelve bunches , or from twelve to twenty pounds . At the vineyards that produce the fine wine called Hermitage , the plants are only two and a half feet apart , and are two feet high , supported with stakes five feet long ; only one /z/ branch is allowed to fruit , and this is pruned back to from three to eight ejes , and from eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vineyards which produce the Burgundy wine , the plants are grown yet closer together . The rows of vines are only two and a half feet apart , and the plants in the rows are only twelve or fifteen inches . After the vines have been three years planted , the space between the rows is filled up with vines , making the distance between the plants only fifteen inches . At the vineyards of Epernay and Ay , where the Champaigne wine is made , the vines are , in the rows , planted as near together as six or seven inches , and the distance between the rows is only eight or nine . Of course , the vines are feeble , and produce but a small quantity of fruit each ; the shoots are also very small and weak , but the vines being so close together , the general aggregate of fruit produced is large . At the vineyards on the banks of the Rhine , the vines are supported by stakes five or six feet long ; this is the case , generally , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually adopted . In Italy , also , the same system is generally employed . In this , and other countries , I have seen the table , or flat trellis used .  --  ( See note to North Carolina system . ) By the road sides , the long cane-pruning is practised in the following manner :  --  A vine is trained up the trunk of a tree , and , at the height of twelve or fifteen feet , a long cane of the vine is led from this tree to another , and secured ; these canes , hanging in festoons , present a beautiful appearance when the fruit is in perfection. * In the Azores , the vines are not supported by stakes ; usually , a small pile of stones encircle the plant , and the bearing * " As we advanced , the houses became more Italian-like ,  --  and the vines , heavy with ripening grapes , hung from bough to bough , through the mulberry orchards . " Page 239 . " The vines which hung from tree to tree , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which the children of Israel bore on staves , from the Promised Land . "  --  Page 276 . Views A-Foot , by J. Bayard Taylor . New York , /z/ shoots lay on these . The Muscats , and other choice kinds , which are grown expressly for the table , are generally trained upon a trellis . At Pico , where the wine exported from Fayal is made , the vine is trained on the surface of the soil , ( which is mostly volcanic rock , ) betAveen walls composed of stone , or lava ; and between these , cross-walls are frequently interspersed , to break the force of the winds , intersecting the vineyards in the same form as a window-sash . At Madeira , a similar method is pursued . Vines , in the open air , are more free from mildew when trained quite high or very low . In villages on the continent of Europe , it is common to see , in the principal streets , the vine trained on the houses , above the lower windows , about twelve feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus produced at little expense ; the roots running under the pavement of the street . The kinds grown are usually the small black sorts , similar to the Early Black July , and Miller 's Burgundy . They are trained to suit the taste or convenience of the cultivator . The following method is frequently met with :  --  The leading shoot , after the vine has become established , should be treated as directed in the rules for the management of the American grape . /z/ The pruning is on the short-spur system. * It should be borne in mind , that the larger the crop a vine is allowed to bear , the longer will be the time required to mature the fruit , and the quality of which will also be deteriorated in proportion to its amount . The native varieties of the grape , when planted in a soil naturally dry and suitable , will do well without a prepared border ; but , as a general rule , it must be remembered that the more care there is bestowed on the preparation of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Hamburgh grape , when well cultivated , is a richer fruit in this climate than in that of England , and it is necessary to test the quality of the foreign kinds here , as the experience of European cultivators does not always coincide with our own.f *In the Journal of Horticultural Tour , Edinburgh , 1823 , is the following :  --  " Grape vines are likewise , commonly trained against the walls of the houses , in the outskirts of the town , ( Rotterdam , ) and we were assured , that they often prove very productive . A long shed , extending two hundred feet , was thickly clothed with vine branches , which were tolerably well filled with fruit . There were , in all , six plants , which grew in the open area , next the street ; we observed both White and Black grapes ; the latter were the more numerous , the Frankendale. " t Dr. Lindiey , after some remarks relative to fruits of American origin , in which he states their ' ' utter worthlessness in England , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this language :  --  " They can only be disappointed so long as the mean of the hottest month is 40 ' in London , and 70 ' in New York . "  --  Gardeners ' Chronicle , 1848 , p. 3L By the aboe remarks , it would seem that Dr. Lindiey attributes all this difference in the quality of fruits , to the diminished quantity of heat ; doubtless , in this difference of heat , he means to include also the effect of the relative proportion of diminished light from the sun , which is , in part , the cause of this lower temperature . But these circumstances will not always explain the causes of these differences in the goodness of fruits . For instance , the Black Hamburgh grape can not well be surpassed in richness of cjuality , when well grown , in this country . It is generally spoken of as a very desirable kind to cultivate , on account of its hardiness and good bearing qualities , and not of its being any thing more than a good grape , " though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often used respecting it , in England . The Esperione is there spoken of as but little inferior to the Hamburgh . Li Massachusetts , it is very inferior , and not worthy of a place in the front border of the house , but on the back wall , where its roots can be kept quite dry , the quality is better ; in a position where its roots are situated in a soil , as regards moisture , more unlike that of England , it approaches more nearly to the quality of the fmit there . If heat caused the difference in the Hamburgh , why does it not in the Esperione ? I presume that the soil of a country has some effect , as well as the sun and heat , in effecting these changes . It is not confined to any one fruit , but the change is noticed in apples , pears , grapes , peaches , cherries , and other kinds . /z/ REMARKS ON THE USE OF MANURES , &c.; Since the publication of the first edition of the Culture of the Grape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether animal substances were beneficial , or otherwise , as part of the compost forming the border . This interest , in this country , has been increased by an article in the Magazine of Horticulture , edited by Mr. Hovey , in which he , in strong language , disapproves of not only animal remains , but classes under the term of " quackery " almost every article that has been , from time immemorial , considered , both by practical gardeners and scientific writers , as useful as amendments for the vineyard . This opinion of his , being published about the time of the appearance of the above pamphlet , wherein I had directed most of these articles to be used in the formation of the border , excited some remark , and the question is often asked , How can there be such a diversity of opinion and practice ? My behef is , that there is not so wide a difference as there would appear ; the reason for this will be given in the proper place . A subsequent article , by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the February number of his magazine , and , in support of his views , he brings forward the editor of the Gardeners ' Chronicle , who disapproves of carrion , but nothing is said against shells and other articles by this gentleman ; on the contrary , the application of these is incidentally approved of , by the commendation of authors who do advise their use . /z/ The following remarks of Mr. Hovej , are the two articles referred to :  --  " On the Formation of Vine Bo7'ders . By the Editor .  - -  The cultivation of the grape vine under glass is now attracting much attention ; and many new vineries have been erected in various parts of the country the last two years . The formation of the border , certainly one of the most important objects connected with the successful management and future welfare of the vines , is , therefore , considered as deserving of every attention . Much has been written upon this subject in each volume of our magazine , and we have endeavored to present our readers with all the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical cultivator . In our article in our last volume , ( Vol. 13 , p. 293 , ) upon the growth of the grape vine in the greenhouse or conservatory , we gave a few hints upon the preparation of vine borders , and remarked ' that a fine crop of grapes could be obtained without all the quackery so often recommended in their formation , such as a bed of oyster shells , or boiled bones , dead horses , cattle , dogs , slaughter-house manure , blood , soot , &c.'; " Some of our practical friends , who have had some experience in the culture of the grape , have been somewhat surprised to find we were not a firm believer in the great efficacy of the very richest ingredients , such as dead animals , for the formation of the border , and some have been almost disposed to doubt whether our own success was not effected by some such aid , contrary to our statement . To the former , we need only remark , that we are more and more convinced , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , but rather an injury in the end ; and , to the latter , we shall merely state that , whatever practice we recommend , we invariably adopt , until experience assures us that it is founded in error . " The subject of the preparation of vine borders has recently attracted considerable attention in England , and vari- /z/ ous communications have appeared , in some of the gardening periodicals , in relation to the practice of using the carcasses of dead animals . This discussion has taken place in consequence of the publication of a small , hut excellent little work , of only eighty or ninety pages , upon the culture of the grape , by Mr. Roberts , a very successful cultivator . Probably , few copies of the volume have ever found their way here , in consequence of the high price at which it was published . We , however , received a copy when it first appeared , and read it with much interest , and came to the same conclusion as Dr. Lindley , whose article we are about to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical , and common-sense treatises which we had ever read , and , saving its recommendation of the ' pabulum ' * of dead animals , to produce the ' nectar of Bacchus , ' was just Avhat every cultivator of the grape was in need of . We had intended to have prepared a Review of it , but other matters pressed upon us , and it was , for the time , forgotten . " The preparation of our article in our last volume brought the subject up anew , and it was in reference to Mr. Roberts 's views that we made the remark before quoted . Subsequently to the publication of our paper , and unknown to us at the time we wrote , appeared Ir . Allen 's pamphlet on the culture of the grape , in which he advises the use of carcasses of dead animals , if they can be had , to such an extent as to cover the bottom of the border . In our Review of this work , ( Vol. 13 , p. 409 , ) we incidentally stated our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use , but rather injurious to the future health of the vines . " Since that time , the discussion of this question has principally taken place , and , to show that our views are the same as those entertained by experienced cultivators , as well as scientific writers , abroad , we have quoted the following article from the Gardeners ' Chronicle for December last , to which we ask especial attention . "  --  Magazine of Horticulture , Vol. 14 , page 49. /z/ After describing the conservatory , and with other remarks relative to the plants therein , Mr. Hovej goes on to say , that it was not originally intended to plant vines in the house , but that , being anxious to prove kinds , " we commenced the formation of the border , not with the expectation that we should raise any grapes worth the trouble . Consequently , the border was made only fourteen feet wide and two and a half deep , and , as the conservatory was set well up with a view to have a fine gravelled trellis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn . The border was formed by carting in sods and good loam from an old pasture , and mixing with them about one quarter of well decomposed manure from the stable yard and from old hotbeds . This was done in July and August at leisure time . In the fall , the whole was trenched over in a rough manner , and about thirty bushels of ground bones added . In this way , the soil lay till the next spring , when it was again trenched over and ready for planting . We are not thus particular in order to show how a border should be made , but merely that it may be seen that a fine crop of grapes can be obtained without all the quackery so often recommended in their formation , such as a bed of oyster shells or boiled bones , dead horses , cattle , and dogs , slaughter-house manure , blood , soot , &c.; All that is necessary , in our opinion , to produce the very best grapes , is a good rich , loamy soil , well top-dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to bring the roots to the surface , rather than that they should go to the bottom after the dead carcasses . " After planting the vines , Mr. Hovey directs , " that , should the weather prove dry , the roots be well watered , and the surface mulched with a little coarse stable manure . " The third season , the vines were allowed to bear from two to five bunches each . Very gentle cropping , certainly . Mr. H. says they were of superior quality , the vines were not forced , and ripened their fruit in September . The fourth season . The regular diary of the treatment /z/ that the vines received begins now . I shall only notice what relates to the manures . In former seasons , nothing is said about manures , and we can only presume they were applied then as they were the year of the record , as this is given as a guide for the management of vines generally :  --  " 3Iarch Ist .  --  Some of the vines have burst a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet having been dug , it was manured with ten or fifteen pounds of guano , and spaded about six inches deep . ' ' June 9t7i.  --  The weather having been quite dry , the border has been mulched with coarse manure , and abovit a barrel of water given to each vine . " June VltJi.  --  Gave the border about ten barrels of water . " June 307i.  --  Since the refreshing rains of the 20th to the 28th , the berries have swelled very fast . " Jul 12th.  --  Warm , with refreshing showers . " July 22d.  --  Was rainy , the 25th the rainy weather continues . " August 8th.  --  Light showers . " August 10th.  --  Showers . " August 15th.  --  The weather having been dry since the 10th , gave about a barrel of water to each vine . August SI St.  --  The fruit all ripe , with the exception of the Esperione and Black Prince . " Mr. Hovey has omitted to state , that his border was covered with coarse manure and leaves in sufficient quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines . This is an important matter , and should not be neglected , for , in addition to the benefit derived from this protection , from the severity of the weather , the advantages from the juices of this covering being washed down amongst the soil and roots , by the rains and melting snows of winter , ( particularly where the border is not of the very richest kind , ) must be very great . The vines Avere planted , on an average , four and a half feet apart , the length of the house being /z/ eighty-six feet , and nineteen vines being the number planted . I should have planted , in the same space , twenty-nine vines , or fifty per cent , greater . And this difference in the number of the vines has a very important bearing upon the subject , as the roots of the vine in his border have this per centage more space to roam for nourishment . Allowing that the vine , thus situated , does perfect a good crop of fine fruit , still , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the difference in the product must be very much in favor of the latter system . Mr. Hovey remarks , " All that is necessary , in our opinion , to produce the very best grapes , is a good , rich , loamy soil , well top-dressed , every year , with old stable manure and guano . " I agree with him perfectly , so far as the soil is concerned , and go even further than he does , for if this good , 7ic7i , loamy soil is had , you have already every thing that is wanted , so far as nourishing matter is concerned , and there can be no necessity for this yearly application of stable manure and guano ,  --  this latter article the most concentrated and powerful manure known . ( I can not see the propriety of recommending the use of this , when the application of decomposed animal substances is forbidden . ) If such a soil can be found , the only preparation requisite before planting the vine , will be , if the situation requires it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenings , which would have a tendency to loosen and give permeability thereto , so as to allow the rain to pass freely through the soil , and , at the same time , make it easy for the roots to spread . This is just the soil we are attempting to form when we prepare the border , as directed under the proper head . In Massachusetts , I suppose such a soil will rarely be met with , and a prepared border must be resorted to . A benefit to be derived from the top-dressing of stable manure and guano , according to Mr. Hovey , is , that the roots are thus brought to the surface , " rather than that they should go to the bottom after the dead carcasses . " These /z/ dead carcasses appear to be a great bugbear in our friend 's path , and one would suppose , by the dread in which he stands of them , that the bunches of fruit , instead of having their usual bloom , would be ornamented with hogs ' bristles , horses ' hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long does he suppose this carcass retains anj appearance of what it was when placed in the border ? In Massachusetts , and south of this , if placed there during any time but the winter months , in sixty days every vestige of the body will have disappeared , excepting the bones , horns , hoofs , and hair , and will have become incorporated with the soil and enriched it to a great degree . The bones , being at the bottom , will remain according to their size and age , from one to fifty years , continually and very slowly decomposing . Mr. Hovey wishes to keep the roots at the surface , and this he will do by the top-dressing . In the directions for the winter treatment of the vine , it was recommended to cover the border with coarse manure and leaves , so that all the advantage the vine would derive from this application would be reaped by following my plan ; and , when fire-heat was used in the spring , it is urged , as proper , to add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manure to cover the border twelve or eighteen inches thick , which would ferment and heat , and certainly encourage the roots to keep to the surface . But does any one suppose that all the roots of the vine ,  --  a plant that will live for centuries ,  --  are to be kept within such a hmit ? This bugbear of the carcasses , ( I am not so particular about the flesh being on them , it is the bones and hoofs I depend upon chiefly , ) which trouble Mr. Hovey so much , and which are to draw the roots of the vine down to them , ( it is admitted then that there is such nourishment , ) I place there , at the bottom of the border , the lower part of them three feet and the upper part , perhaps , not more than two under the surface , to give durability to the border , presuming that the vine will not reach them before the second , third , or fourth year , and /z/ that , when it does , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually prevented from going deeper in search of food ; it is well known that the roots of the grape will form spongioles innumerable over the surface of bones partially decomposed , and that they turn and return , on the inside and outside of them , havuig no disposition to part company . The cause of Mr. Hovey 's objecting to these materials being at the bottom , is the very reason why I place them there . He thinks it willdraw the roots from the influence of the sun and air . I think it will prevent them from going so deep as to be out of this influence ; and at a medium depth , they will be less exposed to the changes of the weather , and enjoy a more equal temperature , as well as be less liable to suffer from drought . Mr. Hovey covers his border , after planting , with a little coarse manure , and , if the weather prove dry , he waters the border . In April , before the manure , which was put on to protect the roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guano was spread over it . In June , the border was mulched with coarse manure and watered . The 30th of June , after refreshing rains , which had washed this manure , and soaked its juices down amongst the roots of the vine , the " grapes swelled their berries very fast , " showing conclusively the benefit of the manure . All Mr. Hovey 's statements go to prove the value of a rich border . His border , it is true , has no beast , in its original form therein , but it is composed of the top soil ( the cream ) of an old pasture , stable manure , and ground bones , ( this last material I think should come under the head of quackery particularly as , in the ground , matter , much of it comes immediately into action , ) with the addition of the guano as a top-dressing . The soil was new , and was well manured with substances in which it is well known the grape will flourish , and the vines were not planted near together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciously treated ; and , if the plan of adding strong stimulating manures , such as guano , bone-dust , or the carcasses of animals , perfectly decomposed , ( I do not care which , the effect , in either case , will be the same , ) be continued from year to year , I see no reason why they should not continue to prosper . The border can , at any time , be made wider , if necessary . If these applications are omitted , I have no doubt that , in a few years , the fruit would deteriorate . In the border prepared with the materials of oyster shells , bones , dead horses , cattle , and slaughter-house manure , as detailed in my plan , the vines , if well treated in the grapery , would continue to fruit well for fifty years or more- , without the application of guano , etc. , or liquid manure , the application of which is quite as offensive as any of the prohibited articles ; and guano , if dissolved in water , and suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapery , is more so than any substance I have recommended , proving that it contains all these disagreeable materials , if you choose to bring them into action , and select that time to apply them to the border . Any one may satisfy himself of the truth of this assertion , by taking a few ounces of the guano and mixing it with a quart of water and exposing it as above named . If this is the case , all the bad effect of strong manures upon the flavor of the fruit must follow the use of this substance as well as of the before-named . That it does have this effect , I do not beheve . Before these substances will be used to nourish the vine , they must be chemically changed ; before this is done , they are a poison ; and , if in sufficient quantity , will destroy life in the roots which are exposed to them . It may be said that guano is already changed ; that it has laid exposed for years to the weather . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is yet capable of fermenting and heating . It is not unusual to find parts of , and even whole , birds , more or less decomposed in it . It is no objection to the use of any substance , as a manure , that there is a certain time or stage in its decomposition /z/ when it is offensive . It is so with any substance ; and if you choose first to bring the material into this state and then to apply it , it is your own fault . Even leaves and the young shoots of the vines , if allowed to ferment and become putrid in a tank , are as much so as any manure ; and when the liquid from these is applied to the roots of the plant on the inside of the house , there is nothing more offensive , or that retains the odor so long . But this is no evidence that the liquid is injurious , or any reason why it should not be used , but it is a hint to the cultivator to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his border , the richest soil or loam , and adds stable manure , ground bones , and guano , with liquid applications in seasons of drought , in summer , after mulching the border . I use a good loam , with a large supply of whole bones and other manures , but also a good portion of shells and old bricks and mortar , and do not apply liquid or liquid manures to vines thus situated . Thus , it appears that , if the one has a rich border , the other does not differ materially from it . To make this discussion of any benefit to the practical gardener , it is necessary that he should read the whole matter and hear both sides , and judge for himself what is best for this purpose . I have quoted all the articles from the Chronicle , and , to express my own opinion upon the question raised , I have appended notes to the different suggestions , as occasion seemed to require . " Questions for Vine Grroivers.  --  Being near the residence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention , ) I had a great desire to pay him a visit . I learned , however , that Mr. was not at home , but was invited by an assistant to look round the place . We proceeded directly to the vineries , in which I found the vines healthy and vigorous ; they were old established vines , and were producing a very full crop , particularly some Cannon Hall Muscats . Proceeding onward , however , to some newly /z/ erected houses , in which the vines had been planted last February , I found the young shoots all dead for eight and ten inches back , and some even more ; and , for the cause of this calamity , I could not obtain a satisfactory explanation , the blame being laid upon the sheet glass with which the houses were glazed . Upon inquiring of what the borders consisted , I was told that they had received a large admixture of dead carcasses , such as those of deer , horses , &c.,; and of bones .

I feel interested in the case , and shall take it kind should any correspondent furnish me with an opinion on the subject . If the evil originated from carrion , ( as in all likelihood it has , ) writers of treatises would do well to first prove its good effects before they so highly recommend such matters to the imhlic.  --  Bohert Elliott , Horn 's Castle , Nov. 24A , 1847 .

Mr. Roberts objects to this at that season of the year , and says it should not be done until the time of forcing approaches . Mr. Errington " is a great opponent to the burying of carcasses , or any part of them , in borders , " and refers to the remarks of Mr. Elliott , and attributes the injury of the vines to this cause ; but it does not appear that he was personally knowing to the facts as stated by Mr. Elliott . " Vine Culture .  --  On looking over the Chronicle , of December 4th , I noticed a communication from a Mr. Robert Elliott , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am evidently the person he alludes to , I beg to offer a few remarks on his visit to Raby , if he , indeed , visited Raby at all , for the Avhole of my men disclaim all knowledge of ever having shown this Mr. Elliott through the place in my absence . From the remarks he makes respecting the vines here , I assure your readers that I should not have troubled myself to refute him , had I not had a work before the public , from the following of which , to the letter , I have had unerring success ; and , if I can not convince your readers that the greater part of Mr. EUiott 's letter is a tissue of falsehoods , I will suffer my treatise to fall as my contemporary 's brick pillars have done . " In reference to the vines in the old houses looking well , and having good crops , as stated by Mr. Elliott , Mr. Roberts says , that it is owing to the disbudding and top-dressing the border with carrion , &c.,; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then goes on as follows :  --  " ' Proceeding onward , however , ' Mr. E. remarks , ' to some newly erected houses , in which the vines had been planted last February , I found the shoots all dead for eight and ten inches back , and some even more ; and , for the cause of this calamity , I could not obtain a satisfactory explanation , the blame being laid upon the sheet glass with which the houses were glazed . ' " Now , in this range , during February and March , there /z/ were planted , inside and outside , upwards of one hundred and thirty vines , chiefly small plants , and through the whole range , when he saw them , ( if he ever did see them , ) there were not thirty vines stopped at the points of the shoots , as he describes , and those so stopped are entirely confined to the roof vines planted outside , which is my favorite method of planting . As to the glass being injurious , this is rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I , in a great measure , believe in the purport of Mr. Spencer 's letter to the Chronicle some time ago , though it was stated that the glass was not in fault . I warn my brethren and amateurs to be guarded as to the too free use of it . " ' Upon inquiry , ' continues Mr. E. , ' of what the borders consisted , I was told they had received a large admixture of dead carcasses , such as those of deer , horses , &c.,'; and , in the remarks appended to Mr. E. 's letter , the editor says , ' We have always discountenanced the use of carrion in this manner . The vines are probably poisoned . ' " It may , perhaps , be in your recollection , and I dare say in that of many of your readers , that a collection of grapes was submitted by me , in September , 1841 , to the Horticultural Society , which was the produce of young vines . The borders in Avhich they grew contained carrion , &c.,; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens then sent superseded , I will still carry out and recommend the use of carrion when it can be obtained . But how can your position be tenable , when I tell you that the vines mentioned by Mr. E. are not planted in carrion , and that no carrion has been near them , not one horse carcass , nor a portion of one , is buried in the whole of my new borders , which are extensive ? I was sorry , at the time I made them , that it was not in my power to avail myself of that pabulum to produce the nectar of Bacchus . All the carrion , of any description , they contain , would not have made one load for a Shetland pony , and most of that was reduced , in order that it might give out immediately nutritious food to the vines , young as they /z/ were wlien planted , had it been placed within their reach ; but it was not . In notices to correspondents , it has been stated that my method of preparing borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine borders at Bishop 's , Stortford , are stated to be gorged with manure and fleshings of skinners and tanners , and no caution is given regarding the too free use of azotised manure , which is the basis of good cultivation . An immoderate use of such azotised manures , as a thorough mixture through the soil , will be far more likely to prove poisonous to vines in their infant state , and far more injurious than any thing I have yet offered to the public as essential to the good culture of the vine . But if I was not able to add carrion , except in a very limited degree , at the time my borders were made , I may mention that I fell in with a goodly lot last winter , part of which has been added as a top-dressing this autumn , and I intend in future to apply it to that purpose . I am so cautious that the least particle should not be wasted , that I hoard it up as a miser would his gold . I hope the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' On more recent inquiry , ' says Mr. EUiott , ' I was also informed that the death of the young shoots was caused by the flue running four times through the back wall . ' All this Mr. Roberts denies . " I beg to tell Mr. E. , when my treatise appeared before the public , I had proved the value of carrion , and I have been in the habit of using it for twenty years back , the results produced by which have been surprising and permanent . " " My new borders are formed and composed of materials nearly to my wish , with only two exceptions : there is too little carrion with too great a portion of another constituent in the soil , in excess , but I hope to be able to subdue this last to my mind . With the above exceptions , I am convinced , from what little I have made the habit of the vine my study , that the border contains Avhat is required for its perfect develop- /z/ ment and fruitfulness , etc.  --  James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ( We can not find that Mr. Elliott has said one word about Raby in his letter . Had he done so , we should have waited for further information before we inserted it . "  --  Editor 's remarks. )  --  Gardeners ' ' Chronicle , 1S4:7 , page 837 . " One of the best modern writers on the vine is Mr. Roberts , now gardener to the Duke of Cleveland , at Raby . His Treatise on Vine Culture contains more really good advice , and sensible suggestions as to the way in which this plant should be managed in vineries , than all the English books of routine , which had been previously published , put together . His success as a grape-grower , while gardener to Mr. Matthew Wilson , at Eshton Hall , was a brilliant example of the general soundness of his principles . A large silver medal , which was awarded by the Horticultural Society , to some bunches of grapes , exhibited September 7th , 1841 , sufficiently attested the advantage of his practice ; nor were they a picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his care , as we happen to know on the very best authority . " It is therefore with no ordinary reluctance that we venture to question a part of the system which Mr. Roberts advocates . We allude to the employment of carrion in his vine borders. * In a letter which we published last week , he * The improper use of the word " carrion " by Mr. Roberts has been the cause of this controversy or discussion , so far as the English writers have participated in it . In his rules for making the border , he calls it by this name , when he is giving directions to have the substance procured . In placing it in the border , he adds , " Not bringing it to the surface within one foot , as its assistance is not wanted the first year . " Thus it will be seen , that it is not putrefying flesh , carrion , that he gives to the vine as food , but the decomposed matter and the bones , which may be properly termed a manure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another error , I think , of Mr. Roberts , is , his not directing that this flesh of animals be used , when fresh and sweet , and the disagreeable consequences attending the removal of it , as described by him , would be avoided . If it must be collected , before making the border , then let it be done a sufficient length of time , before removal , to insure its decomposition . What that time may be will depend upon the climate and the season of the year . Near the equator , a few weeks vv-ould be ample time for even the bones to decompose . In England , it would probably require the whole summer /z/ states his conviction that this sort of manure is of the first degree of importance . After mentioning that , in his new vine borders , , not one horse carcass , nor a portion of one , is buried , he expresses his regret , that , at the time he made them , it was not in his power to avail himself of that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , ' he adds , ' if I was not able to add carrion , except in a very limited degree , at the time my borders were made , I may mention that I fell in with a goodly lot last Avinter , part of which has been added as a top-dressing this autumn , and I intend in future to apply it to that purpose . I am so cautious , that the least particle should not be wasted , that I hoard it up as a miser would his gold . ' " This is perfectly consistent with the directions which Mr. Roberts has given in his treatise . " For these , see Mr. Roberts 's border ; it is unnecessary to repeat them here . " It can not be denied that this is a process which must not be called inviting . Has it any disadvantages ? Has it any advantages ? These are both very important branches of inquiry . It may be alleged that it can have no disadvantages , because the magnificent grapes , above referred to , were obtained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those vines since 1841 , and this point it would be desirable to have elucidated . In the next place , it appears to us that the introduction , into vine borders , of pasty masses of matter , such as result from the use of carrion , is at variance with the first principles of vine cultivation , the truth of which was known even to the Romans . for the flesh and sinews to dissolve . At my garden in Salem , Massachusetts , a very ( at hog- , that had died from excessive heat , in August , was placed just under the ground , and covered with the soil , with the intention of removing and scattering the remains on the border in the fall . In sixty or seventy days , the place was opened , and not a bone even could be discovered . The only vestige of animal remains that could have been part of the creature were some teeth , and they may have been in the soil before . The rapid decay , in this case , no doubt , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog , which was only six or eight months . /z/ A free loose earth is what the vines demand , Where wind and frost have help 'd the lab'rer 's hand , And sturdy peasants deep have stirr 'd the land . " This was the maxim of Virgil , and all theory and experience prove its value . Then there are the gaseous results of decomposition , whose putrid odors render vine borders , constructed on Mr. Roberts 's plan , so intolerably disgusting . Can any one seriously believe that such an agency is desirable ? That it is even suitable ? Certainly we are not among the number . It is perfectly well known that azotised manures in a state of high concentration , are injurious or destructive to vegetable life ; as is proved sufficiently by the effect of certain animal matter , when thrown upon grass land ; or as we have just now evidence of before our eyes , in the form of a large oak tree which was almost killed a few years ago , in consequence of the contents of an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only when diluted that such manures acquire the high value which belongs to them . But it is not alone by their direct action , that they affect plants injuriously ; the putrid gases which they give out , are destructive to the young stems and foliage of plants , in proportion to their strength ; such gases are , up to a certain point , absolute poisons , although , below that point , they are nutritious . It is not very long since , that plants , in a small greenhouse , were almost destroyed in consequence of a dead hedge-hog having been allowed to putrefy in it ; and it appears , from Mr. Roberts 's statement , that some of his young vines , about thirty , are dead at the ends ; those thirty being ' entirely confined to the roof vines planted outside , ' precisely those which the light gaseous products of the rotten carrion , used in neighboring borders , though not in their own , would be most Ukely to affect . Mr. Roberts , however , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such cause ; but he hints at the glass being possibly in fault . He also refers to Mr. Nash 's admirable vine borders at Bishop 's Stortford , which ' are stated to be /z/ gorged " with manure , and fleshings of tanners and skinners , ' and compares them , as we understand him , with his own . But , in truth , there is no analogy . Not a particle of carrion was employed there . Such animal matters as skin , hair , and trimmings of liides , decompose very slowly , and are not carrion any more than bones are . It is the animal matter which rapidly becomes putrid , and passes off in clouds of poisonous gas , that renders carrion , properly so called , objectionable . " The vine-dressers of France object to manure altogether . Virgil , to be sure , recommends it in some lines , which should be committed to memory by every young gardener :  --  Next : when you layers in your vineyard make , Mix some rich dung , and shells and pebbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And trench them deeply in the lightened ground ; Superfluous moisture thus glides through the earth . And healthy vapors aid the tender birth . " No doubt these are wise maxims . No modern discovery is at variance with them ; on the contrary , they are confirmed by the experience of the most intehigent cultivators . The whole aim of the poet is to inculcate the necessitj of keeping the soil loose . Dung may be used , he says , but then you are to mix it with shells and broken pebbles , the object of which is to secure the constant openness of the soil . " On the other hand , Chaptal , the best French writer on the vine , discourages the use of manure . " ' The same reasons , ' he says , ' may be used against the system of the vine-growers of the north , who think it advantageous to manure their vines . By this means , indeed , they obtain larger crops , and more wine , but it is of bad quality , it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank , of the disgusting substances which produced it . Manure communicates to the vine too much nourishment . The nutritious juice , reduced to gas , and received by the mouths of the capillary roots , and by the air-vessels of the leaves , pene- /z/ trates and circulates in the sai-vessels , forms the wood of the plant , and furnishes the substance out of - which the shoots , leaves , flowers , and fruit are developed ; the more abundant the nutritive matter , the more the diameter of the vessels distends , the more rapid is the circulation of the sap , because the channels through which it passes have more capacity . This causes the sap to circulate in a less state of elaboration , the result of which must be , that the wine is flat , insipid , and destitute of all the principles of alcohol . Nevertheless , the abundant crop thus obtained , and the brilliant vegetation , are , after all , in some measure deceptive , FOR they can be but TRANSITORY . In vineyards where manuring is practised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be doubted , that the effect is very remarkable the first three or four years after the manuring of the vines , but , in the succeeding years , the plants begin to languish ; no longer finding that abundance of nourishment to which they have been accustomed , they suffer in consequence , and often fall victims to the want of it . Thus a part of the plants are lost , either by too much or too little nourishment . But vines can receive , and it is often advantageous to give them , such manure as will make good the poverty of the soil , its exhaustion , or what is required otherwise for this sort of cultivation . No manure suits vines better than what is properly called vegetable earth , obtained by the decomposition of plants . Mosses , leaves , and turf , mixed together , thrown up in great heaps , and left for about two years to ferment , make the very best manure of this sort . '  --  ( Traite , sur la Culture de la Vigne , i. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found under the head of manures . " We will not say that these maxims are exactly applicable to English vine-growing ; we seeking find bunches of grapes , the French requiring juice of fine quality ; and we are , therefore , ready to concede the value of manure of a proper description . Nevertheless , although we fully grant this , we are not the less of opinion , that the efiect of manure on vines is /z/ overrated , and we will take the liberty to quote Mr. Roberts 's own Eshton grapes in our support . He says , ' it may be in your recollection , and in that of many of your readers , that a collection of grapes was submitted by me in September , 1841 , to the Horticultural Society , which was the produce of young vines . The borders in which they grew contained carrion , &c.,; as detailed in my treatise , and , until I find the sjjecimens then sent siqjerseded , I will still carry out and recommend the use of carrion , when it can be had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited on this occasion , was as follows , one bunch in each case :  --  Canon Hall Muscat , - - 2 lbs . 3 oz .

But we have also before us , the following memorandum , to be found in the ' Journal of the Horticultural Society , ' vol. 11 , p. 303 . " ' On the twenty-first of August , 1847 , the vice-secretary received from Mr. Abel L. Gower four bunches of grapes ; one a Muscat of Alexandria , weighing two pounds nine ounces , and the others Black Hamburghs , weighing , respectively , two pounds nine ounces , three and a half pounds , and five pounds . The Black grapes were rather deficient in color , but of very large size , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the smallest of these bunches weighed more than Mr. Roberts 's Black Hamburgh , and the largest more than twice as much . And how did Mr. Hutchison , the gardener at Castle Malgwyn , obtain them ? By carrion , or any such violent and disgusting materials ? Not at all . He states that the compost ' used in the formation of the border , was hazelly loam with its turf , three parts , and one part brick , lime rubbish , and broken stones , with a little rich old dung , the turf well rotted , and the whole well incoi*- /z/ porated ; the borders are forked up and watered with Uquid manure once a year . ' " Mr. Roberts will thus see that his fine Eshton grapes are ' superseded ; ' are , in fact , beaten by specimens more than twice as good , and that , by the use of simple , inoffensive means , which , moreover , do not render a garden more pestilent than a London churchyard , and so dangerous to health , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reach of any sanitory regulations . Should Mr. Roberts remain unconvinced by these arguments , we would , at least , endeavor to persuade him to defer the use of carrion till the coming cholera shall have quitted us. "  --  Gardeners ' CVironide , 1847 , p. 851 . In the Chronicle of January 1st , 1848 , page 5th , is a denial of Mr. Robert Elhott , of any allusion to Mr. Roberts , or the vines at Raby Castle , in his article quoted as from this paper , page 798 , for 1847 . " Mr. Roberts did not leave Eshton Hall till May sixteenth , 1844 . I went on the fifteenth of the same month , and found the vines in a good growing state , with plenty of grapes on them , and they still remain in good condition . I have , on the rafters , thirtj-four vines , and on the back wall thirty , in all sixty-four vines , each of which produces , yearly , twenty pounds of grapes. * My plan is , not to allow * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop of grapes for the vine , at twentyfive pounds . English writers upon the subject speak of much larger crops we find ; and , even by your own account , the Hampton Court vine ripens its two thousand bunches . This is all true , but it is no reason why your vines , which have been planted only three feet apart , and are allowed less than eighteen inches on each side of the main shoot for its branches and fruit , should carry the crop that the Hampton Court vine does , which has a great space of soil for the roots to roam in , and the roof of an entire house , seventy feet long , and proportionately wide , for the branches to ramble over . Again , this vine , and some others , mentioned under the head of remarkable vines , are exceptions to the general bearing of the foreign kinds of the grape , favorably affected by some peculiarity in their location , which it is not likely will be the case with the vines in your grapery . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great as you suppose . If I am correct in the length of the house for the Hampton Court vine , which produces the two thousand bunches , the same length of house would contain , by my system , twenty-three vines , and twenty-five pounds each vine would produce five liundred and seventy-five pounds . The same number of vines on the back wall would produce , if well man- /z/ a vine to bear more than twenty bunches of grapes , which swell finely , and we might travel a long way ere we met with vines to match those at Eshton . I have , this year , aged , certainly half this amount , or a total of eight hundred and sixty - two pounds of grapes , the quality of which could not well be surpassed . The two thousand bundles on the Hampton vine , at the time I saw them , would not average more than half a pound each , or one thousand pounds . I have seen it stated , that this vine has produced one ton of two thousand two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be so , but of the quality of this fruit we know nothing . I am endeavoring to show what a vine will do , every year , if treated as directed . In saying that twenty-five pounds is all that a vine should be allowed to bear , I do not wish to be understood as meaning that a vine can not , under any circumstances , occasionally produce a much larger quantity ; the account I so soon give of the vine at Hampton Court bearing such a crop , is proof enough that I hold no such opinion . What I presume to be wanted of a vine is , a certainty ( as near as humcui agency can effect this , ) of a liberal and annual crop of fruit , in quality as rich as it can be grown under the circumstances of situation , &c.; This , I believe , can be obtained by the system recommended and adopted by myself ; and I can assure my readers , that they will , after a kw years of e.xperience , agree with me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every vine , ( favorably situated , ) for many successive years , is not a bad crop . On the back wall , or under circumstances not admitting of a full crop , the judgment of the cultivator must be e.xercised in ascertaining what is the proper amount in these cases ; it will , probably , range from five to fifteen pounds . By limiting the crop to this weight , I do not adhere strictly to just this amount ; it would be absurd to attempt it . Before thinning the berries , I reduce the number of bunches to what I suppose , if well filled out , would make this weight . It would be useless , if , after the estimated weight had ripened its seed , and it was ascertained that , from the vigor of the vine , the bunches would swell and exceed the amount required , to cut off the excess now . When the grapes have thus perfected their seed , and are swelling off " and changing color rapidly , and the bunches are larger than was expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done without injuring the beauty of the bunch , I thin out the berries still more , that all the nourishment may be thrown into those remaining . The effect of this treatment will be to keep the vine in perfect health and vigor . If , under these circumstances , the bunches and berries swell beyond my calculations , and the weight of fruit produced exceeds the rule , there is no harm done , for the vine , from its strong condition , has produced this result . I have thirty pounds , and perhaps more , on a few vines , at this moment ; the bunches which I thought would weigh one pound exceeding this weight considerably ; but some other vines have less than the allowance . Nor do I expect any loss of crop next year , in consequence ; for , had the vines not have been in superior condition , and able , without weakening them , to have done this , the berries would not have swollen in the manner thay have , and the twenty-five pounds would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bearing , and six or ten pounds the recuired amount , I should have been very careful to avoid an over-crop . Strengthen your vines during the first five or six years of their growth , after planting in your border , by not allowing them to produce heavy crops , and keep them ever after in this condition of strength , by aiming for a moderate yield of fruit . By so doing , your ) lants will bo in the state to aflford this nourishment , and the bunches will enlarge to /z/ obtained eleven prizes for grapes , at three shows , and , last year , seven prizes at two shows . In fifteen years , I have received sixty-four prizes for grapes . Mr. Roberts and I do an extent that will surprise you 5 on the other hand , if they are over-cropped , they will ( may they have been ever so promising at the beginning of the summer , ) remain with the berries small and loose , and entirely surpassed in weight and every desirable quality , by the neighboring vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , were cast quite into the shade by these . By the statements of gardeners , who have given accounts of the crops they have produced on their vines , it would be supposed that fifty pounds was an average yield . ( I am of opinion , that the weight , in these cases , was estimated , not real . ) Admitting this weight to be real , then the yield from the seventy feet house , ( the vines planted as is customary in England , four feet apart , ) would be , on the rafters and back wall , twelve hundred and seventj ' - five pounds , about one third part more than would be produced by my plan . If , as stated above , my vines are capable of producing a larger crop , the berries and bunches will swell proportionablj , and the average will be greater , bringing the difference to less than one fourth part . The vine trained as the Hampton Court one would cover all the glass , and it would be useless to attempt to grow grapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently , and , in consequence , would not produce fruit . If space were left for the sun to shine on the wall and to ripen the wood , the crop would be lessened in proportion , on the rafter trellis . Mr. Cherry ( see his statement of the vines , at Eshton Hall , ) limits his crop , per vine , to twenty pounds on an average , back and front vines alike . His object , unquestionably , is , to produce high-flavored fruit , and he is the only English gardener , that I remember to have read , that speaks of so small an amount , and whose practice , in this respect , makes any approach to the product of the vine in the most famous districts of grape culture , on the continent of Europe . I have , sometimes , when a vine has been over-lu.xuriaut , allowed it to ripen one hundred bunches , to check its excessive growth , and with the desired effect ; but this was with the very strong growing kinds , as Verdelho and Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties . Frequently , I have been requested to go and see vines loaded with fruit , and have found forty or fifty large bunches on a young vine ; they were always looking well until after the seeding time , and then came the shrivel and shanking , and another disease , the effect of over-cropping , in which the berries have a soft , cold feeling when touched , just as they do when shrivelled , but no appearance of this on the stems . The fate of these grapes has always been similar , the loss of two thirds or three quarters of the fruit , with scarcely a decent bunch . In Hovey 's Magazine of Horticulture , vol. 4 , New Series , at the 277th page , is an article on the grape , taken from the Gardeners ' Journal , 1848 , p. 182 , in which the writer 's object was , as he states , to do justice to a Mr. Gerrie 's good management of the vine . As I am a disbeliever in the vines annually producing forty or fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty pounds of fruit , for any length of years ,  --  and as this gentleman furnishes one of these wonderful stories , and also supplies the facts contradicting his own statements , and , at the same time , gives confirmation to my opinion expressed before , that these weights are , usually , by estimation , cmd not by actual balance , and will show to the inexperienced in these matters , how easily people may be deceived , when they do not calculate for themselves , and how readily such a statement , after once being in print , is circulated without examination ,  --  I shall quote a large part of it here ;  --  /z/ not essentially differ in the treatment of the vine . I agree with the maxims laid down in his book , with one exception , viz. , the carrion . For a border , I like fresh sods , and duno ; " Both houses were planted in March , 184G . The vines grew finely the first season , making- strong wood , short-jointed , and well ripened ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forcing was commenced in both houses , on the tenth of February , 1847 . I saw them in August following , and a finer crop , or better fruit , I never witnessed , as far as they were pruned . The bunches were large , the berries well swelled , and all a good color , not one of them being shanked . The greatest number of bunches on one vine , was twentj ' - six , the least number , fourteen . The weight of the bunches was from one pound to two and a half pounds each ; the entire weight being neai'ly three hundred weight , from the thirty vines , with which the houses were planted . This , your readers will say , was a surprising crop for the second year after planting , and so , no doubt , it was ; and now comes a very important question . Was it prudent , on the part of Mr. Gerrie , to allow so many to . The vines did their duty nobly . He was aware that the material in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well matured ; and he judged , therefore , that he might allow them to produce the above quantity . " Upon the propriety of fruiting vines thus early , I have expressed my opinion , under the proper head . It will be noticed , that this writer states , that the greatest number of bunches on a vine was twenty-six , the least number fourteen , and that the bunches weighed from one pound to two and a half pounds each . He then adds , the entire weight being nearly three hundred weight , from the tliirty vines ; thirty vines , at twenty-six bunches each , would give a total of seven hundred and eighty bunches , and the mean of the weight , per bunch , he gives , ( one pound to two and a half pounds each , ) is one and three quarter pounds , or , a total of thirteen hundred and sixty-five pounds . Again , thirty vines , at fourteen bunches each , would give four himdred and twenty bunches , which , at the mean weight of one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven hundred and thirty-five pounds ; showing the crop of fruit , according to his omi statement , as ranging betvveen seven hundred and thirty-five and thirteen hundred and sixty-five pounds ; and yet he says , the entire weight was about three hundred pounds , or ten pomids per ne , instead of from twenty-four and a half to forty-five and a half pounds , as by the statement of bunches and their weight . If the number of bimches on each vine , was correctljstated , instead of weighing from one pound to two and a half pounds , they only weighed from six to twelve ounces , or the average weight of abont half a pound each . Very small bunches indeed . As to the vines maturing this ten pounds of fruit , the second year , there is no improbability iu that , and it is not unlikely that they may have borne respectable crops of fruit for several 3 " ears , but I do not thijik tliey would compare with vines differently treated , after tlicy were five or six years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a grapery , and train it after the manner of the Hampton Court vine , he should proceed upon the principle , that he was establishing a tree , to remain for centuries , and should not allow it to fruit until it had been planted five or six years , and had become well established . I believe , however , that the amount of fruit obtained , would be less , annually , after waiting thus long , than by the mode of planting many vines . /z/ in a fresh state , say six cart-loads of good sods , one cart-load of leaf mould , and one cart-load of liorse droppings . George Cherry , Eshton Hall . "  --  G-ardeners ' Chro7iicle , 1848 , p. 22 . " It appears that Ave were not far wrong , when we ventured to express a doubt as to the permanence of the vigor produced in vines , by the use of carrion , ( see page 851 , 1847 . ) Mr. Cherry , the gardener at Eshton Hall , himself , objects to it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good condition , yet admits that the weight of the bunches does not now exceed one pound on an average , yet they have been out of Mr. Roberts 's charge for only three years . This is a sad falling off from two and a quarter pounds a bunch . That they are still in good health and very respectable vines , we fully believe , for they continue to be managed upon Mr. Roberts 's plan , which we regard as excellent , with the single exception of the carrion . " " What the effect of using carrion in vine borders really is , appears pretty clearly from the following statement , which has just reached us : "  --  " Some years since , I took charge of a place where there were three large vineries , the grapes in which had entirely failed . The vines had been planted about six years . Upon examination , the borders proved to contain the carcasses of thirty fat hogs , which had died of murrain , together with the bodies of other stock . They likewise contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense quantity of woolen rags , saturated with oil . Upon digging into the border , I found the soil more hke paste than any thing else , and the stench was so dreadful , that one of the men was taken ill from the effects of it . Throughout the whole of that border , I found not one single fibre ; the large roots were covered Avith canker , and several large ones were eaten completely through . The foliage was very large , but sickly , the wood very long-jointed and watery . I commenced forcing one house of Black Hamburghs early ; the temperature was kept /z/ low , with abundance of air ; the vines broke slowly and strong , but showed scarcely any fruit , generally throwing off a tendril instead of a bunch ; the other houses were also indifferent , both in flavor and color , being watery , and insipid to the taste . At that time , I had not made the above examination . Afterwards , I added one third of old mortar and brick rubbish , and , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the result was , that , the following season , the wood became firmer and shorted-jointed , and the crop improved , both in weight , flavor , and color . E. F. G. " * * E. F. G. states impossibilities ; and , to practical men , renders thereby his communication worthless , unless ihcy can be accomited for as oversights. iThat the editor of the Chronicle should have thought the artick of value , must have been , because it favored his opinion relative to the use of carrion 3 and he could not have given it a careful perusal ; if he did , he overlooked the result of such reasoning . You might , with as much propriety , say , that bone-dust , guano , poudrette , or any chemical combination , was bad and unsuitable as manure for the vine , because it would not flourish if planted in them , simply , or with only a small proportion of soil . According to E. F. G. , " here was a mass of thirty fat hogs , and other bodies besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four wagon-loads of large bones , and an immense quantity of woolen rags saturated loith oil . " ( This last article of oil , unless used in the compost heap , and entirely ' decomposed before it is used , is , perhaps , the worst poison that can be applied to the roots of fruit trees , of all kinds . ) Upon digging into it , according to his account , it was a mass of putrid matter , which would as surely destroy all life in the root of the vine which came within its reach , as fire would destroy life in the animal , if surrounded thereby . In fact , it was a compost heap , piled above the roots of the vines . ( The vines had been planted six years ; this heap of matter could not have been put there at that time ; for , even in England , two years is sufficient for the mass to have been changed . ) Wliat practical gardener would think of planting his vines in such materials ? Compare this mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roberts 5 how very imlike they are ! " Throughout the whole of the border , he found not one single fibre , and the large roots were cankered , and some of them eaten through . " He does not state , by what the roots were eaten ; whether by worms , produced in this putrefaction , or by the canker . This is just the condition the roots might be supposed to be in , that is , dead . It is impossible to cause a root of the vine to live in such matter , during decomposition . Thus far , there is reason in what E. F. G. says , as to the condition of the border , and the state of the roots of the vines growing therein- But , w hen he states , " that the foliage was very large , but sickly , the wood very long-jointed and watery , " we can not agree with him ; it can not be ; E. F. G. must have overlooked some important fact ; the roots of the vine could not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with large leaves . In forcing , " the vines broke slowly , but strong , and showed scarcely any frait . " Here , also , is a strange statement 5 the vines , to do this , must liave received abundant nourish- /z/ " With reference to manuring , a friend has lately communicated to us the following interesting memorandum :  --  " When I visited the vineyards of Frontignan , I was much struck with the exceeding tenderness and crispness ( if I may use the term , ) of the grapes there grown , as compared with the Muscats of our forcing-houses ; and , when I tasted the Nice grape of Raby Castle , of which you were so good as to send me a sample , the idea occurred to me , that the hardness of the pulp might be owing to excessive manuring and forcing of the vine ; and I thought of writing to you , to inquire if you were aware of any facts , in the history of vegetation , that would warrant such conclusion . I may mention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye , had , to my taste , a flavor difierent from the ordinary Nice kind , something like what the French call gout de ferroir in wine . That this peculiarity may originate from the foul manure that had been given to the vine , I think highly probable ; and the following instance will show how easily the flavor of the fruit may be affected by substances less offensive than carrion . M. De Chassirou has observed , that the wines of the Isles of Oleron and Re , are of bad quality , and retain the odor peculiar to the sea-weeds with which the vineyards there are manured . In all wine countries , wiiere we may suppose the culture of the vine to be best understood , the opinion universally prevails , that fresh manure ought not to be used , or , if it be so , that it should be applied in the autumn , after the vintage , so as to be , in a great measure , decomposed , and incorporated with the soil before the ascent of the sap , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots , as before-mentioned by him , could not have furnished it . E. F. G. did not go deep enough into the border ; if he had , ( and the vines were as he staled , ) he then would have found , below all this mass of putrid matter , the roots and rootlets which furnished the sap that produced these long shoots and large leaves ; and these roots being so deep in the soil , is the cause why the vines did not die from the effects of the manure , and is the reason they did not fruit , the wood not ripening- sufficiently . A small part of this putrid matter , if it had been changed , as it should have been , in the compost heap , and then applied as a top-dressing , would have enticed the roots to the surface , and have been beneficial , instead of destroying them , as it did . /z/ practice is occasionally followed in the Rheni-gau , where a strong prepossession exists in favor of manuring the vineyards , * and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vines ; but the best authors concur in recommending , that all the manure employed , should be first duly fermented , at whatever time it may be used . "  --  Grardeners ' Chronicle , 1848 , p. 19 . " The custom of introducing carcasses into vine borders , for the purpose of obtaining monster bunches of flavorless grapes , has prevailed for a considerable length of time in the neighborhood of Leeds and Wakefield ; but the vines have always , in a few years , become feeble and unproductive , in consequence of the dense mass of putrefied matter being unsuitable to the growth of fibrous roots . G. "  --  Crardeners ' Chronicle , 1848 , p. 3T . By James Roberts , Raby Castle . ( As the remarks are long , and much of it not having any practical bearing upon the question , I shall only extract such facts as are different from those already stated . ) " In page 851 , it is stated , that the grapes I exhibited , on September 7th , 1841 , have been superseded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly appears that the Hamburghs sent were heavier , and , I have no doubt , others have shown heavier bunches than mine , which , perhaps , were not the heaviest in the Eshton range ; but , admitting they were , do the grapes alluded to , supersede them as a collection ? This collection , which was exhibited in London , on the 7th September , on the 9th , " was exhibited at York , and took five first prizes . Surely then the grapes must have been good indeed , which , after receiving , I believe , the highest medal ever awarded for grapes , at the society 's rooms in London , travelled , by coach and rail , between four hundred and five hundred miles , were packed /z/ and repacked twice , and then competed , successfully , amongst the best fruit-growers of any county in England . " Between September 7th , 1841 and October 17th , 1843 , I was awarded , by the Horticultural Society of London , eight medals , six for grapes exclusively , and two for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears Mr. Cherry agrees with my practice of culture , with the exception of carrion ; but , if he has not remade the borders at Eshton , which I am persuaded he has not , are not the vines still enjoying the remains of what I cautiously offered ? " Here follow some particularly correct remarks relative to the border , as described by E. F. G. , page 225 . As I have made my own statement concerning the materials used in this border , and the effect , as described , upon the vines , and , as hi the main we agree , it is unnecessary to quote them here . " In making a tour , in the autumn of 1844 , I called at a nobleman 's demesne . After an introduction to the gardener , we entered a large vineyard , in which was a splendid crop of Muscat of Alexandria grapes ; good bunches , with finely swelled berries , and beautifully colored . I expressed my delight at the sight , and he stated the means employed to l ) ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and bore little ; and , he added , ' being possessed of your Treatise , I top-dressed , as recommended , and the result is what you see ; they have been the admiration of all who have seen them . ' "  --  G-ardeners ' Glcronicle , 1848 . " We should not treat Mr. Roberts 's letter on vines , in our last Chronicle , with the consideration to which the indisputable skill of the writer is entitled , if we passed it over without remark . We are also called upon to notice it by some of the reasoning introduced into it . " Mr. Roberts first questions whether his carrion-fed vines have been excelled by others treated to a less offensive diet . That his grapes were excellent , we have repeated over and over again ; they did the greatest credit to his skill , as his work on the vine does to his intelligence and knowledie of /z/ his profession . But , until he can show that a bunch of Hamburgh , weighing five pounds , is not superior to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Muscats , of two pounds , nine ounces , to one of the same kind weighing two pounds , three ounces ,  --  and such are the differences between Mr. Hutchison 's Castle Malgwjn grapes and those of Eshton Hall ,  --  we must retain our opinion , that grapes are not improved by being fed on carrion . It is said that Mr. Hutchison 's vines were seven years old , and those of Mr. Roberts but two ; hut we learn , by the present gardener at Eshton , that the vines there , now that they have become seven or eight years old , only bear bunches averaging one pound . So that the carrion fed-vines are not improved by age ; and their present state is , to our minds , any thing rather than ' conclusive as to the advantages to be derived from using that substance . ' " Mr. Roberts states that some very fine grapes , seen by him in Cheshire , had acquired their condition by being topdressed in the manner recommended by him . We find that manner explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground bones , loamy soil , rotten manure , and decayed carrion , covering the whole with an inch or two of half-rotten stable manure to prevent evaporation , '  --  a good appliance , no doubt . But we are at a loss to know what this has really to do with the question at issue . The use of a little horse-flesh , in a state of decay , is surely not the same thing as filling a border with lumps of putrid flesh . ' Adding one good-sized horse or cow carcass to every ten or twelve yards , ' ( Treatise ) , and we certainly should not be inclined to apply to the recommendation Mr. Roberts 's term , cautious . We own that to us the advice seems rather the reverse . But we half suspect that , after all the controversy , our difference in opinion from our very clever correspondent turns , like many other differences , upon the meaning of a word . What is really meant by carrion ? We understand it to be puti'id flesh in the early stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and plants than it is offensive and disgusting . These early products of animal decay , be they what they may , are g'ven off in such abundance for a certain time , varying with temperature and other circumstances , that they can not be too cautiously guarded against ; and therefore carrion , in the sense in which we understand the word , is wholly unfit for gardening purposes . But , by degrees , the horrible emanations from putrid flesh are decomposed , or absorbed by the surrounding soil , or are lost in the open air , and then their dangerous quality disappears . In fact , decayed carrion , that is to say , carrion which has lost its offensiveness , is not carrion at all ; it consists of little more than bones , saline matter , and the black earth which is called humus ,  --  a very valuable substance , partly on account of its own action , and partly on account of the gaseous matters which it detains among its pores , and parts with gradually and beneficially . It is old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any one , would object . Quite the contrary ; and we readily admit that , after a time , the dead horses in the vine borders at Eshton , ceasing to be dangerous , will become a potent and harmless manure . But the mischief is done before that time ; the first stage in the growth of the vines has been injurious , and we doubt whether any amount of care will quite repair the damage . At all events , admitting that it may be repaired , we are still forced to arrive at the conclusion that the use of so offensive a material as carrion does no good , and therefore ought to be abandoned . "  --  G-ardeners ' Chro7iicle , 1848 , p. 83 . By J. W. Roberts , Crardener , Wakefield , YorhsMre.  --  " Three years ago , I gardened not two miles from Wakefield , where I had two vineries , which had produced little for years . The vines in them were nearly sixty years old . By permission of my employer , I remade the borders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and the border being in a very bad state , I drained it well , refilling it with compost , consisting of a portion of carrion , leaf mould , turf from a /z/ pasture , and stable manure , and the result is , that , last year , these same vines produced a capital crop of well-flavored finely colored fruit , and made excellent wood . Surely , this speaks volumes in favor of carrion . Is not E. F. G. mistaken , when he says that the vines in the neighborhood of Leeds and Wakefield are falling ofi " ? I have lived for nearly twenty years in the neighborhood of Wakefield , and all who have used carrion here , speak in high terms of its favorable effects on their vines . The use of carrion was first suggested to me by reading Mr. Roberts 's ' Treatise on the Vine , ' than which I know of no more valuable work on the subject , and for which I feel much indebted to its author . "  --  G-ardeners ' CJironide , 1848 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan , and quotes Abbe Rozier Chaptal , M. Bosc , and other continental authors , who , it is well known , are opposed to all crude manures for the vine , as proper authorities to be relied upon as evidence of the bad effects of them . The article is very long , but it contains nothing new . It can be found in the G-ardeners ' Chronicle , for 1818 , p. 115 . Remarks on statements made in the discussion .  --  The first assertion by INIr . Elliott , in the communication which commenced the controversy , is , that he found the young shoots on the vines , newly planted , all dead for eight or ten inches . And he denies that the explanation given him of the cause ,  - -  the burning by the sheet glass ,  --  can be the correct one , and attributes it to putrefaction in the border , baneful stimulants to the tender roots have arisen , and the effect of such stimulants , according to this writer , has been tokill the ends of the shoots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putrid matter from the flesh of animals coming into contact with the roots of the vine , I have no hesitation in asserting , from what experience I have had in such matters , the result would have been death to the vine ,  --  the roots dying first , the tops , last . I have never known a vine affected in this manner , when there was a possibility that the rich soil could have /z/ been the cause ; neither do I think that , out of six hundred vines " which I have planted under glass , this singular disease ever seriously affected one vine . I have had a few injured at the end of the cane , hut it has always occurred on some extremely hot and bright day , where the very place on the skin of the shoot , Avhich had been burned by a defect in the glass , could be seen . A new shoot from the terminal eye has invariably pushed and grown rapidly , showing that the cause was external , and not with the roots or sap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason Avhy the glass might not burn the shoots in England as well as in the United States ; that it does burn here , there is no doubt ; and Mr. Hovey , in speaking of the exposure for the grapery , alludes to the necessity of having some protection from the scorching effects of the sun in summer , and mentions the whiting the glass for this purpose . It is not uncommon to see the young laterals , and even the main stalk of the bunch of fi'uit I have sometimes found burned , on the side next the glass , and so injured that I have deemed it best to cut it away . That the gas , escaping from fermenting manure and leaves , will destroy the fohage , I have stated in my remarks on Mr. Roberts 's plan . The editor of the Chronicle states , that it is the " gaseous results of decomposition , whose odors render vine borders , constructed on Mr. Roberts 's plan , so intolerably disgusting . " ( Article extracted as from the Chronicle , 1847 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when prepared either by Mr. Roberts 's plan , or my own , never can exist in fact . I never have discovered the least odor from any border after it was finished . All manures in their crude state are offensive , and , in collecting them for the border , or the compost heap , the person so employed must be subject to the gases , be they more or less disagreeable . I contend that animal matter , when fresh , is less so than any other manure . There is an erroneous opinion formed of the condition of the border , founded upon the improper use of the word carrion ( before /z/ noticed ) by Mr. Roberts , when lie does not in reality use carrion or recommend its use vuitil changed . Dr. Lindley refers to an oak tree , which had been subjected to improper treatment , by the digging into the soil , around and above its roots , of an undue quantity of powerful manure from a cess-pool , with the result , to the tree , ( almost death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman certainly can not intend to compare this injudicious management with the compost formed from carrion and soil , and the mannei ' of applying it , as recommended by Mr. Roberts . For , he immediately adds , " it is only when diluted that such manures acquire the liigh value which belongs to them ,  --  a just remark , not only in relation to the manure above named , but to all the substances usually classed under this head , such as the offal of all animals and birds , the decayed matter from flesh or fish , whether of the soft material which dissolves , or of the bony substances which are a long time in crumbling away , guano , poudrette , &c.; Dr. Lindley refers to the plants in a greenhouse , that were almost destroyed by the gases arising from the putrefying body of a hedgehog , and thinks that this is proof that the vines were injured at the ends of their shoots by the gas from the carrion . It may have been caused by the confined air inside of this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must confess , that I think there may have been some other cause , that affected the plants , and produced the disease . In the newly settled parts of our country , it is customary to leave the dead bodies of animals unburied . I have never noticed any effect produced upon the foliage of tree or herb from the odor or gas arising therefrom . In the valley of the Connecticut , where reside some of our best agriculturists , they manure the land with fresh white fish , that are caught in great quantities , ( I believe in the spring season of the year . ) They spread them broadcast over the fields , and any one who has rode through this district , about this time of apphcation , can most assuredly say that the cus- /z/ torn " is not inviting , " and can bear ample testimony that the air is charged with gas from putrefying matter , yet we hear of no bad effect from this ; and , if a single hedgehog in a greenhouse would kill plants , it would appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these white fish , spread over the surface of the land , would affect the foliage in the fields , wherein they were undergoing this change . Dr. Lindley then says , " The vine-dressers of France object to 7nanure altogether . ' ' I can not pass this remark by , without a direct denial of the assertion . The gentleman himself does it effectually in the quotation he brings forward from Chaptal , and the continuation of the subject of manures by this French author , given under the head of manures for vineyards , will still farther explain the customs of the French . My own belief is , that the French manure their vineyards : that there are exceptions to this , it may be . Chaptal , and other authors , are opposed to the custom , I admit ; but other persons , who write what they have seen and know , state that they are used . Chaptal wishes to discourage the use of it , from a belief that it injures the juice of the grape ; that it increases the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all are endeavoring to obtain , when cultivating for the table , and the plan of cultivation which will produce this , without injury to the amount of the crop , flavor , or color , of the fruit , is the best . Dr. Lindley is of the opinion , that the grapes shown by Mr. Gower have surpassed those grown by Mr. Roberts . From the printed account of them , I should have preferred to have been the one who produced the six kinds named , as having been shown by the latter . Three of these varieties usually setting poorly , all of which were sufficiently large , and the White Nice , ( a kind that makes a large bunch , but a light weighing fruit , ) remarkably so ; they Avere all represented as having been beautiful . Mr. Gower 's , though his Hamburgh bunches were large , were rather deficient in color ,  --  a want that , in my estimation , would make them /z/ unworthy to compete with the first-named . To have a correct idea of this matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not remember ever to have met with any such . My opinion of the characteristics requisite to form a fine bunch of grapes , is , that the bunch be of medium bigness , with the berries large , of an equal size , well colored , and covered with a fine bloom . Very large bunches are not always so equally well flavored as lesser ones , and those weighing from eight ounces to one pound each , are almost always the best . When exhibited at horticultural shows , however , large size , if , at the same time , these be well colored , Avill invariably be considered the best . The border that produced the grapes , which Dr. Lindley considers superior to those raised by Mr. Roberts , is a very fine one , and not very unlike the compost recommended by me , to be used in a situation where it is necessary to remove all the original soil ; but , in this border , they use liquid manure ; and this is universally the case , when the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones or other manures . This application of an offensive liquid upon the surface of the soil , is , in my estimation , more disagreeable than in burying it ; and when the rich border is properly made , ramwater is the only application requisite for the roots , on the outside of the house . On the other hand , the border composed of loam and rotten sods , although excellent , requires this application of liquid manure , to cause the grapes to swell off large and full . This discussion of the subject of manures is well worthy the attention of cultivators . Instead of supporting Mr. Hovey 's assertion , that experienced cultivators held the same opinions as he did , respecting the " quackery , so often recommended , " as the use of oyster shells , or boiled bones , dead cattle , etc. , I am rather inclined to believe , that kQ judicious use of them is advocated ; certainly , it is admitted , that they are promoters of vegetation . Chaptal even allows , that the effect of manure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , he adds , the effects are deceptive ; for , after a time , the manure will cease to act , and the vine will languish . But is not this failure caused bj neglecting to renew the manure ? Plant a vine in a new soil , a good loam for instance , it will grow well , and bear fruit for some years , but soon ( as Chaptal says of the manured vine , ) it will cease to bear fruit , or only in a diminished degree . Renew this soil by adding to it more loam or manure , either as a solid or liquid , and it will regain its former vigor . The soil must be strengthened by yearly application of suitable matter . That harm is done by improper manuring , I have no doubt . If vines , when young , are too highly manured , and this stimulant is not constantly kept up , they will fail to do well ; and this is what I should most fear from Mr. Roberts 's system ; not from the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manure placed on the surface , to produce heat . Dr. Lindley , if I understand his language , does not discourage the use of the articles named by Mr. Hovey , with " the exception of carrion , and this only , as such , and not to the use of it , as I have recommended , in the formation of the border . In the last article written by him , on the subject , he says , " we readily admit , that , after a time , the dead horses , in the vine borders , at Eshton , ceasing to be dangerous , will become a potent and harmless manure . " By the authorities quoted , and the approval of other systems of border compost , which contain manures in large quantities in them , I apprehend that Dr. Lindley , and other experienced cultivators , in Europe , do not differ widely from me , in the opinion I have formed , and in the practice which I have carried out and recommended to the public . It must be apparent to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to take the place of a soil so unsuitable , as to require removal from the place where the border is to be situated , that the compost named for the purpose , must be , in my opinion , in every respect , suited for the welfare of the vines . Mr. Hovey , in his sweeping remarks , relative to /z/ rich borders , refers to mjself , as recommending the use of " the carcasses of animals , to such an extent as to cover the bottom of the border , if they could be obtained . " His statement is correct ; but my views would have been better understood , had some allusion have been made to the substitute . My reasons for recommending the carcasses of animals , are several ,  --  such as the durability of their bones , the exciting nature and strength of the manure formed from the decomposed flesh , etc. , and their cheapness . In the fall of the year , near large cities , it is frequently easy to procure the bodies of horses , either dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be had free of cost , brought to your place , and then killed , and the thanks of the owners to you in addition , for providing a place of deposit , near at hand , for them , which , otherwise , might occasion them some expense in their removal to a distance , or of burjing them . All bodies of animals , killed accidentally , or by disease , are of no value in this country , but as manure , and when such can be had , there is so much saved . On the contrary , the land that has been skimmed of its turf , and three or four inches of its best soil , ( in this part of our country at least , ) is almost ruined . It is true , you may rob your own land , but , should your garden be in the city , ( as mine is situated , ) you would search many an hour , before the proper pasture soil could be obtained . Knowing these difficulties in providing suitable soil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the directions for the compost , with the animal carcasses ; and then , in giving the substitute , presumed that it would be understood , that I did not consider that is was imperatively necessary , that these materials , flesh and all , should be incorporated into the border . That it is best to do so , I firml believe . My first border was made in 1834 , on a flooring of stones ; it was very rich : much slaughter-house manure , with many bones , were incorporated with the soil ; cow manure , and some lime , also , was added nearer the surface . This house has always had artificial heat applied to it ; and , for the last /z/ ten years , has been forced in December , and has never failed to produce a crop of fruit . This season of 1848 , the fruit was as fine as it ever has been ; the bunches , many of them , weighing one and two pounds each ; the berries were large , and well colored . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manures used , were similar to the above ; but , instead of stones , the bottom of the border was paved with bones , and well covered with them ; the vines have always done well , and ripened good crops of fine fruit . The third border was paved , at the bottom , with stones , as whole bones could not be obtained . The manures , in this border , were entirely from the barn-yard , from horses and oxen ; it was very coarse , having much litter and old ( Indian ) cornstalks in it ; the soil was the garden loam , which had been freely manured with barn-yard material ; the proportion of manure added , was one half , certainly , and perhaps , rather more . In this border , the vines have made the most rapid growth of any that I have planted : but the fruit produced therein , although very fair , and well colored , is not large , the berries measuring two and a half to three and a half inches round , for Hamburghs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter-house manures , or the carcasses of animals are added to the compost , the harries measure from three to four inches in circumference . By far the largest part of my borders were made , since the above , in 1843 . Slaughter-house manures , bones , the carcasses of animals , old mortar and bricks , oyster-shells , horse and cow manure , old leather and loam , were added in considerable quantities . I have not discovered any reason for wishing to change the compost . At the end of the house , in a space used for the furnace , no manure was added on the outside , as the street of the city was here , the soil was a good yellow loam , and , on the street , covered with gravel , to notice the difference in the fruiting and growing of the vines , when situated in this unprepared soil , as compared with the compost above , I planted four vines , so situated that three of /z/ them would send their roots mto the street m search of food . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border have ripened three good crops of fruit ; those in the natural soil have not ripened a bunch , and , until this year , have not even set a berrj . One vine , a Hamburgh , has , at present , a very small bunch upon it . The vines have been pruned and well cared for , and I have no reason to suppose that thej will not eventually yield a crop of fair fruit ; that they will be able to bear comparison with the other grapes , in the same house , I do not expect . In 1844 , having occasion to make more border , and hadng a large quantity of stable manure and old leaves , which had been used for covering the roots of the vines in winter , I thought this , if added to the soil in large quantities , which was also a good loam , with some small quantity of cow manure and bones , would insure me a sufficiently good compost . But it was a mistake ; the vines grew slowly , and not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , I have enlarged the border very much , and added strong manure , with many whole bones and twenty bushels of ground ones , with one hundred bushels of charcoal screenings , and as much more old mortar and brickbats , with some considerable wood-ashes mixed with them . The vines are now growing very well , and many , but not all of them , have good crops of fruit upon them . The fruit in this house was small and well colored . In the autumn , watering with liquid manure was resorted to with good effect , yet the difference was very much in favor of the border with the carcasses . More trials with like results , might be added ; however , if these have been properly stated ,  --  and I am certain that my object has been to obtain facts , not to estabhsh theories ,  --  and that these trials have resulted , as above expressed , then there can be no necessity for further testimony of mine , as it all tends the same way , and the mere repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , whether the experiments have been fairly made . I think they have ; that climate and other /z/ circumstances of soil and situation will vary , in some degree , the results of similar trials in other localities is very probable . The effect of different manures in promoting the grotvth of the roots of the vine .  --  This summer , I placed small glass bottles , filled with rainwater , under the stems of grape vines , that had roots about one and a half inches long on them ; they reached the water , touching it sufficiently to encourage the growth in the root ; the bottles were then secured in this position . In seven days , the roots had pushed strongly into the water . I then added different manures , as liquids , to the water , in a very diluted state ; the object being to have the roots of the vine open to view , that the effect of the different manures in producing rootlets or spongioles could be observed . No. 1 , had a grain of guano , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , in forty-eight hours , the rootlets began to put out from the sides of the root , and to consume the liquid . I then took a small teaspoonful of the guano and mixed it with half a gill of water , and , as the Uquid was consumed by the roots in the bottle , it was filled up with this . After a few applications of the guano , the rootlets , which at first put forth and grew freely , ceased to grow , or to consume the liquid ; they soon died , and , on removing the bottle , I found them in a putrid state . This experiment , though unsuccessful , was satisfactory , as it confirmed the opinion I had formed of this manure , that , when applied in a highly diluted form , it is valuable , and that one can not well be too cautious in using it . The second experiment was simple rainwater ; the root in this grew very slowly , and in five or six weeks made only three or four inches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they continued to grow until removed . No. 3 , was manured with the liquid from a teaspoonful of ashes from the wood of the grape , soaked in half a gill of rainwater ; the effect was sudden and great ; and the roots formed so fast , that , in three weeks , there were thousands of feeders in the bottle , and , in bright days , it had to be filled oi /z/ morning and evening ; it very soon used up the first quantity , and had another supply furnished ; this I cut ofi " and planted out ; it is now a growing plant in the border . No. 4 , was manured Avitli the extract from one pound of cow manure , which had been under cover four years , and never exposed to the weather ; it was as free from any offensive smell as the purest spring-water , and was prepared by steeping several days , before using , and was then strained into a bottle . The effect of this was like the above ,  --  from the ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a plant now growing in the border . No. 5 , was the extract of meadow muck , which had been under cover several years ; one pound of the soil , to which was added a very little pot-ash , was steeped in water several days , and strained off into a bottle , and applied as the roots consumed the liquid . This afforded a suitable food , and the spongioles continued to grow and increase rapidly for three weeks , when they received a check , and ceased growing , and were changing color ; the bottle was removed , and the roots placed carefully into one filled with simple rainwater again ; this saved them , and they again began growing . The liquid , which had before proved too powerful , was now supplied them ; as they consumed the water in the bottle , they grew as rapidly as before the check , and formed a fine , strongrooted vine , which is now in the border . No. 6 , was manured with the Hquid drainings from the hog-pen ; although very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In renewing the trial , the liquid which had caused this , was used as the same manure , still further diluted , and the effect was good ; the bottle was filled with roots . No. 7 , was manured with the extract of the leaves and young shoots , trimmings of the grape vine ; these were steeped a few days , and kept warm ; when applied to the water in the bottles , it was quite acid . This destroyed fife wQvj soon , the acid being too powerful . On repeating the /z/ experiment , and after applying the same liquid , when the acidity had passed away , the roots made with vigor and rapidity ; this formed a plant , now flourishing in the soil . No. 8 , was another trial with guano , in a more diluted form ; it did not induce the forming of roots , as did some of the others . The reason of this , undoubtedly , was the powerful nature of this substance , which , in the exposed circumstances of the roots , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow manure and ashes had the most beneficial effect ; that is , they caused the bottles to be filled , in the least time , with roots and rootlets innumerable : although the strength of the liquid was constantly increasing , there did not appear to be any injurious effect therefrom . /z/ The grape vine , in Italy , and in Spain , and the islands of the Mediterranean , as also in its native position , is found to be a plant attaining great age and size ; notwithstanding this , the cultivators of France have so changed its characteristics , that , in some districts there , by their skill , you may find it brought almost to the condition of an annual ; two or three years being the usual time at which they are renewed by layering , and being so close , that it is with difficulty you can pass among them . With regard to soil , they present as striking a contrast ; they are successfully cultivated in vineyards , where there appears scarcely soil sufficient to retain moisture enough to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputations , are situated where the soil is a rich loam . - Climate and exposition , as well as soil and manure , have a great bearing on this cultivation . What these effects are , I trust , has been ( in the language of others , and by notes of my own , ) made sufficiently intelligible to be made of practi- /z/ cable utility . If this has been accomplished , my object in preparing this Treatise has been attained . That the cultivation of the grape , in these United States , is to be vastly increased , there can be no question . How far European theories and modes of cultivation may be suitable here , is yet to be proved . That the grape is susceptible of an almost endless diversity of the modes of cultivation , has been fully established . /z/ Diana Chape.  --  A bunch of this fruit has been sent me , by a gentleman of Lynn , which was raised in his garden this summer ; it was tasted by competent judges , who consider it very good ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor of that variety . As this ripened perfectly , the present year , when the Isabella and Catawba similarly situated did not , it is a strong recommendation in its favor . When the grape is grown on a small scale , and the rosebugs destroy the blossom , covering the bunch with a gauze bag will be found effectual in staying their ravages .
