txt ACHILLE , the eldest son of Murat formerly king of the two Sicilies , is now a planter in Florida . Fleeing from France he came to our country , and found an asylum on our shores , the place of refuge to so many of those stern and restless spirits that once unsettled Europe from her repose . Kings , and princes , and marshals , and nobles , have in turn been forced to take shelter under our eagle , to escape imprisonment and death at home . The life and fate of Murat were forcibly recalled to us , not long since , as we stood in his palace , near Naples-left just as he furnished it , and gazed on his portrait , still hanging where he placed it . It is singular that we have no good biographies of Bonaparte 's distinguished generals . Many of theip being men of striking intellectual qualities , great military ability , heroic courage , and with lives tilled with great actions and thrilling adventures , they furnish materials for most lively and interesting sketches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought strange beings to the surface , of whose existence man never dreamed before . Demagogues and statesmen and orators rose in turn from the heretofore despised mass , and disputed with kings , as if accustomed their lifelong to such encounters . And as the revolution called out what intellectual tbrce was in the French people , so did Bonaparte 's wonderful career bring into the field whatever military talent and genius the nation possessed . The young Corsican , rising steadily by his great achievements from a subaltern in the artillery to the commander-in-chief of the French army , drew all eyes and hearts after him . Besides , the same causes which called out the energies of Napoleon , brought forth also those of other men . The formation of a republican army , led by republican generals , left the field of fame open to every aspirant , and thousands rushed on it , some to succeed and many to fall . This sudden removal of all privileges and prerogatives , and appealing simply to the entire native force and talent of a people , develop strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous growth of our own country exhibits the extent and greatness of this power exerted in the peaceful channels of commerce and internal improvements ; while the empire of France , overshadowing Europe and making playthings of thrones , illustrates the force of this hidden strength when concentrated into armies . The utter breaking up of old systems and old ranks , and the summoning to the battlefield , by a continent in arms , exhausted the entire military talent of France . Three classes of men especially rejoiced in the state of things that made great military deeds the sure road to fame and fortune . The first was composed of those stern and powerful men whose whole inherent force must out in action or slumber on forever . In peaceful times they make but common men , for there is nothing on which they can expend the prodigious active energy they possess ; but in agitated times , when a throne can be won by a strong arm and a daring spirit , they arouse themselves , and move amid the tumult completely at home . At the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern , invincible soldier , who acquired the title of " the bravest of the brave . " A second class of reckless , daring spirits , who love the excitement of danger , and the still greater excitement of gaining or losing every thing on a single throw , always flourish in great commotions . In times of peace they would be distinguished only as roving adventurers or reckless dissipated youth of some country village . In war they often perform desperate deeds , and by their headlong valor secure for themselves a place among those who go down to immortality . At the head of this class stands Marshal Junot , who acquired the sobriquet of " la ternp*te , " " the tempest . " A third class is composed of the few men left of a chivalric age . They have an innate love of glory from their youth , and live more by imagination in the days of knighthood , than amid the practical scenes that surround them . Longing for the field where great deeds are to be * Vie publique et priv*e de JOAcHiM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et contenant des particularit6s inedit6e sur ses premiers ann*es . PARIS . // done , they can not be forced into the severe and steady mental labor necessary to success in ordinary times . To them life is worthless , destitute of bribiant achievements , and there is nothing brilliant that is not outwardly so . In peace such men simjily do nothing , and dream away half their life , while the other half is made up of blunders , and good and bad impulses . But in turbulent times they are your decided characters . The doubts and opposing reasons that distract others have no influence over them . Following their impulses , they move to a higher feeling than the mere calculator of good and evil . At the bead of this class stands , as a patriot , the lazy Patrick Henry , and as a warrior , the chivalric iJurat . The latter , however , was an active , rather than a passive dreamer-pursuing , rather than contemplating , a fancied good , and he acquired the name of the " pricux chevalier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bastide , a little village , twelve miles from Cahors . His father was the landlord of a little tavern in the Ilace . He was honest and industrious , with a large family , differing in no way from the children of any other country landlord , with the exception of Joachim , who was regarded the most reckless , daring boy in the place . He rode a horse like a young Bedouin , and it was around his father 's stable , he first acquired that firm and easy seat in the saddle , that afterwards made him the most remarkable horseman of his age . The high and fiery spirit of the boy marked him out at an early age , as a child of promise , and he became the Benjamin of his parents . The father had once been a steward in the Talleyrand family , and through its influence young Murat was received , at nine years of age , into the college of Cahors , and entered on a course of studies , preparatory to the church . Young Murat was destined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about as much fitted by nature as Talleyrand himself . But nothing could make a scholar of him . Neglecting his studies and engaged in every frolic , he was disliked by his instructors and beloved by his companions . The " Abb* Murat , " as he was jocularly termed , did nothing that corresponded to his title , but on the contrary every thing opposed to it . His teachers prophesied evil of him , and declared him , at length , fit for nothing but a soldier , and they , for once , were right . Leaving Cahors he entered the college at Toulouse no wiser than when he commenced his ecclesiastical education . Many adventures are told of him while at the latter place , which , whether apocryphal or not , were all worthy of the reckless young libertine . At length , falling in love with a pretty girl of the city , he fought for her , and carrying off his prize , lived with her concealed till the last sous was gone , and then appeared among his companions again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing off his professional garb he enlisted in a fit of desperation into a ren iment of chasseurs that happened at that time to be passing 0h the city . Becoming tired of the restraint of the camp , he wrote to his brother to obtain his dismission , which was promised , on condition he would resume his theological studies . The promise was given , and he returned to his hooks , hut the ennui of such a life was greater than that of a camp , and he soon left school and went to his father 's house , and again employed himself in the stables . Disgusted with the business of an ostler , he again entered the army . The third time he became sick of his employmant , and asked for his dismissal . tt was about this time he cheated an old miser out of a hundred francs , by passing off a gilded snuff-box for a gold one . But money was not the motive that prompted him to this trick . A young friend had enlisted in the army , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money , which was out of his power to do . It was to obtain this for his friend , Murat cheated the old man . But the revolution beginning now to agitate Paris , Murat 's spirit took fire , and having obtained a situation in the constitutional guard of Louis Sixteenth , he hastened with young Bessi*res , born in the same village , to the capital , and there laid the foundation of his after career , which made him the most distinguished of Napoleon 's marshals . An ultra-republican ; his sentiments , of which he made no secret , often brought him into difficulty , so that it is said he fought six duels in a single month . At this time he was twenty-two years of age , tall , handsome , and almost perfectly formed , and with a gait and bearing that made him the admiration of every beholder . During the reign of terror he was a violent republican , and advanced through the grades of lieutenant and captain to that of major . In 1795 having been of // some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed to command the army in Italy , made him a member of his personal staffi Here , beside the rising Corsican , commenced his brilliant career . With the words , " Honor and the Ladies , " engraved on the blade of his sword-words characteristic of the chivalric spirit of the man , he passed through the Italian campaign second oniy to Bonaparte in the valorous deeds that were wrought . At Montenotte , Milesimo , Dego , Mondovi , Rivoli , &amp;c. he proved the clear sightedness of Napoleon in selecting him for a companion in the perilous path he had marked out for himself . He was made the bearer of the colors taken in this campaign , to the Directory , and was promoted to the rank of general of brigade . He soon after accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt , where he grew weary and discontented in the new warfare he had to encounter . In the first place , cavalry was less efficient than infantry against the wild Mamelukes . When twenty thousand of those fierce warriors mounted on the fleet steeds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the close and . serried ranks of infantry , and the fixed bayonet could arrest their progress . Besides , what was a charge of cavalry against those fleet horsemen , whose onset and retreat were too rapid for the heavy armed French cuirasseurs to return or pursue . Murat grew desperate in such a position , and was seen with Lannes once to tear off his cockade and trample it in anger under his feet . Besides , the taking of pyramids and deserts was not the kind of victory that suited his nature . But at Aboukir , where he was appointed by Napoleon to force the centre of the Turkish lines , he showed what wild work he could make with his cavalry . He rode straight through the Turkish ranks , and drove column after column into the sea ; and in one of his fierce charges dashed into the camp of Mustapha Pacha , and reining up his magnificent steed beside him , made him prisoner with his own hands . His brilliant achievements in this battle fixed him forever in the affections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few who were to return with him to France . During that long and anxious voyage Murat was by his side , and when the vessel in which they sailed , was forced by adverse winds into the port of Ajac cio , he visited with the hold Corsican the scenes of his childhood . In the revolution of the 18th Brumaire , which placed Bonaparte in supreme power , Joachim took a conspicuous part , and did perhaps more than any other single general for the usurper. in that crisis of Napoleon 's life , when he stalked into the Council of the Five Hundred , already thrown into tumultuous excitement by the news of his usurpation , and the startling cry , " down with the tyrant " met his ear , Murat was by to save him . " Charge bayonets , " said he to the battalion of soldiers under him , and with firm step and leveled pieces they marched into the ball and dissolved the Assembly . Soon after , being at the time thirty-three years of age , he married Caroline Bonaparte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloom and freshness of eighteen . The handsome person and dashing manners of Murat pleased her more than the higher-born Morean . In a fortnight after his marriage he was on his way with his brotherin-law to cross the San Bernard into Italy . At Marengo he commanded the cavalry , and for his great exploits in this important battle , received from the consular government a magnificent sword Bonaparte , as Emperor , never ceased lavishing honors on his favorite brotherin-law . He went up from General of Brigade to General of Division , thea to Commander of the National Guard , Marshal , Grand Admiral , Prince of the Empire , Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor , Grand Duke of Berg and Cleves , and was finally made King of Naples . " The Abbd Murat " had gone through some changes since he was studying theology at Toulouse . It is not our design to enter in detail into the history of Murat , but having given the steps by which be ascended to greatness , speak only of those acts which illustrate the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wertingen , Vienna and Austerlitz , and other fields of fame-in 1806-7 at Jena , Lubeck , Eylau and Friedland-in 1808 overthrowing the Spanish Bourbons , and placing the crown in Napoleon 's hands , he is the same victorious leader and intrepid man . His three distinguishing characteristics were , high chivalric courage , great skill as a general , and almost unparalleled coolness in the hour of extremest peril . Added to all this , Nature had // lavished her gifts on the mere physical man . His form was tall and finely proportioned -- his tread like that of a king-his face striking and noble , while his piercing glance few men could bear . This was Murat on foot , but place him on horseback , and he was still more imposing . He never mounted a steed that was not worthy of the boldest knight of ancient days , and his incomparable seat made both horse and rider an object of universal admiration . The English invariably condemn the theatrical costume he always wore , as an evidence of folly , hut we think it is all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deep thought and compact mind , hut be was an oriental in his tastes , and loved everything gorgeous and imposing . He usually wore a rich Polish dress , with the collar ornamented with gold brocade , ample pantaloons , scarlet or purple , and embroidered with gold ; boots of yellow leather , while a straight diainond-hilted sword , like that worn by the ancient Romaiis , ban0ing from a girdle of gold hrocade , completed his dashing exterior . He wore heavy black whiskers , long black locks which streamed over his shoulders and contrasted singularly with his fiery blue eye . On his bead he wore a three-cornered chapean , from which rose a magnificent white plnme that bent under the profusion of ostrich feathers , while beside it and in the same gold band , towered away a splendid heron plume . Over all this brilliant costume , he wore in cold weather a pelisse of green velvet , lined and fringed with the costliest Snbles . Neither did he forget his horse in this gorgeous appareling , but had him adorned with the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trappings . Had all this finery been piled on a diminutive man , or an indifferent rider like Bonaparte , it would have appeared ridiculous ; but on the splendid charger and still more majestic figure and bearing of Murat , it seemed all in place and keeping . This dazzling exterior always made him a mark for the enemy 's bullets in battle , and it is a wonder that so conspicuous an object was never shot down . Perhaps there never was a greater contrast between two men , than between Murat and Napoleon , when they rode together along the lines previous to battle . The square figure , plain three-cornered hat , leather breeches , brown surtout , and careless seat of Napoleon , were the direct counterpart of the magnificent display and imposing attitude of his chivalric brother-in-law . To see Murat decked out in this extravagant costume at a review , might create a smile , but whoever once saw that gailycaparisoned steed with its commanding rider in the front rank of battle , plunging like a thunderbolt through the broken ranks , or watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high over the tens of thousands that struggled behind it  --  a constant mark to the cannon balls that whistled like hail-stones around it-never felt like smiling again at Murat . Especially would he forget those gilded trappings when he saw him return from a charge , with his diamondhilted sword dripping with blood , his gay uniform riddled with balls and singed and blackened with powder , while his strong war-horse was streaked with foam and blood , and reeking with sweat . That white plume was the banner to the host he led , and while it continued fluttering over the field of the slain , hope was never relinquished . Many a time has Napoleon seen it crlancino. like a beam of light 0 b to the charge , and watched its progress like the star of his destiny , as it struggled for awhile in the hottest of the fight , and then smiled in joy as he beheld it burst through the thick ranks of infantry , scattering them from his path like chaff before the wind . We said the three great distinguishing traits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , and wonderful coolness in the hour of danger . Napoleon once said , that in battle he was probably the bravest man in the world . There was something more than mere success to him in a battle . He invested it with a sort of glory in itself-threw an air of romance about it all , and fought frequently , we believe , almost in an imaginary world . The device on his sword , so like the knights of old-his very costume copied from those warriors who lived in more chivalric days , and his heroic manner and bearing , as he led his troops into battle , prove him to he wholly unlike all other generals of that time . In his person at least , he restored the days of knighthood . He himself unconsciously lets out this peculiarity , in speaking of his battle on Mount Tabor with the Turks . On the top of this bill , Kleber with 5,000 men , found himself hemmed in by 30,000 Turks . Fifteen thousand cavalry first came thundering down on this band of 5,000 arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours they maintained that unequal combat , when Napoleon arrived with succor on a neighboring hill . As he looked down on Mount labor , he could see nothing but a countless multitude covering the summit of the hill , and swaying and tossing amid the smoke that curtained them in . It was only by the steady vollies and simultaneous flashes of musketry , that he could distinguish where his own brave soldiers maintained their ground . The shot of a solitary twelve pounder , which he fired toward the mountain , first announced to his exhausted countrymen that relief was at hand . The ranks then , for the first time , ceased acting on the defensive , and extending themselves charged bayonet . It was against such terrible odds Murat loved to fight , and in this engagement he outdid himself . He regarded it the greatest battle he ever fought . Once he was nearly alone in the centre of a large body of Turkish cavalry . All around , nothing was visible but a mass of turbaned heads and flashing scimetars , except in the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rent banner over the throng . For a while the battle thickened where it stooped and rose , as Murat 's strong war-horse reared and plunged amid the sabre strokes that fell like lightning on every side ,  --  and then the multitude surged back , as a single rider burst through covered with his own blood and those of his foes , and his arm red to the elbow that grasped his dripping sword . His steed staggered under him and seemed ready to fall , while the blood poured in streams from his sides . But Murat 's eye seemed to burn with four-fold lustre , and with a shout , those who surrounded him never forgot to their latest day , he wheeled his exhausted steed on the foe , and at the head of a body of his own cavalry trampled everything down that opposed his progress . Speaking of this terrible fight , Murat said that in the hottest of it he thought of Christ , and his transfiguration on that same spot nearly two thousand years before , and it gave him ten-fold courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rank on the spot This single fact throws a flood of light on Murat 's character , and shows what visions of glory often rose before him in battle , giving to his whole movement and aspect , a greatness and dignity that could not be assumed . None could appreciate this chivalrous bearing of Murat more than the wild Cossacks . In the memorable Russian campaign , he was called from his throne at Naples to take command of the cavalry , and performed prodigies of valor in that disastrous war . When the steeples and towers of Moscow at length rose on the sight , Murat , looking at his soiled and battle-worn garments , declared them unbecoming so great an occasion as the triumphal entrance into the Russian capital , and retired and dressed himself in his most magnificent costume , and thus appareled , rode at the head of his squadrons into the deserted city . The Cossacks had never seen a man that would compare with Murat in the splendor of his garb , the beauty of his horsemanship , and , more than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of the desert would often stop , amazed , and gaze in silent admiration , as they saw him dash , single-handed , into the thickest of their ranks , and scatter a score of their most renowned warriors from his path , as if he were a bolt from heaven . His effect upon these children of nature , and the prodigies he wrought among them , seem to belong to the age of romance rather than to our practical times . They never saw him on his magnificent steed , sweeping to the charge , his tall white plume streaming behind him , without sending up a shout of admiration before they closed in conflict . In approaching Moscow , Murat , with a few troops , had left Gjatz somewhat in advance of the grand army , and finding himself constantly annoyed by the hordes of Cossacks that hovered around him , now wheeling away in the distance , and now dashing up to his columns , compelling them to deploy , lost all patience , and obeying one of those chivalric impulses that so often hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse , and galloping all alone up to the astonished squadrons , halted right in front of them , and cried out in a tone of command , " Clear the way , reptiles ! " Awed by his manner and voice , they immediately dispersed . During the armistice , while the Russians were evacuating Moscow , these soiis of the wilderness flocked by thousands around him . As they saw him reining his high-spirited steed towards them , they sent up a shout of applause , and rushed forward to gaze on one they had seen carrying such terrors through their ranks . They called him their " hetman , "  --  the highest honor they could confer on him  --  and kept up // an incessant jargon as they examined him and his richly caparisoned horse . They would now point to his steednow to his costume , and then to his white plume , while they fairly recoiled before his piercing glance . Murat was so much pleased by the homage of these simple-hearted warriors , that he distributed among them all the money he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and *nally his watch , and then the watches of his friends . He had made many presents to them before ; for often , in battle , he would select out the most distinguished Cossack warrior , and plunging directly into the midst of the enemy , engage him single-handed , and take him prisoner , and afterwards dismiss him with a gold chain about his neck or some other rich ornament attached to his person . We said , also , he was a good general , though we know this is often disputed . Nothing is more common than the belief that an impulsive , headlong man can not be clear-headed , while history proves that few others ever accomplish anything . From Alexander down to Bonaparte , your impetuous beings have always had the grandest plans , and executed them . Yet , men will retain their prejudices , and you can not convince them that the silent , grave owl is not wiser than the talkative parrot , though the reverse is indisputably true . There could hardly be a more impetuous man than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounder judgment than all his generals put together . Murat 's impulses were often stronger than his reason , and in that way detracted from his generalship . Besides , he was too brave , and never counted his enemy . He seemed to think he was not made to be killed in battle , or to be defeated . Bonaparte had great confidence in his judgment when he was cool , and consulted him perhaps more than any other of his generals upon the plan of an anticipated battle . On these occasions Murat never flattered , but expressed his opinions in the plainest , most direct language , and often differed materially from his brotherin-law . Perhaps no one ever had greater skill than Napoleon in judging of the position of the emiemy ; amid in the midst of battle , and in the confusion of conflicting columns , his perceptions were like lightning . Yet , in these great qualities , Murat was nearly his equal . His plans were never reckless , but the manner he carried them out was desperation itself . Said Bonaparte of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field  --  the best cavalry officer in the world . " Murat loved Bonaparte with supremne devotion , and bore with his impatience and irascibility , amid even dissipated them by his good humor . Once , however , Bonaparte irritated him beyond endurance . Murat foresaw the result of a march to Moscow , and expostulated with his brother-in-law omi the perilous undertaking . The dispute ran high , and Murat pointed to the lateness of the season , and the inevitable ruin imi which the winter , so close at hand , would involve the army . Bonaparte , more passionate than usual , because he felt that Murat had the right of it , as he had , a few days before , when he besought him not to attack Smoleusko because the iRussiamis would evacuate it of their own accord , made some reply which was heard only by the latter , but which stung him so to the quick that he simply replied , " A march to Moscow will he the destruction of the army , " and spurred his horse straight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in some sore spot , and he determimied to wipe out the disgrace by his denth . Be ordered all his guard to leave him , and sat there on his magnificent steed , with his piercing eye turned full on the battery , calmly waiting the ball that should shatter himim . A more striking subject for a pi9ture was scarce ever furnished than lie exhibited in that attitude . There stood his bigh-mettled amid richly caparisoned charger , with arching neck and dilated eye , giving ever and anon a slight shiver at each explosion of the artillery that ploughed up the turf at his feet , while Murat , in his splendid attire , sat calmly omi his hack , with his ample breast turned full on the fire , and his proud lip curled in defiance , and his tall white phumne waving to and fro in the air , as the bullets whistled by it-the impersonation of calm courage and heroic daring . At length , casting his eye round , he saw General Belliard still by his side . He asked him why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " is master of his own life , and as your Majesty seems determined to dispose of your own , 1 must be allowed to fall beside you . " This fidelity and love struck the generous heart of Murat , and he turned his horse and galloped out of the fire . The affection of a single mami could conquer him , at any time , whom // the enemy seemed unable to overcome . His own life was nothing , hut the life of a friend was surpassingly dear to him . As proof that he was an able general as well as a brave man , we need only refer to the campaign of 1805 . He commenced this campaign by the victory of Wertingen-took three thousand prisoners at Languenau , advanced upon Neresheim , charged the enemy and made three thousand prisoners , marched to Norlingen and compelled the whole division of XVeernesk to surrender , heat Prince Ferdinand , and hurrying after the enemy , overtook the rear guard of the Austrians , charged them and took 500 prisonerstook Ens , and again heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1800 prisoners -- pushed on to Saint Pollen , entered Vienna , and without stopping , pressed on after the Russians , and overtaking their rear guard , made 2,000 prisoners , and crowned his rapid , brilliant career with prodigies of valor that filled all Europe with admiration , on the field of Austerlitz. in that battle , Murat , as usual , was stationed behind the lines with the cavalry . It was to him that Bonaparte always looked to complete his victories . It is hard to describe the conflicts of cavalry , for it is a succession of shocks , each lasting but a short time , while the infantry will struggle for hours , enabling one to view and describe every step and stage of the contest . Hence it is , that in descriptions of battles the separate deeds of cavalry officers are slightly passed over  --  the shock and the overthrow prevent the proper appreciation of individual acts . Nothing could exceed the grandeur of the scene on which the " sun of Austerlitz " arose . A hundred and fifty-five thousand men met in mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and victory wavered , while the rapidly falling columns and the ensanguined , cumbered field , told how awful was the carnage . But amid the roar of a thousand cannon and the incessant discharge of musketry , the muffled sound of Murat 's terrible shocks of cavalry was heard , making the battle field tremble beneath their feet . Nothing , it is said , could be more awful than this dull , heavy sound of his charging squadrons , rising at regular intervals over the roar of combat . Bonaparte usually put fifteen or twenty thousand cavalry under Murat , and placed them in reserve behind the lines , and when he ordered the charge he was almost certain of victory . After a long and wasting fight , in which the infantry struggled with almost equal success , and separate bodies of cavalry had efl*cted but little , Bonaparte would order him down with his enormous weight of cavalry . It is said that his eye always brightened as he saw that ma*nificent 0 body begin to move , and he watched the progress of that single white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intensest interest . Where it went he knew were broken ranks and trampled men , and while it went he knew that defeat was impossible . Like Ney , he carried immense moral force with him . Not only were his followers inspired by his personal appearance and incredible daring , but he had acquired the reputation of being invincible , and when he ordered the charge , every man , both friend and foe , knew it was to be the most desperate one human power could make . And then the appearance of 20,000 horsemen coming down on the dead gallop , led by such a man , was enough to send terror through any infantry . The battle o a en tina exhibited an instance of this moral force of Murat . He had ordered Junot to cross a marshy flat and charge the flank of the Russians while he poured his strong cuircsseurs on the centre . Charging like a storm with his own men , he was surprised to find that Junot had not obeyed his command . Without waiting for his guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting fire , rode up to him and demanded why he had not obeyed his order . Junot replied that he could not induce the Westphalian cavalry to stir , so dreadful was the fire where they were ordered to advance . Murat made no reply , but reining his steed up in front of the squadron , waved his sword over his head and dashed straight into the sharp shooters , followed by that hitherto wavering cavalry as if they bad forgotten there was such a thing as danger . The Russians were scattered like pebbles from his path ; then turning to Junot , he said , " There , thy marshal 's staff is half earned for thee ; do the rest thyself . " At Jena , after the Prussians began their retreat in an orderly manner , and no efforts of the infantry could break their array , Bonaparte ordered Murat to charge . With 12,000 horsemen following hard after him , cheering as they came , he fell on the exhausted columns and trampled them like grass beneath his feet , and // although Ruchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing could resist the fury of Murat 's successive onsets , and the defeat was changed into a general rout . We find him also at Friedland , bursting with his impetuous charges through the allied ranks . But it is at Eylau that he always appears to us in his most terrible aspect . This battle , fought in mid winter , in 1807 , was the most important and dreadful one that had yet occurred . France and Russia had never before opposed such strength to each other , and a complete victory on either side would have settled the fate of Europe . Bonaparte remained in posses. sion of the field , and that was all-no victory was ever so like a defeat , and Murat alone saved him . The field of Eylau was covered with snow , and the little ponds that lay scattered over it were frozen sufficiently hard to bear the artillery . Seventy-five thousand men on one side , and eighty-five thousand on the other , arose from the field of snow on which they had slept the night of the 7th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a continent . Augereau , on the left , was utterly routed early in the morning . Advancing through a snow-storm so thick he could not see the enemy , the Russian cannon , fired half at random , mowed down his ranks with their destructive fire , while the Cossack cavalry , which were ordered to charge , came thundering on , almost hitting the French infantry with their long lances before they were visible through the driving snow . Hemmed about and overthrown , the whole division composed of 16,000 men , with the exception of 1,500 , were captured or slain . Just then the snow storm clearing up , revealed to Napoleon the remnant of Augereau s division scattered and flying over the field , while four thousand Russians were close to the hill on which he stood with only a hundred men around him . Saving himself from being made prisoner by his cool self possession , he saw , at a glance , the peril to which he was brought by the destruction of Augereau and the defeat of Soult , and immediately ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry . Nothing was farther from Bonaparte 's wishes or expectations than the bringing of his reserve cavalry into the engagement at this early stage of the battle -- but there was no other resource left him . Murat sustained his high reputation on this occasion , and proved himself for the hundredth time worthy of the great confidence Napoleon placed in him . Nothing could be more imposing than the battle field at this moment . Bonaparte and the Empire trembled in the balance , while Murat prepared to lead down his cavalry to save them . Seventy squadrons , making in all 14,000 well mounted men , began to move over the slope . Bonaparte , it is said , was more agitated at this crisis than when , a moment before , he was so near being captured by the Russians . But as he saw those seventy squadrons come down on a plunging trot , and then break into a full gallop , pressing hard after the white plume of Murat , that streamed through the snow storm far in front , a smile passed over his countenance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , and the front line of the Russian army went down likefrost work before it . Then commenced one of those protracted fights of hand-tohand and sword-to-sword , so seldom witnessed in cavalry . The clashing of steel was like the ringing of a thousand anvils , and horses and riders were blended in wild confusion together . The Russian reserve were ordered up , and on these Murat fell with his fierce cavalry , crushing and trampling them down by thousands . But the obstinate Russians disdained to fly , and rallied again and again , so that it was no longer cavalry charging on infantry , hut squadrons of horse galloping through a broken host that , gathering into knots , still disputed with unparalleled bravery the ensanguined field . it was during this strange fight that Murat was seen to perform one of those desperate deeds for which he was so renowned . Excited to the highest pitch of passion by the obstacles that opposed him , he seemed endowed with ten-fold strength , and looked more like a superhuman being treading down helpless mortals , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle of musketry , and falling of sabrestrokes like lightning about him , that lofty white plume never once went down , while ever and anon it was seen glancing through the smoke of battle the star of hope to Napoleon , and showing that his " right arm " was still uplifted and striking for an empire . He raged like an unloosed lion amid the foe ; and his eye , always terrible in battle , burned with increased lustre , while his clear and steady voice , heard above the tumult of the // strife , was worth more than a thousand trumpets to cheer on his followers . At length , seeing a knot of Russian soldiers that had kept up a devouring fire on his men , he wheeled his horse and drove in full gallop upon their leveled muskets . A few of his guard , that never allowed that white plume to leave their sight , charged after . Without waiting to count his foes , he seized the bridle in his teeth , and with a pistol in one hand and his drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallop upon them , and scattered them as if a hurricane had swept hy . Though the cavalry were at length compelled to retire , the Russians had received a check that alone saved the day . Previously , without bringing up their reserve , they were steadily advancing over the field , hut now they were glad to cease the combat and *vait for further reinforcements under Lesboeg , before they renewed the battle . We need not speak of the progress of the contest during the day . 0ies of valor were performed on all sides , and men slain by tens of thousands , till night at length closed the awful scene , and the Russians began to retire from the field . Such was the battle of Eylau , fought in the midst of a piercing snow storm . Murat was a thunderbolt on that day , and the deeds that were wrought by him will ever furnish themes for the poet and painter . But let the enthusiast go over the scene on the morning after the battle , if he would find a cure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled across each other in the short space of sx miles , while the snow , giving hack the stain of blood , made the field look like one great slaughter-house . The frosts of a wintry morning were all unheeded in the burning fever of ghastly wounds , and the air was loaded with cries for help , and groans , and blasphemies , and cursings . Six thousand horses lay amid the slain , some stiff and cold in death , others rendering the scene still more awful by their shrill cries of pain . The cold heavens looked down on this fallen multitude , while the l ) ale faces of the thousands that were already stiff in death , looked still more appalling in their vast winding-sheet of snow . Foemen had fallen across each other as they fought , and lay like brothers clasped in the last embrace ; while dismembered limbs and disembowelled corpses were scattered thick as autumn leaves over the field . Every form of wound , and every modification of wo were here visible . No mo ( lern war had hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged , there the slain lay thickest . That Bonaparte had confidence in Murat 's generalship , is seen in the command he entrusted him with in Spain , and also in appointing him commander-in-chief of the Grand Army in its retreat from Russ*a . We have said little of his conquest of Spain , because it was done without effort . The sudden rising of the population ofMadrid , inwhich were slaughtered seven hundred Frenchmen , was followed by the public execution of forty of the mob . Much effort has been made to fix a stain on Murat by this execution , and the destruction of some hundred previously , in the attempt to quell the insurrection ; by calling it a premeditated massacre . But it was evidently not so . Murat was imprudent there is no doubt , and acted with duplicity , nay , treachery , . in all his dealings with the royal family of Spain , but we also believe he acted under instructions , lie doubtless hoped to receive the crown of Spain , but Bonaparte forced it on his brother Joseph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Of his civil administration we can not say much in praise . He was too ignorant for a king , and was worthless in the cabinet . The diplomacy of a battle-field he understood , and the management of 20,000 cavalry was an easier thing than the superintendence of a province . Strength of resolution , courage and military skill he was not wanting in , while in the qualities necessary to the administration of a government , he was utterly deficient , lie was conscious of his inferiority here , and knew that his imperial brother-in-law , who gazed on him in admiration , almost in awe , in the midst of battle , made sport of him as a king . These things , together with some unsuccessful efforts of his own , exasperated him to such a degree that he became sick and irresolute . Four years of his life passed away in comparative idleness , and it was only the extensive preparations of Napoleon in 1812 to invade Russia , that roused him to be his former self . Bonaparte 's treatment of him while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that transpired in the Russian campaign , conspired to embitter Murat 's feelings towards his imperious brotherin-law ; for his affection , which till that time , was unwavering , began then to vacillate. // We think that it had been more than hinted to him by his brother-in-law that he intended to deprive him of his crown . At least , not long after Bonaparte left the wreck of the grand army in its retreat from Russia in his hands , he abandoned his post , and traveled night and day till he reached Naples . It is also said by an acquaintance of Murat , that Bonaparte at the birth of the young Duke of Parma , announced to the King of Naples , who had come to Paristo congratulate him , that he must lay down his crown . Murat asked to be allowed to give his reply the next morning , but no sooner was he out of the Emperor 's presence than he mounted his horse and started for his kingdom . He rode night and dny till he reached Naples , where he immediately set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being summoned anew by a marshal of France , sent to him for that purpose , to give up his sceptre , he replied , " Go , tell your master to come and take it , and he shall find how well sixty thousand men can defend it . " Rather than come to open conflict with one of his bravest generals he abandoned the project , and let Murat occupy his throne . If this be true it accounts for the estrangement and final desertion of Napoleon by his brother-in-law , in 1814 he concluded a treaty with Austria , by which he was to retain his crown on the condition he would furnish 30,000 troops for the common cause . Bonaparte could not at first credit this defection of the husband of his sister , and wrote to him twice on the subject . The truth is , we believe , Bonaparte tampered with the affection of Murat . The latter had so often yielded to him on points where they differed , and had followed him through his wondrous career with such constant devotion , that Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked , and became utterly reckless of his feelings . But he found the intrepid soldier could be trifled with too far , and came to his senses barely in time to prevent an utter estrangement . Shortly after , Napoleon abdicated , and was sent to Elba . But before the different powers of Europe had decided whether they should allow Murat to retain his throne , Europe was thrown into consternation by the announcement that Bonaparte was again on the shores of France . Joachim immediately declared in favor of his brother-in-law , and attempted to rouse Italy . But his army deserted him , and hastening back to Naples he threw himself into the arms of his wife , exclaiming , " all is lost , Caroline , but my life , and that I have not been able to cast away . " Finding himself betrayed on every side , he fled in disguise to Ischia . Sailing from thence to France , he landed at Cannes , and dispatched a courier to Fouch* , requesting him to inform Napoleon of his arrival . Bonaparte irritated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had precipitated things so in Italy , contrary to his express directions , sent back the simple reply , " to remain where he was until the Emperor 's pleasure with regard to him was known . " This cold answer threw Murat in a tempest of passion . He railed against his brother-in-law , loading him with accusations , for whom , he said , he had lost his throne and kin a dom . Wishing , however , to be nearer Paris he started for Lyons , and while changing horses at Aubagne , near Marseilles , he was told of the disastrous battle of Waterloo . Hastening back to Toulon , he lay concealed in a house near the city , to await the result of this last overthrow of Napoleon . When he was informed of his abdication , he scarcely knew what to do . At first he wished to get to Paris , to treat personally with the allied soveriegas for his safety . Being unable to do this , he thought of flying to England , but hesitating to do this also , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through Fouch* , obtained permission of the emperor of Austria to settle in his dominions . But while he was preparing to set out , he was told that a band of men were on the way to seize him , in order to get the 40,000 francs which the Bourbons had offered for his head ; and fled with a single servant to a desolate place on the sea shore near TouIon . Thither his friends from the city secretly visited him , and informed him what were the designs respecting him . Resolving at last to proceed to Paris by sea , he engaged the captain of a vessel bound to Havre , to send a boat at night to take him off . But by some strange fatality , the seamen could not find Mutat , nor he the seamen , though searching for each other half the night ; and the sea beginning to rise , the boat was compelled to return to the ship without him . As the morning broke over the coast , the dejected wanderer saw the vessel , with all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // gazed for awhile on the lessening masts , and then fled to the woods , where he wandered about for two days , without rest or food . At length , drenched with rain , exhausted and weary , he stumbled on a miserable cabin , where he found an old woman , who kindly gave him food and shelter . He gave himself out as belonging to the garrison at Toulon , and he looked worn and haggard enough to be the commonest soldier . The white plume was gone , that had floated over so many battle fields , and the dazzling costume , that had glanced like a meteor through the cloud of war , was exchanged for the soiled garments of an outcast . Not even his good steed was left , that had borne him through so many dangers , and as that tall and majestic form stooped to enter the low door of the cabin , he felt how changeful was human fortune . The fields of his fame were far away-his throne was gone , and the wife of his bosom ignorant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his humble fare , the owner of the cabin , a soldier belonging to the garrison of Toulon , entered , and bade him welcome . But there was something about the wanderer 's face that struck him , and at length remembering to have seen those features on some French coin , he fell on his knees before him , and called him king Murat . His wife followed his example . Murat , astonished at the discovery , and then overwhelmed at the evidence of affection these poor , unknown people offered him , raised them to his bosom , and gave them his blessing . Forty thousand francs were no temptation to this honest soldier and his wife . Here he lay concealed , till one night the old woman saw lights approaching the cabin , and immediately suspecting the cause , aroused Murat , and hastening him into the garden , thrust him into a hole , and piled him over with vine branches . She then returned to the house , and arranged the couch from which Murat had escaped , and began herself to undress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ordinary household arrangements . In a few moments sixty gens d'armes entered , and ransacked the house and garden , passing again and again by the spot where Murat was concealed . Foiled in their search , they at length went away . But such a spirit as Murat 's could not long endure this mode of existence , and he determined to put to sea . Having , through his friends at Toulon , obtained a skiff , he on the night of the 22d of August , with only three attendants , boldly pushed his frail boat from the beach , and launched out into the broad Mediterranean , and steered for Corsica . When about thirty miles from the shore , they saw and bailed a vessel , but she passed without noticing them . The wind now began to rise , and amid the deepening gloom was heard the moaning of the sea , as it gathers itself for the tempest . The foam crested waves leaped by , deluging the frail skiff ; that struggled almost hopelessly with the perils that environed it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cavalry could scatter , and he sat and looked out on the rising deep , with the same composure he so often had sat on his gallant steed , when the artillery was mowing down every thing at his side . At length the **25;1215;TOOLONG for Corsica was seen advancing towards them . Scarcely had Murat and his three faithful followers stepped aboard of it , before the frail skill sunk to the bottom . It would have been better for him had it sunk sooner . He landed at Corsica in the disguise of a common soldier . The mayor of the Commune of Bastia , the port where the vessel anchored , seeing a man at his door , with a black silk bonnet over his brows , his beard neglected , and coarsely clad , was about to question him , when the man looked up , and " judge of my astonishment , " says he , " when I discovered that this was Joachim , the splendid king of Naples ! I uttered a cry , and fell on my knees . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk bonnet , and the gold brocade for the coarse gaiters of a common soldier . The Corsicans received him with enthusiasm , and as he entered Ajaccio , the troops on the ramparts and the populace teceived him with deafening cheers . But this last shadow of his old glory consummated his ruin . It brought back to his memory the shouts that were wont to rend Naples when he returned from the army to his kingdom , loaded with honors and heralded by great deeds . In the enthusiasm of the moment , he resolved to return to Naples , and make another stand for his throne . At this critical period the passports of the emperor of Austria arrived . Murat was promised a safe passage into Austria , and an unmolested residence in any city of Bohemia , with the title of Count , if he , in return , would renounce the throne of Naples , and live in obedience to the laws . Dis // daining the conditions he would a few weeks before have gladly accepted , he madly resolved to return to Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small vessels , he sailed for his dominions . The little fleet , heat back by adverse winds , that seemed rebuking the rash attempt , did not arrive in sight of Calabria till the sixth of October , or eight days after his embarkation . Oa that very night a storm scattered the vessels , and when the morning broke , Murat 's hark was the only one seen standing in for land . Two others at length joined him , but that night one of the captains deserted him , and returned with fifty of his best soldiers to Corsica . His remaining followers , seeing that this desertion rendered their cause hopeless , besought him to abandon his project and sail for Trieste , and accept the terms of Austria . He consented , and throwing the proclamations he had designed for the Neapolitans into the sea , ordered the captain to steer for the Adriatic . He refused , on the ground that he was not sufficiently provisioned for so long a voyage . He promised , however , to obtain stores at Pizzo , but refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murat still had in his possession , to use in case of need . This irritated Murat to such a degree , that he resolved to go on shore himself , and ordering his officers to dress in full uniform , they approached Pizzo . His officers wished to land first , to feel the pulse of the people , but Murat , with his accustomed chivalric feeling , stopped them , and with the exclamation , " I must be the first on shore ! " sprang to land , followed by twenty-eight soldiers and three domestics . Some few mariners cried out , " Lono live King Joachim ! " and Murat advanced to the principal square of the town , where the soldiers were exercising , while his followers unfurled his standard , and shouted , " Joachim for ever ! " but the soldiers made no response . Had Murat been less infatuated , this would have sufficed to convince him of the hopelessness of his cause . He pressed on , however to Monte Leone , the capital of the province , hut had not gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gens d'armes . Hoping to subdue them by his presence , he turned towards them and addressed them . The only answer he received was a volley of musketry . Forbidding his followers to return the fire , with the declaration that his landing 611 should not cost the blood of one of his people , he turned to flee to the shore . Leaping from rock to rock and crag to crag , while the bullets whistled about him , he at length reached the beach when , Jo ! the vessel that landed him : had disappared . The infamous captain had purposely left him to perish . A fishing-boat lay on the sand , and Murat sprang against it to shove it nfl ; but it was fast . His few followers now came up , hut before the boat could he launched they were surrounded by the bloodthirsty populace . Seeing it was all over , Murat advanced towards them , and holding out his sword , said , " People of Pizzo ! take this sword , which has been so often drawn at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave men with me . " But they heeded him not , and kept up a rapid discharge of musketry ; and though every bullet was aimed at Murat , not one touched him , while almost every man by his side was shot down . Being at length seized , he was hurried away to prison . Soon after , an order caine from Naples to have him tried on the spot . One adjutant-general , one colonel , two lieutenant-colonels , and the same number of captains and lieutenants , constituted the commission to try a King . Murat refused to appear before such a tribunal , and disdained to make any defence . During the trial he conversedin prison with his friends in a manner worthy of his great reputation . He exhibited a loftiness of thought and character that surprised even his friends that had known him longest . At length , after a pause , he said : " Both in the court and camp , the national welfare has been my sole object . 1 have used the public revenues for the public service alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my death I have no wealth but my actions . They are all my glory and my consolation . " After talking in this strain for some time , the door opened and one of the commissioners entered and read the sentence . Murat showed no agitation , but immediately sat down and calmly wrote to his wife the following letter . " My DEAR CAROLINE-My last hour has arrived ; in a few moments more I shall have ceased to live -- in a few moments more you will have no husband . Never forget me ; my life has been stained by no injustice . Farewell my Achille , farewell my Letitia , farewell my Lucien , farewell my Louise . 1 leave you without kingdom or fortune , in the midst of the multitude of // my enemies . Be always united : prove yourselves superior to misfortune ; remember what you are and what you have been , and God will bless you . Do not reproach roy memory . Believe that my greatest suflhring in my last moments is dying far from my children . Receive your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koep always present to you the memory of your unfortunate father , JOACHIM NAPOLEON . Pizzo , 13th October , 1S15 . " Having then enclosed some locks of his hair to his wife , and given his watch to his faithful valet , Amand , he walked out to the place of execution . His tall form was drawn up to its loftiest height , and that piercing blue eye that had flashed so brightly over more than a hundred battle fields , was now calmly turned on the soldiers who were to fire on him . Nota breath of agitation disturbed the perfect composure of his face , and when all was ready he kissed a cornelian he held in his hand , on which was cut the head of his wife , and then fixing his eyes steadily upon it , said , " Save my face , aim at my heart ! " A volley of musketry answered , and Murat was no more . lie had fought two hundred battles , and exposed himself to death more frequently than any other officer in Napoleon 's army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark for the enemy 's bullets , he notwithstanding always plunged into the thickest dangers , and it seems almost fi miracle that he escaped death . His self-composure was wonderful , especially when we remember what a creature of impulse he was . In the most appalling dangers , under the fire of the most terrific battery , all alone amid his dead followers , while the bullets were piercing his uniform and whistling in an incessant shower around his head , he would sit on his steed and eye every discharge with the coolness of an iron statue . A lofty feeling in the hour of danger bore him above all fear , and through clouds of smoke and the roar of five hundred cannon , he would detect at a glance the weak point of the enemy , and charge like fire upon it . As a general he failed frequently , as has been remarked , from yielding his judgment to his impulses . As a man and king he did the same thing , and hence was generous to a fault , and lil5eral and indulgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early life rendered him unfit for a statesman . Yet his impulses , had they been less strong , would not have made him the officer he was . His cavalry was the terror of Europe . Besides , in obeying his generous feelings , he performed many of those deeds of heroism-exposing his life for others , an ( l sacrificing everything he had , to render those happy around him , which make us love his character . He was romantic even till his death , and lived in an atmosphere of his own creation . But unlike Ney , he was ashamed of his low origin , and took every method to conceal it . He loved his wife and children and country with the most devoted affections . His life was the strangest romance ever written , and his ignominious death , an everlasting blot on Ferdinand 's character . The book to which we referred at the head of this article is utterly unworthy its title . Written by a believer in " the divine right of kings , " and a scorner of plebeian blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than , " the hutcher of the army . " Not deigning to describe a single battle , half the book is taken up with incidents of Murat 's early life , and the other half with an account of his amorous adventures after his marriage with Caroline Bonaparte . He puts a great many silly speeches into his mouth , and describes a great many amours , for the truth of which we have his assertions alone . That the moral character of Murat could not he very correct according to our standard , is evident from the fact that his life was spent in the camp . The only way to judge of such a man , is to balance his actions , and see whether the good or evil preponderates . But whatever his faults were , it will be a long time before the world will see such another man.
