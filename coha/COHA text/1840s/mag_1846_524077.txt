txt BEFORE our present number can be disseminated , and its contents fairly digested , a very important election is to be made by the people of the State of New York , between the old and the new Constitution . The question of a new Constitution for the State of New-York is a question that concerns the Union . The action of a leading member of the confederacy naturally influences the conduct of all the rest , both by affording example and provoking to imitation . The political spirit of the Empire State may invigorate or enfeeble , purify or contaminate , the temper of the nation . And if , where there is a comparatively settled and sober tate of feeling , where the landmarks are not new and the attachments not recent , where the prudence and phlegm of comparative age and experience operate as an invisible restraint-if in a State like New York there is a revolutionary , fickle and radical spirit in politics , if law is there held light and variable , if change is regarded with indifference or with relish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excitable children of the family ? Should grave old Massachusetts forget her staid propriety in the least degree , or for a moment , a fit of reckless levity might be looked for and be pardoned in daughters of the Union yet in their teens ! If broad-shouldered , heavy-sided New York is seen capering in the air , and flinging her Constitution about as a plaything , what mad pranks may we not expect from the light limbs and nimble blood of the younger children of the confederacy , who naturally take their manners from their matronly sisters ? We trust the jealousy of state rights and the independent sovereignty doctrine are not to be carried into the region of moral obligation . If we are not responsible to each other 's legislatures , we are to each other 's public sentiment . We each owe to each other and to the Union , to consider in our State politics , what is profitable for the whole country , and for the sister States . New York has no moral right to ignore the consequences of her policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ! As an organ of the Whig party of the Union , and of the national conservatism , we demand that New York shall consider whether or no her example is to be followed and can be recommended to the other States of this Union We are pledged to " stand by the Constitution , " the sacred instrument of our National Liberties . We hold the Constitutions of the separate States , so far as they are in the spirit of the American Magna Charta , to be part and parcel of it . And when , in any particular State , there is an invasion of the principles , or a grieving of the spirit , of the National Constitution , although only in a local form and degree , we hold ourselves pledged by our motto to strike then and there // for the Constitution . If our National Constitution decays , it will perish by the withering of the branches , not of worms at the root . If , over-loaded with political fruit , and civil and social blessings , the branches proudly refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous , luxuriance , and so break with the weight of their unguarded greatness , the parent trunk must die of the bleeding wounds in her limbs , however sound her own stock , or deep struck her roots . We feel , therefore , that we stand by the Union , when we stand by her children ; that as a mother pines with the sickness of her children , and convalesces with their recovery , we save the Parent Constitution , when we heal or protect the Constitution of her daughters . And let us not forget , as lovers of the Union , as sticklers for the federal existence and rights of the country , that an example safe for .. a State like New York to give , may be fatal to other States to follow , and so fatal to the Union . Whatever may be the Constitution of the Empire State , there ezists there a public sentiment which is comparatively conservative . We are relatively an established and settled community , with some saving prescriptive customs , feelings , and objects of veneration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old World to catch the breath of her venerable experience , disinfected by the great ocean over which it sweeps , and ifivaluable to them in its viewless influence-an influence the more legitimate , because owing everything to its intrinsic worth , and nothing to bare authority . They possess a literature , a pulpit , seats of learning , and social customs and usages , which are all highly conservative . They can bear much latitude in their political manners , and much vicissitude in their written laws , because both are interpreted and applied by an unwritten law , which does not partake their licentiousness or variableness . But it is not so with others , and many of the States . Their Constitutions and laws are meant for , and construed as , business papers ; referred to as practical and precise guides of conduct . Every article in them tells upon the character of the people . If radicalism and ancient unrepresentative democracy are theoretically recognized in their instruments of government , they will get practically embodied in their state conduct and civil , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downright , dishonest , and practical repudiation in Mississippi , when we have only delay and culpable want of pecuniary punctiliousness , with loss of credit , but not of honor , in Pennsylvania ! What is repressed and gently frowned upon by the State government of New York , as antirentism , will be openly avowed and gloried in in Illinois as anti-Mormonism . What is mere mischievous theory with the older States , will be thorough , destructive practice with the new ones . Thus , for aught we know , there may he private purity and general rectitude enough , and a sufficiently established reverence for the courts in New York , to make the experiment now proposed , of judges elected by the people , not as fatal to their character and usefulness as we fear it will be , and according to allordinary calculations mwst be ; but however that shall prove , what could be said in favor of popularly chosen judges in some of the States that might be named , who even now prefer Lynch law to any other , and who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who after mock trials had hung offensive citizens at any time upon the nearest tree ?

We doubt if she has put the question to herself with any soberness , or Imill sense of its meaning ? Bearing these thoughts in mind , we propose to offer a few discursive remarks upon the new Constitution , incidental to and illustrative of , the real matter in our thoughts , which is the necessity of an increased fidelity to our political duties and privileges-especially the great duty of making whatever of virtue and intelligence we may possess felt in the only place where it can be decisively exertedat the polis . But first of the new Constitution . We regret that the labors of the Convention have been protracted so nearly up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left for that careful study and deliberate consideration which so iriiportant a document deserves , before it is accepted as the supreme law of the land . We are not , // however , among those who are disposed to blame the Convention for the length of time they have given to the duty committed to them . Either they should have begun earlier , or the election should have been deferred . We are not of those who think Constitutions can be made or changed in a hurry . It is with fear and trembling that we see any agitation of the question of constitutional emendation , but if it is stirred , we wish it to be thoroughly , anxiously , and scrupulously pondered It is not our present purpose formally to discuss the Constitution now offered to the people of this State . We are not prepared upon so short notice to express decided opinions upon o grave a subject . Whatever pertains to the most sacred instrument of this State and peol ) le we would ever handle with reverence and caution . The result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the people of New York to amend the Constitution , ought to be very soberly and thoughtfully considered by him who attempts to criticise it . But we must exceedingly regret that the people are to be called to pass upon the labors of the Convention with so little time for personal reflection , or consideration of the commentary , which the proper guides of public sentiment would doubtless make upon it after calm meditation of its provisions . A full year would not be too long a time to agitate the merits of the new Constitution . If we speak our full sentiments , we must say , that , without any regard to the merits of the new Constitution , we should be better pleased to bear with the faults of the old , ( if that is a fit epithet for a document of twenty-five years ' standing , ) than disturb the reverence just beginning to gather around it . There is no pretence that the present Constitution is a bad one . It has defects like all human works ; but under it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free , and prosperous people . One of the most respectable assemblies of men ever convened for any political purpose , exhausted their wisdom , patience , and patriotism in devising it . The lustre which their names have gathered since , throws back a mellow light upon the work of their earlier lives . The brilliant reputation of such men as Tompkins , Kent , Jay , Platt , Livingston , Van Vechten , Wheaton , Tallmadge , Van Buren , many of whom are still with us , blends with the glory of the present Constitution , and we behold its displacement from the inmost shrine of our archives , with much the same sorrow with which we see the venerable authors and amenders of it surrendering their places on earth to their degenerate sons . We hardly dare to consider with what emotions the surviving members of the Convention of ' 21 have followed the proceedings of the recent Convention ! It was , for the most part , with extreme reluctance that that intelligent and patriotic body consented to any important change in the instrument they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they separated , it was with a feeling of much anxiety and sober question , whether on the whole their labors had been for good or evil , and with an earnest hope and belief that at any rate , our laws would not again for ages be subjected to the peril of a constitutional revision . We can hardly doubt that the majority of that very Convention had voted against the proposition for calling their own body into existenc-u . Fur no men are so conscious of *tfre evil of instability in the fundamentid law of a people as those who have the acutest perception of its particular defects , and are most like to be commissioned with its emendation . This is indeed a great security for the caution and conservatism of such a body , and would generally be a perfect one , if there were not a stringency in public sentiment which compels every representative body to do not what it thinks best , but what it knows to he expected . The Convention does in the main what it is sent to do , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudence and experience have , under these circumstances , for their only field , the problem , how in yielding their own inclinations and judgments , they may give in the least that is possible to the popular caprice and love of change . Thus the Constitution having come out of the hands of one Convention in comparative safety , and with as few changes as could possibly be expected , was deemed by the most sagacious men in the body to have had a providential escape , from a peril not likely soon to recur. * But some of the noblest and // wisest of them are yet alive to see a more radical revision attempted , perhaps accomplished , with a provision in the Constitution itself , that every twenty years the people shall he invited to amend the fundamental law of the State ! We doubt not the surviving members of the last Convention deplore , with peculiar sensibility , what now seems destined to he a constitutional instability of the Constitution . And what improvement in a free and even moderately good Constitution can repay that loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which must attend even the most unfrequent and cautious changes ! There are wrongs , errors , and perversities wrought into the Constitutions of many foreign States , which justify revolution , terrible price of justice and freedom as it is ! and when men are ready to risk their lives and fortunes for political reform , it is time they should have it ; for it proves that life and fortune are not worth possessing without it . But for common grievances , much more for slight imperfections or uncertain improvements , or perhaps only to render the instrument nearer to theoretical perfection , to disturb the inviolable character which ought to belong to the supreme law ; to accustom the people to think it can be changed whenever it suits their caprice ; to make it the subject of party discussion and the theme of newspaper criticism ; is to strike without provocation or reason at the root of patriotism , of order and of prosperity . The time has not come in this new country and in these recent States , when the value of the reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of being estimated . Change is a comparatively small evil to us now , when the elements of prosperity are so large , that no possible instability of the Laws can repress them . Our Institutions are so superabundantly beneficent in their general character , that no abuse of them can , for the present , make them otherwise than benignant . Our People , for the most part , feel their inde pendence of political operations and interests . The laws press so lightly , taxes are so small , the avenues to enterprise and success so numerous , the propitiousness of soil and climate , the extent and cheapness of territory so great , that the People care very little in their hearts for a Constitution which ostensibly does little for them , and whose principal charm is , that it meddles so little with them'in any way . The law is not a visible guardian presence in our country as yet . We do not seem to need its protection . There has been , as yet , little to call out the most dangerous passions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired for great and alarming jealousy to exist between the rich and poor . Land is too cheap and abundant for agrarian animosities to wax dangerous . Taxes are too light to be deemed burdensome , or to provoke any disposition to revolution . While this state of things lasts , it matters little what hold the Constitution has upon the love and veneration of the people . But this condition of things can not be permanent . Nay , while we celebrate it , it is going and gone . Already the first outbreaks of conspiracy against the highest law of the state have been witnessed . Already we have felt the need of that settled respect for the Constitution , which no shifting , changeable Charter of rights can secure ! And , as our population becomes denser , the inequalities of fortune more marked , the difficulties of success greater , the more common and alarming will be the explosions of the ordinary political passions of our nature , and the greater the necessity for strong and energetic laws based upon a sacred and inviolable Constitution . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be laying up a reserved fund of veneration for Law . The time is rapidly coming , when the politics of our general and our state governments will have an interest derived from a new sense of their instant connection with our individual well-being . There is no such feeling now , except in the minds of the the followinrr sentences , which illustrate the feeling with which those who were best acquainted *&amp;*iB the spirit of that body regarded the probable permanency of the instrument they had devised . " The question which is about to be taken will be final ; and the Constitution which shall be adopted on the last Tuesday of January next , soil obebly endure forages . Before a decision of such mii*nitude and so momentous in its consequences , shall be made , it is important that authentic and correct information should be extensively diffused through the commoaity. " - Preceedings a Debates of time Convention of 1821. // 439 commercial or manufacturing classes , who are not like to look beyond their immediate concerns . Indeed , we must needs ascribe much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which springs a wide and general indifference to political interests among our citizens . There is no country on the face of the earth where politics makes more noise , and at the same time excites less real interest , than in our own . There is , of course , a considerable class among us who live on the excitement they are able to stir up at election times . The exercise of the elective franchise still possesses a novelty and importance for the middling interest , for newly adopted citizens , and for recent graduates in freedom at home , which gives our elections a factitious excitement , in which the grave and more deeply interested portion of the community do not participate , because it does not grow out of the questions at issue . There is reason to doubt whether the wisest and most honest portion of the country makes itself felt at the ballot liox , except on rare and extraordinary occasions . Everybody knows that the vote by which the present Convention was called was an exceedingly light one . The occasion seemed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reflecting ! The people wanted to mend the Constitution-.that was all ! It was already a cracked vessel I It had been repaired before-it might be again ! Who cared about the Constitution ? Who had read it-who had suffered from it , or been benefited by it ? Was it worth a walk of half a mile , in an unusual direction , to say a churlish No ! to so indifferent a request ? And thus , by default as much as anything , a Convention is permitted ! And now , is it of much more consequence who constitute the Convention , than the question whether we will have one ? Very little surely -- It can not be concealed that a gross indifference characterized the choice of delegates to revise the Constitution . We doubt not the general respectability and honesty of that body . But we think , without the slightest bias from party feelings , that it would be absurd to compare it with the Convention of 21 . We look in vain for the names of our wisest , best known and most trusted citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a company of strangers , and men who , if distinguished , have achieved their notoriety chiefly in the proceedings of the Convention . This , surely , is not the fault of the body . We sent them there , and they have doubtless done their duty to the best of their knowledge and ability . True , they have seen fit to make our judges elective by the people , and instead of simplifying and condensing the Constitution , have entered into details which must create constant necessity for revision-for which they have made most liberal provision ! But we have no right to complain of the conduct of agents selected with so little anxiety or care-nor is it probably of much use to enter any objection to the chief innovations upon the Constitution . We do not call a Convention to make trifling changes . it must do something to distinguish its labors , and meet the expectations of the people . We have many fears that the New Constitution is as good as accepted , and doubt not it would be , if it were ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that it is , in some respects , superior to the old . But that it has vita mistakes iand most miserable innovations , is , we doubt not , the conviction of all those who ought to direct the public sentunent . It is enough for us that the judges are made directly electve by the peopleand for a limited and comparatively short period of time We bad thought ourselves badly enough off , that our highest judges all left office at the very period of their greatest usefulness , * when their passions had cooled and their judgment ripened , and just as the experience of the courts had brought their wisdom to the highest pitch ; in short , at the time when other nations and other states are accustomed to think their judges at the very height of their usefulness ! ' We had thought it bad enough to see men who had devoted the energies of their maturity to the judicial office , turned off upon their own resources-which no Proceedings of the Convention of 21 . Art . V. Sec. 3d. - " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices during good behavior , or until they shall attain the age of sixty years . " Thus already are full ten years , on an average , of the ripe and golden judgment of our Chief Justices cut off and flung away , for no essential reason . Fif* teen years of Chancellor Kent 's profound judicial ltnowledg* and mature experience have7 in this way , been lost to the country ! // swollen salary or rich perquisites had nourished-too late in life to return to the bar , too early to retire to private life , even if able to do it ; but destined to languish out ten or fifteen years in poverty and ennui , which might have been the most useful , respectable , and satisfactory portion of their lives ! This we thought quite too bad , and likely to bring unnecessary instability and disrespect to the office . But this we coiuld bear . Our judges were firm , able , independent and experienced men-raised above the influence of political party , and wholly beyond the caprice or resentment of the people they judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity and suspicion and instability is to be introduced into our Judiciary ! Our judges are to be chosen directly by the people ! and that serene and elevated region , which the winds and waves of politicat excitement have , till this time , respected , is to he thrown open to their utmost violence . Hitherto , the people , justly suspicious of themselves and their own hasty and impulsive action , have voluntarily put it out of their power to disturb the sacred scale of justice with their excited hands . They had thrown an inviolable veil of sanctity about the form of that protecting goddess , and forbidden themselves from raising its folds to break the calmness of her meditations or influence the independence of her decrees . This noble self-restraint was one of the most beautiful illustrations of the temperance that may belong to freedom , and , while it continued , answered a thousand sneers which the foes of liberty directed at our licentious institutions . But alas ! the time has come for treating resolution ! Why should justice be more reserved than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serene independence-this calm seclusion of hers-is hardly respectful to the Sovereign People ! They desire to know what the haughty Themis is doing in her shrine . They will pull her out and make her sociable ! She shall feel her equality or entire dependence ! Justice shall no longer grow old , distant and venerable . She shall be young and lively and companionable ! Justice , so far from being blind , needs a new pair of eyes once in eight years , to see to her business ! And so , henceforth , our judges are to be the creatures of party ; are to be tempted above the resistance of human nature , into unfairness and selfish biases , because the people are afraid to hMd in re serve a particle of their power-though by voluntary restraint  --  and have got to think that they have somehow been juggled out of their rights by the Constitution . We have no heart to say how sadly unwise-how madly indiscreetwe think this reckless throwing overboard of the best bower in the Constitution is . If the vessel of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the new tackle this late refitting has furnished to get her main anchor back , we shall thankfully own ourselves croakers where we fear we are prophets . We have already said much more than we designed , in reference to the " new Constitution . " After all ! the main grievance is that it is new , and by its own provisions can never he old . Every twenty years is to see it plucked up by its still tender roots , and our liberties and rights and state attachments are never to know the shelter of anything better than a thrifty sapling ! We had hoped to see a growing reluctance iu our fellow-citizens to change in the laws . In the reaction now visible in the public sentiment of the world , upon the licentiousness of thought which has characterized the last half century , we had hoped our own community would partake sufficiently to make it cling to anything established that was not intolerably bad . But we counted too much upon the wisdom and reverence of our people . They have not yet attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws which share the reverence that belongs to the fathers and founders of the families that inherit them ; which are woven in with the pride and affections  --  the instinctive , or earliest and latest emotions of the human heart ; which have grown with the growth , and strengthened with the strength of the people , and possess a place in their regards , shared only by the religious faith they l ) rofess and the domestic affections they cherish ! In our jud0ment , the political watchfulness and jealousy which guards our institutions and laws is taking a very unfortunate direction . We are satisfied that the welfare , freedom , and happiness of our people depend much more upon the administration of our laws than upon the theoretical perfection of them ; and that the Constitution and laws have been , at any time within fifty years , capable of an application entirely satisfactory . But with our extreme solicitude // for a perfect Constitution , we are *vonderfully indifferent to the exercise of those rights and privileges we enjoy under it , and very unfaithful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or additions which the Constitution really required , lay rather in the feelings which the people were hound to bring around it than anywhere else ! If it had been sacred enough in our eyes to make its principles binding and imperative ; if the laws founded on it had been thoroughly carried out ; if the rights and privileges under it had been fully availed of and cherished ; if its duties had been faithfully done ; there would , by this time , have grown up around it a feeling of confidence , respect , and attachment , which would have been infinitely more valuable to the character , happiness , and pros* ) erity of our people , than any theoretical , or even practical , amendments of which it admits . We earnestly desire to see a growing jealousy of our rulers , and of politicians and public servants . We wish , with all our hearts , that a more general and fixed attention should be paid to the proceedings of our General Assembly and to the executive department of the government . We would divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any general truth in the well-endorsed maxim , that " that government is best which is best administered , " then hqw much more important is it to insist upon energy , rectitude , and scrupulous adherence to the Constitution on the part of our legislative and executive functionaries , than to be perpetually tinkering at the fundamental law , and trying experiments on the Constitution of the State ? The State must have a more than feline vitality to survive these repeated draughts upon her principle of life . One of the worst effects of disturbing the highest law of the State , is the tendency it has to alienate the loyalty , interest , and activity of the best l ) art of the people . It cheapens legislation , debases public life , disgusts the conservative feeling of the educated and serious mind of the community , and gradually deprives us of the experience , wisdom , and rectitude of our best citizens in our halls of legislation , and even robs us of their votes at the polls . Can it be denied that a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public men ? With the exception of the Senate of the United States , there is no political body that commands the . respect of our people as being a rel ) resentation of the highest intelligence , the loftiest patriotism , the purest wisdom of the nation , *r any part of it . The sober sense , the high morality , the sound , practical conservatism of our community is not represented in our political assemblies , nor felt in its strength at the ballot box . There is a feeling , that it is idle to attempt to stem the current of a wild democracy ; that do what the wise and prudent may , the rash and foolish will prevail , and that the sooner they reap the fruits of their inexperience and intemperance , the better it will be for the conservative portion of the community . There is another and a better feeling which operates to the same resultnamely , a wide conviction among the intelligent and observing , that the real interests and substantial well-being of the country are independent of its politics-that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our territorial circumstances , for many years to come , either by bad legislation or poorgoveminent ; and under this conviction , good and true men wash their hands of politics , and neglect the first duties of citizens . We can understand , and we instinctively sympathize to some degree , with both these feelings . But we are confident that they are alike mistaken and dangerous . It is doubtless impossible , and may continue so for a long time , for the sobriety , virtue , and experience-the educated and disciplined mind of this community  --  to control the legislation of the misguided , impulsive , and shortsighted people . There has been so much ignorant , unprincipled , and ridiculous glorification of the wisdom and power of us , the people , among both political parties , that it is no wonder we are intoxicated with self-importance , and think ourselves able to make , interpret , and execute laws without the aid of our best citizens , by the mere putting of our own heads together . The doctrine of political equality has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competency , and political wisdom , that it is not easily understood how one head can be wiser than another , or more fit to govern . It is clear enough to some that ten poor heads put together ever so cunningly , do not equal one good one . But it is not strange that the people should believe the charlatans and knaves who take such pains to persuade them // No'r. , that they are as wise as they are free , as sagacious as they are privileged ! Far be it from us to throw doubts upon the safety or wisdom of our Free Institutions . We believe in them fully , and trust in them heartily . Universal suffrage has our entire concurrence and grateful affection . But it is because it compares so favorably with all other modes of political existence , not because it has not great evils conitected with it . We esteem the advantages of the democratic republican system vastly greater than any other form of government ever devised by man , and do not doubt its approach to the most perfect supposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to inevitable perils , and we do not confound our preference for our own with a blind insensibility to its dangers . It is a great source of alarm and of evil to us , that so much ignorance , passion , and short-sightedness should be at the polls . We see not why the people should not manilest their weakness , blindness , and folly , in their political as much as in their other relations . We do not look for consummate wisdom among them on other subjects ; why on this ? But we can easily confess that we would sooner encounter and suffer the consequences of all this ignorance and folly than disfranchize a single citizen . We believe in the education which Freedom gives its children . We are looking forward to the end of the experimen4 with confidence . We regret nothing in the past . We are hopeful of the future . But we will not flatter and fawn upon the people , and endeavor to blind them to their own deficiencies , and need of better guidance . Under these circuijistances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think and act upon the thought , that the people will have their way , and that it is of no use to attempt to direct or elevate public sentiment . Our people need plain and honest dealing . They know at present little of the misgivings , anxieties and conservative tendencies of the sagacious and experienced observers of public alfairs . The politicians stand between the sense and honesty , and morals , and religion of the best class in the country , and the mass of the voters and both parties seem intent rather upon persuading the people of their superior democracy , than of anything else . What is now needed more than anything , is for the good and great men  --  the high-minded , honest , sensible and experienced men  --  to take hold of the politics of the country , and place themselves where they belong , at the head of the masses , to guide , teach and save them . But if the good and wise shrink from politics as from a pollution , let them not complain , that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state allows itself to be repelled from the oversight and guidance of its political interests , because there is so little that is respectable or attractive in the present politics of the country , or because the chances of influence are so lean and remote , it forsakes a duty , the more sacred from its arduous and unpaid character , and imperative in precise proportion to its repulsiveness ! We rejoice to see that the perils of the country , the dangers of a democracy forsaken of its natural heads , are attracting the attention of those , who hitherto have allowed themselves to labor chiefly in the field of sectional politics , to the duty of combining to direct the national sentiment , it is clear , that a party is springing up of strong , wise and honest men who feel that we are a Nation and must have a national sentiment , and that this sentiment must go from the best downward-from the wise few , to the ' busy many-from the experienced and large-minded and patriotic , to the body of the people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session , of men , hitherto wide as heaven apart , for great national purposes , and in defence of American ideas and American principles ; the principles ot a representative government-not to be guided or betrayed by the hasty passions of the people , or their short-sight d policy -- was the most cheering sight the patriot has witnessed since the origin of our government . And we are rejoiced to notice , in Massachusetts particularly , the first shootsof a party " of the best " - in short a union for political purposes , of men who feel they have a country to serve and save , and who are determined not to allow the whole guidance of the people to be in the hands of the selfish , the superficial and the unpatriotic . We contend earnestly , that the thinking and good men in our community shall not subtract their wisd in , experience , attention and activity from our politics , local , state , or general-that our politics shall not be abandoned to a tins known a& politicians , , tI*men who live upon their // 443 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap or go a-begging , and that the obligations of citizenship shall not be esteemed among the least serious and important we acknowledge . There must be , throughout the country , a revival of political interest on new and patriotic grounds . it must no longer be a stereotyped pretence that men take office for the sake of the country , nor deemed an impossible virtue . Never did more glorious opportunities of usefulness , and of distinction , wait for high-minded and wide-sighted patriots . A new destiny has been opened upon us during the last fifteen years . We have just begun to realize our national greatness and importance , and to feel the astonishing concurrence of circumstances , which is rapidly hurrying us into a foremost place among the nations of the earth . The immense diversion of the best thought of the land to other enterprises and interests , leaves our politics in the hands of the unworthy . Just at a time when we need the greatest sagacity , prudence and principle , to shape our fluent or plastic destiny , we are under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest importance are filled with second and third-rate men ; our House of Representatives , made up ( with honorable exceptions ) of party hacks , or of " whoever would go ; our press and political organs , rarely guided by firm , reliable and high-minded men ; and our ballot box often empty of- the votes of the best class of our people ! What but the invisible guidance of Heaven can pilot us safely through the perils attendant upon our rapid growth , our rising ambition , our lust of conquest , our impatience of law , our sectional jealousies and divided interests , when the deck of our vessel of state is left in the charge of those who ought at best to be passengers only , while the real crew , in desperation or indifference , have all gone be-low ! We almost despair of bringing the intelligence and virtue of this nation , or of this State and community , to the ballot box . And if we despair of this , what hope shall we not abandon ? The number of valuable citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to turn the scale of most elections . If the sober , conservative , virtuous and patriotic portion ofthisnation knew its own strength and numbers , and if every good and tru&amp; man cast his vote as a sacred duty at every election , we should experience at once a mighty and glorious reform in our politics , and have little reason to dread the rashness and folly of our own people , or of our newly adopted citizens . The ignorant and misguided are sure to vote . All those who are creatures of imitation , of superficial excitement and gregarious tendencies , will of course vote , and vote as the wire-pullers of party shall direct . Both sides are like to get a proportion of these , although the Democratic or Destructive Party will inevitably get the lion 's share , as it knows so much better how to enlist popular feeling , and not from any want of pains or inclination on the other side . But it so happens that the sober sense and real policy of the country is Whig . The Whig party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of our National Politics at the present crisis , as it has been at any given time since the adoptiomt of the National Constitution . Free Institutions ought always to be administered on conservative principles , just as absolute or aristocratic Institutions ought to be administered on anti-conservative principles . The triumphs of conservatism here , are as important as the victories of reform abroad . And this is the instinctive conviction of the intelligence , virtue and honesty of the country . But this wisdom and virtue will not vote ! Is too indifferent , careless , occupied , disgusted to vote ! Its vote might , perhaps , give the ascendency to conservative principles ; but it will not vote ! At the worst it would create a great minority , too manifestly powerful to be despised , which would keep the other party in check . But it will not vote ! It is dissatisfied with the course of the Whig * ) arty ; with its divisions , with its candidates , with its inconsistencies ! What then ? Js not the general policy of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main direction and general tendency the national and patriotic one ? And are wise and good men to see the country ruined , because they do not like everything abotut the measures or candidates of the party , whose cardinal principles they espouse ? We detest the milk and water morality , which sacrifices to a scruple interests that have every general principle of dtity and policy in their support ! We have no patience with men who throw away their votes upon favorite candidates , while they suffer great principles of public policy to be stifled . And here we might stop ; but while w* // are upon the subject of the moral obligation of the citizen to vote , we have a more special word to say of the folly of those who reserve their exercise of this right for what are called serious or great occasions . In truth we lose all great occasions , because we have willingly lost all small ones . Our votes do not prevail when important issues are at stake ; because , being wholly unaccustomed to regular and concerted action methodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not combine our full force , however urgent the necessity . or great the pending interest . Suppose our military establishment reserved itself against an invasion of the country , and that we depended wholly upon volunteers , without regular officers , without drill or discipline , to resist aggression or ( lefend our territory ? Whatever patriotic rage and personal valor might accomplish , we should be inevitably beaten , until whipped into discipline . We doubt not that upon a question of union or disunion the volunteer strength of the conservatives would be overwhelming ; but upon anything less than this it is almost sure to he beaten ; and all for want of regular voting , of a constant knowledge of the precise strength of the conservative party , of an exact measurement of the difficulty to he overcome at the polls . If we knew our precise force , and could depend upon it at every election , we should certainly be in at least half the time . But without concert , method , drill , or recognized obligation to vote , we lose measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political party , every electwa ? S a criszs , however unimportant the questron raised . The heart which is gained by success in a small issue animates and leads to victory in the next struggle , which may be for a great principle . There is no such thing as an unimportant election . It is important to the party integrity and habit of triumph , if not to the interests of the country . The party which is most faithful to the ballotbox will govern the country ; and therefore , if we wish to prevail in the councils of the nation , or the local government , we must vote-vote on great and on small occasions-vote spring and fall , in sunshine and rain , at the end of a five-mile ride or a ten-rods walk-we must stay at home to vote , or we must journey home to vote - we must vote or succumb-carry the elections , little and big , or lose them , small and great , according as we feel the importance and practice the duty of voting . We may do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not vote . The vote is the only MAN the country knows and feels . XVIII we vote or will we abandon the institutions , laws and liberties of the country , whose proudest monument in the face of all nations is its right of universal suffrage ? And here let us speak one word more to those whose personal purity and candor and principle exhibit themselves in what is doubtless a wholly honest , but we must think not very wise , contempt and censure and neglect of ny politics . There are thousands of good an ( l wise men who will not pertbrm their political duties , because the country , forsooth , is divided into parties , and they do not choose to have it said , we vote with the party . They are too honest , independent , virtuous , to accept the nominations of caucuses and conventions , and vote for men they never saw and do not know , and whose views or character , in some respects , they can not approve . Now , Heaven forfend that we should speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or render the exercise of citizenship and its most solemn act any less anxious and deliberate than the best and most punctilious can make it . Indeed , it is against the latent and unintentional immorality involved in the obstinacy or impracticableness of those who will fight wholly on their own hook iR political struggles , or not at all , thatwe are directing our observations . There seems to be a vague notion in the minds of a portion of the better part of the community that the country can be governed without parties ; that they were not conteml ) lated by the founders of our institutions ; that they are not a legitimate part of the political machinery ; and that the spread of virtue , intelligence and candor would abolish them . But this is mere indiscriminating sentiment . The very foundation of our government , its universal suffinge , its rotation in office , its free press , its frequent elections-all are fitted to create , and even designed to create , parties . There can be no parties under an absolute government , comparatively speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in other words , combinations of men for the sake of promoting their own views of public policy in questions where there exists room for honest difference of opinion , or where necessary collisions // arise , and compromise is to be made between Sel ) arate interests . The only question is , what shall the character of these parties be , and who shall control them ? Shall the people divide only upon very fundamental questions , or upon superlicial ones ? This must depend upon circumstances . There are of course different party lines , according as you consider the country in its general extent or its particular districts , or with reference to one or another kind of interest . But there must be parties-that is , there must be a union of those who will compromise their minor interests to save their major ones-who will sacrifice some of their preferences or interests for the sake of other and more important of their wishes and principles . And these parties will have leaders . Shall they be the foolish or the wise , the sober or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the general policy of this nation . There are strict constructionists , and there are liberal interpreters of the Constitution-those who die by the letter and those who live in the sphit of it . There are those who lean to a strong government and would protect the federal interests of the country , who are more devoted to the nation than to the State , and are more proud of being American citizens than Northerners or Southerners , Virginians or Vermontese and there are State 's Rights men and sticklers for the Independent Sovereignties . There is a Conservative party , which venerates the wisdom of experience and loves the virtue and purity , the customs and associations of the past , and feels its connection with the race , and would not strike boldly out of the track , or forsake the direction or quicken the prudent pace at which the world has arrived at its present position ;  --  and there is Young America , ( America is too young to be the mother of any child yet , ) which despises the old-*vomanish maidms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apron-string of the best motherthat ever was made ; which would set the world upon wholly new feet , and at once reduce an ideal theory ( a very superficial ideal , we think ) to practice , at any cost and in the face of any difficulties . There is a law and order , a slow and sure , a distrustful and cautious party  --  a conservative , a Whig party ; and there is a radical , innovating , hopeful , boastful , improvident and go-ahead party  --  a Democratic , a Loco-Foco party ! Now these two parties , both in the main honest , and holding representatives of all orders and classes of society , are real , necessary expressions of two contrasted policies , of two great conflicting ideas , which go to the root and extend to the utmost branches of the national life . Whichever of these policies or ideas prevails in the country , decides the practical operation of our institutions , interprets the Constitution , and possesses a full right to govern . The party is only the instrument by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under heaveii in which it can get itself sl ) spoken out and acted out . But these ideas are fundamental no so important political ideas in the country ! none so practical , so decisive for good or evil ! Have the people then no right to organize upon them , and is it not their duty to compromise all other views , opinions , and attachment to men or measures for them ? We will not , of course , vote for dishonest and wicked men to support our own measures or policy ; for such men hurt the measures and policy they undertake to support-nay , can not be trusted even to support it at all . But anything short of immorality or untrustworthiness should be no bar to our voting for the party candidates . We should sacrifice preferences to principles , favorite candidates to important measures , men to policy , personal , local , or temporary interests , to . national , ' general , and permanent interests . We should vote with the party , exerting all our Thfluence to make and keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly to identify low and unworthy ideas with party movements , as if they were inseparable . While the ideas orlines of policy are worth sustaining , the party is ; and we forsake our principles when we abandon our party before it abandons its general aim and purposes , and notwithstanding any regrets we may have at its particular deficiencies , or disapproval of its incidental measures . Let us remember that this country must be gove rued by a party-always-forever ; and that to sneer at or forsake party because it partakes of the passions , and immorality , and folly of the people who partly compose it , is to abandon the wheat because of the tares , and eat no bread , because we can not have it as white as snow . The party is a phrase that polite and virtuous and pious mouths must learn to use without mak* ing faces ! It must become a respecta // ble , a sober , a vital duty , to support a party  --  and if there be no party in the country which is not radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party formed on great national ideas , if the Whig party be not a party with which earnest , sober , and Christian men can vote , then we must have another party with which they can . For the intelligence , virtue , wisdom , honesty of the country must make itself felt at the polls , or be basely treacherous to the nation and if virtue and sense , goodness and knowledge of the world , or of the adjustment of means to ends , go together , it must appear to this body that without organization , method , discipline , agreement , in short without party , the wisdom and virtue , and honesty of the country can do nothing for it . The only question to decide then is , not whether we will have parties , or belong to a Party-we must do this or prove false to our first duty as citizens-hut will we vote with the Whig party or Democratic party ? or will we lay the foundation of a new party , whose aim shall he to possess itself of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with the general policy , the fundamental idea of the Whig party , and as friends of the nation , of virtue , of religion , shall give it a regular , principled , serious , and hearty support , hy that mightiest and most sacred , though often helittled and desecrated instrument-a vote . We beg the most serious attention to this appeal to the intelligence and conscience of the non-voting portion of our fellowcitizens , men who belong , by every instinct of education , virtue and sagacity , to the Whig Party , the great Conservative party , the party of law , order , reverence and nationality We implore these self-disfranchized citizens , not to do themselves , the State and the Country , this unnatural wrong ! Civil suicide is a new crime , which ought to he attended with public disgrace . Let it not be said , in future , that those who held the saving power of this nation in their hands , were too slothful , careless , cowardly to use it before it became too late . " Died%v its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History to write upon the grave-stone of a Party , which possesses the sympathy and loses the votes of enough virtuous and , intelligent men to turn the trembling scale of Political Power , and fix it forever where it belongs , on the side of stable laws , a strictly representative Democracy , and a Conservative Administration.
