txt /z/ FORTY-SEVEN years ago , I had the privilege of offering congratulations to the Corporation , and Faculty , and Friends , of this Institution , at its Second Commencement . We have now , through the good hand of our God upon us , an opportunity of assembling on a like occasion , half a century from the time of its legal organization . The Act of Incorporation was passed by the Legislature of the Commonwealth in June , 1793 , conferring the usual rights and powers of a collegiate institution , by the name of Williams College . I remember reading in a newspaper at New Haven , an account of the first meeting of the Corporation , soon after the Act was received , and of their appointment of Mr. EBENEZER FITCH as President . It was also stated that the qualifications for admission would be much the same as those at Yale College . The principal Donor , and indeed the Founder , of this Seminary , was Col. EPHRAIM WILLIAMS , born /z/ at Newton , in this State , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed to Hatfield , when this son was young , and afterwards became one of the first settlers of Stockbridge . The son , in early life , followed the seas , and , with an enterprising spirit , visited England , Holland , Spain , and other foreign countries . In the war between England and France , from 1740 to 1748 , Mr. Williams was connected with the troops raised in this country , and became distinguished in the military profession . From the close of that war to the commencement of the war of 1755 , the frontiers of New-England were in an unsettled state , in consequence of their proximity to Canada , and the partially hostile state of the Indians . Mr. Williams had the command of the line of the Massachusetts forts west of Connecticut River , and in time of war resided much at Hoosack Fort , three and an half miles east of this place . He was looked upon by the people of the Province as likely to succeed to the important station and character long held by Col. John Stoddard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the military protector of the western settlements . Mr. Williams was possessed of gentlemanly manners , dignified character , popular with all classes of people , and especially with the soldiers . At the commencement of hostilities in 1755 , he took the command of a regiment raised in the Province , and joined the army under the command of Gen. Johnson , advancing to meet the French invasion from Canada . As they came in conflict with the enemy /z/ near Lake George , Col. Williams , at the head of the advanced guard of a thousand men , received a mortal wound , from a musket ball , through his head , and did not live to witness the victory of the day . The battle was fought on the eighth of September ; the enemy was defeated , with much loss , and Baron Dieskau , their commander , was wounded and taken prisoner . The Massachusetts troops , on that day , gave an earnest of what they were to do twenty years afterwards . Col. Williams , by his will , made a little before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of his property , consisting in new lands , with notes and bonds , for the perpetual support of a Free School in a township west of Fort Massachusetts , previously called Hoosack Fort , if the township should be called by his name . His executors were Col. Worthington , of Springfield , and Israel Williams , Esq. , of Hatfield , who managed the legacy with great prudence and success . In 1785 , the General Court incorporated William Williams , Theodore Sedgwick , and others , " Trustees of the donation of Ephraim Williams , Esq. , for maintaining a Free School in Williamstown . " In 1788 the Trustees voted to erect a building for the accommodation of the Free School ; and the General Court granted them a lottery to raise four thousand dollars . The inhabitants of Williamstown raised by subscription two thousand dollars for the same purpose . The jbrick building now standing , eighty-two feet by forty-two , and four stories , well built , was erected in 1790 , at the expense of about eleven thousand dollars . The funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With an expectation that the Free School would become a College , Dr. Fitch was early requested to leave his connexion with Yale College and become its preceptor . After much hesitation , he accepted the appointment , and the school was opened , with one assistant , and soon after a second , in October , 1791 . It soon became highly prosperous , and collected students from a distance , as well as the vicinity . In the Act of Incorporation of the College , in 1793 , the General Court made a grant of a thousand dollars a year , for four years , for the procurement of a Library and a Philosophical Apparatus . In October of that year , the College was duly organized , consisting of three small classes . The Academy continued several years in connection with the College ; it was found to be a convenient place for the preparatory studies , and students more advanced had the privilege of reciting with the college classes . The Tutors of the College were the Teachers of the Academy . For a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted with a competent knowledge of the French language , instead of the Greek . From the year 1795 to 1799 , Mr. Samuel Mackay , a gentleman of amiable character and a good scholar , was Professor of the French language . Dr. Fitch made a public profession of religion , while a Tutor in Yale College , and soon after if /z/ received a license to preach the Gospel , in May , 1787 . In June , 1795 , he was publicly ordained in this town , by the Berkshire Association . The Rev. Ephraim Judson , of Sheffield , with whom he had studied divinity previous to his license , preached on the occasion . At the time of the establishment of Williams College , there were but four other Colleges in New England ; Harvard , Yale , Providence , and Dartmoutlu The two latter commenced nearly at the same time . The first class at Providence graduated in 1769 , the first at Dartmouth in 1771 . Williams soon took a respectable rank among these Colleges . The first class , graduating in 1795 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third , ten ; the fourth , thirty . In 1798 , when our country resolved to resist the hostile aggressions of France , and pledged their support of the government by numerous addresses ; one was sent by the students of this College , with the approbation of the Faculty . President Adams , in a very kind Answer , spoke of the flourishing state of so young a literary Institution . Some of the means which contributed to the early prosperity of this College , were that the necessary expenses of the students were less than at any other ; that , in this retired position and the character of the community , there were less inducements to dissipation ; and , we may add , the fidelity and labor of the Instructers . The principal means of instruction at that time , in all our Colleges , was the personal application of the student , and the recita- /z/ tion of the classes . The extensive practice of Professional Lectures , at the present day , is very useful for youths that love study , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few persons will submit to the labor of thinking , if others will think for them . With a part of the grant of the Commonwealth , when the College was incorporated , a competent Library was procured , well selected ; and a Society Library by the students was soon commenced , both of which have been regularly increasing . The first three commencements were held in the small Meeting-House , the first one built in the town . The fourth was in the present house , then in an unfinished state . The early commencements were attended by numerous collections of people from the vicinity and from a distance , and by various distinguished and literary characters . A Catalogue of the College was printed in the Fall of 1795 , containing seventy-seven students . The following Note was appended . " Besides the above members of College , there are about forty students in the Academy connected with the College . " This Catalogue included the students , exclusive of the faculty ; and , so far as I know , was the first Catalogue of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done by Yale College , the year following , and the measure was subsequently adopted by the Colleges generally . For some years it was done on a single sheet ; they are now usually printed in a pamphlet , containing the names of all connected with the College . The first Triennial Catalogue of Yale College , in the form of a pamphlet , was in 1778 ; the first at Harvard about the same time . Previous to that time they were printed on a large sheet . A Catalogue of the graduates of this College was published in 1799 , and has been continued Triennially . The President 's house was built in 1795 . The East College was built in 1797-98 , from the avails of a township of land in the District of Maine . The land , with another township , was a grant from the General Court in 1796 . This was a brick building of four stories , one hundred and four feet by thirtyeight ; it was convenient for students , and regularly occupied till the winter of 1842 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1795 , President Fitch delivered an able and popular address to the graduating class , but the practice was not continued . During the administration of President Griffin it was resumed , and continued some years . It seems , however , to be due to the graduating classes to have the Commencement day for their own exhibitions . The Commencement of 1807 was a mournful occasion . President Fitch 's eldest son , having been admitted as a member of College , died the preceding evening . The President presided at the public exercises with great propriety , and the morning after , attended the funeral of his son . The members of this College have boarded , uniformly , in families in the vicinity . The College suffered a temporary depression about the year 1821 . President Moore accepted a /z/ call to preside over Amherst College , then recently established . His continuance there was short , being soon removed by death . The prosperity of Williams was soon restored by the active labors and splendid talents of President Griffin . The members of this Institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious instruction . They have been favored with the regular ministration of gospel ordinances , with the views of divine truth adopted by the Reformers , and by the Fathers of New England . The College has been frequently visited with the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit , and many of the students , as we trust , have been truly born of God , and fitted for great usefulness in the church of Christ . A very interesting account of these revivals , by Professor Hopkins , has been published in the American Quarterly Register . A Saturday evening Conference was set up by the students , quite early , I believe before the organization of the College , which I suppose has never been intermitted . The three Presidents , that have preceded the one now in office , are deceased . A very valuable Memoir of President Fitch has been recently published by one of the Alumni. * It is executed with care and fidelity , and with much labor , in consequence of the President 's Diary and papers having been destroyed by fire . Unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffin is much wanted . * Rev. Calvin Durfee , of Dedham . /z/ Having presented these few sketches of the early history of this Institution , Brethren Alumni , in view of the advantages we have enjoyed for early education , I would call your attention to some thoughts relative to our obligations to our Alma Mater , to our Friends , and to our Country . Correct education qualifies a person for increased usefulness , in every department and station of human life . The course of education in the New England Colleges is general , affording an introduction to the various departments of science , and laying a foundation for future improvement . In our country , pursuits and stations being open to all , the opportunities for honorable distinction are inviting ; and , with the ordinary favor of Divine Providence , no one can fail of being a reputable citizen , without a manifest dereliction of duty . The Seminary of a liberal education has a high claim upon its sons for their grateful fidelity . The student has the benefit of no small amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of faithful teachers constantly caring for him , and of the general solicitude of all who are concerned in the supervision of the Institution . A preceptor seldom forgets a pupil , or ceases to take an interest in his prosperity . It becomes then a question of some interest , How can a young man , favored with a liberal education , do honor to the Alma Mater , who , with unsparing hand , has done so much for him ? A few things will be suggested in answer to this inquiry . I. In the first place , he must not lose his /z/ Literary character . He went to College for the sake of acquiring science . This has been liberally bestowed upon him ; and his College looks to see its effects . It is not the object to make him a practical mechanic , or a politician , or a fine gentleman , but a scholar . And , having obtained an advantageous introduction to the circles of science , if he makes progress in the good work , and attains to eminence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hope of his early privileges . The community look to a person of college education for college attainments ; and to excel in these is all that is required . But this they have a right to expect . A primary reason why young men , after leaving College , decline in their literary character , as they often do , is , they look for too much . It is a principal embarrassment of learning in our country , that so many seek the character of a universal genius . American youth are not apt to be deficient in ambition , or labor ; but they will expand their views for a grasp beyond their capacity , or the means they can command . Let a young man of the best talents , attempt to excel in literature , in the various departments of science , in the mechanic arts , in agriculture , in the fine arts , and he will be likely to fail in the whole . But let him deliberately resolve to excel in one or two of these , he will be likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Divine Providence has so constituted things that steady persevering effort will usually obtain its object . No person suffers in character for being ignorant /z/ on subjects to which he has not turned his attention . The lawyer or jurist are not considered deficient because they are unacquainted with anatomy ; nor the architect because he is unskilled in agriculture . A scholar , distinguished in the knowledge of languages , rhetoric , history , poetry , is not the less esteemed because he has not attended to botany and zoology . All know that the human mind is limited , and one that would be versed in all subjects , is commonly believed to be master of none . We have much more confidence in a professional man , or a scholar , who limits his researches , than in one who claims an acquaintance with the various branches of science . II . One that would excel as a scholar , should seek to know his own natural talent . All have their gifts from a bountiful Creator , and there are few who can not be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talent that God has given them . Gnothi seauton , a favorite precept with the ancients , was deemed too great to have originated in human wisdom , and must have come from the gods . It is a common thing to see persons engaged in pursuits for which they are unqualified , and their efforts , though honest and persevering , will be abortive . One may be distinguished in a mechanic art , that would fail in a learned profession . A professional man that is doing well , not unfrequently , leaves his profession to become a merchant ; and he usually becomes a bankrupt . In the different departments of science one may /z/ be eminent as a historian , another as a geographer , another as a mathematician , a chemist , a botanist ; but let them change their respective pursuits , and the most of them would be likely to be indifferent in their profession . There is occasionally a genius , like that of Alexander Hamilton , that will grasp any thing , and be eminent in any pursuit . But such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand alone . III . The acquisitions of a scholar can never be obtained but by labor and perseverance . This is indeed the gloomy part of the prospect ; the up-hill labor in the path of science . But it is unavoidable . This truth can not be presented to young students too often , or too earnestly pressed upon them . It is the sine-qua-non of all literary eminence . And it is to be urged the more earnestly because there are no exceptions in the case , and because it is one of the last that an intelligent young man is willing to believe . We have few eminent scholars in this country , and simply because few will devote sufficient time and labor to the object . There is no case in which the motto upon the bee-hive , " Nothing without labor , " is more applicable than this . What is the reason that so many of our young men , who leave College with a high reputation for talents and attainments , afterwards disappoint the expectations of their friends ? Their literary reputation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confide in the suggestions of flattery , they rely upon their genius to surmount every obstacle , and do not learn /z/ their error till it is too late to obtain the remedy . In a few years the ill-calculating youth sees his class-mate , who in College held the place of mediocrity , far before him in reputation and useful knowledge . The reason is briefly given : one relied on his talents , the other on his labor . Dr. Johnson has given a just representation of the labor of a student , in the Preface of his Dictionary , and with much feeling , as he was constitutionally indolent . " Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of Dictionaries ; whom mankind have considered , not as the pupil , but the slave , of science , the pioneer of literature , doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press forward to conquest and glory , without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that facilitates their progress . " This was the hypochondriac complaint of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Giant of English literature , " is derived , principally , from his Dictionary . A characteristic term was often given to students in the last age , which I regret to have gone out of use , because it was singularly appropriate : Painful ; a painful student . It is impressive and strictly true . We know of no men who have attained to eminence in literature or science who have not been distinguished for laborious application . This was true of President Dwight . President Edwards usually studied twelve hours in a day , for many years , and he began this course in early life . Dr. Hopkins told me he had repeatedly studied eighteen /z/ hours without eating . Gen. Hamilton and Col. Burr were men of laborious application in their studies . Let the young men of our country who aspire to literary eminence , look at these characters , while none of them can claim talents superior to theirs , and learn the cost at which it must be obtained . European scholars , at the present time , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent and variety of knowledge , indicated in Paradise Lost , must have been the accumulation of many laborious years . Newton was not only distinguished for long and profound thought , such as few intellects could have sustained , he had also a very extensive acquaintance with books . He could rectify ancient chronology , as well as solve the most abstruse problems of mathematics . Boyle , born and bred amid the fascinations of wealth , associated with the first classes of society in England and foreign countries , was still the self-denying student ; his insatiable thirst for knowledge carried his mind above all other objects , and he gave a powerful impulse to that system of philosophy which was soon to dissipate the darkness of preceding ages . The learned Bishop Burnet said of him , in his funeral sermon at Westminster , " Which of all Boyle 's writings shall I recommend ? all of them . To him we owe the secrets of fire , air , water , animals , vegetables , fossils ; so that from his works may be deduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal founder of the Royal Society . His works , in five folios , show the vast /z/ extent of his acquisitions and labors . He was a friend and correspondent of our second Governor Winthrop . Copernicus , was cotemporary with Columbus : the two great men of the age of the Medici . One presented to the human race the unknown half of the Mundane sphere , while the other led the human mind to a just conception of the boundless Concave with which it is enlightened and adorned . Luther soon followed to dissipate the darkness of the Monastic ages , and let in upon the moral world the beams of the Sun of Righteousness . Copernicus was thoroughly versed in all the learning of his time . He was early led to an examination of the Ptolemaic system of natural philosophy , then universally adopted and followed . It is said of him , " In his thirty-fifth year , Copernicus bent all the powers of his mind to this interesting subject ; and , after twenty years ' laborious study , the cycles and epicycles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sun was nobly and independently placed in the centre , to illuminate and govern the whole . A long period was necessary to convince the understanding and remove the prepossessions of the world upon this subject ; but it was effected . The system of Copernicus was greatly enlightened and improved by Boyle , and afterwards demonstrated by Newton . Lord Bacon , the illustrious star of the reign of Elizabeth , after making himself thoroughly acquainted with the artificial philosophy of the schools of the middle ages , reasoning from assumed /z/ causes to their uncertain effects , boldly struck out a new course , taking the works and providence of God , as they stand before us , and thence deducing their nature and various operations . The natural world , the character and history of man , are presented to our senses . Chatham , the great English statesman , was almost as familiar with the human character , and the state of the world , in the ages past , as in his own . The same was true of Sully and Richelieu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British senate , for the extent and variety of his knowledge , was supposed to have no equal among his contemporaries . Hume and Gibbon , the first historians of the last century , possessed immense stores of erudition , acquired by long and laborious study , from childhood to advanced life . Their two great works are the result of the indefatigable toil of many years . In the Greek and Latin languages , and the works of their illustrious authors , they were as much at home as in their own . When we read the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , our admiration at the dignity of the narrative , and the immense variety of authorities with which it is sustained , is not less than our regret that so great a mind could be totally misled by a dislike of the Christian salvation . Never has the world had such a proof of the need of the divine warning , " Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men and not after Christ . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet of Him who spake as never man spake . /z/ Sir William Jones , one of the first scholars that Great Britain has produced , a master of most of the Oriental , as well as European languages , to whom the Christian world will ever be under the highest obligations , for the light he has thrown upon the historical parts of the Old Testament , was constantly devoted to intense study , till he sunk under the weight of his labors , at the age of forty-eight ; the age of Hamilton , Pitt , Nelson , and others of great distinction . Napoleon closed his career at the age of forty-six ; he had a miserable existence six years longer . I mention these facts , in this place , to show how much the labors of some men have accomplished , and what a station they have attained in the annals of our race , in a comparatively short period . . s'tvfrvi-'rti ' . KJS ' - auto rii M-J . P iii*.i IV . We may notice some of the encouragements to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a high standing in this respect , is attainable . This may be said with safety , because it is frequently accomplished . We have been too much accustomed to believe that such attainments are reserved for distinguished genius . We often make an incorrect estimate of the genius of a young man , and still more of a youth . Precocity frequently misleads the judgment in such a case . How different is the relative standing of the members of a College-Class , when they enter , and when they graduate . Genius is an indefinite term ; it has , at least , many shades of signification . One has a genius for one object , and one for another . I knew /z/ a boy of perhaps fourteen , that was considered hardly compos mentis , very stupid , poor for any business ; yet he knew every plant and herb that grew in the woods , and could go and find the root in the winter . One of the best species of genius that we know of is a disposition for application . The eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as distinguished for genius . Public sentiment , in this respect , has rather been against him . Because he was known , principally , by his SpellingBook , a work , by the way , of no ordinary intellect , he has not been generally ranked among the men of genius and talent in our own country . Yet he attained to the rank , in the opinion of good judges , of the first philologist of the age . It may be safely said , that , in this important department of literature , he was not surpassed . And in his large Dictionary , he has left the richest legacy to his countrymen that has ever been left by any literary man . It is , undoubtedly , the best Dictionary in the English language . " And while a nook remains , where English minds and manners can be found , " it will be resorted to as an authority . No American author has realized as much pecuniary profit by his works as Dr. Webster . He has always been a man of excellent character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The class at Yale College of 1778 , to which he belonged , has long been considered as one of the most distinguished from that Institution . Their Tutor was the Rev. Dr. Buckminster of Portsmouth . /z/ The class contained Oliver Wolcott , Joel Barlow , Uriah Tracy , Josiah Meigs , Zephaniah Swift , Asher Miller , Noah Smith , Stephen Jacob , and other distinguished men ; and no one has been more useful in life , or left a higher reputation at his death , than Dr. Webster . And now , my young brethren Alumni , graduates and undergraduates , behold a model of character , presented to the literary young men of the United States ; Who can say that such an eminence is unattainable ? I heard a gentleman say in New Haven , many years ago , he little thought that Mr. Webster , when in College , would ever be employed in correcting and improving our language . How has all this been effected ? By a correct course of life and a steady persevering industry . This is the whole secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respect and esteem to endure for ages . The Rev. Dr. Hyde , of this county , was a proper sample of the character now in view . He knew his own powers , made the best use of them , was diligent and methodical in business , a man of study , seldom said or did an unwise thing ; he was a very useful and successful minister , and enjoyed and left a desirable reputation . What young minister can not do the same ? The attainments of a Scholar are the work of time . Eminent men , more commonly , begin their acquisitions very young . President Edwards began his studies at an early age . The only son of intelligent parents , he early acquired a great thirst for learning , and his progress was never interrupted . /z/ Fed on plain food , the steady habits of study in early life prepared his physical constitution for intense application ; and you may say without an hyperbole , his Freedom of the Will , History of Redemption , and Religious Affections , were the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our system of education is the neglect of the years of childhood . Divine Wisdom has so constructed the human mind , that important acquisitions may be made at almost any period of life . In early childhood the little ones will learn to speak English , Russian , Greek , with perhaps equal ease , and pronounce like their teacher . But this can not be done at ten years , still less at twenty . From four to eight years , or ten at farthest , they must learn to read and spell , a sine-qua-non in a good education , and if not obtained at this period , it never is , but imperfectly . Uneducated preachers , invariably , preach without Notes . The principal reason is , they can not read well enough to deliver from a Manuscript . Reading and orthography being acquired , let your son read Latin , Greek , French , then learn to construe , and then to parse . Simple arithmetic may be learned early , and I think simple numbers are learned more easily than when incumbered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical for the young mind . Children can remember , and imitate , but they do not abstract . They want no authority but the dictum of the teacher . The anomalies of language do not disturb a young learner ; he learns from authority . /z/ In our mode of education , the period from nine to twelve years , an important period , is almost lost . It is the time when habits of application should be acquired , when the physical constitution is forming , and may be formed to endure great mental application . It is quite common that an English lad is as forward in his learning at twelve years , as ours are at fifteen . We suffer much time to be lost . From nine to fifteen years is the time to learn the languages . At fifteen or sixteen years of age , a lad may be able to read the Latin and Greek classics with facility , and what is gotten at that period is not likely to be lost . History may be read with profit , cotemporaneously , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth to speak in Latin , and think in Latin ; in that way he will imbibe many of the thoughts of the great minds of antiquity , whose thoughts were mighty . We are all aware that the discipline of our schools , or rather the want of discipline , is such that it would be difficult to effect what we have now contemplated . Modern theorists would banish corporal punishment from our schools , with capital punishments from our criminal code . The great men of the British nation have not been educated on these refined principles . Dr. Johnson says he was a good scholar when he was young , because he " had a faithful Master who whipped him if he did not get his lesson . " Dr. Lightfoot has given us a like fact in a little different manner . On the subject of the Confusion of Tongues , he says , " This punishment of /z/ theirs at Babel , is , like Adam 's corruption , hereditary to us , for we never come under the rod at grammar-school , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we have produced Johnsons and Lightfoots without such discipline , we may talk of laying aside corporal punishment . I am well aware that there is many a noble-minded youth , who finds that his early education has been neglected , who yet has a laudable , ardent desire to ascend the hill of science . Let not such be discouraged . Many of the first scholars in all civilized countries had done but little at twenty years of age . This is eminently the fact with the distinguished literati of Germany . And it has ever been the same with us . Let the young man enter upon his work in earnest , with the undivided object of acquiring a classical education , leaving ulterior pursuits at the disposal of divine Providence , constantly bearing in mind that it is not his genius but his labor that must accomplish his object ; let him be very careful of his health , and his eyes , and , with the favor of Heaven , where he is to look for all success , he need not be disheartened . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has got but little , and much is yet to be done . " Per varios casus , per tot discrimina rerum , Tendimus in Scientiam ; sedes ubi fata quietas ostendunt . " But , if he can not make this , as I have stated , his undivided object , if ulterior views engage his attention , and his mind is fixed on distinction in a profession , a seat in Congress , or the favor of the Fair , he will accomplish but little . Eminence as a /z/ scholar is enough for his ambition , or his desire for usefulness . Every distinguished scholar is a rich blessing to society , to his country . As an encouragement in the pursuit of science , let the youth be assured that a great field is yet unoccupied . Thucydides had no occasion to weep , when he heard the history of Herodotus read at the Olympic Games , lest there should be nothing left for him to record . Oh , when will the God of heaven give us a Thucydides , to write the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cicero could exclaim , " Quid dulcius Herodoto , Quid gravius Thucydide ! " 1 remember a common observation when I was young , " The learned professions are full , there is no room for any more . " This has certainly been said for fifty years ; and the evil or the good , whichever we term it , has not increased . Accomplished scholars and able writers have relatively diminished . We have books without end , and the multiplicity destroys the value . A great part of them are written with such haste , and so little regard to materials and documents , that the most of them are very defective , and often doubtful as to facts . We have no good National or Universal Geography . Still more are we in want of a National Gazeteer . And , for the higher seminaries , we want a good system of Natural Philosophy . I need not enumerate . On the subject of a National History , I will speak shortly . Aside from such deficiencies in our literature , the works of an able judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ever will be . /z/ And the light ephemeral productions , constantly showered upon us , can not displace them . I would present a single illustration . What a volley of Comments , Expositions , Criticisms , Hints , all of about equal value , have lately been thrown upon the unfortunate prophet Daniel . One of the most illustrious characters of our race . And yet , an Exposition of that portion of sacred prophecy , worthy of the greatness of the theme , would be a most valuable addition to our theology . For if the Christian world is not wholly misled , the great visions of Ulai are hastening to their accomplishment . It is an encouragement for a student that he knows not his own resources till he has made the experiment . A particular department of study may appear to him unoccupied , but it is one in which he has not been conversant , and it is contemplated with reluctance . Let him make the trial , prepared to meet with obstacles , and he will find the field of labor constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with his theme . Many of the best works in literature have commenced with no matured object , and have far surpassed other productions of the same author , on which he might have high expectations . He did not know himself . Dr. Young apologises for neglecting more important studies , to write his Night-Thoughts . A w r ork on which his reputation as an author principally depends . It is , happily , a primary principle of the human character to be pleased with one 's own employment . Let the modest student enter upon the way , and be /z/ steady in his course , his ardor increases with every attainment , his mind expands , his invention is strengthened , his taste is purified , in the completion of his object he has disappointed himself , if not his friends . By every successful effort , he is prepared for additional labors , and becomes a blessing in his day , and for days to come . V. There are obstacles in the pursuits of science which are not to be overlooked . These should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disposed to relinquish his object when he comes to the encounter . One is , the community are but indifferent judges of literary merit . It is not uncommon that a publication of much value , a work of labor and learning , may be in a measure overlooked , while one of a contrary character , possessing some factitious attractions , may have a great run . A distinguished clergyman , a few years since , delivered and published an able Historical Discourse , the work of several months , on an important subject , and there were about a sufficient number of copies sold to pay the charge of publication . Soon after , he wrote a sermon in five hours , on the death of a suicide , attended with tragical circumstances , and the sermon soon went through three editions . The author has the consolation that his historic discourse will ever be doing good , and will be a document of high authority ages hence . The labors in science are not to be confined to the business of authorship ; they are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ public life . In these pursuits , literary and scientific attainments are highly important , and seldom fail of having a due influence , still , in all professions there are pretenders , novices , who , by artificial means , and retailing the knowledge of others , acquired clandestinely , bear away the palm from true merit and virtue . Such things are painful to our feelings , and it is trying to the benevolent heart to see the community thus defrauded ; but these evils will exist in man 's imperfect state . Still , true learning will be seen and known , it can not be concealed , it will be appreciated by the judicious and discerning , and will seldom fail of being highly useful . A great discouragement in the paths of learning is that the way is long . This is true . Great attainments in science are never made without long and laborious application . No mental power can grasp the whole at once . An unhappy impression has existed in some of our Seminaries , that three or four hours in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is as much as his health will admit , and as profitable as a greater length of time . All this is trifling . An injurious sentiment for any literary institution . In study there must be close thought indeed , and also writing and reading . Writing can be done no faster than the mechanical execution , and reading has its limits in like manner . Some will run over a volume in one or two hours , and say they have read it . Their knowledge will be inaccurate and confused . Read the works of Plato , of Livy , of Blackstone , of Edwards , in that manner , and what would you get of the spirit , of /z/ the rich thoughts , of those great writers ? It is well to intermix reading and writing , but ten hours in a day is none too much to be employed in application . We like the " ten hours ' system . " The course is long ! a relative term ; where is the goal ? By what scale do you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without end ; its benefits are gathered on the whole course . The enjoyment of discovery , the excellence of truth , the privilege of doing good , the security of a good reputation , are the perpetual rewards of the faithful scholar . Newton labored , without intermission , from early life to old age , much of the time with intense application ; and he had that enjoyment which he sought and loved , during his long life . What employment is more laborious than that of the traveller ? I believe none . Yet his labor is never finished . Behold the indefatigable Audubon , now traversing the Rocky Mountains , at the age of sixty years . I spake with him some months since , on his contemplated tour ; his wishes are nothing less than to ascertain the genus and species of all the birds of the forests , and to make known to his countrymen the best pass from the Mississippi to the Pacific . His attainments , notwithstanding all his privations and toils , are his constant reward , while there is but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowls of the mountains , and the wild beasts of the field are mine . " A greater obstruction in the pursuit of extensive literary acquisitions , than any other , especially in our country , is the limited circumstances of most /z/ students , which render it necessary for them to be engaged in the duties of active life . A partial remedy for this inconvenience , sometimes adopted by students , is by exchanging one misfortune for another , in a state of celibacy . An unwelcome suggestion indeed . I am not insensible of its alarming nature . But the names of Erasmus , Boyle , Newton , Locke , afford some relief to this infelicitous class , while they stand in the first ranks of literature . The laborious student , toiling for the good of his fellow men , may well be considered one of the exceptions the apostle Paul would make from the common rule of duty . One that is engaged in the duties of professional life , or as a teacher , or in public office , finds many embarrassments in the pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who surmount these obstacles , and make great advances in general literature , without abating , but increasing , their reputation and usefulness in their profession . Such are Lord Brougham , and Sir Robert Peel , in the British Parliament ; such w T as the late Gov . Clinton of New York ; and such are Adams , Webster , and Everett , in our own Commonwealth . Indeed it is not common that men of leisure do much in learning ; this is more often done by men of business . But , to do this , there must be a great thirst for knowledge , persevering application , and no time lost . We entertain a hope , that in the progress of our country , our high literary institutions may be furnished with scholarships , and funds , devoted to the support of students , who would pursue their studies after the close of their college course . In this way a large portion of the great scholars of Europe have been produced . There have been rich men and princes in European countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meritorious students , and enabled them to be devoted , exclusively , to literary pursuits . The want of books , has ever been spoken of in our country as a hindrance to the pursuit of science . This evil , though gradually diminishing , is not inconsiderable . Our public and private libraries , are more generally composed of the common works procured from the bookstores , which seldom have such as are often wanted by laborious students. * The hurry and activity of our countrymen afford small partiality for the folios and quartos , the black letter and the learned languages , of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . Many works of that period , of great value , are very scarce with us , if found at all . The works of Bishop Bull , the ablest English writer on the doctrine of the Trinity , are hardly known in our country . The writings of the early authors of New England , some of them distinguished for scholarship and correct thought , are but little known . The books of our country are widely dispersed ; could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in families , closets , garrets , often unknown to the possessor , be collected in public deposits , and duly arranged , the evil of which we speak would be greatly diminished . As /z/ things now are , the student is often subjected to much labor and expense , or , which is more common , ventures upon his conclusions without sufficient authorities . VI . I will now say a little on some of the departments of Literature that claim the attention of the American scholar . One is the learned languages . A great part of the literature of the world is still in the languages of Greece and Rome . And though much of it is translated , it is always impossible to convey in a translation the full spirit and beauties of the original . Previous to the last century , the most of the works of the learned authors in European countries were written in the Latin language . This was the case with the works on the Civil Law , and Medicine , almost as much as Theology . The most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as some others , was much cultivated , in the middle ages , by the Saracens . Those works , some of them written originally in Arabic , are mostly in the Latin language . We have a periodical work , principally scientific , published in Leipsic , in quarto , a volume a year , from 1682 to 1760 . There are a few extra volumes , making ninety in the whole . Written in Latin , a common vehicle , the contributors were the learned men of all European countries . It gives a correct view of the state of science for a period of eighty years . The title is " Acta Eruditorum , " in monthly numbers , and is understood to be the first periodical , except newspapers , published in Europe . /z/ This work of vast and varied learning , will probably ever remain in its primitive language . A familiar acquaintance with the learned languages expands the mind , and makes it familiar with the copious and impressive thoughts of the best modern writers , as well as with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language helps one , essentially , to a correct grammatical knowledge of our own . It is indispensable to a theologian to be familiar with Latin and Greek ; if he is not , a learned antagonist in polemic discussion will claim the advantage . Those who have not admitted the doctrine of the Trinity , have had the address to manage the discussion so as to make it a test of true learning to reject the sacred passage in John , respecting the " Three that bear record in heaven , " as not genuine . It was this that misled Adam Clarke . A good expositor in some respects , but having a passionate ambition for the reputation of great learning , he dare not do otherwise than reject that important portion of divine truth . The Catholics assail us in the same manner ; that it is our ignorance of the learned languages , and of the writings of the Christian Fathers , that leads us to disown them as the true church of Christ . The truth is , there has ever been much more learning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Reformation ; yet they will continue the charge . Our defence must be matters of fact . The most of our expositions on the Scriptures are in the Latin language . /z/ The physician , the anatomist , the jurist , the statesman , can never be competently skilled in his profession , without a familiar acquaintance with the writers in the ancient tongues . Another department of Literature claiming the attention of every scholar , is History . The history of our race is blended , more or less , with all our attainments in literature and science . " The proper study of mankind is man . " History is a statement of the human character , and the transactions of man , in all the varieties of condition and circumstances in which he has been placed . A large portion of Divine Revelation consists of history , written under the unerring guidance of the Spirit of f/ truth . All nations have their histories preserved , in one form or another ; among uncivilized tribes , this has been generally done by tradition , often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and the numerous periodicals , have a tendency to do away traditionary history , and this venerable and impressive mode of domestic instruction is going into disuse . Perhaps the present mode has superior advantages , but we can not witness the change without regret . " Tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation . " There is a life , a feeling , a permanence of impression , in an oral narrative , which a printed page can never impart . King Philip 's war was just a century before that of the American Revolution . And I much question whether the events of the latter , with all our books /z/ and schools , are as well known by the youth of New England , at this time , as were those of the Indian war , a century ago . In the study of history , the student should take a close and comprehensive view of the great subject , for permanent utility , and not mere temporary entertainment . A valuable history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining a full knowledge of the subject . Light cursory reading , with an expectation of going over the work again , is injurious to the memory , and leaves indistinct impressions . On the question as to the order of reading history , I should incline to the opinion , after some school-book notice of that of our own country , that , for a youth that is to be liberally educated , ancient history should take the lead . That portion of history has become settled ; it is not to be changed , by new evidence , or new writers . There is also a simplicity and distinctness in the events detailed , which are suited to the young mind , and calculated to make a beneficial impression . Ancient history exhibits an energy in the human character , a loftiness of thought , an individual elevation , which the arrangements of modern civilization would scarcely admit . The seminal principles of government , of law , of the arts of life , of the fine arts , are found in remote antiquity . And , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period , have never been surpassed . The architect , the statuary , the poet , must go to Egypt , to Greece , to Rome , for their first models . And no small part of the /z/ architecture of the present day is taken from the middle ages . The statesman looks to ancient Republics for models of free government ; and to the empire of Romulus , enduring for two-and-twenty centuries , for the permanence of civil institutions . Let the student of history follow the order of events , the progress of civil society , the perfect wisdom and order of Divine Providence , and his acquirements will be distinct and permanent . Chronology and Biography are very important parts of history . Without the former , one 's ideas will be confused , and he will never possess the accuracy of the scholar . By use , dates may be remembered as easy as facts . In Biography , Plutarch is the great model . In our public seminaries there is usually a misapprehension concerning the period denominated " the dark ages . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress than in the sixth century . The northern tribes came down upon the cultivated provinces of the Roman empire , and subdued them by their arms , while they in return subjected their conquerors to the mild sceptre of the Prince of peace . The empire of the Caliphs , of the house of Abbas , who reigned in unbroken succession for more than four centuries , were rivals in arts as well as power , of the empire of Justinian and Theodosius . During the same period , there were great advances in civilization among the Saracens in Spain . The battle of Toloso , in the year 1212 , for energy and military skill , is among the memorable battles of history . When Ferdinand /z/ and Isabella terminated the dominion of the Saracens in that country by the conquest of Grenada , and the expulsion of that people from their territories , like Louis XIV . revoking the Edict of Nantz , they lost the best artizans and manufacturers of their kingdom . The expedition of William the Conqueror in the eleventh century , was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases the contest was of the Gaul against the Briton . William , with his forces , crossed the English channel , in face of the shipping of his enemy , and fought them on their own ground , which Napoleon could never do . Let the battle of Hastings , in 1066 , be compared with the battle of Borodino ; the mightiest effort of war . In each case the forces of the assailant had been long trained to arms , and the stake was a kingdom . William was victorious and obtained his crown ; Napoleon failed to conquer , and the battle was his ruin . The principal difference between the two warriors was the difference in the times . The greater part of the civil institutions of modern European nations , had their origin in the middle ages . From thence has risen that mixed form of government which seems to produce greater satisfaction and stability than any other . Modern history is of great value ; and among the numerous works to which the student has access , it is important that he should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few with attention and care , than many in a desultory manner . When we speak of the historian , we would include /z/ the writer , as well as the reader , of history . To a few thoughts on this subject , Brethren Alumni , I would invite your attention . Our country is a great , a wonderful , country . Its whole history , as well as its origin , seems to indicate that it is designed by Infinite Wisdom to be a Model of Nations , to lead others to that elevation of human society , which we hope the Creator means to bestow on our race . In this view , to omit other considerations , it is of great importance that our history be well written and well known . In this would be found the origin and true nature of our constitutions , statutes , usages , civil and ecclesiastical , which have produced and sustain our unexampled prosperity . The materials of our history are numerous and authentic ; but uncollected , unknown , and dissipated as the leaves of autumn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limited and local narratives are the true and safe materials of history . One that writes a good history of his own town , a century or half century sermon , when the main object is an exhibition of facts , or the life of a distinguished man , confers a special benefit on the community . Every one that writes such a work , or even a characteristic obituary , should feel his responsibility ; the author of a more extended work will rely on him as an authority , and he is bound , not only to see that his statement is correct , but , according to the extent of his plan , nothing important is to be omitted . Such local narratives are the true sources of history , giving a correct character of the times . Many important facts can be collected from tomb-stones. /z/ Every College , and all important public Institutions should have a correct history . There are few literary men who can not confer an important benefit on the community and posterity in this way . It is true , my brethren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , not to be avoided . Some popular orator , engaged to perform on a public occasion , will send to you for facts respecting an important event , or an interesting character , and sets the time for his returns ; at the time appointed he makes a fine display , and is admired for his attainments . He trades on borrowed capital , and makes no mention of his creditor . This is a practical matter , which ought to be understood . But if we can not be content to labor without any other reward than that of doing good , in our thankless world , we shall do but little . Another way , in which honest annalists are tried in their feelings , is , that popular men , who speak well , and sometimes think well , very commonly , are not readers , or their reading is confined to periodicals and works of the day . They will speak confidently of past events , which they have heard of in conversation , and in their statements , be wholly incorrect . And others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as matters of fact . A distinguished gentleman in New York , not long since , said , without qualification , to a numerous Methodist congregation , that the first Sabbath school in the United States was established in Hanover , in Virginia , by Bishop Asbury , in the year 1785 . There were Sabbath schools in New England before /z/ that bishop or John Wesley were born. * A single case will show the importance of correctness on such occasions . Cicero says , in one of his Orations , that the first blood shed in Rome , in a civil commotion , was at the time of the sedition of the Gracchi , about 620 years from the founding of the city . A very interesting fact , but I believe it rests wholly on the authority of the great orator . Writers of history , in our country , if they take a subject of any extent , and mean to do it justice , have a great task to perform . The materials are not collected in public deposits , as is generally done in older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national history , I have no doubt , a century hence , than it is now . Documents will be brought to light , and collected , and many publications of no authority will be duly exposed . A peculiar difficulty on this subject is the state of public sentiment with regard to the time and labor necessary for a historical work . It is expected to be done off in a short period . An historian must have long and hard labor in collecting his documents , as well as in writing , and rewriting , and revising , his work . Much expense is necessary . He must often examine the sources himself , without depending on others . Records of legislatures , of courts , towns , churches , must be examined , and conflicting authorities weighed and estimated in his own mind . He must set no time for the completion of his work , till he has begun to write it over for the last time . /z/ But let it not be forgotten , that talent , and labor , and fidelity , so employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , under the guidance of immutable truth , looking to posterity and to Heaven for his reputation and success , will not fail of a great reward . He will have an influence in forming the character of generations after he sleeps . We have no National History , worthy of that name , and I see no prospect that we are soon to have one . Marshall 's Life of Washington is well done , for the circumstances of the author . The work was called for by the public before he entered upon his labor , and he had at the same time the various cares of his eminent station . President Adams , soon after he left his high office , was requested to engage in such a work . Had he then devoted himself to the object , before this time we should have had a National History , which , I presume , would compare , advantageously , with those of Hume , Gibbon , De Thou , or Livy and Thucydides . He thought some upon the subject , but was soon recalled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gifted son of Massachusetts , now our National Representative at the Court of Great Britain , if he could be induced to devote eight or ten years of the better part of his life to the service of his country , in this manner , would soon silence all other attempts , and , while he would rear a monument of fame , which few in our own land have /z/ yet done , the blessing of unborn generations would rest upon him . The only history written in our country , to which adequate time and labor have been devoted , and , in my view , the only one that w r ill be read in future times , is the History of Ferdinand and Isabella , by the amiable Mr. Prescott . He was employed about ten years on the work , and devoted much labor to the acquisition of the requisite information and documents . It is written with excellent judgment , and embraces a portion of history very interesting to Americans , and scarcely less so to the people of Spain . And , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I may add , a great part of this time he was so afflicted with weak eyes , as to be unable to read . He is now engaged on a history of Mexico , and he will not be hurried to the completion by the length of the way , or the prospect of emolument . I hope it is the design of Providence to make him a great blessing to his country . The Ecclesiastical history of our country is as important as that of any part of the Christian Church since the Reformation . We have nothing but detached and very limited portions , and these often incorrect ; notwithstanding the extension of the gospel of Christ was , professedly , a primary object in the settlement of most of the American Colonies . And it is a subject of pleasing recollection that the Confessions of Faith , of the Puritans of New England , the Episcopalians of Virginia , the Dutch Reformed of New York , and the Huguenots /z/ from France , one of the best portions of our early population , were essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence in promoting a friendly intercourse among the Colonies , and preparing the way for our ultimate National Union . The churches of New England are the only churches of modern times who have adopted the popular mode of ecclesiastical government . It was a rare experiment , but it has been successful , and has enjoyed the blessing of Heaven . Many Christians , in various parts of our country , and in other countries , are seeking for some ecclesiastical organization of a popular character ; and a well-written history of our Congregational churches , would be a great blessing to the Christian world . We believe this system of church-government to be scriptural , and peculiarly conformable to our civil institutions . But no one could do justice to this subject , without much time , travel , and research . There are indications at the present day , of no equivocal character , that the Christian world will look , for ecclesiastical government , to New England or to Rome . A volume was published , not long since , giving some account of the great religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ago . It is as well done as might be expected , in view of the short time devoted to the work , and the few materials with which the author was provided . But it is an inadequate representation of the stirring , heaven-guiding , scenes of the richest display of the grace of God this country has enjoyed . The state /z/ of religion , previous to that revival , was not as low as is there represented . A good history of that work , and of previous revivals , from the commencement of these churches , would be beyond all value . Other studies than those now mentioned are perhaps equally deserving of the attention of the student . The Mathematics , highly useful for the discipline of the mind , are essential to the cultivation of the mechanic arts , and to the principal improvements of the community . The scholar in his study , investigating the mechanism of the material world , lays the foundation of the numerous inventions and improvements so often introduced in Manufactures , Agriculture , and Navigation , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comforts of life . Natural Philosophy , in connexion with the sciences of Chemistry , Geology , and various others , are connected with numerous practical effects , and tend directly to promote the welfare and prosperity of the community . The diligent student , though often overlooked , must discover and make known the elements of the natural world , from which are derived the food , the medicine , the clothing , the mental improvement , with the various comforts and privileges of cultivated society . The rapid increase of the population of the world , at the present day , which has no parallel in ages past , is , primarily , the result of the improvements in science . The science of Astronomy , while it is eminently calculated to expand the human mind , and raise the affections to Him who directs the mighty move- /z/ ments of creation , is connected with many practical benefits . The husbandman , the navigator , the fisherman traversing all seas , are constantly dependant on the astronomical student , who must guide their calculations , and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less for the seaman than Capt . Cook . Geography and Statistics , very apt to be studied superficially , have an important influence on the welfare of a community . We know but little of the capacities of the world for the extension and improvement of the human race . The Old Colony of Plymouth , a tract of indifferent land , I think , will always sustain as great a population , and with as many comforts , as an equal tract in the valley of the Ohio . Massachusetts , the most populous of the American States , is likely ever to retain this ascendancy . The present territory of the United States , if it were as populous as this Commonwealth now is , would contain about 200,000,000 of inhabitants . It is generally characteristic of eminent men , that they are distinguished for their knowledge of Geography . For a statesman , this is indispensable ; and scarcely less so for a teacher , or for a learned profession . We should judge from the reading of Paradise Lost , that the great poet was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be a thorough scholar should be familiar with the holy Scriptures . The most perfect Narrative ever written is the Book of Genesis . Competent judges have placed the Book of Job in the first rank of Epic Poems . Milton has said , /z/ " There are no songs like the songs of Zion . " And all the sages of the world can not bring together such a mass of practical wisdom as the Book of Proverbs . But I will not deprive you of an extract from Sir William Jones , on this subject . He says , " Theological enquiries are no part of my present subject ; but I can not refrain from adding , that the collection of Tracts , which we call , from their excellence , The Scriptures , contain , independently of a divine origin , more true sublimity , more exquisite beauty , purer morality , more important history , and finer strains both of poetry and eloquence , than could be collected within the same compass from all other books that were ever composed in any age or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments of literature and science , eminently inviting to the scholar , according to his particular talent and inclination , affording abundant opportunity for usefulness and distinction . Fellow-students , the field is wide , it is continually expanding , yea it is white , go ye forth to the harvest . VII . We notice some of the benefits and rewards of literary attainments . These have come into view , incidentally , in connexion with the subjects to which we have attended . The first to be mentioned is , They are a sure unfailing source of usefulness . The great pattern of human life , the only perfect character that has appeared in our world , " went about doing good . " The human soul can have no higher aspiration than this , and no better /z/ presage of future blessedness . The world has been in great error in the opinion that learning is principally a matter of theory , and of little practical benefit . True learning is wholly practical , useful in every department of life , giving to every one an increased ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Learning in females is eminently useful , as they are the primary teachers of every rising generation . The acquisition of learning is an inexhaustible source of enjoyment to the possessor . Look at the vacant countenance , the listless sensations , the burdensome indolence , of the savage . The same in all lands . What is his enjoyment ? His highest desire is an exemption from pain . And to this he seldom attains . Hunger and cold are his constant companions , while to social enjoyments he is a stranger . Every gradation of improvement in the human mind increases the means of enjoyment . If a student inclines to the hypochondria , let him take up a problem in Euclid , or a volume of Plutarch , or the statistics of China , and think nothing of his diet . He has no occasion to be solitary ; gloomy solitude is ingratitude to Heaven . Attainments in learning command the respect of all men . The distinction that individuals obtain among others does not depend , ordinarily , on station , or profession , or office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of these is generally the scale by which persons are measured in the estimation of their fellow-men . Learning may indeed be connected with other qualities that are offensive ; it is some- /z/ times , though not often , united with odious vices , and these may destroy our confidence in the person ; but they do not alter our estimate of his learning . Literary men will hold their just station in the community , whatever be their employment . The infatuation of our countrymen for public office usually ends in disappointment . Our experience has proved sufficiently that no office can elevate an indifferent character , and that it is easy for such an one to degrade the reputation of an office . Many a noted character , had he retained his proper place in the community , might have passed away with reputation ; but , being presented to public scrutiny , he sinks often below his just deserts . We have spoken of our obligations to the place of our education , to do honor to our foster-parent . Alexander felt that he owed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . He said , one gave him his life , the other taught him how to live . The character of a literary institution consists , as we have said , in the reputation of its sons . And that reputation must be , principally , that of cultivated mind . It becomes us then , to be habitually laboring for those intellectual attainments which will be but the continuation of the impulse we receive in our classical education . No good habit is more easily lost than that of mental application ; and , being lost , it is very difficult to be regained . The professional man finds himself much occupied in necessary duties , and has little time for mere literary pursuits . Much can be done at intervals and broken portions of time . A /z/ clergyman procured the Universal History , in sixty octavo volumes , and set his task to read , by divine permission , a volume a month . This was done , without neglecting other reading , or professional labors , and in five years the task was completed , affording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations and all times . Instead of spending your time in reading periodicals , and the light steam-printing of the day , let it be devoted to standard works . Those that drink at that spring shall thirst again ; but they who are storing their memories at the fountain of great minds and great hearts , will find a perennial stream lasting as human life . Shakspeare , and the Spectator , and Bunyan , I am persuaded , will be as familiar to the literary community , two centuries hence , as they are now . Ephemeral publications may help one in conversation , to which a feeble intellect may attain , but they debilitate the mind and destroy the memory . They are read to be forgotten . Every kind and degree of useful knowledge is beneficial to the professional man ; it invigorates all his labors . I was early taught that each part of the circle of science strengthens every other . The business of Instruction , seems likely to become a profession , in our country , as it is in many others , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation and the usefulness of the teacher of youth . The greater the fountain , the richer is the stream flowing from it , and its fertilizing effects will appear in distant times . r /z/ The attainments in literature which honor our Alma Mater , honor our parents , our friends , our / country . Who are the characters , in all countries , that glow in the recollection of the world ? It is not the aspiring statesman , who rises to a temporary elevation , soon to be supplanted by a rival ; not the destructive warrior , nor the man of wealth ; it is , with few exceptions , the man of letters , the man of intellectual labor , who enlightens his contemporaries and their distant posterity , relieving the ills of human life , and increasing its blessings . How much less do we honor Caesar 's sword than Virgil 's song ; what was Cromwell 's power to Milton 's poem ? What was Charles V. , the first monarch to whom flatterers could say , " The sun ever shined on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abused subject ? And where would have been the heroes of ancient time , if Herodotus , and Plutarch , and Cicero , had not preserved them ? We have said , much is to be done . Kind friends , it is true . The men of learning have got to civilize the world ; to raise a great portion of our race from a painful degradation , and lead all to the blessings of industry , of self-respect , and social life . Being united in one common pursuit , the difference of station and language is of little consequence ; they can labor as brethren , mutually benefiting each other , and thus introduce a brotherhood of nations . The progress of science is tending rapidly to prevent the evils of war , to break down arbitrary power , to lessen the extent and evils of slavery . Science is uniting the world in mutual intercourse , and will /z/ lead to the universal spread of the Divine Salvation* Happy they who are sharers in the long and arduous labor requisite to this high consummation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glorious reward . Such will not have lived or toiled in vain . The machinery of Divine Providence is rolling on ; the heralds of the Cross will follow the Navigator and the Warrior ; the lights of science will explore the recesses of the Mausoleum , the Harem , and the Convent ; all true history will be confirmed , the universal brotherhood of man is established , the impostures of Mecca and Rome are unveiled ; the peaceful sceptre of the Man of Calvary unites a joyful race in thanksgiving and praise . ' Go , ye swift messengers , to nations scattered and peeled , to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto , to nations meted out and trodden down , whose lands rivers have spoiled , and bring them , a present , unto the place of the name of the Lord of hosts , the mount Zion . '
