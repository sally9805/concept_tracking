txt CLOSED rooms and the heat of fires are essential to the comfort of the inhabitants of New England during about eight months in the year . The great cost and labor required for maintaining these fires have produced constant efforts to improve the apparatus and render the methods of warming more economical . The old fireplace , which formed the sittingroom of a large part of the family , in the days of our ancestors , was long ago abandoned for the improved forms introduced by Franklin and Rumford . These again have passed away , and new arrangements of stoves , grates , and furnaces have succeeded each other , during the last fifty years , with a rapidity which , although it has often outrun improvement , has in the main greatly advanced the economy of warming houses , and given great comfort to all classes of people . Heat alone , however , is not all that is necessary to our com * fort , or even health , in winter . Without a constant supply of pure air , consisting of those proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has combined in the common atmosphere , we can expect neither a healthful body // nor a vigorous mind . Now , it unfortunately happens , that a supply of this pure air , or the ventilation of rooms of every kind , is necessarily adverse to the most economical methods of heating them , and it is a matter of no small difficulty to combine an efficient ventilation with a moderate consumption of heat . Even in cases where mere expense has been disregarded , and the attention has been confined solely to producing a temperate and pure atmosphere , success has not always followed the efforts of those men whom of all others we should consider most competent to direct works of this kind . To show this it is sufficient to mention the failure of Sir H. Davy , in 1811 , in his attempt to ventilate the House of Lords . But if the subjects of warming and ventilating he not yet so thoroughly understood as could be desired , we are certainly advancing in our knowledge of them , by a more complete investigation and publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the treatise just published by Dr. Wyman , of which it is our purpose to give a more particular account in this article , we have had , heretofore , several very excellent works , particularly those by Mr. Tredgold and Dr. Reid . The latter of these gentlemen has been rendered somewhat conspicuous by his labors in warming and ventilating the Houses of Parliament , and by the cry which has been opened upon him , in various forms , from the English press . Whatever may be said of his practical efforts , his book bears ample testimony to his very competent knowledge of the subject upon which he is engaged . But he is evidently an enthusiast , and , like most other enthusiasts , a man of a single idea . Ventilation is , with him , about all that is necessary in life . Food and clothing are insignificant , compared to it . The Lords and Commons are to meet in their new palace , not so much to make laws and govern the kingdom , as to enjoy the comfort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be rendered subservient to this end . Carrying his notions to this ridiculous extent , we can not wonder that he has failed to obtain credit with judicious men , who , however they may hereafter use his work when in search of facts , will not yield to his opinions the weight of an authority . The work by Dr. Wyman is not less complete and full than that either of Tredgold or Reid ; and in some points it // is much more so . It is very judiciously arranged . The plan which he has followed , according to the Preface , has been , - " First , to describe the laws and properties of gases generally ; especially the law of their diffusion , so important in its influence upon ventilation . " Secondly , the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere . " Thirdly , the processes by which atmospheric air may become vitiated ; particularly the processes of respiration and combustion , and the nature of the gases produced by them . " Fourthly , the means by which impurities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " Fifthly , the principles of the movements induced in air by heat , especially those occurring in apartments and in chimneys . " Sixthly , the moving power best adapted to ventilation , and the quantity and qualities of the air which should be supplied . " Lastly , the mechanical arrangements best adapted to effect the ventilation of the various structures to which they are applied . " - pp. vi. , vii . The first part of the volume , which contains an account of the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere , as a necessary introduction to the more practical parts of the work , is very full and satisfactory , and shows Dr. Wyman 's familiar acquaintance with the discoveries of modern science . But as we intend that the work shall speak for itself , we commence with the following extract of a curious computation , made by Dumas , showing the sufficiency of the supply of oxygen in the atmosphere . " The air which surrounds us weighs as much as 581,000 cubes of copper , 3,273 feet by the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubes . Supposing the earth peopled with a thousand million men , and animals equivalent to three thousand million of men , they would not together consume in a century a weight of oxyg*en equivalent to sixteen of these cubes of copper , while the air contains 134,000 of them . It would require 10,000 years for this number of men to produce a sensible effect on the eudiometer of Volta , even supposing all vegetable life annihilated ! " - p. 7 . Of the following facts and instances relating to combustion , some are new , and those which are not so will bear to be again examined . " A pint of oil when burned produces a pint and a quarter of water ; a pound of gas , more than two and a half pounds of water . // " An Argand gas-burner , in a shop-window , will produce in four hours two and a half pints of water , which may be condensed upon the goods , the window , or any other cold substances . " The Argand burner of the Boston Gas Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning at the Tate of four feet per hour , twenty-two ounces , or a pint and six ounces , of water , and four feet of carbonic acid , which will render four hundred cubic feet of atmospheric air unfit for respiration . " A pound of oil produces 2.86 pounds of carbonic acid , and consumes the oxygen contained in 13.26 cubic feet of atmospheric air . " A pound of coal-gas produces 2.56 pounds of carbonic acid , and consumes 4.25 cubic feet of oxygen , which is equivalent to that contained in 2125 cubic feet of atmospheric air . For every cubic foot of gas burned , an equal quantity of carbonic acid is produced , and renders , according to Leblane , 100 cubic feet of air unfit for respiration . " As an illustration of the demand for air to produce efficient lighting , we may mention the following . In the vestry of a meeting-house in Boston , some years since , great complaint was made of the impurity of the oil used ; it burned well for a time , when the lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening . The sexton was directed to procure better ; he tried many kinds , but all to no purpose . He had noticed , however , that , the longer he was compelled to remain after the services , and listen to the complaints of the aggrieved , the better his lamps burned , which was soon interpreted to mean the improvement of the air consequent upon the opening of the doors and the departure of the au*lience. " - pp. 65- 67 . The annoyance experienced in cities from smoke has always been complained of as very serious . So great is this grievance in London , that a member of parliament , a few years since , declared in his place , that it was well known that it had rendered the city uninhabitable . It has not yet attained to this formidable height with us , and probably the more general use of anthracite and wood than of bituminous coal will preserve us from the fate of London . Still , some method for burning smoke , where bituminous coal is used , especially in manufactories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it has not yet been fully accomplished , the way seems at last to have been opened to it ; and the following extract will indicate the principles involved , and the most successful practical results yet attained . // " We have already spoken of the great nuisance of the smoke of bituminous coal , as usually burnt in large cities . A great variety of modes have been invented and patents taken out for the consumption of smoke , but , until a short time , they have all been contrived upon a wrong principle . It has been supposed that it is only necessary to heat the smoke to a certain temperature to consume it , and if it is not consumed , it is because the requisite heat had not been attained . For this reason it was proposed , and the proposition was for a long time practised upon , to place the new coal in front , near the door , and allow the gases to be driven off over the hot coals and burn . This was Mr. Watt 's plan ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergoing the process of coaking , but never sufficiently diffused to mingle with the gases and accomplish their complete combustion ; even if they were transformed into carbonic acid , still , in passing over the incandescent fuel beyond , that carbonic acid would dissolve a portion of carbon and again become carbonic oxide . This plan was not successful , nor were any others which were formed upon the same principle . " An Argand lamp without a chimney will burn without smoke , if the wick be kept low ; but on raising it to a certain point , it smokes ; if now the chimney be put on , the smoke no longer appears ; it is not produced . In the first case , the volatilized carbon and disengaged hydrogen , into which the oil is converted , do not meet with sufficient air at a proper temperature until they have risen so high that they have become too cold to burn ; in the second case , this amount of air is supplied at the right place , and the red-hot vapor of carbon unites with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle upon which smoke is to be prevented in furnaces . Soft or bituminous coal is composed essentially of carbon and hydrogen , which , with a certain amount of heat , are disengaged as gases , and , if a proper amount of oxygen is supplied , and of a proper temperature , they unite with it and are consumed . If these facts are kept in view , it will be seen that smoke can be prevented as readily in the furnace as in th' Argand lamp . If the air is introduced in too large quantity , or at too low a temperature , the gases are cooled , and smoke appears . In these cases , it is found necessary to admit the air heated to a proper temperature , without allowing it to come in contact with the fuel , and entirely separated from that which passes through the grate , that it may retain its full amount of oxygen up to the moment it mingles with the gases . " It has been supposed that the admission of air would cool the furnace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not // to be the case when so regulated as just to consume the smoke , as will be seen in the following results of experiments by Mr. HI . Houldsworth . The kinds of coal used were Knowles 's Clifton coal , a free-burning kind , which does not cake , and produces a considerable quantity of ashes ; and Barker and Evans 's Oldham coal , a slow-burning , rich , caking coal , containing little ashes. * " Steam produced in a given Time . No air admitted , Coal thrown upon fire , 230 lbs . 100 No air , " " " " 460 " 109 53 square inches of air , " " " " 230 " 132 Air regulated to consume all smoke , " " " " 230 " 134 53 square inches of air , " " " " 460 " 140 Showing that the admission of air increases the amount of steam produced in a given time from 30 to 40 per cent . " - pp. 105- 107 . If it be difficult , with our present apparatus and methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical advantages which would be possible from the combustion of smoke , we may obtain an equivalent for this waste , in saving our heat by an arrangement of double windows . Although we now and then see this arrangement adopted , we are confident that it deserves to be brought into more general use ; and we have often wondered , that , with the laudable disposition to avoid all unnecessary expense , which is so general amongst our people , this simple fixture has been so much neglected . We know that the objection has sometimes been made to it , that the air of rooms thus guarded becomes less pure ; that it preserves the heat mainly by preventing the escape of the warm , or the entry of the cold air . This is altogether a mistake , as the single window , if well fitted , prevents the passage of air , but fails to retain the heat , which can pass through a thin wall of glass with great facility . The nonconducting power of the double window , on the contrary , is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a cold window makes a part of one of the walls , a constant current of cold air descends along it , which is often mistaken for that which enters the window from without ; but it will exist without that , and can not be prevented by closely fitted sashes , or any care in calking their crevices . The unpleasant effect of this fall of air from a number of large windows , as in churches , and their great influence in lowering the temperature of the room , are much greater than is usually supposed , especially in buildings // heated by warmed air , where the walls do not feel the influence of radiated heat . In our New England climate , where the temperature not unfrequently approaches zero , and is often below the freezing point , there would be a vast saving of heat , if our churches , court-rooms , and other public buildings , could be preserved from this cooling process . This can be done by means of double windows , fitting closely , and inclosing between them a quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat only by a change of position among its particles ; each particle may receive a portion of heat from a heated body , and , by coming in contact with another less heated body , communicate its heat to it , but not otherwise . One particle never communicates its heat to another particle . Hence , if glass , or any other material which transmits light , be placed at two or three inches ' distance from the glass , the inner sash will be kept warm , the circulation of the air between the sashes going on slowly ; consequently , less heat will escape from the room . If this same arrangement were introduced into the walls of the room , and the transmission of air between them cut off at two or three levels in each room , or even if the communication between the different stories were completely cut off at the floor and ceiling , great good would result. * In buildings in which a complete system of ventilation is established , these windows should , as suggested by Count Rumford , be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of ventilation , for , under such a system , windows would be required for the admission of light only , never for the admission of air . Double windows would , under such circumstances , in summer prevent the transmission of heat inwards , as in winter they preven$ its transmission in the opposite direction . Glass is not necessary in the construction of double windows , where we require only a diffused light ; white , cotton , stretched upon a suitable frame , and rendered impervious to air by linseed oil or other preparations , will answer equally well for preserving heat , and be much less expensive . " - pp. 125- 127. * " Mr. Nathaniel J. Wyeth , of Cambridge , Mass. , has adopted this principle in a brick ice-house which he has lately erected . The building is 198 feet long by 177 wide , and 40 feet hifh ; the walls are 4 feet in thickness at the bottom , and 3 feet 6 inches *t the top , including within their thickness two air-spaces . A triple wall is thus formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that making the division between the two air-spaces 4 inches . The air-spaces are subdivided in portions of 6 feet in length and 5 in height ; the first division being formed by bricks , and the second by planks resting on bricks projecting from the sides , and covered with dry tan . At the top and bottom of the building the air-spaces are made perfectly tight by masonry . The transmission of heat by the movement of the air is thus prevented , and the greater part of that which finds its way to the ice is by the radiation of the walls . " // In any system of ventilation established and practised upon rational principles , it seems necessary first to determine what quantity of air is requisite to each individual in a given time . It would seem that the ration of air , the food to the lungs , might be assigned , like the ration of bread and meat , the food of the stomach , and although we might be required sometimes to content ourselves with a short allowance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To determine this question , various estimates and observations have been made , which exhibit widely discordant results . Dr. Arnott will be content with two or three cubic feet a minute ; while the supply sometimes required in the House of Commons has been sixty feet a minute for each person . These extremes exhibit the difference between necessity and luxury . The smaller quantity will support life for the time , but with a constant feeling of discomfort and strain upon the health , while the larger gives a good tone to the body and a free flow to the spirits . In cold weather , and it is then only that the amount of air need be limited , it will always be found , that , however large a quantity we may desire , we must bound ourselves by our wealth . The supply of heat required to warm a room is in proportion to the supply of fresh air admitted to it . Thus , while the rich may enjoy open flues and hot-air furnaces , those of more moderate means must content themselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use their atmosphere , as they do their garments , as long as possible . It appears that the cost of high ventilation does not end with heating the air ; for it has been found that a larger supply of food is consumed by a person kept constantly in a fresh atmosphere , than by one having less change of air . The following cases given by Dr. Wyman are in point . " In a weaving.mill near Manchester , where the ventilation was bad , the proprietor caused a fan to be mounted . The consequence soon became apparent in a curious manner . The operatives , little remarkable for olfactory refinement , instead of thanking their employer for his attention to their comfort and health , made a formal complaint to him that the ventilator had increased their appetites , and therefore entitled them to a corresponding increase of wages ! By stopping the fan a part of the day , the ventilation and voracity of the establishment were brought to a // medium standard , and complaints ceased . The operatives ' wages would but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be answered by draughts upon their backs , which were by no means in a condition to answer them . " In Edinburgh a club was provided with a dinner in a well ventilated apartment , the air being perfumed as it entered , imitating in succession the fragrance of the lavender and the orange-flower . During the dinner the members enjoyed themselves as usual ; but were not a little surprised at the announcement of the provider , that they had drunk three times as much wine as he had usually provided . Gentlemen of sober , quiet habits , who usually confined themselves to a couple of glasses , were not satisfied with less than half a bottle ; others , who took half a bottle , now extended their potations to a bottle and a half . In fact , the hotel-keeper was drunk dry . That gentlemen who had indulged so freely were not aware of it at the time is not wonderful ; but that they felt no unpleasant sensations the following morning , which they did not , is certainly quite so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any arrangement for producing or aiding ventilation , it is necessary to become familiar with the laws which govern the movements of air . " The movement of the air has been called by Dr. Reid , according to the means by which it is brought about , the plenum , the vacuurn , and the mixed movement . Giving here merely the general principles upon which they act , a description of the means by which these movements are kept up will be deferred to a subsequent chapter . " By plenum movement is meant the circulation produced by air forced in from without by the wind , or any mechanical power . Every part of the room so ventilated is subjected to a slight pressure , and air escapes through all doors , flues , and crevices ; it is one of the advantages which attend this mode of ventilation , that there are no indraughts whatever except through the proper channels . The wind-sails used for the ventilation of ships act upon the principle of the plenum movement , the moving power being derived from the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The force of the wind , acting upon a cowl turned towards it , is frequently made use of in the ventilation of build* ings ; and where it is combined with another in the opposite direction , with a good wind , is quite efficient . But as we can not depend upon the constant and sufficient action of the wind , and as it has no effect in calm weather , when we require it most , other and mechanical means must be provided . In almost all cases , air vitiated by living beings , except in the very hottest // weather , is warmer than that into which it is poured . In winter , it is very much warmer ; and hence , when a sufficient outlet is afforded in the ceiling , an important moving power is obtained , aiding the plenum movement ; we seldom make use of a plenum movement solely . " The vacuum movement takes place where we produce a difference of pressure , whether by heat applied at the bottom of a chimney , or by mechanically pumping out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The reverse of the plenum movement , there is in this a pressure of air in at all windows , open doors , and flues not connected with the moving power . It is therefore a matter of great importance to the successful opera . tion of this plan , that the windows should never be opened , and the doors as little as possible . This movement , produced by heat , is the most natural and simple , and is observed as well in the great movements on the surface of the globe as in the operations of the arts . It is the only means ordinarily employed in private houses , and by far the most common in public buildings . " The mixed movement is produced by a combination of the means just mentioned ; the vacuum movement being induced by a chimney , and the inward pressure , with its inconveniences , obviated by the propulsion of the requisite quantity of air . It is undoubtedly by a nice adjustment of this mode of ventilation , that the most perfect system may be produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small space , the quantity of air required for their comfort is greatly increased ; and unless a corresponding increase in the exhausting power is provided , - and this is accompanied with an increased inconvenience from the pressure inwards at the doors , - mechanical means must be resorted to to make up the deficiency . " - pp. 131- 133 . " In examining the ventilating arrangements of a room , the smoke from gunpowder burnt in a spoon will be found very convenient ; it need not be in sufficient quantity to heat the air materially , and yet will show the various currents in different parts of the room at the same instanV . If exploded over the register in the floor for admitting air from the hot-air furnace in common use , the current will be found to rise rapidly to the ceiling , along which it will flow towards the walls , descending by these slowly , by the cold windows more rapidly , approach the register , and a part be again drawn into the ascending current . The various currents from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found to follow the course we have pointed out in the preceding illustrations . A fine thread of silk has been frequently used for the same purpose , but it will be found better adapted to // the examination of single currents than those complications which are usually found in a room . " - p. 140 . Such are the movements or modes of ventilation which are to be applied under all varieties of circumstances , and modified to suit the size and height of the room , the method of heating it , and the use to which it is subject . Of rooms for public use , where large numbers assemble , churches are generally the least difficult to ventilate , as the audiences are rarely large in proportion to the size of the building , and the assembly seldom continues more than an hour and a half ; a time so short , that a few flues or openings in the ceiling , and a supply of air from a Wakefield furnace , or hot-air stove , are sufficient to correct the effect of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive than that of churches , as the audiences are more crowded , the ceiling lower , and the lecturer often overestimates his ability to interest his hearers , and holds them together more than his legal hour . As it is not often in our power to adopt the plenum movement in a lecture-room , great care should be used , when such rooms are designed and built , to provide large flues in the walls , or openings in the ceilings which should be assisted by cowls to produce a constant flow from the rOOm . School-rooms , occupied , for several hours in succession , by persons of tender years and requiring every aid from external circumstances to fortify their health and assist their growth , need a high degree of ventilation . Children are not readily sensible of the presence of foul odors or a suffocating atmosphere . Hence , they may receive much injury in their health from bad ventilation , without complaint . Cold is immediately painful to them , and they will take care to let their sufferings be known . They are therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with pure air if at all chilly . But they should be exposed to neither ; for it is impossible that the object for which schools are instituted can be well attained without an invigorating atmosphere , which gives clearness to the mind as well as strength to the body . As the number of scholars who assemble in one room rarely amounts to a hundred , there can be no difficulty in providing a sufficient ventilation for them , if it be taken into consideration and made part of the design when the schoolhouse // is built . If then neglected , especially if the building be divided into stories , and occupied by different schools or classes , so many difficulties may be found in adding flues for ventilation , that they will most likely be for ever wanted . Dr. Wyman has given the subject of school-rooms particular attention in his treatise , not only in relation to ventilation , but in respect to various other conditions which affect the health and comfoi*t of both scholars and instructers . Of all rooms for large assemblages , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to ventilate . The complaints constantly made of the close and uncomfortable atmosphere of our legislative chambers are known to every body . This is to be attributed solely to these assemblies continuing together during many consecutive hours , so that , if there be any excess in the production of noxious over the supply of pure air , it has time to accumulate , while the members of the assembly , from want of exercise , and sometimes from the prosy and unsatisfactory character of the debates , are rendered particularly sensitive to the annoyance . The amount of fresh air required for a House of Representatives or a House of Commons is enormous . It is in warming and ventilating the British House of Commons , that Dr. Reid has found it so difficult to give satisfaction to the public . This gentleman was employed by the government , after the destruction by fire of St. Stephen 's chapel , formerly used by the Commons , to warm and ventilate the rooms temporarily provided for parliament . It was intended , likewise , to make such experiments with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of heating and ventilating the new Houses of Parliament , then erecting . Funds without limit appear to have been placed at his command , and on his part , he seems to have disregarded all complexities in the construction , and all attendant difficulties of derangement from neglect or any other cause . He has made the chamber a part of a chemical apparatus , and the air and the Commons are substances to be operated upon by it . The air is strained , washed , heated , and again moistened ; and then it is sent , in definite quantities , always under control , to combine with the members . Thermometers and observers are placed wherever they can be useful , and one would suppose that all that can be effected by science to render the house comfortable had been done . Still , such is the diversity of sensa-41* // tion in different members , that Dr. Reid complains , that , when the House first met , after the ventilating arrangements were made , one of the members exclaimed , as he hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be suffocated immediately " ; and in a moment or two , he was followed by a second who said , " I am shivering with cold , I can bear this houseno longer . " He found , moreover , that the same individuals differ materially in their feelings at different times . Occasionally it has been found necessary , in order to suit the fluctuating orders of the members , to make from fifty to one hundred changes in the quantity and quality of the air in a single night . In general , the members require air of a higher temperature before dinner ; after dinner an increased quantity of air at a moderate temperature . Moreover , it is found necessary , in protracted sittings , as the time advances to two , three , four , and five o'clock , in the morning , gradually to increase the temperature to stimulate the exhausted constitution , except when the excitement of the debate is extreme . The greatest supply is needed in autumn , when the air is moist , the wind light , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet a minute are required to render the atmosphere comfortable . The various experiments made by Dr. Reid , and the knowledge obtained from their results , led a committee , charged with the subject , in 1841 , to recommend the following plan for ventilating the new Houses of Parliament . " The air , according to this proposed plan , is to be taken from a height of 200 feet , by two towers , the clock-tower and the Victoria tower , which are to be situated at opposite extremities of the immense pile of buildings constituting the new Houses of Parliament . The design in taking air from this great height , and from two sources , is to escape the various impurities which usually exist near the surface of the earth , and to use one or the other source , as the wind may drive smoke or impure air towards the other . From these tow*rs the air is conducted to a basement story , between the foundation walls , whichextends under the whole building . This immense area is expected to afford , in warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of the halls above . In the basement , also , is to be placed the warming apparatus , the mechanical power , and all the horizontal flues connecting with the upright flues conducting to the various apartments . " After the air has been properly tempered in the basement , it // is to be allowed to ascend into the public ball above , and into the committee-rooms . In the committee-rooms , the air entering which is to be only moderately warmed , are to be open fires , fed by coke or other smokeless fuel . All the ventilating and smoke-flues of these apartments , to the number of about 400 , are to be carried upon a fire-proof floor under the roof to a ventilating tower or spire over the central octagonal hall . This tower , which is to he 250 feet above Trinity high-water mark , is to be the sole egress and the principal moving power to the whole system . " Provision is to be made in this tower for making a fire , if it shall he found necessary ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural current of the wind , by which the air is forced inwards , aided by the rarefaction of the air , when heated in the various apartments , by which it flows outwards , will , in most cases , produce a sufficient ventilating current in the lofty tower . When the Houses are much crowded , it is intended to make use of mechanical means to propel the air , and prevent indraughts at the doors . " As the larg* halls are used in the evening only , and the committee-rooms in the day-time , it is proposed to use upon the committee-rooms the same power which at other times would be devoted entirely to the halls . " The following is the estimate of the expense of the warming and ventilating arrangements of these buildings , machinery being provided to assist solely in the ventilation of the Houses proper . 1 .

To pass from these great and expensive works to the more simple , though more important , matter of ventilating private houses in connection with warming them ; the great principle laid down by Dr. Wyman should always be borne in mind , namely , that the greatest economy in warming can not // be combined with the most perfect ventilation . They are things incompatible with each other . To produce a sufficient ventilation with the least possible waste of heat must , therefore , be the measure of excellence aimed at . The heating apparatus now in common use with us may be arranged under three kinds . The open fireplace or grate ; the close stove , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placed in the room occupied by the family ; and the apparatus for hot air , in whatever form it may be constructed . Where the open fireplace or grate is used , it must always be accompanied by a good ventilation ; as the flow of air to the chimney , above and by the side of the fire , must be attended by an equal flow of fresh air from without . With the wide fireplaces and open flues , such as were used by the early settlers in New England , the ventilation was in such excess , that the temperature of the room could never be raised much above that of the external air . The model of this old fireplace and chimney was probably brought from England by the Puritans , where it had lately been substituted for the more simple hole in the roof , in the dwellings of the common people ; as Holinshed says that old men , in his time , mentioned the great increase of three luxuries since their remembrance , namely , glass windows and chimneys to their houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close stove was an immense advance from the open fireplace , even after it had been improved by narrowing it to its smallest dimensions , in giving a comfortable temperature to rooms ; while it has been attended with the great evil of rendering the ventilation imperfect . Used as it sometimes now is , under the name of the air-tight stove , in a close room , it can not fail to be most pernicious to the health of all exposed to it . The mode of warming by hot water or steam held in vessels or pipes within the occupied room may be subject to the same abuse . Should this method of warming houses be imprdved and extended , as we think it not unlikely it will be , some flue or aperture should always be provided for ventilation ; otherwise , it will become quite as injurious as the air-tight stove . The system of warming by hot air , whether the air be heated immediately by the furnace , by water , or by steampipes , is one of the greatest improvements in domestic comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilating // as well as heating apparatus , and it is only necessary to provide for a sufficient evaporation of water , to be introduced with the air , to render the atmosphere of a room always comfortable and healthy . Those to whom the sight of an open fire is pleasant , and who are not willing to abandon the domestic hearth , may use hot air for their halls , entries , and many other rooms , and retain the fireplace and its accessories in their sitting-rooms ; and this combination furnishes the most perfect method of warming and ventilating now known . The peculiarities of the foregoing systems of warming and ventilating are fully described and examined by Dr. Wyman ; and as it is our purpose rather to call attention to his work , than to furnish a treatise of our own , we may here close our notice with again recommending his book for the sound judgment , accurate science , and good taste which everywhere pervade it.                   @ @
