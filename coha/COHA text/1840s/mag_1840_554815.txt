txt THE recent exhibition of Mr. Aliston 's paintings invites us to offer a few thoughts upon the works of the artist and the art which he adorns . In doing so , we stand in the same relation to the subject of our remarks which we should hold with regard to an author still living and writing in the midst of us ; being restrained in same degree from the license of eulogy , and withheld from the freedom allowed in speaking of those who have passed from the scene of their labors . Yet is this delicacy due rather to the reader and to ourselves , than to the artist . The mind of one who has for many years been following his own serene course , passing from land to land , and from school to school , hut always true to himself , and leaving traces of his history from time to time in gentle images and harmonious colors , must of necessity look with slight emotion upon the opinions of the unjust , the incompetent , the over inquisitive , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place in the roll of American artists , without reference to any higher pretensions which may be asserted for him , is too barren a laurel to be worn with much sense of glory . When his name shall belong to the past , who then will wear it ? Yet doubtless there are many , who think the whole debt of glory cancelled by the little word first , and criticism discharged of all her duties , when she has stamped it with her approval . We must speak more freely than only to echo the vote of the majority . One living man among us , and one only , has any right to be named in the highest walk of his art , as holding the pencil of a master . if we would learn how far his excellence extends , we must go elsewhere for our terms of corn parison . There can be no offence in these remarks ; for the time has not come for art to have accumulated its treasures and formed the public taste among us . For all the declamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur of nature in our Western world , and the influences to be exerted by our free institutions , they have hitherto impressed // a tendency to the useful , rather than the beautiful , upon the national mind . The mountains and cataracts , which were to have made poets and painters , have been mined for anthracite and dammed for water powers . It is probable , that much more will depend on the yet undetermined character of the race , which will by and by assume one or more distinct national types under the influence of the matQrial and social peculiarities of existence in the new world , than upon the terns of our constitution or the magnificence of our landscapes . The national character may he Attic or Bceotian , of Spartan vigor or Athenian elegance ; but it is safer to remember what we have accomplished than to predict what we shall do , while as yet we know so little of the direction to he given by circumstances to the mind and character of a new people , sprung from the mingling of as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome after the invasion of Alaric . Hitherto our masters in all the nobler paths of intellectual culture have been sought for in the old world ; and it is there we must look for the scale by which to measure any degree of excellence , that passes our ordinary standard of judgment . If the subject of these remarks had any thing to fear from such sources , he might hold in dread two classes of critics . There are some who admire all pictures , especially if they are in richly ornamented frames . The strong primitive instinct for rich colors attracts them alike to the studio and the carpet warehouse , to the camera obscura and the kaleidoscope. in a great painting they are enraptured with some of those effects which belong to it in common with the most inferior work ; nay , if it have any extravagance of coloring or conception , they will he most apt to fix on this very point as chiefly to be admired . Their remarks , whether in speech or print , are worse than valueless , for they persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see with a superficial critic 's eye , they have studied out , - approfondi , as the Frenchmen say , - all that the artist bas in him . There are many civil and pleasant creatures of this kind dangling about all picture galleries , as capable of judging of the nobler productions of genius , as they would he of criticizing the observations of Herschel , did they honor the firmament with a glance through their quizzing-glasses. // The other class of critics has been already described by Sir Joshua Reynolds . It consists of those , who , " not knowing what can or can not be done , are very liberal of absurd praises in their descriptions of favorite works . They always find in them what they are resolved to find . They praise excellences that can hardly exist together ; and , above all things , are fond of describing with great exactness the expression of a mixed passion , which more particularly appcars to me out of the reach of our art . " Such are the two orders of umpires , that distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason of it is not difficult to discover . In this country we have but limited means of educating the eye and the taste to the just appreciation of the beautiful in art , as it has made itself familiar to all the cultivated classes in lands where centuries have been garnering up the tributes of generation upon generation . The great works of the great artists of the past may be said to be unknown among us . We educate ourselves upon what we find , and our standard becomes of course imperfect . The commonplace observer is readily pleased with a little glare and effect , and never acquires a relish for better qualities . The more enthusiastic and contemplative single out some master of loftier capacities , and break over him all their alabaster-boxes of sentiment and idealism . They remind us of the homely proverb , signifying that the bells ring in the tune that unwise heads are thinking of , - of the lady and the curate , one of whom saw whispering lovers , and the other cathedral spires , in the moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it the quintessence of roast beef , plum puddings , pies , and custards , - and all this because , as good Sir Joshua said , " they describe their own imaginations . " It is not invidiously , or with any assumption of superiority , that we make these remarks . It is because the standard of general taste must he considered , before we can trul feel how lonely is the summit that genius toils so long to gain . The eyes of many follow its course so long as it moves lightly up the flowery slopes , and turn away when it reaches the steep and difficult ascents ; a few are ever peering with telescopes of doubtful transparency to see it reach some castle which they fancy in the clouds ; but fewer are they , // who mark every step of its progress , and can measure its height when it has reached the extreme limit of its efforts . With all the honors and praises which have been bestowed upon Mr. Aliston while among us , his final appeal for judgment can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , not , we hope , to " foreign nations , " but to " his own countrymen when some time is passed over . " There are , indeed , some few among us fitted by nature and trained by long study to speak with authority upon our artists and their works . It is by their silence , rather than by any forwardness upon our part , that we have been led to venture upon a task we should have gladly seen committed to other and abler hands . The sketches of his own life given by Mr. Allston , and to be found in Mr. Dunlap 's entertaining volumes , delineate his real history more vividly than many long biographies have done for their subjects . He mentions his early tendency to the imitative arts , but without attaching too much importance to so common a trait . From his fantastic images and miniature landscape-making he passed to drawing from prints , and then to original compositions of the scenes in romance that interested his boyhood . Becoming acquainted with the famous miniature painter , Malbone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own words , " could make no hand of it . " He succeeded better in oils about the same time ( this was early in his college life ) , and even at this period painted a landscape with figures , which was afterwards exhibited at Somerset House . An old landscape , by an uncertain band , at a friend 's house in Cambridge , the pictures of Pine in the Columbian Museum , and Smibert 's copy of the head of Cardinal Bentivoglio after Vandyke , in the College Library , were his models . It strikes us as a little singular , that our painter of love , and peace , and purity , and solemn story , should have shown an early fondness for comic scenes and banditti combats . A few years later , and Mr. Allston turned his attention to Scripture subjects , and produced two heads of Apostles , having thus run through in a natural order the various departments of painting , as yet wandering with little instruction and little apparent certainty of aim . At the age of twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art for three years . This was // the first time he had fairly found instruction , and it may not be idle to glance at the condition of the English school of painting at that period . Sir Joshua Reynolds had now been dead about ten years , and his distinguished contemporaries , Wilson and Gainshorough , some years longer . From them the rise of painting in England may fairly date its origin . The first by his magnificent 1 ) ortI*aits , full of individuality and sl ) irit , and glowing with rich coloring , had elevated this branch of painting almost to historic dignity . His clear and noble views of art as taught in his lectures , his dignified and amiable character , had reflected new lustre upon his name as an artist . It seemed at times as if , to the less ambitious department in which he shone unrivalled , he might have added equal triumphs in the loftier department . The Tragic Muse " in the National Gallery , although a portrait of the great actress of his time , is invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real lineaments and outlines . Mr. Allston himself speaks of two of his pictures , which we have never seen , as showing what he " might have done in history . " If the " Holy Family , " which we have seen in the National Gallery , is an exhibition of his powers in this department , he sinks immeasurably below the purer standards and , unhappily for his glory , at the side of this very painting , is the Venus instructing Cupid , of Correggio , to shame with grace and sweetness the wholly unpoetical representation of so much more holy a subject . But we suppose posterity has decided , that Sir Joshua was the Vandyke rather than the Raphael of rising art in England . Of the two eminent landscape painters we have mentioned , Wilson , beyond question , was of the higher order . He sought in foreign lands for the subjects of his pencil , and , following in the steps of Clatide and Poussin , endeavoured to find in the skies and scenery of Italy the same source of inspiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country seats ; and guineas were more indispensable than glory , and what he got hardly , he spent wrongly ; so that Wilson , the first of English landscape painters , left no school behind him but that of his own masters . Gainshorough was a thorough Englishman , who painted from nature , and nature in her simple aspects ; aiming at no great effects of composition , but content with a hill , a cottage , // a clump of trees , a market-cart , a peasant girl , and such familiar objects . His legacy to his countrymen was the same nature from which he painted , and little beyond this . Such were those whose fame still rested over the land where the young pilgrim was to be initiated in the first mysteries of his calling . They left behind them an improved state of art , but they had not created any thing like a standard , to which the student could look for models in the loftiest range of his profession . If the " English School , " which Sir Joshua supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gainshorough would be ren ) embered as one of the most eminent founders , had followed in the steps of the three artists we have mentioned , it would have aspired only to moderate triumphs . It was destined to grasp at a higher dominion under the reign of their most distinguished successor , one of our own countrymen . When Mr. Allston arrived in England , Benjamin West , the successor of Reynolds as President of the Royal Academy , and the first painter in the country , must have been at the height of his glory . His welcome to his young countryman was marked with all the kindness that belonged to his amiable character . Of his excellent personal qualities , Mr. Allston has spoken warmly , but we do not know that he has publicly expressed his opinion of his merits as a painter . To West , at least , belongs the credit of having nobly dared , if not of having greatly accomplished , all that art can compass . A competent critic , Sir George Beaumont , has said " When we consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had at first chosen , though there was not a grain of taste for it in the country at that time , it does him the highest honor , and I am ashamed of the recent ungrateful neglect of my countrymen . " He was too ambitious in his aim , and too successful in his career , not to have made bitter enemies ; he ventured into the field which long ages had filled with genius , and was measured by the side of their colossal champions . Prolific almost beyond modern example , crowding his vast canvass with every image of human passion and superhuman majesty , his very failures were redeemed by the grandeur of his efforts . His deficiencies in some of the accessories , especially in color , are familiar to those who have studied his works . // But beyond this , so far as our opinion may be hazarded , there lies a deeper and more fatal cause for the neglect which his works have suffered . The spirit of the porlirait painters , the same spirit which made Reynolds represent his Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried Copley away from his courtly sitters to paint the House of Lords , with its peers and periwigs , and flamed out in the scarlet regimentals and crimson faces of Trumbull 's heroes , - was still to be seen in the classic and sacred compositions of XVest , under the Roman 's wreath , under the martyr 's circlet , under the Magdalen 's veil ; reducing all alike to the common national likeness of the living London model . In this he led the way for feebler successors , who still worked over the same material , patching and mending from year to year , until at length , when the last spark of expression had expired upon the pencil of Westall , the English artists returned to more congenial pursuits , and the public smiled once more for Wilkie , and Turner , and Lawrence . If Raphael , in the midst of Italian beauty , complained of the deficiency of the " belle donne , " and was forced to look inwardly for what he did not find about him , how much more must this necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressive types after which the English people have been fashioned . It is not enough to equal nature as we see it habitually . The great Italian painters knew this well , and they went to crypts and ruins to trace the lineaments , which , in broken and faded colors , had outlived the race that wore them . The Flemish masters thought otherwise , and therefore , with all their wonderful powers , they have given us for angels and cherubs the plethoric wives and pursy children of their worthy burgomasters . The ancient order has been often reversed ; seven fair women were moulded into one fairer image of old , but it has been oftener true in modern times , that one tolerable model has been multiplied into twenty intolerable pictures . We have but imperfect means of determining what was the direction of Mr. Allston 's studies during the three years he spent in England . He began by drawing from plaster , the usual discipline , we suppose , of the Academy , and appears to have been a ready scholar . We see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of his art during this period . A comic picture , and a Rocky Coast // with his old favorites the banditti , and another landscape which he had painted in college , were his contributions to the annual exhibition at Somerset House . His comic picture found a purchaser , and he painted another for the owner to match it . In what other labors these years were passed we know not ; whether he imitated or avoided the example of the leader of the English school , or , taking from him only the ambition of hereafter excelling in the historical department , confined himself to academic studies and efforts of the humbler kind we have mentioned . Originality is never so absolute as many are fond of supposing , and our artist himself has rebuked the arrogance of self-taught genius and its worshippers with too much earnestness to let us suppose he could be sensitive in hearing it mentioned , that he had imitated one or another master during his progress to the fullness of his own powers . When a youth , we have said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a few of his early sketches of the comic kind which we have seen , it is not hard to trace the influence of Hogarth , and we are as little disposed to regret that he relinquished the one as the other . We have not seen any attempt of this kind by M Allston , which carries the mark of the pencil which his maturity has wielded . It seems to us an exceedingly interesting circumstance , that , during his first residence in England , he should have given no more decisive evidence of the path he was to fob low . Whether it were diffidence , or wisdom , or good counsel , that taught him to reserve his powers until he had broken from the world of English art , and sought the original fountains whence it first flowed , the fact is certain , that he escaped to a wonderful degree the effects which might have been anticipated from the example of his celebrated countryman , to whom , as an American , and as a kind friend , he must naturally have been strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great powers , and the best painter of his time in England , it would he hard to point out any very eminent example of success in those who have folloxVed in his footsteps . The master who filled acres of canvass with so rapid a hand was of all models the most dangerous , the qualities in which he excelled , conception and general design of his subject , tending much more to lead the student // into an ambition beyond his capacities , than to give him thorough habits of doing well whatever might be within his reach . From nearly all influence of this kind , we say that Mr. Allston seems to have escaped . There is nothing in his pictures to remind us , that they were painted in smoky London ; - no fog of Newman Street rests over his Egypt or Judea . Whatever effect his long and doubtless diligent studies in England may have produced upon his progress , they were happily employed in giving academic precision to the groundwork of his future excellence , rather than any sudden maturity of style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mannerists he will outlive . The English historical school , - if West and his scholars could claim this title , - has often fallen into the local peculiarites of the life which they saw about them . It may have been pardonable in the earlier artists to have introduced cowls and mitres among the apostles , but we can not now forgive the transplantation of familiar features and costumes into the representations of sacred story . Faces which are pleasant to look upon as they smile over the tea-table are not therefore in keeping with the solemn scenes of Scripture . Not to leave this fault without an illustration , we may refer to one among many such examples we could easily find ; and we take one that all may verify . In the picture of " Christ healing the Sick , " of which a tolerable engraving may be found in the work called " The National Gallery , " one of the prominent figures , a mother with a child in her arms , is marked by a trifling peculiarity of costume , which , strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has equally destroyed the ideal at which the painters aimed . Because the milliners of Mrs. Siddons 's time thought it becoming to dress ladies with a bandage round their faces , as if they had the toothache , and because Mrs. Siddons thought fit to be so painted , ( as everybody may see in the Stage Edition of Shakspeare , ) was there any reason why West should enrich the daughters of Palestine with the graces of Pimlico ? We have preferred a trivial illustration to a mere peremptory accusation . To have utterly avoided faults like those of which we have spoken , would seem almost a miracle in the history of a young artist , whose earliest instruction was given by those // who bad become the masters of their time in spite of these faults . But it is plain , that the genius of Mr. Aliston never expanded to its fair proportions until it was touched by another wand than the pencils of the English academicians . We doubt whether there are many critics living , who would venture a conjecture as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed his earlier time of study , from any thing to be detected in his paintings . And this brings us to the period at which his steps were turned to the true school where he learned and displayed his powers . Mr. Allston left England for the continent in the year 1804 . At that period , half the collections of Europe had been deprived of their choicest works , to enrich the Imperial gallery of the Louvre . An opportunity never again to be enjoyed was presented to the artist , of embracing in one glance , and enjoying in a single hour , the brightest treasures which three centuries had accumulated . Of the impressions which they produced upon the artist 's mind , we have only one partial record ; and , although we can , perhaps , reconcile it with the course of his subsequent studies , and the acknowledged superiority which resulted from them , this record is hardly what we might have anticipated . The objects which he has commemorated as having " absolutely enchanted " him , - as having " taken away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings , not of the Roman or Lombard masters , but of the Venetian , - of Titian , Tintoretto , and Paul Veronese . And , as if conscious that we should wonder that the aspect of perfection in one of the secondary qualities of the art , namely , that of color , should have entranced the mind of one we should have thought most susceptible to the great poetical qualities , - the creative powers which call out scenes and characters , - Mr. Allston justifies himself by some ingenious remarks in which the state of mind produced by the gorgeous concert of colors is compared to that arising under the influence of music . The idea contained in these remarks is , that color , like music , has the power of setting the imagination at work , and indirectly suggesting a thousand ideas and feelings it does not immediately supply . A passion for this source of excitement , and a susceptibility to it , are , we should think , infinitely more rare than nicety of musical ear . The eye being the great intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the ear , which is less // constantly in relation with the judgment . A passion for color may exist with or without other attributes of a great artist . West , to whom we have so often referred , was deficient in perception of color ; another artist , well known among us , who never ventured upon grave historical subjects , - Stuart Newton , - was conspicuous for his exquisite taste in this respect . After a residence of some months in Paris , Mr. Allston went to Italy , where he remained four years , - a long life to a busy mind in the midst of every incitement to study , and surrounded by all the varieties of perfection as its models . Most of this time , as we learn , he resided in Rome . Here his character as a painter was formed , but of the exact course of his studies we have no information . It is from a hint or two scattered here and there , and from the testimony which his works themselves furnish , that we may put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study which he has left apparently to be made up from these fi *gments . It is enough for us , that , after his long residence in Italy , he returned to England a master in his art , - his very first effort being a complete triumph , and his subject no less a miracle than that which Michael Angelo and Sebastian dcl Piombo had chosen for their united powers , with the hope of rivalling the " Transfiguration " of Raphael . Before hazarding some remarks upon the various characteristics of Mr. Allston 's style , we can not but advert to a circumstance of great interest in his history . We allude to the long intimacy with Mr. Coleridge , which commenced during their residence in Rome . In the artist 's words , to no other man did he owe so much intellectually . We have sometimes wondered , when we have thought of " Christabel , " the sweet Unfinished , and " Bel*hazzar , " the great Unseen , if the fastidiousness , not to say caprice of the poet , may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so grateful . How easily a poetical mind acquires an influence over the painter , we may see in the works of Irving and Leslie , - where the same succession of scenes and characters that sparkles on the page of the one , glows on the canvass of the other . To those who remember the " Genevieve * of Coleridge , and have seen the " Rosalie " of Allston , // although in one love is conscious , and in the other slumbering , the same soul of purity , of trustful tenderness , of thoughtfuluess , not mournful but akin to melancholy , will make the two seem as sisters . " Few sorrows bath she of ' her own , My hope , my joy , my Genevieve ; She loves me best whene'er I sing The songs that make her grieve . " - " No , never came from aught below This melody of woe , That makes my heart to overflow , As from a thousand gushing springs . " - " 0 , nothing sure the stars beneath Can mould a sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " So thought the gentle Rosalie , As on her maiden reverie First fell the strain of him who stole In music to her soul . " We have followed the steps of Mr. Allston up to the period at which he gave to the public the first great work , which was to be the evidence of the powers that had been so long in training . " The Dead Man revived by touching Elisha 's Bones , " was the first picture undertaken by Mr. Allston upon his return to England in 1811 . From that period to the present time , whatever changes may have occurred in his style , his subjects and his mode of treating them have been uniformly marked with the daring and firmness of maturity and , considering his character as a painter from this time as formed , we can pass over more lightly the influences to which he was afterwards subjected , and , leaving the details which may hereafter belong to his biographer , look at the life of the artist as distinct from that of the individual . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full blaze of English criticism , by attempting a subject like that of the miracle of the awakening of the Dead . It must have been a boldness which was acquired beneath the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , - it must have been the habit of modelling from the Torso and the Laocobn , which prompted this rash and giddy effort . All the difficulties of // drawing and grouping , all the subtilties of expression , were to be mastered in the same composition , which seemed as if chosen , by the aspiring candidate for fame , in defiance of every circumstance that multiplied its dangers . Mr. Allston has recorded his unbounded admiration for Michael Angelo , in describing the impressions he first received from the works of the great Italian painters . In the first two pictures on the Catalogue of the late Exhibition , he has recorded the same feeling , with no doubtful hand , upon his canvass . To us , the magnificent picture of " The Dead Man restored to Life , " seems not in all respects nuexceptionable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too haggard and frightful to be brought into the very front ground of the picture . When Raphael once dared , - in the cartoon of " The Apostles healing the Sick , "  --  to introduce the hideous forms and faces of two wretched cripples , he relieved the effect their prominence could not but produce , by the angelic graces with which Saint John is clothed as with a divinity . When , in " The Transfiguration , " he drew the convulsed epileptic in all the struggles and contortions of his terrible disease , he disposed around him three figures whose expression is all tenderness and loveliness ; and one , the most prominent of all , said to have been drawn from her whom he loved but too fondly , is fair and graceful enough to draw our eyes and thoughts away from the painful contemplation of the agonizing youth beside her . In Mr. Allston 's picture , the fearful miracle which seems to be working even before our eyes , and the various expressions of astonishment and fear which the scene produces upon those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effect which startles rather than attracts us . The tenderer passions , depicted in the other characters of the picture , are comparatively lost sight of in the midst of these terrible images of struggling death and life , of overwhelming astonishment and terror . Nothing but the most perfect delineation of the gentler feelings , in the most beautiful forms , could have neutralized , so to speak , the effect of their violent attitudes and expressions upon our feelings . Yet , as instances of anatomical truth , and of the bold drawing which follows from thorough familiarity with the structure of the whole frame , and of energy of ex // pression , the prominent figures of this painting are worthy of the school from which they came ; that of the great sculptor , the force of whose chisel no other hand could equal , and whose paintings , like his marbles , were but too severe in their matchless truth and majesty . It has been doubted how appropriately the light was represented as emanating from the skull of the prophet . We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , to convey the chemical idea of phosphorescence , rather than that of divine effiux ; but this could only be to those who have less imagination than philosophy . We have not now the advantage , as we could wish , of carefully examining this picture in various lights , which doubtless should be done to acquire a just perception of all its details . That it received the highest honors of the British Institution at its Annual Exhibition is of comparatively little consequence ; for there was no historical painter in England at that time , to our knowledge ( with the exception , if the reader chooses , of West ) , who ever conceived of laboring after merit such as this painting possesses . But that the artist , in his first great effort , should have so nobly trusted to his own powers , that he should have so triumphantly vindicated the seeming audacity of his venture , and , grappling with every human passion , and with the mysterious presence of superhuman power , should have chained them in this living and terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers and ambition . To those who are fond of tracing resemblances we would mention the central group of Raphael 's cartoon of " The Death of Ananias , " as being possibly in our artist 's recollection when this painting was conceived . The miracle is reversed , - the struggle is from life to death , and not from death to life ; the figure at the head of the dying man shows little more than astonishment , - that at his feet , on the other hand , recoils in unmingled terror . The same daring spirit is shown in the subject of some other pictures painted not long after the one just mentioned , and still remaining in England . The first is , " The Angel liberating St. Peter from prison , " painted for Sir George Beaumont , and now in a church at Ashby de la Zouch . The subject is similar to that of a fresco of Raphael 's in the Vati // can . Of the second picture , " Jacob 's Dream , " belonging to the Earl of Egreinont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behwe , but 1 have treated it in a very different way from any picture I have ever seen ; for , instead of two or three angels , I have introduced a vast multitude ; and , instead of a ladder , or narrow steps , I have endeavoured to give the idea of unineasurable flights of steps , with platform above platform , rising and extending into space immeasurable . Whether this conception will please the matter-of-fact critics I doubt ; nay , I am certain that men without imagination will call it stuff ! But , if I succeed at all , it will be with those whom it will be an honor to please . " It is impossible that the reader should not be reminded by this description of the manner of treating his subjects adopted by Martin . Immensity of space , startling effects of perspective , innumerable multitudes melting together in dark myriads , and only illuninated at the point where the principal action is passing , vast masses of gorgeous architecture piled over each other , and spreading away until they are lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which this artist at first astonished , and at last satiated his admirers . It was scenepainting of an elevated order , a gigantic machinery of appliances* in the midst of which the actors were reduced to puppets , and the uncounted multitudes dwarfed away into bundles of pinheads . It was a brilliant paradox , impressive at first sight , but soon losing its effect . Heaven and hell had been carved in a nutshell before the days of Martin , but they had never been painted in the compass of a square yard . Ships had been wrought of ivory , with all their ropes and sails , that might have floated in a lea-cup ; but the deluged world , with all its inhabitants , had never been crowded into the circumference of a napkin . Whether Martin 's original hint came from the picture of " Jacob 's Dream , " we have no means of determining ; but , if it were so , it would not have been the only instance in which he has borrowed from Mr. Allston . Of one thing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great points of individual character and expression , for the sake of imposing effects obtained by theatrical artifice and extravagance . " Elijah in the Desert , " we have heard spoken of as being one of Mr. Allston 's best pictures . This he brought // with him to America , where it was purchased by an English gentleman . The painting of " Uriel in the Sun " belongs to the Marquis of Stafford . The grandeur of the subject is in this picture of surpassing elevation , - to paint in all his effulgence the Angel of the Apocalypse , after the description of Milton . " lie soon Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand , The same whom John saw also in the sun : His back was turned , but not his brightness hid ; Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar Circled his head , nor less his locks behind Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round ; on some great charge employed He seemed , or fixed in cogitation deep . " " The Archangel Uriel , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throne , Stand ready at command , and are his eyes That run through all the Heavens , or down to the earth Bear his swift errands . " A colossal figure , on the scale of fourteen feet in height , but foreshortened to nine feet , seen in the full blaze of the sunbeams , must have called forth all the painter 's powers , and tasked them to the utmost . This painting too was honored with a liberal token of approbation from the directors of the British Institution . It must , therefore , be a great picture , because not to fail in delineating such a vision of glory was in itself a triumph of genius . These are the most important of Mr. Aliston 's paintings while in England , his other works being of less pretension , and of various nature , so far as we can judge of them by the scanty record he has given us . Of these great pictures , one only was in the late exhibition . But there was still enough in this collection to illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a careful analysis , to afford an insight into the character of his various excellences , and the models he had proposed to himself for imitation . The great picture of " The Raising of the Dead Man , " was one of the chief ornaments of the exhibition . The remarks we have already made respecting this composition may perhaps explain the fact , that it was less the favorite of the crowd than some of the other paintings , although it was , from its position as well as its nature , the first to arrest attention . One other painting , " Jeremiah dictating his Prophecy to // Baruch , " may be traced also to the school of Michael Angelo , so far as the character of the subject , the colossal scale of its execution , and the severe simplicity which distinguishes it may justify this opinion . The face and head of the Prophet are full of grandeur and majesty . The drap*ry is , if possible , too simple ; hut the painter has chosen to throw the whole force of his effort into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have recommended a less exalted subject . On passing in review the series of historical pictures we have mentioned , we at once perceive that Mr. Allston has aimed to reach the loftiest sublimity in the conception of his great works . If we may judge those we have not , by those which we have , seen , he has treated his subjects with the dignity of conscious power , and , choosing the drapery of his art , as the fitting garment of noble thoughts , has thrown it , without one idle fringe or fold , over the pure and holy images that rose before his imagination . It remains for the future to decide upon the success of his greatest effort , - Belshazzar 's Feast , - in expectation of which we have been fasting some few years , with only a cabinet picture from time to time to sustain us in endurance . We are disposed to admire the constancy with which Mr. Allston has resisted all the busy suggestions of curious and forward people , and waited for his own time and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brick and mortar , the wood-hewers and waterdrawers , work on all days alike , and must be always true to their stipulated hour , is that any reason that we should subject the highest intellectual power , the creative imagination , to the same laws that govern the lowest , the least capricious and the least fatiguing of our faculties ? The factory wheels run day and night , and summer and winter ; but there are tranquil waters and silent souls , which an angel visits only " at a certain season . It will be remembered , that the subject chosen by Mr. Allston for his greatest work has been already treated by Martin , in his usual style . It appears from one of Martin 's letters , given by Mr. Dunlap , that he undertook this painting in consequence of an argument with Mr. Allston , who had mentioned his own intention , and the mode in which he meant to treat the subject . We remember hearing it said , but we know // not on how good authority , that the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , was borrowed from the American by the English artist . However this may be , the conception does not strike us as unlikely to occur to more than one mind at the same time , for it is only a modification of an idea long familiar to the poets and painters of the supernatural . In the famous " Notte " of Correggio , and in the " Adoration of the Shepherds " of Rembrandt , the infant Saviour is represented as the source of the light that shines upon the group around his cradle . The heads of saints in many of the ancient pictures , are surrounded with luminous halos , and Mr. Allston has extended the same attribute to the skull of the buried Prophet . Virgil bad recourse to the same appearance in showing the presence of the divinity around lulus . It is not so much in the thought of making the characters luminous , which seems obvious enough , that the merit of such a painting as " Belshazzar 's Feast " could consist , nor in great architectural pomp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just management of all these secondary objects of interest , and , infinitely more , in the truth and feeling with which the character and passions of human beings , under the influence of the sudden appearance of the Divinity , in the portentous warning that crossed their hour of revelry , should be displayed . If any of our readers will glance at the Catalogue of the late Exhibition , they will see next upon the list " The Triumphal Song of Miriam on the Destruction of Pharaoh and his Host in the Red Sea . " This painting forms the connecting point between the two series of our artist 's works . The first series comprehends the pictures we have already mentioned ; the second embraces the various representations of tranquil female beauty , ofwhich " Beatrice " or " Rosalie " may be taken as the type . We have always considered " Miriam " as the happiest effort of Mr. Allston we have seen . It has , to be sure , the advantage of action to arrest the attention , while in others of his female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give better reasons for our preference . " Miriam " has all the dignity of an historical painting ; it is a scene in which there is only one actor , but a terrible tale is told by her triumphant lips , and the yet heaving ocean is // rolling sullenly in upon the beach the wrecks that prove its truth . The painting has all the individuality too of a portrait , and thus gains the advantage of producing one clear and instant impression , without the analysis the mind must go through in contemplating a varied composition . Besides this , the style of coloring adopted in this picture , so far as we may be allowed to judge , ( and this is one of the mysteries of art , of which we ought to speak diffidently , ) is superior to that of almost any of the artist 's productions . In fact , the whole painting recalls Titian to our minds with singular force ; the same robust and gorgeous mould of vigorous beauty , and the same transparent flesh , the same dark , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despair to learn by what alchemy he changed his colors into molten jewels as they flowed upon the canvass . We can not speak in the same terms of " The Witch of Endor raising the Spirit of Samuel before Saul . " In regard to this picture , we feel almost compelled to retract one of our previous remarks . We do think that we see the scholar of West in these faces and attitudes , and we do feel compelled to own , that we find a little something in common between this picture and the works of that most prolific illustrator of Bibles and prayer-books , some twenty years since , who , having three or four stereotyped faces and forms , applied them like the Nuremberg Chronicle , to all the characters of sacred and profane history in succession . Sure at least we are , that the impression produced on us by this picture reminds us of Westall ; but it is very possible , that we may be mistaken as to the resemblance , and at any rate we have nothing else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An elaborate painting of Mr. Allston 's , which came to the exhibition from the South , " Donna Mencia in the Robber 's Cavern , " was one of the greatest favorites in the exhibition . A woman in distress affects most minds more strongly than a suffering angel ; and this scene of purely human character served as a pretty touchstone , to try the sympathies of the many who circled the gallery . The picture has great depth and richness of color , and by its brillancy , as well as its subject , arrests the attention of all . It has , independently of its merits , the interest belonging to it as a work of // a different style from any of Mr. Aliston 's finished paintings , and may be the realization by the artist , in the maturity of his powers , of some of those conceptions of banditti advenures for which he has recorded his early fondness . The expression which characterizes Gil Blas and Donna Mencia , the charm of his ingenuous and graceful youth , and the beauty of her features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all outward show of emotion , give a tragic dignity to this melodramatic subject . Among the most remarkable and characteristic of Mr. Allston 's works are a series of female heads of expression , varying in many points , but all sisters of the same family . Such are " Beatrice , " " Rosalie , " " A Roman Lady , " " The Valentine . " In other instances , he bas given his subjects at full length , and , calling in the attractions of landscape to his aid , has yet contrived that nature shall so harmonize with the state of the beings he has represented , that the air , and the earth , and the heavens shall seem but as the emanation or reflection of those whom they surround . On some of these pictures we may hazard a few remarks . It strikes us that the general tournure , the outline , the attitude of Beatrice , are most graceful and happy . There is all the simple ease of Raphael in the air of this picture . But we do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Valentine . It wants more tenderness , or more sadness ; we look and ask what is the expression of the features , instead of looking and feeling what it is . Mr. Allston can not wonder at remarks of this kind , for he knows the infinite difficulty of giving those shades of expression which have been his favorite attempts , - but those who " describe their own imaginations " will wonder at it much . To represent a strong and simple emotion is a thing of comparatively little difficulty . The common drawing-books will give the learner models for hatred , scorn , wonder , grief , and even love . But to represent , as in Beatrice , the susceptibility of womanly feelings rather than their expression , or , as in " Rosalie , " to attempt to write upon her lineaments what love will be rather than what it is , is more than we can hope for any art to compass . There will always be strongly imaginative minds , who will see in these fair images all that the painter could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown , that forcibly marked // character , whether of strength or beauty , or at any rate strong expression , must he impressed upon the marble or the canvass , if they would appeal to the common taste and heart . There is more of warmth and soul in the expression of " Rosalie " than in " Beatrice . " The eye in particular is of great beauty . But the effect of the foreshortened face , however admirable the drawing , is to compress the features , and perhaps take away from the first effect of the picture . In " Rosalie " we see , even more than in " Beatrice , " the softness of outline and haziness of atmosphere which have characterized many of Mr. Allston 's later productions . The " Valentine " lady has fat ' less of the ideal , and far more of breathing life about her than " Rosalie " ; it is a real woman , and not a poetical vision . In color and costume , it appears to us admirable , and we are only disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all meretricious ornaments , all affected grace , but should also somewhat neglect the commonly received notions as to beauty of features . In the expression of that vague condition of the female mind and heart , where there is tranquillity at the surface , while the elements which make up so large a share of woman 's existence are lying just beneath , and , as it were , only to be suspected through any outward sign , it is obvious that the accessories of the principal figure may be made of great significance in giving meaning to the delineation . For this reason , we are more pleased with the full length paintings such as the " Evening Hymn " and the " Spanish Girl , " than with the half-lengths . In the first of those just mentioned , for instance , the effect of the " dim religious light , " which blends softly together the hard outlines of day ; the character of the architecture , of which just enough is seen ; the mellow shadows , in the clear depths of which a strong light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holy repose , that spreads , as if from the maiden 's soul , to her features and her figure , and outwardly into all the inanimate things around her ; produce upon us an influence which proves the power of these harmonious combinations in suggesting images hardly to be directly delineated . More obvious if possible is the same truth in " Lorenzo and Jessica . " If the atmosphere of the painting last noticed was the mysterious twilight of religion , that of the picture we // now mention is glowing with the tremulous light of love . Any elaborate display of scenery would have broken the unity of the scene ; the outlines of a few edifices in the horizon are quite simple and serve to relieve the bright moonlight , which seems to have borrowed a warmth not its own from the hearts of the young lovers upon whom it is smiling . We are tempted to make a few remarks upon some of Mr. Aliston 's landscapes , but we feel even greater difficulties in forming our opinions respecting this class of productions than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art in the composition of a landscape , so much of mysterious skill in managing the lights and tints which are spread by nature with such infinite variety over her works , so much individual truth to be combined with general harmony , that we have always felt the incompetency of any eye hut an artist 's to judge truly of all the merits or defects of this class of paintings . The poetical character of Mr. Allston 's mind shows itself in his landscapes as much , perhaps , as in any of his productions . It is a great error to imagine , that the highest reach of the landscape painter consists in giving an accurate copy of some particular scene ; as much so as to suppose , that an exact portrait of an individual is as elevated a work of art as the ideal Apollo or Venus . Sir Joshua Reynolds has contrasted the Flemish and Dutch landscape painters with Claude in this respect . Which of these masters Mr. Allston has followed can not be doubtful . The poetical feeling which Claude , more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may he a dangerous gift . The best living English artist in this department , Turner , has doubtless been led away from the truth of nature , by following too ardently the seductive light of his own imagination . It may have been the good fortune of Mr. Allston to have been so long removed from the competition of academies and exhibitions , that he has avoided the temptation of soliciting the continued notice of the public by means of novelty and artificial extravagances . The habit of painting up to each other , of struggling for brilliancy and strong contrasts , in order to avoid being thrown into shadow by more ambitious artists , is doubtless one of the dangers that tends to corrupt the simplicity which belongs to genius . Without saying that Mr. Allston has ever reached the perfection // of the unrivalled master who dipped his pencil in the sunshine , we must allow that his landscape paintings are among the most remarkable we have seen among those of the followers of Claude Lorraine , for their composition , their coloring , the truth of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced , and the true poetical spirit with which they are conceived . The colder and classical style of the learned Poussin is less congenial to the mind of Mr. Allston ; yet in the few landscapes we have seen of his , - and there were two or three in the late exhibition which remind us of this master , - his spirit was most happily preserved without any servility of imitation . Our country has the right to claim , then , at least one great name upon the list of living artists . On him descended those nameless influences , which , in all countries and ages , have from time to time fallen upon such as Heaven has chosen , to delineate and adorn in various modes the images that fill the worlds of reality and of dreams . In the midst of the trials and fatigues of common life , from which none of us , and least of all the artist , escapes , he has been laboring for us and for our children , to combine the scattered beauties of nature , to reproduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melted away among the clouds of imagination , to call hack in renewed existence the creations of the past . And it is not mere natural genius to which we owe our admiration and gratitude , hut genius improved by patient study , refined by still seclusion , warmed by good affections , and therefore diffusing itself in images as finished , as pure , as full of gentle feelings ; even as one planet is reflected with the same light from the bosom of many waters . Born in a country where the art of painting scarcely had an existence , subjected to the same academical instructions which have been so fertile in producing mediocrity among the English painters , he seems to have followed only the purest models of the best days of Italian art . And , whether we trace in his loftiest efforts the daring of Angelo , or detect in his clear and glowing tints the pencil of Titian , or see in his soft gradations of light the delicate hand of Correggio , in all we can equally trace the influence of the painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ; showing a power which will lend to the future more than it has borrowed from // the past . It can only be when time shall have added his mysterious charm to our artist 's productions , when they shall have become familiar to the popular eye as are the constantly repeated works of the old masters , when the general taste shall have reached a far higher standard than at present , that the verdict of posterity will be announced . If our republic should be destined like Rome to triumph in every thing hut in sculpture and painting , she has at least hegun with better auspices . The courtly grace and hearing of our ancestors before the Revolution survive in the forms that fill the ample canvass of Copley ; the fathers of our republic and the first race of her citizens are recalled in the brilliant life that flowed from the pencil of Stuart ; the rehellious Colony sent one of her rude children to rule over the Academicians of her royal mistress ; and , if the century which has given their names to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - but that the brightest and noblest of all , - its offering to the arts has been worthy of what may be hereafter called'the heroic age of the country.
