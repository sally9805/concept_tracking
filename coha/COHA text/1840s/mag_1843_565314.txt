txt Nnw ENGLAND *5 the home of Congregationalism . It is true , there are Congregational churches elsewhere . They are numerous in England , Wales , and Scotland , as well as in many of the states of our own Union , and most of these do honor to the name which they bear , and are living witnesses to the excellence of the polity after which they are ordered . There is no place however which Congregationalism calls her own , with such manifest propriety , as New England . Few are the communities in New England in which a church does not exist , founded on this platform - few , in which such a church does not stand foremost , in its spiritual beauty and fruitfulness-in the energy of its moral influence-in its place in the respect of the community-in its hold on the intelligence , the cultivation , and the wealth of the population . These churches are the true genii loci . In their separate and confederate strength , they are felt to be the glory of New England at home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our land  --  and this land itself through her , to be the light and hope of the nations . Not only is Congregationalism most at home in New England , but this is the place of her nativity . Her soil was possessed in the name of a free spiritual church ; a church which should be free that it might be spiritual , and which was to be spiritual , that it might continue free . Her colonists reared upon // her shores , no gorgeous standards emblazoned with emblems of earthly state , amid the pomp of military pageantry and the din of martial music . It was with beaded knee , and with cheerful , though trembling song , that they consecrated this earth and these heavens to the honor of the Son of God , as it might be seen in churches ordered by his will . In forming them , their pattern was no ill-assorted patchwork of the gaudy but soiled remnants of apostate Rome-nor was it the fantastic product of the brain of some wild enthusiast . It was by the open Bible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the pattern showed them in the mount , that they measured and wrought each one of its separate stones . The issue corresponded to their faith . The Head of the church smiled upon churches freed from the lust of power and framed in primitive simplicity . As the population increased , new churches were planted . Soon the fame of these churches for intelligence and order ; for peace and spiritual fruitfulness ; was borne across the Atlantic , and New England churches were founded in the mother land . We are not aware that the Congregational churches of New England were ever more truly prosperous , than they are at the present moment . We doubt whether there was ever a time , when they were more sound in the faith , more faithful in discipline , or more abundant in good works . Never were they so richly blessed of God in the power and frequency of the visitations of the Divine Spirit . Their position at present however is somewhat peculiar . Their duties to themselves and to others , as arising from these circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful consideration . To this position , as indicating what these duties are , we would invite the attention of our readers . The great questions of the times are these : " Where is the church ? " " What ought the church to be ? " Church polity is a leading study of the times . One would think that the perfection of the church in this respect , was essential to its health and salvation . Every theorist of course has notions of his own-and is as ready to defend them , as the Abbe Sieyes was in his day to furnish a constitution to order , or our own unfledged politicians have ever been to tinker the currency . are not surprised to notice in a certain class of men , a disposition to speak of the defects of our own system , and to remark freely upon these evils and the results to which they are tending . Some do this , who prefer Congregationalism to every other polity , and for this very reason , would correct its few deficiencies , and give it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , who seem not to be at home in its simple structure , and long for a more splendid establishment . This sensitiveness to the defects of our own ecclesiastical system , and this readiness freely to talk of them , we believe to be peculiar to ourselves . We glory in it as the evidence of a love of truth stronger than our love of sect . The Presbyterian , especially , if he is of the more rigid sort , is so accustomed to appeal to The Book , that be is insensibly led by his habitual deference to its prescriptions , to regard it as the end of all wisdom . The Methodist regards no system as worthy to be thought of , compared with that Discipline , in which John Wesley so shrewdly reconciled the most absolute clerical despotism , with the intensest popular activity . The Episcopalian considers no excellence so surpassing as his excellent liturgy and government-that petrified specimen of the English // mind in its transition from Rome to to Christ . The Congregationalist , alone , is not insensible to the defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what is more worthy of notice , is free to confess them . But what are these defects to which some among us are somewhat morbidly sensitive ? Whywe have no creed as a standard of orthodoxy-we have no usages established by authority , as a pledge to decency and order . Our system is loose and disjointed . It involves the radical principle , that a company of Christians may choo*e and ordain their own officers , and yet be a church of Christ . It makes each church to be a separate and individual existence , and thus tramples on that unity for which the Redeemer prayed and his apostles labored . These complaints are no new thing under the sun . They are as old as the very beginnings of the Congregational system . The great and good men who were amazed by the audacity of its novel principles , saw in them only the elements of weakness and disorder , and predicted for the churches based upon them , a speedy and contemptible dissolution . So has it been from then till now , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous and healthful existence , and been a fountain of life in the universal churches . To all these obiections there is one triumphant answer . The system has been tested by time . The defects complained of , are defects in its theory-not its practical workings . these evils against which there is outcry , are anticipated evils , not actual and present defects . They are such as possibly may arise , and against which we have no provision , in a nicely balanced paper-system-no checks and balances to make the machine go right of itself . But where is the system which works better than this ? Where the polity which better answers the ends which church polity has a right to accomplish ? Where in the wide world , is the faith of the gospel more pure , or the piety of the gospel more fruitful , than in these churches ? Where are the clergy held in higher honor , and their office in greater respect ? Where is the unity of the spirit more faithfully kept in the bonds of peace ? Where does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universal church , and that the member of a sister church is in fact united in the same fellowship with himself ? Whereas he goes here and there through the community of churches , does he feel , that in every church he shall find a home , and be received by its members with the warm welcome of a brother ? The practical workings of any system , upon a fair trial , we can not but consider a sufficient test of its excellence . In vain do we search the world over to find more pe*fectly realized , the ideal of what churches ought to be , than in these New England churches-as they have been and now are . When then we are told that our churches are without order-we plainly reply , it is false , so false , that in point of fact , there is no where such real order as with us . When it is said our system is loose and disjointed , we answer , it proves not se . No churches , no ministers , are held more tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of action a phalanx more precise in its movements , or more effective in its aggressions . But to these defects more particularly . " We have no creed , or confession of faith , which we receive as a standard . " And what if we have no such creed ? Do we need one ? Is it not known , what we preach , and what we believe ? Is it not also known , that in the // main , our churches and ministers believe and preach the same thing ? Is the gospel so indefinite and ob . scure a thing , that living men can not read what it is in the English Bible , and so give or withhold their fellowship , as this gospel is professed or denied ? " But heresy will by and by creep in . " As if the next generation were to have neither intellects nor souls of their own , which , enlightened by the spirit of God , could be trusted to be vigilant for themselves . As if the present generation were to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will creep in , if you trust the defense of the faith to a dead statement of Christian truth , rather than to the zeal and vigilance of living teachers . Such statements , without this vigilance , guard from no evil , while they tempt the heretic to a perjured conscience , and the true to a false reliance , in their efficacy to guard against error . As summaries of Christian truth , they are not to be despised , but as defenses of the faith they are not to be relied upon . " But we have no established usages . " It is true , we have no Directory for public worship and no order of Common Prayer from which we may not deviate . Nor have we a rigid form , prescribed by authority for the organization of a church , or the ordination of a minister of Christ . We have usages however , consecrated by time , and commending themselves to all , by their appropriate and significant simplicity . " But they are not printed in a book , and enforced by authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus enforced , and yet be consistent with our distinctive principles . In this however , there is nothing peculiar or alarming . There is nothing peculiar . The customs of the common law-the forms of legal procedure , the rules of admission to the legal and medi cal professions-are regulated not so much by statute as by actual practice . The law of evidence , by which life , and property , and per son , are protected or forfeited to law , is an unwritten thing . There is nothing alarming . We need not fear that those who follow us will lose their memory , or their com* mon sense . It is not certain , that they will forget what has been the usage of the churches-or , in a paroxysm of folly , will rush from its sober ways into some fanatical disorder . We know that there are those , who are strangely fond of a perfect system of truth and order , that shall be printed in a book , and who , because a system is thus printed , will receive it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm to such minds in dead machinery . They delight to imagine it in easy and beauteous motion . If it does not so move in fact , it ought to , and they trust that by and by , it actually will . If there is friction in the wheels , and every wheel brings so much added friction , there is no friction in the idea of the perfect church . If to avoid friction the machinery is kept still , or but barely moves , they have only to imagine how well it is fitted to move , and it rejoices their hearts to think of their most excellent church . Others there are , who wish a system most exact and rigid , that by ecclesiastical rules they may accomplish purposes which they can not compass by logic or piety-. and by the spell of adherence to rules , may supply that magic power to the wand which was once so potent in clerical hands . Hine illa* lacryma ? . If it be so , then we have good reason , instead of desiring regulations more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have none at all . " But our system allows the validity of lay-ordination in cases of possible exigency . " So does Rich* ard Hooker  --  the often quoted de // fender of the Elizabethan or English church  --  and so does every other man , who is not ready to swallow any absurd conclusion from the divine right of the ministry . " But it holds the doctrine , that it is the church which constitutes a man its pastor by its electing voice . " And what republican is there who should object to this doctrine ? Nay , what American is there who owes to this doctrine first asserted for the church , all the blessings which it gives his country , now that it is adopted in , the state , should not blush for his ignorance and ingratitude ? Well is it , that it holds these principles . They are its glory , because they are justand if they had been earlier asserted , they might have proved health and salvation to the dying church . To hold the opposite , is to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the body of the faithful , when the church has become corrupt , no hope of deliverance , except from the source whence hope has forever fled . It is to fasten upon the diseased body , which , if left to itself , might gather the struggling energies of returning life , a carcass of death , and thus to poison and stifle its remaining vitality . He however who , from this admitted principle , infers that , as a matter of fact , our churches do not consult and respect their ministry , and give them all reasonable influence and control , argues from the theory of our system , but not from its actual workings . He argues just as all monarchical Europe does , from what they suppose must be the case in respect to democratic America . To convict him of a false conclusion , the very rocks of New England are ready to cry out . " But we destroy the unity of the church , by giving a separate and independent life to the local body . " Nay , we uphold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral and spiritual unity , not an ecclesias tical and political commonwealth . By this very principle do we secure the church , as far as it may be in this world of ours , against the divisions and strifes that are incident to all societies of imperfect men . " But it is a matter of complaint among laymen , that we have no ecclesiastical system ; and there are some , who , because we have no book of standards , do not attach themselves to our societies , but unite with the church of the prayerbook . " This may be so  --  but we doubt whether this is the true reason , for there are many other reasons than this why a man in New England may prefer the church of Queen Bess to that of John Robinson . We can see however , that this may be possible with men , whose dissatisfaction on this ground , is fostered by the influence and example of their spiritual guides . But we can not easily see how a New England man , taught by a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would know better , or if he did not , he might easily be taught , that such securities for faith and order are of little worth , and that the evil which they occasion , is too certain to be incurred for the doubtful advnntage which they bring . It would seem that the simplicity of our system , its freedom from forms , its easiness of working , and its demand on the living energies of each individual member of the church , might be made , not merely its sufficient apology , but its triumphant vindication . it is easy to see on the other hand , how it may and must happen , that when the minister is continually complaining of the looseness of his church , and is calling for a book of standards , and is manifestly deficient in sympathy with its great and peculiar principles , the members of the church may conclude , that they are in a rickety and falling establishment , and may look about // for the protection of one that is more firmly built . We complain then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without just occasion , as untrue to the first principles of our polity , and forgetful of all the lessons which history inculcates . We complain of it , as most injurious in its consequences-as certain to be the cause of the dissatisfaction which is said to exist . It can not but happen , that what the teacher distrusts , the disciple will disown and deny . The strength of our system is a moral strength . It consists in the confidence of living men in each other , and in the system under which they live . The good sense of thinking men , the experience of the past , the voice of all history , testify in its favor . Where are the men who neglect these advantages , and fail to rally around the remembrances of the past , and the usefulness of the present , the best sympathies of their hearers ? Why do they not breathe into their hearers the true New England spirit ? Why do not they show the evils that lurk in every other church , and war against its spiritual simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distrust , because we regard it as without just causeas ungrateful for the best system of church government with which the world has ever been blest , as unmindful of the corruption with which power has ever cursed the church , as untrue to the high trust which God has placed in our hands for the generation which is to come after us , and as suicidal to our present life and hope . While we are so earnest upon this point , we do not contend , that there are no deficiencies in our churches . We have more than intimated already , that there is a call for improvement , and that such improvement may be attained . It is natural first of all to notice such as concern the ministry . The office of a religious teacher is recognized in the New Testament as essential to the perfection and prosperity of the church , and his qualifications are described with admirable fidelity and truth . He is a man well instructed in the truths which he is to teach , with skill to adapt them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this end . He is also a gentleman , intelligent , courteous and open-hearted , who scorns duplicity and self-seeking , both in handling the word of God and in his intercourse with his fellow-men . But he is not a priest . He is in no sense a mediator between God and man . He consecrates not the baptismal water , which introduces the infant to the church . He makes not the bread of the eucharist , to be the food of the soul , through the virtue that passes from his consecrating hands . He is not studious of the rights which belong to his order in the church . He strains not himself to keep his order or himself in his place , by a forced antagonism against the fancied inroads of his flock . Whatever improvements are proposed by or for the ministry , should be based upon the apostolic model . They should be made in the direction of the Bible and of common sense , and not in that of the church , after the traditions of men . Now it has happened of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded various regions of Pro . testant Christendom . As was to be expected , its attacks have been most violent where the predisposing causes were the strongest ; but it has not been entirely unfelt even in the healthful atmosphere of New England . Our Episcopal brethren are greatly amazed or encouraged , we hardly know which , at the appearance of some symptoms of church feeling in so unexpected a quarter . The ministry , it is argued , must // strengthen their position in these democratic days . They must take to themselves more distinctly the sanction of a right divine . They must maintain a sense of this sanction by a distant and imposing air , perhaps by a clerical habit-at all events , by attaching to their decisions a more solemn importance , as pronounced by the organs through whom God declares his will to man . Their presence in a meeting of laymen , is to be a matter of high consideration ; and they are never to forget-certainly they are never to suffer their people to forget-their dignity as a distinct and holy order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves their appropriate place , they will not only secure their lawful influence , but will throw around their office and themselves , a mysterious charm , and awful fascination . To feel thus towards a religious teacher , it is argued , is necessary and agreeable to man . This we think to be a mistake . Clerical pretension does not of itself strike men agreeably . It may be admitted by the ignorant . It may be enforced by the compulsion of law . But it asserts its surest and most potent charm , when it bribes the conscience by a false peace , or indulges sinful desire with an easy atonement . The New England people are not so ignorant , as to be imposed on by clerical grimace . They do not endure a priesthood by law . We desire not , and certainly should not dare to bribe them by softening the truth of God , or indulging their desires after a lax religion . In the Romish church , the priest is a very great man , and the people love to have him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he will give absolution for a few pence , and for the same sum , whisper in the ear of the dying , Depart , Christian soul-so long it is not only very easy , but very delightful , to believe that he can open and shut the doors of heaven . The homage to the priest is but a transformed idolatry of the man 's own lusts-his attachment to the church , a love of a church that gives a religious license to sin . Let the priest preach a clean heart and justification by faith alone , and his reverence and occupation would both be gone . Or if the conscience owned the truth of the gospel , it would disown the lie of the priest . The readiness with which the Episcopalian gains the ear of some people , and makes such excellent churchmen of the gay and thoughtless , is easily and truly explained , when the argument is known to be , not a musty and learned discourse of the Fathers , but the pithy maxim , that " Episcopacy is the only religion fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles II . It is not remembered that he uttered any other religious saying , except this , that " God would not damn a man for a little pleasure . " But for a Congregational minister to set up high church pretensions , is certain to raise the cry of priestcraft . It will not go down , unless he takes off the edge of his pretensions by a little extra gentility , or an easy way in the application of his sermon . That tendencies exist towards disorder and disorganization , we do not deny . We admit that in some portions of New England , the pastoral office does not receive its just consideration . We also admit , that often there is an unreasonable demand for ministerial labor , and an excessive fondness for excitement . The minister is sometimes blamed for want of success , where the fault is not with himself . We know also , that moral and political agitations , have here and there engendered a fanaticism which is somewhat hard to be reasoned with . All this we admit . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is to be done with them ? We an- // 575 swer , the people can be made to see that these are evils , and great evils . They can by logic , patience , and love , be made to see , that the pastor must receive a certain deference and respect , in order to the highest success , and perhaps as a condition of any success in his ministry-that excitement is not religion , while yet religion can not but enkindle zeal-that narrow and divisive tests in the church , are at war with the fundamental principle of a Christian society , which must tolerate and forbear with minor differences of feeling and of judgment . This must be done in love , not in wrath , in patient meekness , not with irritated contempt , by one in earnest sympathy with the popular mind , not by a man who loftily despises the people and their works . The work may be difficult , but it can be done . If it can not be done for the sake of one 's office , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man must go to it , with the same sturdy and determined enthusiasm , with which Richard Baxter went into Cromwell 's army and argued with the fanatic soldiers , and plainly , but patiently , talked them down . In such a course , a minister may expect to do much goon , and as a consequence , strengthen himself and his order . If he pursue the opposite course , he may indeed enwrap himself with the dignity of an imposing state , and make his people stare at his mysterious pretensions , and he may enjoy the ideal comfort of contending for a principle ; but he will cut himself off from the substantial comfort of enjoying their warmest yet respectful sympathy , and of turning that sympathy to the highest and holiest uses . Perhaps he may gather about his ears , a very hail-storm of domestic wrath , and have nothing left but the privilege of sighing for the good old times . We desire therefore that the ministry of New England , should have faith in the people , and instead of complaining , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoice in the many advantages which the popular system ensures . Let none of them sigh after the efficiency of a session or a presbytery , that they may execute sooner , their own wise measures . Nor let them indulge a pusillanimous longing for the grateful quiet which is said to be diffused from the Episcopal throne ; but let them set themselves with the utmost diligence , to make the fullest proof of the superior excellence of our own primitive and apostolic way . This leads us to remark , that , although our system is the most popular in its principles , it has often failed in a measure , of developing all its capabilities in this respect , and has not entrenched itself as it might , within the popular sympathies . The temptations to be careless in respect to this result , are not inconsiderable . Ours are the original churches of New England , and seem to hold the soil by right of prior occupation . We hold the sympathies of the most intelligent and wealthy of the people . Our system was transmitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not surprising that we put excessive confidence in these advantages . We may trust too much to the impulse which has been given us in the past , and think it will of itself carry us forward , in spite of the open assaults of avowed enemies , and of the insinuating arts of proselyting dissenters . Our ministers , too , are scholars and students . They are metaphysicians of course . Such men are sometimes satisfied , if they see the truth themselves , without sufficiently inquiring whether they lead others to see it . They are as familiar with the abstractions of systematic theology as with household words , and may suppose that to others such abstractions are as full of interest and // of ' meaning as to them . They delight in the smooth and easy calmness of ' philosophical disquisition , and forget that their hearers require the energy of popular argumentatibn . They are pleased and convinced by a clear and lucid essay , and do not remember that the hearts of their bearers are waiting to bound at the stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine has its peculiar truths . Rightly preached , they are eminently " the power of God unto salvation . " They may be so preached , that those who hear , both the learned and the unlettered , if they understand them as presented , can not but pervert them to their own destruction . They may be presented as if the object were not to commend the gospel to the conscience , but to offend the conscience by dogmas abhorrent to its primal instincts . There are weak and ignorant and excitable men in all our churches . Parties sometimes arise , and wax fierce and violent . It is not uncommon for the stronger faction to sacrifice to its obstinate self-will , the interest of the church , by driving off an excited minority , whom a little forbearance and concession might have saved . In such a strife , the church and society acquires an inberitance of odium , which a generation can not outlive . These things have been done at the instance of a minister , who knew the right so well , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England in which the clergy are enterprising , harmonious , and devoted to their work . As pastors and preachers , they labor with considerate energy and a just apl ) reciation of the wants of their people . They are true Congregationalists , and rejoice in all the popular features of their system . Thus , while they sympathize with the people , they can reprove them with plainness and ef ' . feet . They are in the midst of difficulties and excitements and proselyting efforts ; but their churches prosper , and acquire a more preponderating influence . If there are parts of New England where this is not true of the Congregational interest , it is but fair to ask , whether the ministry are enterprising ,  --  laboring with discretion and heart and hope , and bringing out , truly and fairly , the power of the gospel and of our popular system . If there is any one duty to which the New England clergy are summoned by the exigency of the times , that duty is , to study to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy vanity of the multitude , or excite their sectarian or malignant feelings , but we do contend that they should aim to secure for their preaching , themselves , and their own system of church order , the honest and hearty sympathy of the public . They should know no arts but manly arts . Yet they may and should make their ministry to be a ministration of the gospel to the wants of living men as they find them , and cause it to speak to their consciences , their social sympathies , and their republican feelings . The gospel should be presented just as it lies in the pages of the Bible , not as a system of lifeless abstractions , nor as a bristling phalanx of metaphysical dogmas , but as real and living truth . The aim of the preacher should be , so to present the gospel , that it shall be understood ,  --  so to present it , that it can not but be understood . He should press it on the intellect with the force of resistless demonstration . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminates an evening cloud . His intense and earnest desire should be , so to speak as to affect his hearers , and he should not be satisfied in any way until this object is secured . His pastoral ministrations should not be doled out with a reluctant hand ; still less should they // be robbed of their freshness and their zest , by peevish complaints of the excessive demands of his flock ; but they should come warm from the heart of a sympathizing monitor and friend . To be a preacher and a pastor , should put in requisition all that he is as a scholar and a man . He should also be much of a man among his fellow-men . He should interest himself in all the questions , political , moral and social , which are now uppermost . In all that concerns the true interests of society , he should be himself a wakeful and thinking man , whose opinions smell not of the damp and stifling air of the cloister , but have been matured in the cheerful sunlight of the open atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious teacher , and a minister of Christ . Before such a man there can not stand up the modern pretender to an exclusive priesthood by virtue of the apostolic succession . Let the pretender reason and dog . matize as he will , he can not persuade the people that such a pastor as we have described is not a lawful minister of Christ , or that he has no right to preach the gospel . Into the daylight that radiates from such a pastor , it will be hopeless to bring out the mysteries of Puseyitish charlatanry , or the quackeries of regeneration by the Episcopal water , and of sanctification by the Episcopal eucharist . Nor will the insinuating arts of the busiest sectarian , nor the disorganizing doctrines of the roving infidel in disguise , succeed beneath the eye of his wise vigilance . We venture to suggest , whether there is not required in our congregations a more considerate attention to the order and details of public worship . Is not our public worship capable of being raised to a higher degree of interest and solemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our assemblies , the sermon is made of too much account , in proportion to the other parts of the pub Vol . I. 73 lic service . Those who make this charge , forget that preaching is the great ordinance of Christianity , and that it bath pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe . Yet it may well be inquired , whether the demand which is made on our ministers for able and well-wrought discourses , and the manifest reasonableness of this demand , has not led them to give less attention than is due to the other parts of their office in the sanctuary . We have been truly taught  --  and the lesson is worth more than the most venerable liturgy can be ,  --  that the form and manner of worship are of little consequence compared with the spirit of the worshiper . But we may be in danger of forgetting that the full and fit expression of devotional thoughts and feelings , especially in public worship , is necessary not only to the highest decorum , but also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expression of any feeling reacts upon the feeling expressed . It deserves to be considered , whether improvements are not required in this respect , and whether the attention of the clergy may not be directed to this subject with manifest advantage . The considerations of propriety , of good taste , and of pious feeling , all demand it , as well as the interests of our churches as a body . We do not admire a liturgy . Least of all do we like the liturgy of the Episcopal church , for the practical uses of a Christian assembly . To us it is picturesque rather than devotional ,  --  suited rather to impress the imagination than to express the worship of the spirit . This effect would be heightened , to our minds , if it were still in the original Latin , and yet more if it were performed in some structure of the middle ages , and with the music of the Sistine chapel . We do not ask for such a liturgy , or for any other . But we would propose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // effort , the improvement of the manner and forms of public worship . While spiritual worship should be the great thing thought of , it should take its most graceful and appropriate external forms , and wear them with ease and dignity . To this end , we do not require any change in our system , but only more richness , comprehensiveness and variety in public prayers , and the training of our congregations to the observance of any proprieties which they may have slighted . Much depends upon the manner of the pastor in conducting the services of the house of God . Religious affectation we abhor . But there is demeanor in the pulpit which not only accords with , but is demanded by the sacredness of the place . To be so much at ease in it as to be above its solemnities , or to affect an air of nonchalance , deserves banishment from its enclosure by an outraged community . To add to the interest of our devotional services , some have proposed the reading of the Scriptures it ' . alternate verses by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We greatly prefer the spirited reading of appropriate selections by the pastor . It seems far better suited to the object for which the Scriptures are publicly read , and is better adapted to secure the attention of the people . It has also been proposed , and the attempt has been made , to introduce into our churches a kind of chanting , not borrowed , we believe , from Popish or Episcopal churches , but simpler and more suited to the nature and character of evangelical worship . To this we make no objection . Indeed this is the way in which the Psalms , as given by Divine inspiration , were originally sung in the temple . The Psalms in the Hebrew , as David and Asaph composed them , are not metrical ; and it has seemed to us that those Divine songs are more appropriate to he sung in an exact translation accord . ing to the original structure of the parallelisms , than they can be in any metrical version . Let Christian hymns be added , and metrical versions of the Psalms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ancient songs in the style and form in which they were first uttered from hearts inspired of God . But the antiphonal way of chanting or reciting from the choir and the pulpit , we would let alone . It is not appropriate with us . It has no meaning . It is a theatrical exhibition for mere impression , and not a natural expression of the devotions of the congregation . It was against all that sort of church music , that the reformers protested and contended . Every such incongruous practice may attract by its novelty for a time , but , as it is not in keeping with the general style of our service , had better be let alone . It deserves also to be asked , whether , a stronger social feeling may not be cultivated in our societies , and an intenser warmth of kindly feeling called into life . Our New England manners are proverbially cold . Many of our religious societies , from being the oldest and in most cases the strongest , are far from being enterprising , especially when compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age also , they sometimes have an accumulated inheritance of old prejudices , that result from divisions of wealth and family , as well as from ecclesiastical and political strife . There is also sometimes a bigoted prejudice against every thing which is not in the good old way . From these circumstances , advantage is taken against us , to detach individuals and families , whom a little attention might have retained . But this need not be so . We can do to retain such persons , what others do to detach them from us , as far as it is right or desirable that we should ; and thus we may not only increase the strength of our com // munion , but these efforts may be the means of increased religious life . There is no way in which the pastor or his church can provide more effectually for kindly and saving impressions , than by laying hold of the sympathies of all . In no way can the young be kept back from folly and sin , so effectually as by a cheerful air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious community . If the members of our churches would lay themselves out thus to do good , many prejudices against religion would be avoided , their own piety would be kept from an austere and denunciatory spirit , and numberless avenues of good might be opened by a gentle hand . We desire not that their admonitions should be less frequent , or the steady assertion of the necessity of repentance and faith less pressing ; but we do desire that the irreligious and even the erring portion of the community , should not be repelled and held off at a studied distance . This human nature of ours was given by God , that through its sympathies and affections , the soul might be saved . Would that we all knew it better . Direct and frequent efforts may be made to excite and strengthen these bonds of interest . The pastor may see his people often in social gatherings , or meet them in circles at each other 's houses , in which all classes shall freely meet and be welcome . Above all , may our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freer atmosphere may pervade them . The subjects introduced may be more various . All the services may have more freedom and freshness , less constraint and less formalism . In this , as in every good work , the pastor must take the lead  --  and an enterprising pastor will accomplish much . We deem it of great importance to the prosperity of our churches in every point of view , that the particular church be not displaced from ks true foundation , and from the legitimate ground of the union among its members , by any attempt to bring its influence to bear directly and formally upon public opinion , and the decision of matters in discussion among Christians . In this way , narrow and divisive tests are introduced , the appropriate work of the ministry and the church is thrust aside , and the good sense of the community is offended , by seeing the church forget its high vocation . Let Christians do what seems to them wise and good in voluntary societies , and at the ballot box , to remove all social evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ would receive . Let it be forever settled , that Christ receives all who are sound in the faith and prayerful in heart , and unspotted by offenses against the recognized laws of morality . Within the sacred enclosures of the church , we meet as fellow Christians . here let every difference be forgottendifferences of opinion in respect even to what are appropriate Christian duties . Let us forbear with each other , and pray for each other , and remember , that a Christian and kindly tolerance of one whom we think greatly in the wrong , is among the last attainments of a soul that is ripening for heaven . Any other course than this , is sure to excite well-grounded prejudice in the community , and to repel from our enclosures those who have sense enough to know what the church was designed to be.
