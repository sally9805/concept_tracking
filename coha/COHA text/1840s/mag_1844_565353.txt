txt " PRAY , sir , did you come here in a hat or a turban ? " was the grave inquiry of Charles Lamb , addressed to a young man , who had annoyed him and his guests of an evening by some rather free and impertinent remarks on religion . We in our simplicity might think that the same question would not be inappropriate to Theodore Parker , although he styles himself " minister of the second church in Roxhury , " and we have never heard that the church in question professed to he other than a Christian church . The name of Mr. Parker we can hardly suppose to be unknown to any of our readers . Most of them , we presume , are more or less acquainted with the opinions of which he is at once the representative and champion . He is known to many as the author of a sermon preached at South Boston , May 19 , 1841 , entitled " A Discourse on the Transient and Permanent in Christianity , " which attracted much attention at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston newspapers . The views advanced in the sermon were given more fully to the public during the winter following , in a series of lectures delivered in Boston , and , as we are informed , to a large , intelligent , and highly interested audience . These lectures are embodied in the volume of which the title is given below . The reason why his volume and the opinions which it advances have not been made more extensively the subject of criticism , may be the strangeness of these opinions . To a common man , even if intelligent or learned , they seem more like the * A Discourse of Matters pertaining to Religion . By Theodore Parker , Minister of the Second Church in Roxhury , Mass . Boston : Charles C. Little &amp; James Brown . 1842. // dogmas of a French or Hindoo de1st , or mayhap the more refined religionism of a Persian Soofee , than the Christian theology of a Christian teacher  --  and such a reader is likely to dismiss them with the mingled emotion of pity and amazement with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of monomania . These opinions are not strange , however , in the sense of being uncommon . We think that we can readily show , that there are sufficient reasons , why they should receive a grave and considerate attention in our journal . We shall not stop to give these reasons , but shall enter at once upon our work , which we trust will justily itself to our readers . The volume is entitled " A Discourse of Matters pertaining to Religion . " The design of it , as we are told in the preface , is " to recall men from the transient shows of time to the permanent substance of religion ; from a worship of creeds and empty belief , to a worship in spirit and in life . " It consists of an introduction and five books , each of which treats of a distinct head under the following titles . 1 . Of Religion in general , or a discourse of the Religious Sentiment and its manifestations. 2 . The Relation of the Religious Sentiment to God , or a discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sentiment to Jesus of Nazareth , or a discourse of Christianity . 4 . The Relation of the Religious Sentiment to the great . est of books , or a discourse of the Bible . 5 . The Relation of the Religious Sentiment to the greatest of human institutions , or a discourse of the Church . The Five Points of this Parkerian system , which by courtesy , and under protest , we must call Christian ,  - -  inasmuch as its author wears a hat rather than a turhan ,  --  are as follows . 1 . Man is by nature a religious being . The religious sentiment is as natural to him as the sense of sight or of hearing . By it he can not but communicate with the spiritual world , as by these with the natural . This sentiment as perverted or more or less mingled with baser elements , has given birth to all the historical religions , Christianity among the rest . Its legitimate and purified product is absolute religion , which is love to man , and love to God . 2 . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , who give room and play to the religious sentiment . Just in proportion to its influence do they hold clear views of truth , and exercise warm and pure religious feeling . Other things being equal , one man is more inspired than another , as is the quantity of his being and the quantity of his obedience . The inspired needs no miracles , nor the testimony of man or angel or God , to prove his inspiration . He carries the voucher in his own breast to himself , and he calls up the same in the breast of his neighbor. 3 . Of Christianity . Jesus of Nazareth differs from other men , only in this , that in the sense already described he was a man of the most religious sentiment , or a little the most of an inspired man whom the world has ever seen . His life in the main , was consistent , beautiful and holy . His precepts were wise and good , though the substance of them had been uttered before , yet never in a form so free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practical uses . As a teacher and model of absolute religion , he is unrivalled . The story of Jesus however , as we find it in the New Testament , is incredible and absurd . It is a mixture of the legendary , the mythical and the true ,  --  a confused record of the various verbal reports of what he was and did , that naturally arose out of the admiration and love which he rightfully awakened , // 373 and were engrafted also on the fanatical expectation of a Messiah so current among the Jews of that time . 4 . The Bible is the greatest of books , as it has in it more of absolute religion than any other book . But the common notion of it as divine , miraculous or infallible , is false and foolish . A portion of it is inspired in the sense already defined , but in different degrees . Other portions , intermingled with these , are absurd , legendary , and incredible . 5 . The true idea of the church is Christ , the model man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions , and observing his life . That which is called the church , has answered important purposes , but if the question were to be raised , which is the greater , the good or the evil which it has done , it would be difficult to answer . The true church is yet to arise . We have given to our renders , this condensed summary of the contents of the volume , in order to furnish them with a bird's-eye view of the entire system of its author , so that they may understand the relation of each single principle to the whole of the well compacted scheme . We are well aware that were this to be their first or only view of it , they would say at once , " It is only a naked and vulgar Deism . Better leave it to itself , to rot by its own fermenting , than scatter the poison and prolong its life . " Not such would be their conclusion were they to see it in the volume itself , as it there appears not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grace with which it puts on the mien and gathers about itself the robes of an angel of light . Here will they find the gravest objections against historical Christianity and the Bible , which the honest or dishonest infidel has ever started , put forth in their gravest form ; much truth , which theologians have denied or despised , stated with eloquence and power ; and error , which too many have prudently feared to face , no longer on the defense , but storming their citadel , and flushed with all the ardor of expected success . They will find here philosophy propounding her hardest problems , and essaying to solve them not by the cold analysis of the sensual school , with its meagre results of death , but in the glowing and life-like methods of the spiritual , with its elevating conclusions . Here also is learning , of which the great fault is that it has read too much , and been overborne by that authority which it professes to brave . The style too is clear , so clear that it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud that piles itself at noonday . It is pointed and vigorous , and rises to heights of no mean eloquence . We have no desire to flatter Mr. P. , certainly we do not fear him . We think that it is neither in fear or flattery that we say , that his volume is not a book to he despised . It is true , it is nothing more or less than Deism , and no man would more readily own it than its author . He is too well acquainted with the history of words and of opinions not to know , and too freespoken not to confess , that according to his principles Deism is quite as good a name as Christianity in the vulgar acceptation of the term . But if the book is Deism , it is not the naked and low Deism of the French and English school . It would scorn to own an affinity with the sensual and low-lived railings of the pot-house , however readily the affinity might be claimed on that side . The imputation of such a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an interest so entranced to the eloquence of the author . Nor would it be acknowledged by not a few who bend over its pages , as bound by the spell of an enchanter . We know not how readily this volume was sold . We do not care to ask whether there are more or // 374 Theodore Parker . fewer who go to the length of our author in his conclusions . But we do know that these opinions are the infidelity of the age ; that in substance or in form , secretly or openly , they are the creed of , we will not conjecture how many , among those who promise to become the gifted men of the day . We also know that its leaven pervades much of what may be called the better part of our literature , and if we do not greatly err , is not unfelt or unseen in the church-even in that which calls itself orthodox We think therefore that it requires attention , quite as much as those inflated specimens of quackery which appear too often under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , as an antagonist it is far more desirable and respectable than the system which indites these things- it has an air of wholeheartedness and radicalism which we like . Though not without a cant and pretension peculiar to itself , it has none of the monkish sanctimony and whine- It goes upon the principle of settling questions by argument and not by authority . It acknowledges some wisdom in the present , and does not oblige us to open all the musty cloisters of the past . If we must deal with either , we certainly prefer Protestantism run mad to Oxfordism in the same calamity . We do not propose to give a full or critical analysis of this volume of five hundred pages . To consider all its arguments , to review all its statements of fact , to rebut its conclusions , as well as to follow its learned references , and recriticise its criticisms upon all the systems of religion and philosophy which the world has ever seen , would require a volume as large as Mr. Parker 's . We shall attempt only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , " of religion in general , " is designed to give us the leading principles of the author 's entire system of religious philosophy . It is what it purports to be , a discourse of the religious sentimeat and its manifestations , " or in other words , an examination of that part of man 's nature which makes him capable of religion , and a critique of the forms of true and false religion , which it has in fact assumed . In this discussion , the aims of the author are distinctly made known , and his conclusions are clearly nnticipated . We are soon informed that the religious element is almighty and independent ; that it is seen in every form of religion , while it has been poorly represented by the best ; and that man 's only and his sufficient resource is , to fall back on his own nature and let it lead him on to the noble issues of absolute religion . Of course , we expect that this religious sentiment shall be accurately defined , that its nature shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all revealed religions , as supreme and above them all , shall be most triumphantly demonstrated . For such a definition we look through its one hundred and fifty pages , and we look in vain . We are led on from chapter to chapter , and we find it not . In the first we find the proposition that there is in man the religious element , briefly argued and in the main argued eloquently and well . laying shown that there is in man a sentiment which connects him with God , our author in the second chapter seeks to show how with that sentiment is given the idea of a God , which is always true , and from it is developed the conception of God which is always imperfect , and therefore false . rJ7his distinction he considers most important . The critical reader will see in it the whole doctrine in a nut-shell . If it is so , that whenever man thinks about God in the way of conception , reasoning , or discourse to himself or // 375 another , he is and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , that every revealed religion is and must be imperfect , and xvorthlcss too , except as it enables man to fall back upon the idea within his own soul . But more of this anon . Next Mr. P. discourses of the extent and power of this sentiment . He shows that it is universal , indestructible , and the strongest and deepest element in human nature . In all this there is much truth and eloquence . In the fourth chapter , he discourses of the idea of religion as connected with science and life . In the fifth , he sets before us the three great historical forms of religion , which are , Fetichism , Polytheism , and Monotheism . Here we find much ingenuity , and more power of description , and still more fanciful philosophizing . He concludes this chapter as follows , pp. 110 , 111 : " In passing judgment on these different religious states , we are never to forget that there is no monopoly of religion by any nation or any age . Religion itself is one and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worships the only God . He hears the prayer , whether called Brahma , Jehovah , Pan , or Lord ; or called by no name at all . Each people has its prophets and its saints ; and many a swarthy Indian , who bows down to wood and stone ; many a grim-faced Calmuck , who worshiped the great God of Storms ; many a Grecian peasant , who did homage to Pho*bus Apollo , when the sun rose or went down ; yes , many asavage , his hands smeared all over with human sacrifice , shall come from the east and the west and sit down in the kingdom of God , with Moses and Zoroaster , with Socrates and Jesus-while men , who called daily on the only living God , who paid their tribute and bowed at the name of Christ , shall be cast out , because they did no more . Men are to be judged by what is given , not what is withheld . ' In chapter sixth , he discourses of " certain doctrines connected with religion ,  --  I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immortality of the soul , "  --  and here he argues in the same strain as in the previous chapter . In chapter seventh , he speaks of the influence of the religious sentiment on life , under the heads of Superstition , Fanaticism , and Solid Piety . From this we make the following extract , that our readers may see the mixture of falsehood and truth , of weakness and strength , with which the volume is filled : " But why go back to Patriarchs , at Aulis or Moriali ; do we not live in New England and the nineteenth century ? Have the footstcps of superstition been effaced from our land ? Our books of theology are full thereof ; our churches and houses not empty of it . When a man fears God more than he loves him , when he will forsake reason , conscience , love , the still small voice of God in the heart , for any of the legion voices of authority , tradition , expediency , which come of ignorance , selfishness , and sin ; whenever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at church , or an austere observance of Sabbath and fast days , a compliance with forms ; when he hopes by professing with his tongue ihe doctrine he can not believe in his heart to atone for wicked aciions , wrong thoughts , unholy feelings , a six days ' life of meanness , deception , rottenness and sin , then is he superstitious . If he were superstitious who in days of ignorance , but made his son 's body to pass through the fire to his God , what shall be said of them in an age of light , who systematically degrade the fairest gifts of man , God 's dearest benefaction-who make life darkness , death despair , the world a desert , man a worm , nothing but a worm , and God an ugly fiend , who made the mass of men for utter wretchedness , death and eternal hell ! " " But the milder forms of fanaticism we can not escape . They meet us in the theological war of extermination in which sect now wars with sect , pulpit with pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of superstition in its milder form , let him open a popular commentary on the Bible , or read much of that weakish matter which circulates in what men call as if in mockery , good pious books . If he would find fanaticism in its modern and more pharisaic shape , let him open the religious ' newspapers , or read theological polemics . The conclusion of Solid Piety would doubtless surprise those of our readers who have judged of the author by report , or by the summary which we have given of his creed . Were it a translation from some ancient stoic , or new Platonist , // we should call it one of the finest specimens of their somewhat exaggerated but still glowing eloquence . We give the following : " Now in some men , religion is a continual growth . They are always in harmony with God . Silently and unconscious , erect as a palm tree , they grow UP to the measure of a man . To them , reason and religion are of the same birth . They are born saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their fact of life , there has been at no time a gulf . But others join themselves to the armada of sin and get scarred all over with wounds as they do thankless battle in that leprous host . Before these men become religious there must be a change , - well defined , deeply marked ,  --  a change that will be remembered . The saints who have been sinners , tell us of the struggle and desperate battle that goes on between the flesh and the spirit . It is as if the devil and the archangel contended . XVeII says John Bunyan , the devil fought with me weeks long and I with the devil . ' To take the leap of Niagara and stop when half way down , and by the proper motion reascend , is no slight thing , nor the remembrance thereof like to pass away . This passage from sin to salvation , this second birth of the soul , as both Christians and heathens call it , is one of the many mysteries of man . With bleeding feet the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of life and wonders at the tortuous track he left behind . " But the religious element , what is it ? says the reader to his friend the critic . You have not yet told us what he means by this potent and all absorbing thing . Have patience , gentle reader , that is the very point which we ourselves have been endeavoring to discover . Our author , though be is much of a philosopher , and thinks to move the heavens and earth thereby , is one of such a species that he defines by describing , and piles on a metaphor where he should draw a line in analysis , or at best defines by snatches , and trusts to the tout ensemble , for a just impression of what he would be at . For instance , at three several points he makes the attempt formally to define this essential matter . First , on page 18 : " Looking carefully at this sentiment , separating this as a cause from its actions , and these from their effects , &amp;c. , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this-A 5EN5E or TIEPENDENcE . " And yet he is not very confident that he has reached the hottom , for in a note he says : " Perhaps all will not agree with that analysis which makes a sense of dependence , the ultimate fact in the case . This is the statement of Schleiermacher , not to mention more ancient authorities . ( But you-such a philosopher as you , Mr. Parker , the very hero and apostle of the inward light-you do not go by authority ! ) Of course , a sense of infinite as well as finite dependence is intended . Others may call it a consciousness of the ii*finite ; and contend less for the analysis than for the fact of a religious element in man . " ( So it would seem . ) In our apprehension of the matter , it is a very imperfect account of the religious sentiment , to say that the ultimate fact which analysis discovers , is a sense of dependence . Doubtless it is true that this is one element and an important element , hut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels a sense of dependence that is well nigh absolute , greater perhaps than any one man feels on any other , in any relation but his , and of course more like that which man feels on the infinite Being . But he must have a very godlike master , and he himself must he a very perfect man , to have this sense of dependence result in any thing like religion . That which would make it akin to religion is not the sense of dependence , but the character of the master and the character of the servant . The sense of dependence is not the ultimate fact in the analysis of the religious sentiment , it is only one of the ultimate facts , if we may be allowed to use a phrase so self-contradictory . Nor is it the one of the ultimate facts which constitutes the sentiment religious , or gives to the species its // 377 differentia ,  --  as is clear from our illustration . But as Mr. Parker is not himself very confident of the correctness of his definition , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several pages in the hope that he will propound one with which he will he better satisfied . In the fourth chapter , ( p. 44 , ) we find the following development of his views , which though not a formal definition is designed to answer the end of one by description . " Now the legitimate action of the religious element produces reverence . This may ascend into trust , hope , and love , which is according to its nature ; or descend into doubt , fear , and hate , which is against its nature . It thus rises or falls , as it co-exists in the individual with wisdom and goodness , or with ignorance and vice . Its legitimate action leads straightway and of necessity to reverence , absolute trust and perfect love of God . Thus there can be but one kind of religion , as there can be but one kind of time and space . " We are bold to say , that there are few passages in the English language more incongruous and inconsistent than this . First is the proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This eleinent whatever it may be , whether the scnse of dependence or not , is something , for it has an action of its own and a result that is according to its nature . And yet it is capable of two opposite results , results as opposite as trust is to doubt , hope to fear , love to hate  --  and of these results one is according to , and the other against its nature . How is this ? Because it co-exists in the individual with wisdom and goodness , or with ignorance and vice . One would conclude from this that religion , true religion , is not a simple but a complex result , as it depends on these circumstances-that this thing called the religious element has no legitimate result , but the re sult depends on the company which it keeps-that it is as much according to its nature to fall as to rise , to end in doubt , fear , and hate , when in bad company , as in trust , and hope , and love , when in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called religions , there may be as many kinds as there are bad associates for the religious element . But no , we are not allowed to draw such a conclusion ; for that would blow up the whole framework of absolute religion . On the contrary we are required to draw another conclusion , directly at war with the premises ,  --  " Thus , thus ! there can be but one kind of religion , as there can be but one kind of time and space . " The part which the religious element plays in this result is not altogether unlike the part of the element which gave the name to the stone-broth . The broth had one element the action of which was to give the broth a name , but that it was broth depended on the mutton and vegetables , and spices , that were boiled with the stones . On pages 45-6 , the question arises , how are we to learn what is perfect religion ? To answer the question we must not go to the actual religions , all of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primitive facts of religious consciousness within us . There we find religion is VOLUNTARY OBEDIENCE TO TEE LAW OF GOD , INWARD AND OUTWARD OBEDIENCE to that law he has written on our nature , revealed in various ways through instinct , reason , and conscience , and the religious sentiment . " If no other fault were to be objected against this definition , this would fairly be against it , that it does not draw the line of distinction between religion and morality . The author himself tells us on page 48 , that " a sharp analysis separates between the religious elements in man ; " and he illustrates the point reasonably well . In a perfect delinition , // a distinction so important should have been kept in mind . But waiving this , we allow the definition of absolute or perfect religion to be reasonably just and well stated . It is only unfortunate that it is so true , as to upset the grand first principle of the author 's system . Here we have his definition , " absolute religion is voluntary obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; " and yet absolute religio n may be found in all the so called historical religions . Let the reader refer to what he himself says , as quotedonpage375 , from 110-11 of his volume . Look at the practical workings of absolute religion as defined by himself , under the Polytheism of the Greeks . It is voluntary obedience to the law of God . ' Of which god-of Jupiter or Mars , or Venus or Neptune ? Is it answered , Of none in particular , of any one , of none , of all-no matter ; but the inward and outward obedionce to that law which he has written on our nature  --  to the eternal law of duty impressed on every heart , with no specific reference to any one or many deities . But this is morality , it is not religion ; for religion according to our author 's own showing carries with itself a reference to a Deity . Or if it be obedience to conscience , then conscience will and must reject such monsters of cruelty and lust " as deities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rejection . Or if it is replied that there must be a reference to one God , the God of Nature , the God who appeals to the heart , then again it is Monotheism , the worship of the living and trueThe Fetich worshiper , so far as he has absolute religion , is no longer a Fetich worshiper . The Hindoo no longer worships Brahma , or Vishnu , or Juggernaut . Absolute religion so far from being at peace with the imperfect form of falsehood and sin , fights against and destroys it . The principle of which it is the great object of the volume to show that it may dwell in the same house with all sorts of inmates , no sooner fairly gets possession , than its first act is to turn them all out of doors . Thus by his own definition does Mr. P. destroy his own system . If he will follow it out instead of retaining his fondly cherished and fanciful theories of all religions , he will adopt the words spoken by a good man of old- " Forasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind ; " and of another good man , who says- " They that make them are like unto them , so is every one that trusteth in them . " He will accept these conclusions not as the bigoted ravings of Jewish exclusiveness , but as the calm conclusions of sound philosophy and of unshaken truth . These are specimens of the way in which our author defines and reasons even upon the point which is entirely fundamental to his system ; and yet he would seem to many as not only a clear , but a very clear writer . His words are simple and effectively chosen . His single sentences are often most admirable for their point and force . His illustrations are numerous , and some of them surpassingly fine . But he is not a logician . Conceptions he does not delight in ; for , according to his system , they are of necessity imperfect , and belong to the province of the understanding . We only wish that Socrates could have the handling of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what he does or does not mean , and whether in some cases he means any thing . Though a somewhat vulgar fellow , he would bring such a reasoner to his bearings . Perhaps it might not be without profit , if the examination were held before the audience who thronged his lectureroom , and swallowed what some would call elegant blasphemy in the name of truth and of God . // 379 But can it be , we are asked again , that Mr. Parker does not know what his own opinions are ? Can it be , that a theory which was thought by not a few to blow sky-high all the received notions of Christianity and the Bible , and which has been received with so great favor by so many of the reflecting and educated minds of Boston , should turn out to be so indefinite and shadowy a thing ? Not in the least . Mr. Parker holds opinions which are definite , false , and dangerous . It is by no means difficult to gather these opinions from his writings . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions to which they lead . It is not his fault , but the fault of the opinions , if , determined as he is to hold them , he can not state and define them better . They will not bear analysis . They rejoice in metaphor and pomp of description . If then we leave his definitions and arguments , and gather his conclusions from the general course of his writings , we can not be at a loss to know what he holds concerning the religious element in man . We dwell longer on this topic as it is fundamental . His views upon this point may be viewed psychologically and practically . First , what is his psychological view of this sentiment . This may be gathered from the second chapter , which is entitled " Of the Sentiment , Idea and Conception of God . " The religious sentiment , being a sense of dependence or something of the sort , takes for granted an object on which we depend . If this object does not exist , then nature has provided an instinct to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . Therefore there is a God . But we are not to suppose that we come to this conclusion by inference , and rest upon it as a probable conclusion . This is but the attainment of a low and sensual philosophy . No , the sentiment gives it , and it is itself the idea of God . This idea is we know not what ; but it is the revelation which God makes of himself  --  the manifestation of himself to man , as separate from the subject which beholds it , and yet in the subject . This is the eternal and true idea of God . But when we attempt to conceive of him , i. e. think , talk , or reason of him as a being with attributes , then we form a conception of him which is very different from the idea , and which is therefore imperfect always , and most likely false . In their conceptions of God men always fail , and often err . In their idea of him they can not err . Positive religions always give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the best of them ; and man as he falls back on the idea , knows better than they all can tell him-he is above them all , his own guide and teacher . No religion clothed in conceptions taken from the understanding can satisfy the reason . None can teach it . To all this we have only to say , If it be true that there is this difference between the idea and the conception of the infinite , both being objective , and the idea being the only revelation of truth , then Mr. Parker 's conclusions are true . Man is his own light and his own inspiration . All that is said to him falls short of what he knows already . Lie is above the Bible and the Koran . They can tell him nothing new . He can detect their errors . Here then is the question in a nut-shell . Is there an idea of God and a conception of God , one of which is not the other , and both of which are objective ? We deny that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there can be any thing objective to the mind , which is not a conception , and we call on Mr. P. to prove that there can be . There may be instincts , wants , a sense of dependence , a consciousness of the infinite , or whatever you please to call them in Platonic or Aristotelian // 380 Theodore Parker . phrase , and they may afford ground to believe that nature has provided an object answering to them , and you may rest on the conclusion that there is such an object , and wait with eager longings till the angel of Jehovah , or the voice from the cloud , or a miraculous token , shall satisfy your doubt , or waken the inattention of your fellow men ; but to say that there is an object itself revealing and itself revealed , which scorns the ordinary garb of things knowable , is really too bad . We know well enough that it is very fashionable , and in some quarters very taking , thus to put on lofty airs of spiritualism , and to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more spiritual than Plato , more ideal than Lord Bacon , and more transcendental than Kant . We are not of those who suppose all German philosophy to be mist and nonsense . XVe believe that much of it is capable of being understood , and is also true . But what of it is true is not taught by such writers as these . Such spiritualism as this needs only to be tested by its fruits . On the one hand it leads to a vulgar fanaticism , under the name of the witness of the Spirit and the inward light of the spiritually proud . On the other , it sets man above all forms of worship , all truth revealed to the conscience and by miracles ,  --  installed on the heights of absolute religion , above the warmth of human wants and human prayers , frozen into a would be god by the chill air of his own self-sufficiency . So much for a metaphysical distinction . So-much for the importance of metaphysical studies . If there are to come down from these pretended summits of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us atheism by system and in lectures before schools of divinity , and who shall preach the falsehood of Christianity to educated men and women , and all in the name of a spiritual nature ; then it is time that mental science should be acknowledged of some consequence in forming the principles of those who are to influence their fellows . Let us now turn to Mr. Parker 's practical view of the religious element . Here his chief error is , and it is a great error , that he makes the religious in man a sentiment , and a sentiment only , without showing its a relation to the moral character of the man who feels it , and the moral government of the God whom he worships . Religion , with Mr. Parker , is a thing instinctive and involuntary . As is the feeling of ' delight to the beaut ' *J'ul , as the emotion of awe is to the sublime , such is religion to the divine . The man who feels it may be as remorseless as a pirate , and as sensual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sensual and cruel nature , he may rise to the lofty heights of religious feeling and worship , as the glory of the Eternal shines forth upon him in the splendor of a magnificent moonlight evening , or rushes by in the fury of a tornado . No matter what his god may be , whether one like himself-sensual , crafty , and cruel , or , which answers the same end , a holy God , who is yet indifferent to his character ; if he do but pay him worship , it is still religion , and as all religion is one and the same , we must recognize it in its divine origin . No matter what the worship may be ,  --  it may be the burning of a candle , the pouring out of a liquid , the muttering of a prayer , or the high and rapt contemplations of a proud and intellectual sentimentalist , if it be worship it is religion , and religion is one and the same . If this be religion , man can not avoid being religious . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as vision from the existence of a seeing faculty in man , and that of light out of him . " If this be religion , it is consistent , as Mr. Parker would have us believe , with every species of folly and // falsehood in the form of religious belief , and almost every species of indulgence in sin by which men have dishonored the image of Him who made them . If this he religion , it is easy to see it in the sacrifice cruel and bloody , where man offers up his fellow to his horrid Deity ,  --  easy to see it in the worship of every image , monstrous and vile , which has gone up from man 's degraded and besotted imagination , to be exalted as his God , and to repay him by degrading him to a deep still lower . If this be religion , it is easy to believe " that many a swarthy Indian , who bowed down to wood and stone ; many a grim-faced Calmuck , who worshiped the great God of the storms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apollo when the sun rose and went down ; yes , many a savage , his hands smeared all over with human sacriflce ,  --  shall come from the east and the west , and sit down in the kingdom of God . " But this is not the true idea of religion . The sentiment on which religion is founded is indeed instinctive , and so are all the prime elements of man 's nature ; but that which makes this emotion religion , is the moral character in its great under current one with God , and that God a holy God . Hence true religion or right worship implies and supposes a moral administration enforced by a reigning God . It supposes a man under the dominion of the law of duty-at peace with himself , and in harmony with the will of Him whom he worships . Thus and thus alone do adoration , praise , and prayer , become holy and pure emotions ; so does the religious nature sit as a crown of grace on the whole moral being rightly attempered and subdued ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be no moral perfection , no oneness with the true God , then religious sentiment , or the feeling with which we regard the Divine , becomes the most certain and rapid agent in man 's degradationforasmuch as it gets his gods on the side of his lusts , and makes the indulgence of his most debasing propensities the passport to the favor of the Being on whom his all depends . When religion fills her temples with harlots , and makes worship to be prostitution and debauchery , let her no longer be called divine . If the sentiment of worship is to deserve a decent name , let her keep her gods decently moral . We know very well that Mr. P. will not accept our representation as just . He will claim that he himself has recognized the relation of religion to morality . We admit the fact . But we deny that he has remembered or used it . He has recognized the principle to a certain extent , in statements not wholly correct but not greatly false . He must be a great blunderer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . But the view which he makes the basis of his actual philosophizing and the ground of his conclusions , is the one which we have given . It confounds the religious sentiment with real religion . No distinction can be more important than this , between the instinctive sentiment of religion and that which is indeed religion ,  --  between that homage to truth which the sensibilities and the conscience can not but render , and that love of the truth , which the soul gives that has yielded itself to the authority of truth . And yet no distinction is oftener lost sight of . The sentimentalist may be a wretch , whose practice is unprincipled and base , and yet by the deep sea or on the mountain top , or beneath the still influences of some lonely midnight hour , he thinks of his Creator and is elevated to what he calls worship . The gay young man , or the gayer young lady , who would scorn of all things a life of duty and of prayer , can yet hold high discourse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proud , whose god is his intellect , and whose life instead of being ordered ever as under his great taskmaster 's eye , " is but a splendid career of intellectual ambition ,  --  he too sometimes kindles into lofty aspirations after the ethereal and divine . Surely , ' he says , all men are religious . Let us adore the sentiment , and hold loftier views of man , and with a gentle heart , judge of the various forms by which it shows itself . ' This is the religionism of too much of our literature . It is a sentiment of religion , a reverence for goodness , some lofty views of God , without obedience to such a sentiment , in a life that serves a holy God . It is the religionism of Byron , of Bulwer , of Dickens , of Gothe , which , lofty in sensibility and noble in aspirations , makes the realization of religion in living goodness a vulgar and contemptible matter . This kind of religiousness is seen in the conventicle , when some iron-fisted wretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to propitiate the God whose will he does not care to fulfill . He is an instance of religious sentimentality , though of the vulgar sort . It is seen in the cathedral . Here is a throng of wild Milesians , earnest in their worship , because that worship indulges their vices and opens to them the gate of heaven . With what devotion do they cry , " Hail , Mary , mother of grace . " There is a group of educated Romanists , or a few Puseyites whose hearts have long been here . See how as the organ swells to its loftiest notes , and the choir respond in their majestic melody , and the imposing ceremonial proceeds , the sentiment of worship fixes every countenance and moves every heart . The worship is finished . The crowd disperses . They have discharged to God his due . But as that due does not take hold of their lives and themselves , their religion is but a farce , which would deserve our laughter did it not destroy the soul . It is seen too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer revealed as one who is holy and must be obeyed , but is discoursed of in the words of a fond and sickly sentimentalism ; where the realities of a coming eternity are not proclaimed in words of earnestness and power , but the religious sentiment is gently stirred , Christ is praised , the audience are flattered , and the ceremonial concludes . Now we are upon this point , we must make a clean breast of it , and say all that we think . We charge this sentimentalism upon no class or sect of men . It is found every where , for its elements are deeply grounded in the nature of man . We see it not unfrequently in the spruce rector of some fashionable Episcopal congregation , who reads the liturgy in the way best fitted to excite the religious sensibilities of his fastidious flock , and pronounces a sermon that shall in no wise disturb the conclusion that they are truly devout , if they do but admire the organ and love chanting , and are stiff for the bishop . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gracefully the part of an amateur divine , and astonishes the ladies by the exquisite appropriateness of his devotional services , but who knows nothing of the dignity or the duty of a manly dealing with the consciences of his hearers . But no where do we see it so systematically taught as in the writings of certain leading Unitarian divines . We do not charge it as a necessary consequence of their leading and peculiar articles of belief . We do not excuse or palliate those outrages on common sense , in the form of theology and under the name of Calvinism , which have been made their justification . We simply assert it // as a matter of fact , that as we read the writings of Channing , so justly esteemed for his pure and lofty sentiments-of Green wood , so tasteful and elevated  --  and of Ware , so honest hearted and devotional ,  --  their religion seems to us sentimentalism rather than holiness . It is the product of the feelings refined by culture , rather than of the will consenting to the dominion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which should be cultivated , refined , and matured , rather than as a condition and a token of acceptance with God . It is a matter of taste rather than of duty  --  a thing which pertains to " the absolutely beautiful , the absolutely true , and the absolutely good , " rather than a requisite for the dying hour . It soothes and elevates the feelings , rather than speaks peace to the conscience . It reconciles man to his outward sense of propriety , rather than to the actual favor of the living God . We know that it will occur to many that none make so much of the social virtues , or the kindlier charities of life . We will admit that none exhibit those virtues and charities , better than some who may be found in Unitarian congregations . There must be holiness however , as the grand constituent of character ,  --  love to God as a holy Being , and joy in the law of duty as it reaches to the inmost soul and takes hold of the eternal state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion , with no more morality in it , than a sensation of the nervous system , or the gratification of the palate . We do not enter here into the question , as to what man was made to be , or how deep is his depravity . We believe him godlike . We call him divine . But the higher his capacities , the baser is it to pervert them  --  the more godlike his destination , the more damning is the failure to fulfill it  --  the more divine his best and highest aspirations , the more wretched and guilty and ill-deserving , is it not to obey them . It has become fashionable , of late , for men of a refined taste and cultivation , to pay great respect to the religious sentiment . Philosophers acknowledge its reality , and ascribe magnificent results to its influence on man and society . All this is very well as far as it goes . It shows an advance in the high feeling of literary men . It argues well of the philosophical literature of Christendom . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be denied ; or if Christianity as a spirit is to be received , while its facts and principles are to be represented as mere moonshine , it is not so well . And yet we fear that this is but too faithful a description of many of the writings of the socalled spiritual philosophy , alike recreant to conscience , to the wants of man , and to all the laws of historic interpretation . But to Mr. Parker and his volume . Book second is entitled " the relation of the religious sentiment to God , or a discourse of inspiration . " The inspiration of which Mr. Parker here " discourses , " is not the usual question of fact , whether or not the writers of the Scriptures were in truth inspired above other men . It is the more fundamental and previous question , whether one man can be inspired above another in the supernatural or miraculous sense . If it is decided that they can not be thus inspired , it is easy to see that the subordinate question is disposed of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God should thus impart miraculous inspiration , it follows of course that he has never so inspired particular individuals . The critical reader will see at a glance that Mr. Parker has decided this question already . Indeed , as we have already stated , if his view of the religious element is just , as defined in the distinction between the idea and // the conception of ' spiritual truth , he has carried all his points by the previous question . We ought not to wonder that he seeks to carry this view through the volume , with unfaltering consistency . The argument , as we have already stated , is this . God is revealed to the reason of man , and whatever man can know of God or spiritual truth , with absolute certainty , he knows through the reason . It is natural for him to make a conception of God , as of the finite objects of the senses or the understanding ; but in these we have only our subjective notions , which do not of necessity have an objective reality corresponding thereto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time he enters somewhat deeply into the other matters pertaining to the metaphysics of the Deity . But we may not follow him here , though the inconsistency of his reasoning is greatly tempting . The field being thus opened , the following inquiries are started How does God act in nature ? The answer is , that God is immanent and active in nature ; that he imparts perpetual life to the laws which he has given to created being , and in their life makes himself perpetually manifest . His only way of acting in nature is by sustaining and executing the material laws . This is true of the inorganic , the vegetable , and the animal world . From these we go up to man . In him we find a self-conscious moral and rehgious being . What would analogy lead us to conclude as to the way by which God is present in him . Plainly in the same way , by giving life and execution to the laws which make him what he is . As he acts in nature by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in man , according to the laws of moral and self-conscious being . If we question nature farther , we shall find that every want is suppliedover against every necessity is set its appropriate supply . We should expect it would be so in the special case of man . His animal nature has wants . For these is provided a supply . Not only for every want of the body , but for every disease of the body a supply is furnished . But of what use is the supply unless man can avail himself of it ? Nature meets him here . She not only gives the supply , but she guides man to use it by instinct and understanding . So is it with his intellectual being . So also with his moral and affectional nature . " But the religious element is the deepest , highest , and strongest element in man . Shall this be neglected ? Our analogy teaches us , that in this as in the other case , there must be a supply for the wants , and some plain , regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereby he can get a knowledge of this support , discover this will , and thus by observing the proper conditions obtain the highest spiritual welfare . " Or in other words , every man is inspired if he will be . Then comes the question of fact , Are men in fact inspired ? In support of the affirmative he argues , that men are inspired , is the belief of all nations . This argument , if it proves any thing , proves too much . vrhe general belief is not that men are inspired in the way for which he contends , but supernaturally . Of the manner in which men are inspired , or communicate with God , there are in his classification three theories  --  the Rationalistic or Naturalism , which in philosophy is Sensualism , and in religion is the Unitarianism of Priestly ; the Anti-Rationalistic or Supernaturalism , which has the same philosophy as its basis , but in religion is Orthodoxy as understood among ourselves ; and the Natural-Religious view or Spiritualism , which is Mr. Parker 's own view . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay hold on matter and supply bodily wants , // through which we obtain naturally all needed material thincrs. so we have spiritual faculties to lay hold on God , and supply spiritual wants , through them we obtain all needed spiritual things . As we observe the conditions of the body , we have nature on our side ; as we observe the law of the soul , we have God on our side . He imparts truth to all men who observe these conditions ; we have direct access to Him through reason , conscience , and the religious sentiment , just as we have direct access to nature through the eye , the ear , or the hand . Through these channels and by means of a law , certain , regular , and universal as gravitation , God inspires men , makes revelation of truth ; for is not truth as much a phenomenon of God as motion is of matter ? Therefore if God be omnipotent and omni-active , this inspiration is no miracle , but a regular mode of God 's action on conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a rare condescension on the part of God , but a universal uplifting of man . To obtain a knowledge of duty , man is not sent away outside of himself to ancient documents for the only rule of faith and practice ; the word is very nigh him , even in his heart , and by this word lie is to try all documents whatever . " - p. 216 . Or in other words , if the reason gives to man all the knowledge that he can have , the man has only to open his eye , and he sees and is inspired . Supernatural inspiration is impossible and useless . It is impossible , for there is no work for it to do . It is useless , for all its work is done . But we have remarked at length upon this fundamental argument . There is however in the synopsis given , one argument drawn from the analogy of nature which we must notice . In the universe , we are told , whenever there occurs a want , there is found a supply  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the religious wants of man , there must be a supply which is also not miraculous . This argument , for one from analogy , is sound as far as the cases are similar , though in regard to the abundance of the supply , it is somewhat over stated . But there is one great fact overlooked , and that is altogether material . In respect to man 's religious wants , there is an indisposition on his part to avail himself of the supply . If , in respect to these necessities , man had the same willingness that he feels in regard to the wants of his animal or even his intellectual nature , and the supply were not furnished , then indeed nature would be untrue to herself , and God to his own promises of hope and love . We hold that in such a case there is a supply . We hold as truly and as fully as Mr. Parker , that by the light of nature and their own souls men may know the truth concerning duty and God . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if they do not listen to this voice , there is no other help for them . We hold that men know their duty and do it not ; that they might know more , but they will not . Here then is fact which Mr. Parker does not allude to . Here is a want , for which according to his system there is no supply . Man knows his duty but does it not . He sees the light , but will not follow it into greater light , but suppressing it , he yields himself to falsehood and darkness . He does this willingly ; he does this perversely . What shall be done for him ? Mr. Parker has evaded this whole question . It would seem that he hardly believed it to be a fact . He does indeed speak of man as disobedient , but he gives him as such no place in his argument . We repeat the question , What shall be done for him ? Mr. Parker can not answer . His system forbids him to answer . With lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming to hold higher views of man than the Naturalists with their sensual philosophy , and the Supernaturalists with their inconsistent and fanatical notion of a miraculous intervention , he has no remedy for man 's deepest want , and his grandest necessity . God has done all for man that he can . He dwells in him so fully , and reveals himself so perfectly , that he can do nothing more to help him . He can communicate himself no more ; he can give no new life ; he can awaken no new energy . Thus exalting man so high , and talking greatly of God , while man hears from his conscience and nature the *vail resounding , " Thou hast destroyed thyself , " and looks up to hear the voice of hope from on high , " In me is thy help , " he tells him , In God is no help . In nature for every want there is a supply , but for this want there is no supply . So much for the second book , or the discourse of inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the measure of success which we have traced , proceeds to book third , which is entitled , " the relation of the religious sentiment to Jesus of Nazareth , or a discourse of Christianity . " In this book , we have the application of the principles already expounded , and the more full statement of the results which have been before not dimly announced . In the first chapter the question is stated , and the method of inquiry is indicated . He tells us again , as often before , that the religious element bears the same relation to particular systems of religion that reason does to the various systems of philosophy . When a particular form of religion is discussed , the question to he asked in respect to it is this-Does it teach absolute religion . This is the question in respect to Christianity . To answer this inquiry , we must know two things-what is absolute religion , and what is Christianity ? The or mer is not at all difficult . The latter is the most difficult of all matters . To determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the question which we must ask is , Are these words true ? We need not ask whether he wrought miracles , or lived a good life , for if he did both , it would not prove his words true . If he did no wonders , and was intellectually and morally very imperfect , yet his words , if true , are just as true notwithstanding . In the next chapter , the author comments on the records of these words as reliable sources of information , and concludes that they are inconsistent , contradictory , credulous , and wholly untrustworthy . His argument we shall not follow . In it there are as many assertions as sentences , and , as we think , as many falsehoods as there are assertions . His conclusion in respect to the worth of these writings and the amount of fact which may be gathered from them is as follows : " What has been said is sufficient to show that we must proceed with great caution in accepting the statements of the gospels . The most careless observer sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and words put in his mouth , which are directly at variance with his great principles and the general tone of his character . Still there must have been a foundation of fact for such a superstructure ; a great spirit to have coinmenced such a movement as the Christian ; a great doctrine to have accomplished this , the most profound and wondrous revolution in humun affairs . We must conclude that these writers would describe the great features of his life , and set down the great principles of his doctrine , its most salient points , and his most memorable sayings , such as were poured out in the highest moments of inspiration . If the teacher were true , these sayings would involve all the rest of his doctrine , which any man of simple character , religious heart , and mind free from prejudice , could unfold and develop still farther . The condition aud nature of the Christian records will not allow us to go farther than this and be curious in particulars . Their legendary and mythical character does not warrant full confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine in which the evan // 387 gelists all agree , though they differ in most other points . " - pp. 230-1 . In a note he adds " The character of the record is such , that I see not how any stress can be laid on particular actions attributed to Jesus . That he lived a divine life , suffered a violentdeath , taught and lived a most beautiful religion , this seems the great fact about which a mass of truth and error has been collected . That he should gather disciples , be opposed by the priests and Pharisees , have controversies with them , this lay in the nature of things . His loftiest sayings seem to me the most like . ly to be genuine . The great stress laid on the person of Jesus by his followers , shows what the person must have been . They put the person before the thing , the fact above the idea . But it is not about vulgar men that such mythical stories are told . " As the considerations which ead to this conclusion are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refutation . In the third chapter , he inquires what are the main features of Christianity , and we are told that they are love to man and love to God . It is indeed admitted that Christ might have taught something about baptism and the Lord 's Supper , though it is somewhat doubtful . " Did he lay any stress on the watery dispensation ? count it valuable of itself ? Then we must drop a tear over human weakness . " . . . . " But if it came from him , we can only say , there is no perfect guide but the Father . " The authority of Christianity is the subfrct of the fourth chapter . Its only authority is its truth . But as it has been contended , that it depends also on miracles , this question is discussed ; the conclusion is that miracles are impossible , and that there is no evidence that they occurred in the case of Christianity . In the fifth chapter , he asks what are the essential peculiarities of Christianity . In the sixth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus of Nazareth , under the two heads of the negative side , or the limitations of Jesus , and the positive side , or the excellencies of Jesus . Chapter seventh is devoted to the mistakes about Jesus , his reception and influence ; it gives a graphic portraiture of his sufferings and trials , within and without , and then proceeds to show how the same thing is fulfilled in all the Jesuses before and since his time , and particularly in the case of Theodore Parker , hero and apostle of absolute religion . The picture is pleasant and not unaffecting , though it becomes somewhat seriocomic when we remember that he alludes to the scribes and chief priests of Boston and Harvard College . Next we have in hook fourth , " the relation of the religious sentiment to the greatest of books , or a discourse of the Bible . " He describes the position which the Bible holds and the influence which it wields , and says justly , that there must be a reason for it , and that is the soul and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bible , that it is the only authoritative rule of religious faith and practice , is in his view untenable . Of this view he says , " Accordingly with strict logical consistency , a peculiar method is used both in the criticism and interpretation of the Bible . Reason has nothing to do in the premises but accept the written statement of the word ; ' the duty of belief is just the same whether the word contradict reason and conscience , or agree with them . " " Now this is true or not true . " If it is true it is capable of being proved . Of the four ways by which it may he established , he considers at length the following , " the examination of the contents of the Bible , and the external history of its origin . " In regard to the Old Testament he lays down the following thesis . " Every book of the Old Testament hears distinct marks of its human origin ; some of human folly and sin , all of human weakness and imperfection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and concludes thus , " To look back upon the field we have passed , it must be confessed that the claims made for the Old Testament have no foundation in fact ; its books like others , have a mingling of good and evil . We see a gradual progress of ideas therein , keeping pace with the civilization of the world . Vestiges of ignorance , superstition , folly , of unreclaimed selfishness , yet linger there . Here the moral and religious sentiment are insulted ; there , is beautiful instruction for both . There is a gradual progress in the Jewish as in all mythologies . First , God appears in person ; walks in the garden in the cool of the day ; eats and drinks ; makes contracts with his favorites ; is angry , resentful , sudden and quick in quarrel , and changes his plans at the advice of a cool man . " lie examines the New Testament also , and comes to a similar conclusion . He then adds , " These facts can not be hushed up , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face . They have pained already many a breaking heart , who could not separate the truth of Christianity from the errors of its record , felt with groans that could not be uttered . It need not be so . Christianitv is one thing ; the Christian documents are another . " He concludes with some remarks about the excellency of the Bible , to which we may have occasion to refer . It is no part of our design to follow the author through his criticism on particular passages . His argument is hasty and superficial . It is but the striking extracts from a pretty thorough course of neological reading , or the siftings of the sweepings from German lecture rooms . There is nothing new , nothing said which has not often been answered , and the best answer to which , is a good commentary on the Bible , if indeed , such a thing there were . We can only offer some general considerations . Let us take into our hands then this Bible , in respect to which Mr. Parker has adopted these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its own light-that venerable collection of Hebrew literature , with that other assemblage of writings that is grouped around Jesus and his followers . We apply to them no peculiar principles . We will go no farther than we are led by the canons which sound sense and reason prescribe in the study of all the literature and history of the past . If given by God , the Bible will speak for itself . We repel and reject the charge , that a peculiar method of criticism must be used in respect to it . We open first the Old Testament , and study it by the light of historic interpretation . These Hebrew writings are in the hands of a peculiar people , who honor them as their sacred books ; whose history they record ; and out of whose occasions of joy and sorrow , of prosperity and affliction , of worship and wailing , they are said to have originated . Their gifted men composed them , their legislators , philosophers , prophets and poets . Far back in the world 's youth , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and lineage are still remembered with honor , for the Jew of this day though unlike Abraham in his faith , boasts Abraham as his father . This patriarch is a wandering herdsman , in all the simplicity of the pastoral life . You may see him even now in the Bedouin of the desert , if you take from the latter his vile and selfish creed , his thievish and hungry life . 1-us tribe and kindred are loved with the freshness and strength peculiar to his time and his calling , and his strongest desire is to be the founder of a family and a name . He knows not the mystery of letters . His vocabulary of oral communication is greatly limited . His views of things human and divine are narrow and short.sighted , except as there beats within his bo // som a strong and true heart . We see him in his wanderings , with his household of dependents ever about him . We must judge of his attainments not by our light , but by comparing them with those of his contemporaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these we have no record . The world had rolled on a decade of centuries farther when Homer painted the manners of his time ; five at least intervene between Moses and the painter of Ulysses . But look at Abraham with these centuries against him , and look at Ulysses and his history . XVe see in both , the same simplicity of manners , the same dignity and tenderness of affection . The pictures of both must have been taken fresh in the earliest times . They could have been traced by no modern hand . See Ulysses , pious indeed after his way , honest and upright . But how does Abraham the Chaldean herdsman tower above him in his knowledge of the Judge of all the earth , who can not but do right , to whom he offers the simple sacrifice , calling on his name . Amid temptations to worship the host of heaven or the stupid image , he worships the unseen . He stands out in the earliest history of man as a worshiper of one and a holy God , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fitted to inspire . Here is a phenomenon in the history of the race , strange and peculiar . How are we to account for it ? Is it enough to tell us that he obeyed the religious elements , and fell back on the guidance of absolute religion ? No , the question still returns , the historical question , why have not others done the same ? But the story attempts to explain itself . It tells us that God spoke to him in a dream ; that he made a promise to him , that if he would be faithful to his service as the One , he would make him the father of a great family ; that in a vision he confirmed to him the covenant , after the usual way of those times , by passing in a visible symbol between the quivering and divided limbs of slaughtered victims ; that he tested his faith by long delay in respect to the child of his promise , and tested that faith again , by demanding that child in sacrifice . These things appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the poetic drapery with which the filial devotion of his descendants delighted to invest the memory of their honored sire , but utterly unworthy of the Eternal ; and besides , to him it is philosophically impossible for God to reveal himself to man . But laying aside this last objection , we ask , why trivial ? How could the Eternal reveal himself to that mind except in the way in which he did , without destroying it . The future state is too distant , from which to bring motives that shall be strong enough to move him , and so he appeals to his strongest passion , that was instinctive and innocent , and promises to make of him a great nation . But he bade him offer his son in sacrifice . Oh horrible ! the perfect God could never do that ! Why not ? Is not he the master of life ? Did not Abraham know that it was to test his faith and that God could and would raise him to life ? Does Mr Parker know enough of Abraham and his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his moral sense ? But we are curious to know , how God could reveal himself to such a mind , except in the way in which he did . Would Mr. Parker have him teach Abraham all the doctrines of the absolute religion in the phrase of lIege 1 , Spinoza , or Schleiermacher ? Viewed in the light of the age in which Abraham lived , the call by night , the covenant and the demand of sacrifice , not only form no objection , but add truthfulness to the picture . Against all this Mr. Parker has but two arguments . First , the metaphysical // one , touching the idea and conception of God . Second , the following . The sacred books of all nations tell mythological stories about their great men , therefore all stories about revelations or wonders are of course mythic . He has carried the argument by the previous question . We pass over the history of Abraham 's family , as it expands itself into a tribe and prepares to become a great nation . It is still surrounded by idolatrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demand a visible image , the embodied Deity , to say nothing of the temptations that beset it from debasing rites . In the world 's uplifting and recovery , it is the plan of its instructor to teach his lessons as he may , and it is a hard and slow one , this first lesson of the one spiritual God . The tribe are suffered to become captive to the proudest and wealthiest nation of the world . They are delivered , after inflictions of evil on their oppressors ; and as the sea rolls over the bodies of their haughty pursuers , this unlettered tribe sing a song composed by their leader , which is to be ever in their mouths as a memorial of what the one God , their God can do . They go to Sinai . The path by which they were conducted thither , can even now be traced ; and the rock , which God selected as the place on which to enthrone his law , can be well nigh identified . Beneath its overhanging precipice , shaken by horrid thunderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is given in precepts , which an unlettered people could understand and remember , but which are the sum of moral wisdom for all time . To these was added a ritual system , which addressed the senses of a nation who could only thus discern the spiritual . The ark may have been taken from some Egyptian ceremonial , and the entire ritual from pinetices common to the surrounding nations . Certainly they were adapted to the age and the time . Jehovah is revealed as the national Deity , in conformity with the views of the time , and conducts himself as such . He takes them to the land provided for them . He gives it the blessing of his promise . He holds over his people a government of temporal rewards and punishments . To their faithfulness he gives harvests of plenty , to their recreancy , blasting and mildew . The laws he gives are wonderful for their wise forecast . They provide for the occasions of domestic life , for the welfare of the soil , for the national harmony and union . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed . And in all this system , there is present a pure religion which reaches to the heart , while in its sacrificial offerings there is the symbol of a sublime mystery yet to be unfolded . And yet Moses lived five hundred years before the Odyssey was written . Except as we account for him , by supernatural guidance and inspiration , Moses is a monster striding more than a thousand years before his age . In comparison with his code , viewed as adapted to the age for which it was designed , the code Napoleon , that production of the master mind of modern times , with all the experience and education of the world centuries older , sinks away from admiration . We put it to you , Mr. Parker , account for Moses if you can . Oh , fie , fie on you , that with your Homer in your hand , and able as a scholar to enter into the spirit of the past , you fail to admire the wonder of wonders , and to see in him a supernatural influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the university ; and it is not for us to say that the way in which you repay them now , is surprising or undeserved . But you will tell us that the God of the Jews was a God of war and // of cruelty ; that he doomed the unhappy Canaantes to massacre ; and that he is most inconsistent with himself , now holy , now sinking to the level of their prejudices and passion . Of this we have only to say , that it is for you to show , that there was any other way in which he could reveal himself to imperfect and bigoted Jews , they being as they were . We say that there is not the least evidence that the moral sense of the people was offended in the least , by his allowance of war , of slavery , or by any word or act which in your view is so strong an argument . Of the devotional poetry of these Scriptures , we take your own description . " The excellence of the Hebrew devotional hymns has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences , arts , literature , bright and many colored , has little that approach these . They are the despair of imitators ; still the uttered prayer of the Christian world . rfell us of Greece , whose air was redolent of song ; its language such as Jove might speak ; its sages , heroes , poets , honored in every clime ; - they have no psalm of prayer and praise like these Hebrews , the devoutest of men , who saw God always before them , ready to take them up , when father and mother let them fall . " We ask you , as a scholar , and a student of the world 's history and literature , where did this poetry come from ? We turn now to the New Testament . Rome is in her pride and pcwer . She has swallowed the world in her insatiate appetite for dominion . In her broad empire , there is learning and culture ; there is luxury with its daintiest contrivances , and art with her proudest triumphs in painting , statuary and architecture . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the driveling of an idiot about the Deity . Though Athens still opens her schools of wisdom ; and philosophy , protected and fos tered by her conqueror , has had centuries in which to test and mature her conclusions in respect to the elements of moral and religious wisdom ; the wisdom of the world is still at loss , or if she snatches at some gleams of truth , she has not the moral force to hold them , much less to impress them on man , and give them a swift and victorious propagation . The Jewish people still continue . Though they have not been without service for the well-being of the world , yet they have ill understood and fulfilled the commission , which was placed in their keeping . At this period , the mass of them are fanatical bigots , with a few who understand the import of their religion , and are waiting for the consolation of Israel . Upon this scene , see Jesus step forth in the dignity of the Eternal , and yet with the simplicity and just proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " Try him as we try other teachers . They deliver their word , find a few waiting for the consolation , who accept the new tidings , follow the new method , and some go beyond their teacher , though less mighty minds than lie . Such is the case with each founder of a school in philosophy , each sect in religion . Though humble men , we see what Socrates and Luther never saw . But eighteen centuries have past since the Sun of humanity rose so high in Jesus , what man , what sect , what church has mastered his thought ; comprehended his method , and so fully applied it to life . " We see him in his life with his rude and half-taught disciples ; patient and mild , he brings o utby degrees the wonderful truths concerning his system and person , as they were able to bear them . He is crucified ; he rises from the dead ; his followers gather new views in respect to his character , his teaching and the destiny of his kingdom ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full and just view of the Christian system . What a literature have they left us ? As Mr. Parker says , " Little need now be said of the New Testament , of the simple truth that nestles in its leaves , its parables , epistles , where Paul lifts up his manly voice , and John pours out the mystic melody of his faith . " Test Jesus by his age , hy any age , and need we ask what is the only solution of the wonder ? Did we not know how Mr. Parker on his theory would answer us , we should almost feel that we insulted his understanding and moral taste to question whether he could answer it in hut one way ! So much for the men of the Scriptures , and their recorded lives and sayings . Tested by the light of their own time , they tell their own tale . " But allowing the inspiration of the men , " the objector will say , surely you will not contend for that of the collected writings . " In respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We give her all her usual license to ascertain by whom they were written , and whether or not they have come down to us as they were at first written . So too in regard to the meaning of the several passages , she has all the range which she ought to ask , and all the light which a knowledge of the times , and of the modes of poetic ororiental speech can possibly furnish . But the writings of the Old Testament come down to us as the sacred books of this people among whom God dwelt . To many of them are affixed the names of authors known to be inspired as men . They were inspired to speak . Why should they not be guided as writers ? They have received also the attestation of Jesus and his inspired preachers . Difficulties embarrass this question ; but to make them decisive as objections , against an argument so strong , they must not merely be said , but be shown to be without a possible solu tion . We are told of the contradictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a minuter criticism would raise . And are we not reasonable enough to consider that these records are but fragments , coming down to us through centuries of time long gone by ; that the difficulties might vanish in a moment , did we know the languages as did the writers , and did we see with their eyes ; that on the supposition that such writings were to be inspired , and yet be the writings of men and in the hands of men-writings so various in kind , so remote and diverse as to the time of their origin-we should expect precisely these difficulties to exist , and that they could not but arise ? The offenses arising from the imprecatory psalms-putting on them the most unfair construction , and from war and slavery , vanish as we consider that the men and writers were inspired not to discern all the applications of truth , else must Abraham have been a Paul in the completeness of his knowledge , but that they were inspired in their age , and for their age , and by their age are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many seems to hang over the traces of the Messiah , promised in the Old Testament and recognized in the New , can be removed only in proportion as we ourselves can become Abraham , and see with his eyes the first tints of the day that was to dawn in Christ , and then trace its slow uprising before the mind of Jacob , of Samuel , of David and Isaiah . Who shall tell us that together with the prophetic intimations concerning this Messiah of which there is record , there were not many spoken which never passed to the sacred page " But the miracles and the rising from the dead ! " And what are these as grounds of wonder or offense , by the side of Moses , or David , or Jesus ? What more natural , what more necessary , than in a seasual // and besotted age , they should be needed , and being needed should be givers ? What more natural appeal could be employed to break up the torpor of sin , and to call the attention of astonished man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul by higher evidence ? Because rattles and horn-books and toys in all their gradations , are useful for infancy and childhood , are we to conclude after we have outgrown them and exhausted all their good , that there can be no such things as toys ? Shall we , as we stand on the heights of absolute manhood , reason by grave demonstration , that a rattle is an absurdity , and our , recollections of them are but the dreams of infancy ? * Thus do we account for and vindicate the Bible , as critics and students of its literature . Thus do we give the solution to the secret of its hold on man , which Mr. P. acknowledges and so well describes . See pp. 318-19 . There is another argument of which Mr. Parker seems to have taken but little heed . Though he talks much of absolute religion , and would have us believe that in it is the essence of that which meets the heart of man , he seems to us to have failed to reach the just idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute religion is a sentiment , not a moral principle . His God is to be the theme of poetic musings by twilight , rather than of reverential yet confiding obedience ; and is to be honored by the graceful observances of a beautiful religion , rather than by the inner realities of spiritual worship . Man in this system , though a moral being , is not so disordered and * It will be observed that the argument here is arguiecatum dd Itominem . It would indeed be a narrow view of the relation of miracles to the Christian revelation , if we were to suppose that they were wrought only because of the ignorance and debasement of the period in which the revelation was made . guilty as to need pardon and strength , nor is God a moral ruler that will bring man tojudgment . But , in truth , man is a sinner , his God does condemn him , and his soul thirsts for peace and satisfaction . He opens the Scriptures . As literature , and history , and poetry , they must have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the book of life . He reads their pages anew . He traces through them the history of God 's progressive revelation of himself to man for man 's moral recovery , till he beholds at last the full glory of God manifest in the flesh , and Christ is revealed as man 's " wisdom , righteousness , sanctification and redemption . " He binds the holy volume to his heart and goes on his way rejoicing . Of the fifth book , or " a discourse of the church , " we have but a word to say . It is a critique on the history of the church and the several forms of Christianity , and is characteristic of its author . It includes two sections under the head of Protestantism , with the following titles , - " Of the party that sets out from the sovereignty of God , "  --  and " Of the party that sets out from the paternity of God . " The first of these might not come amiss if it should be read at the opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the second be read at the meeting of the American Unitarian Association , particularly that part of it which describes the present condition of Unitarianism . The reasons which induced us to give so extended a notice of this volume of Mr. Parker 's , we have already hinted at . It is not a recent work . Some of the interest which it at first excited we are well aware has died away . But it remains as a representation of that which is and is to be the infidelity of the age . This system demands the notice of every observer of the times . We see in the Dial of October , 1843 , a re // view from Mr. P. , commending two works by Ilennel , in which it would seem his own views are if possible more fully made known than in the Discourse of Religion . We give the following from ilennel : - " With no hostility then towards Christ and Christianity may the Theist renounce his faith in miracles and prophecy . Let all benefactors of mankind continue to look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize a kindred mind in the Galilean who preached lessons of wisdom and benevolence in an early age of the world , and fell a sacrifice to the noble idea of introducing a kingdom of heaven upon earth . Let the good Samaritan still be cited as the example of humanity , the Passover supper be remembered as the farewell of Jesus to his friends , and God be worshiped under the character which he attributed to him , the Father in heaven . Let painting and music still find solemn themes in the realities and fables relating to Jesus ; let feasts and holydays still take their names from the events of his life , our time be dated from his birth , and our temples surmounted by his cross . Christianity then has been neither evil nor useless , but out of it will proceed a further mental growth . " Such is its creed . Its peculiarities are twofold-its views of natural religion , and its views of the Scriptures . In respect to both of these , it professes to receive all that is valuable and permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary . In its absolute religion it professes to retain the essential principles that are derived from the nature of things . Nay , it claims to itself the higher merit that it beholds them by the intuition of the reason . It tells us in effect , " We cherish the same piety which you inculcate-we worship the same God and with the same spiritual worship-we recognize the same regeneration which is enjoined by the Christianity of history and of miracles-we require not testimony - we cherish a loftier and more believing spirit . " But it is not the same religion . It gives us but half the religion of nature , and not the whole . It gives us a God of purity indeed , for any other is rejected by an elevated taste , but it gives no God whom we love and worship as our Father-no God who upholds a pure law and gives life to an actual government . It recognizes man with a spiritual nature and moral faculties , but not man responsible to a reigning Jehovah , and held to the issues of blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . And yet , that infidelity should honor these eternal principles so far as it does , is a cheering token of the times . It shows that these truths have fought their way and have seated themselves in triumph in the convictions of man . Whether the Bible be true or not , the mind of man knows and acknowledges that these are truths . Infidelity itself is compelled to own them , even while it evades their force and pressure . It seems to own the truth but hides it , and gives us instead of the truth its own cant about " the spiritual nature and destiny of man ; " that painted mirage by which so many gifted minds are still led on , thinking that the next stage shall quench their thirst for " the living water , "  --  and still are they pilgrims , and still are they in the desert . So too in respect to the Scriptures . It seems to give them all the honor which they deserve . It can use the choicest epithets , to set forth their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with an angel 's tongue . We deny not the sincerity with which it pays its homage . The days of such vulgar and illiterate scorn as Voltaire or Diderot presumed to pour upon the literature of " the barbarous Jews , " are gone forever . The world has grown wiser . // Her science , and taste , and knowledge of the past , all have taught her better . But after all , this proudreligion shall we call it ? - scorns the word so admired , when that word claims the authority of a revelation from God . Thus does it take off the heavy weight of obligation . True , it professes to do this on the ground both of piety and historic sense . It is shocked at such exhibitions of God , and it is too well acquainted with man 's credulity to believe in a miracle or Theophany ; so with strange talk of myths and legends does it profess to solve the question whence came the word . But it is a heavy burden that it undertakes , and a barbarous solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revere with Strauss . By believing so much , you make difficulties that you can not shake off . This infidelity is adapted to the age , not to the uncultured and vulgar mind , but to the most cultivated and refined . It is learned ; nay , learning has made it mad . It is engendered by reading without reflec-tion by yielding the mind to passive impressions , without the energy of an active will , an honest moral sense , and the stern discipline of an active life , till finally the power of comparing shrinks into incapacity , and the man is given up to an idiocy of judgment , " ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth . " It satisfies the taste-it makes peace between the taste and the moral sense by enthroning the beautiful , and making religion and holiness nothing but poetry . Nay , it is more pious than the Scriptures - more believing than to be willing to need their aid . Its atheism is so scientific , so tasteful , so intellectual , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its infidelity is so learned , so catholic , so ready to appreciate all that is good in the Scriptures , while yet it can not bring itself to believe all that it desires to , that multitudes conclude there must be something in it . " There must be something in it , " so would say the careless reader of fine intellect and refined taste , and noble aspirations , who would make his peace with his conscience , and yet can not bring himself to the spirit and life demanded by vulgar piety . This we suppose to have been the influence of Mr. Parker and of the school to which he belongs , on the minds of hundreds . They have not been persuaded to follow the author to the full length of his speculations , but their faith has been unsettled and they cry out in inward agony , but with a calm brow . To this state much of the mind of Christendom sometimes seems to be tending . We would not be intolerant in using the word infidelity so often in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do only apply it after its ordinary usage ; and until their views have gained a currency so wide as to reverse that usage , the word must retain its propriety . But we write in no scornful mood . They are brethren to us , not merely by the ties of common humanity , but by those of similar studies and tastes , and we may add similar difficulties with much that passes for truth . We know something of the fascination they are under , and would fain greet them as they rise to a better way of thinking . But this is the infidelity of the age . What shall be done to meet it ? We can only indicate the answer to this inquiry . Declamation will not do it . Nor will cant , nor denunciation . Nor Pietism with its warm heart and busy hand , but with eye askance upon enlarged and liberal studies , and a generous course of manly cultivation . Nor will the zeal and devotedness of a ministry , however graceful in manner , or easy in utterance , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attained a catholic and liberal taste for all that is excellent // in character and literature . We need not say that Oxfordism , with all its train , will but aggravate the evil . Nay , Oxfordism , in the last analysis , is little else than another type of the same disease , poetry instead of holiness . We must have a learned but yet a logical , vigorous , and bold philosophy , which shall be true to man and true to God ; which shall do justice to the problems that are committed to her for solution , and which shall argue and demonstrate rather than dogmatize and sneer . We dare to affirm that to philosophy is committed a most important position , in *vin44*iting the truth from prevailing error . No man can doubt it , who traces the influence of a false but seductive system in the volume of Mr. Parker . We must also have a scheme of interpretation which shall do justice the most complete to the Bible , as written by man , while yet it shall vindicate its dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind sickens at the amount of nonsense that has been written vaguely about the Bible , under the name of spiritual interpretation . It is stunned and confused amid the Babel-like confusion and the wordy wars of modern exegetes , and is lost in the labyrinthine cane-brake of their long drawn speculations . It starves on the vapid nihilities of a frigid and soulless neology . It looks for a true and consistent historic interpretation , which shall bring out the parts of the Bible each in relation to its own time , and shall show the wisdom and condescension , the providence and skill which they testify of him who revealed them . Such a vindication of historical Christianity and of progressive revelation , we hesitate not to say , is one of the grandest wants of the age , and may well be one of its proudest achievements . It was our original design to add to the considerations already given , a view of the i-elation of Mr. Parker 's opinions to the fundamental principles of the Unitarian system , with some remarks upon the position he holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important topics suggested by the volume , and we intended to have given to it , an important share of our notice . But this article is already long enough ; and the topic which remains untouched is too large to be fairly disposed of in a closing paragraph . In a future number , we shall probably pay our respects again to the apostle of " Absolute Religion . " The appearance of such a teacher , the publication of such a book , in the name of Christianity , at the metropolis of New England , is a phenomenon , which , if justly explained and resolved into its elements , can not but teach us some important lessons . Merely to argue against the Discourse concerning Religion-merely to refute its fallacies ever so completely , is comparatively a small matter . How came the book to be written , published , read , admired ? How came Mr. Parker to be what he is ? These are questions which no philosophical mind , Unitarian or Trinitarian , Liberal or Evangelical , can avoid asking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be learned from the phenomenon before us.
