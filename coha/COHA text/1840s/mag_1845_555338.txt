txt HARDLY any author of our own age has exerted a wider influence than the author of the work before us . Not that his books have been generally read ; for , in the current acceptation of that term , he is very far from being a popular writer . Nor yet can he have been much read by the class next removed from the many , - by the busy , stirring , leading , managing class of people , - by those who pull the puppet-wires that move the masses . But ideas of all kinds are put in circulation by very different persons , - by those of retired and contemplative habits , who speak and write only when they have somewhat to say , and whose sole aim beyond self-culture is to convince reasonable men of what is true , or to persuade them to what is right . The thoughts // which they set in motion float in the intellectual atmosphere , and are constantly inhaled and given out again in new forms by thinking men ; and in their ceaseless circuits and transformations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less thoughtful and more active members of the body politic , find a lodgment there , and thus work their way gradually into the common mind . But those who thus sustain the vital circulation in the intellectual world do not occupy its highest places . There is yet a loftier style of mental endowment and character . There are the men of genius , of inspiration , of genuine intuition , who hold , face to face , communion with " the incorruptible spirit that is in all things , " who strike out great thoughts and attain comprehensive views , not by labored processes of induction , but spontaneously and by open vision . A few of these sufflce for an age ; and they are the mediators between their race and absolute truth . They enunciate principles , which the patient labor of an inferior order of minds must verify . They open rich veins , which the diligent and plodding must work . They plunge into the region of the unknown and unexplored by routes which none can trace , throw up their signal lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepwise , by cutting away the undergrowth of ages , and building a solid pathway . They thus plan work and furnish materials for the large and growing class of respectable , sensible , useful writers , leaving them scope for a certain degree or kind of originality in supplying intermediate processes and subsidiary thoughts , and in the whole work of rhetorical arrangement and adornment . We are disposed to assign to Isaac Taylor a very high rank in this last named class of minds . He is not a genius , hut a great and fruitful thinker . He is no Prometheus , hut he handles fire to admiration . Of absolutely original views or ideas , his writings present , for the most part , an utter dearth . But , as an eclectic philosopher and theologian , he is careful , candid , discriminating , often judicious , always instructive . Though indebted to his extensive reading for the germs of his theories , and for the staple of his arguments and illustrations , he yet has made the fruits of his study thoroughly his own by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind has passed upon them all , so that he is never a plagiarist , and never appears as a // mere compiler , but always as an independent thinker and critic , with a strongly marked individuality of character . He is eminently a suggestive writer , inasmuch as he deals largely in paradoxes that startle the reader 's mind into reflection , and his works abound also in half-shaped , fragmentary conceptions and statements , which the reader is left to complete for himself . We have called Taylor a candid author ; but the word needs qualification . It is applicable in full to his personal consciousness and to the sincerity of his aims . No author of our times has a more devout love of truth , a more cordial readiness to weigh objections and to respect opposite opinions , or a greater fearlessness of results , than he . But his mind is subject to some strong biases , which , while he is unconscious of their presence , often warp his judgment , and blend false elen ) ents with his theories and convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive , is partial and one-sided . With Christian antiquity he is intimately conversant ; with pagan antiquity not more so than every man of liberal pursuits professes to be . In old English theological literature he is no less an adept than in patristical lore ; of modern German theology , his impressions seem to have been derived at second hand , and his kiiowledge is exceedingly imperfect , so that , while he occupies a position worthy of a Christian , at the farthest remove from German skepticism , he has failed to profit by the enlarged views and liberal canons of historical and biblical criticism , which , salvdfide , he might have borrowed from the continent . In isolated ecclesiastical history he is thoroughly versed ; yet he seems not to have traced it in its parallelism with the progress and the revolutions of states and empires , or with the literary and scientific developments of successive ages . His views , therefore , often lack comprehensiveness and universality ; their correctness is relative , not absolute ; they are taken from a point either too remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague and inadequate , or else disproportionately magnified . Then again , our author is too prone to regard all classes of subjects indiscriminately in their aesthetic aspects . Himself a man of refined culture , delicate perceptions , and fastidious tastes , he is often captivated or repelled by the auspices under which a theory has been broached , or the form 14 * // in which a system has been promulgated ; and permits what is adventitious and unessential to outweigh the actual merits of a case or question . Quaintness and daintiness of thought and a certain moderate euphuism of style have a charm for him , independently of the truth or falsity of the ideas which they represent . Also , in common with most persons in whom the aesthetic element is largely developed , he is more readily accessible to the beautiful than to the grand . His love of symmetry often leads him to ignore truths which he can not crowd between the points of his compasses , and measure on his scale . The region of the immense and the unknown he hardly recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petty cobwork of a dreamy imagination , - if that may be termed imagination , which works by mathematical rule , and never violates proportion . Taylor 's practical views on all subjects are also materially affected by his isolated and retired position , and his ignorance of the condition , character , and wants of the great mass of mankind . Leading a life of literary ease , domestic in his tastes and habits , conversant with few except persons of cultivation and refinement , he has but a vague and traditionary knowledge of the less fortunate classes and conditions of society . The rougher forms of life he has beheld only at a distance so remote as to soften their rugged features , and to shed a delusive haze over their deformities* Sin and misery are to him not the stubborn and immeasurable facts that they appear in actual life , but negative quantities in the account current of humanity , which , though vast , are yet susceptible of easy calculation , and may he cancelled with mathematical accuracy . He has never sounded the depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental and moral neediness of countless multitudes even in the most enlightened parts of Christendom . His creed , indeed , as to the dogma of native depravity , is sufficiently orthodox ; but depravity is with him a technical term , rather than an embodied attribute of character . Thus , his views and theories , when they have reference to society as it is , or to its progressive amelioration , are vitiated by his oversight of a portion of the facts in the case . They lack adaptation to the actual condition of things . For similar reasons , our author is better versed in the past // than in the present , and displays his powers to far greater advantage in the philosophical analysis of what has been , than in the announcement of that which is to come , whether on earth or in heaven . Indeed , when he assumes the prophet 's wand , his future is simply some phasis of the past idealized and glorified . His very paradise has all its forms run in terrestrial moulds , and borrows many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His quietness of spirit , his retired manner of life , and his contemplative and introspective habits of mind fit him to be the expositor of the statics , rather than of the dynamics of society . He views the race , or the church , or the nation , ( as his subject may be , ) as in a state of equilibrium , and calculates with beautiful precision the balanced forces which keep each other in repose . But he can not throw himself on the rushing tide of human activity and progress , and ascertain its rate and its laws of ebb and flow , sound its eddies , and mark from age to age its shifting channels . He can give a masterly analysis of single , isolated elements of civilization and social improvement ; but they must first be brought into his laboratory , and cast into his crucible . He can not detect them in operation , or trace them clearly in their joint action as combined with other forces . He is like the chemist , whom the motions of the heavenly bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteoric stone fall from the volcanoes of the moon , the astronomer * carry it with unhesitating confidence that no test or solvent will be left untried in determining the nature and properties of its primitive atoms . Such an author is necessarily a very inadequate type of an age like the present , whose breath is ceaseless agitation , its atmosphere turmoil and excitement , its very rest motion . Taylor 's style is marked both by great beauties and by glaring faults . As a medium of ready communication with his readers , it can claim small praise . It is artificial and elaborate to the last degree . It abounds in involved sentences , unvernacular idioms , words of foreign , unfamiliar derivation , and heavy , cumbrous compounds , designed to embody whole sentences of meaning . An author of less merit could hardly induce a numerous public to undertake the severe task-work of mastering such a style . But while the outward garb in which the author has seen fit to clothe his // thoughts interposes serious difficulties in the way of apprehending them , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and inimitably delicate hues and shadings . Taylor 's books are full , even to weariness , of felicitous expressions , of words that are pictures , of single isolated images , that incarnate abstract truth , and make its form and semblance almost flash before the natural eye . Indeed , there is hardly a sentence of his , which is not graceful , exquisitely wrought , and worthy to be transferred to the commonplacebook , as a gem worth keeping by itself . But his prose is all high table-land . He never rises , never falls . There is no variety , - no adaptation of the expression to the relative dignity of the subject , or prominence of the thought , - no plain , unadorned statement of plain and simple truth . On the other hand , the most momentous and thrilling themes never quicken his pulse , or dash his pen with fire , or swell the silvery stream into a rushing torrent . Old Hugh Latimer , drawing analogies from things temporal to picture out a spiritual feast , says " When there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , at the end of the dinner they have certain subtleties , custards , sweet and delicate things . " Taylor serves up an inimitably " delicate dinner , " and , if his guests complain of their fare , it can only be on the ground , that the " subtleties " come not at the end alone , but constitute first , second , and third course , entr*es and dessert . " The Natural History of Enthusiasm , " if not our author 's first work , was the first which gave him fame . Most of his subsequent works , including the one now under review , belong to the same class with this ; and it is on these that his reputation must chiefly rest . They consist of the minute , thorough , philosophical analysis of fundamental principles and essential elements of religion , society , and human nature . They are heart-probing books , such as reveal man to his own better knowledge ; and are adapted to exert the most salutary practical influence on cultivated and reflecting readers , in expounding recondite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of the Christian Scriptures , and pointing out the true conditions of social well-being and progress . Of the " Physical Theory of Another Life " we can not speak so favorably . It is , what it purports to be , a strictly physical theory . It materializes the soul , and heav // en , and hell . Its system of the world to come has all the grotesqueness , with little of the quaint symmetry and fantastic beauty , that attach to Swedenborg 's . It had its germ undoubtedly in Abraham Tucker 's vehicular system , which , as a literary curiosity , possesses singular charms , but , gravely proposed as a theory , can awaken only surprise and skepticism . Saturday Evening is one of Taylor 's most edifying books . It consists of a series of short and loosely connected essays on the spiritual condition and relations of man individually and collectively , and on the intimate connection of the soul , still earth-bound , with higher intelligences and a loftier sphere of being . It is a book which one may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . It has just enough of accurate reasoning to keep the intellectual faculties on the alert , and just enough of dreamy imagining to lift the soul into those vague and boundless regions of speculation , faith , and desire , in which we can always say , " It is good for us to be here . " Its strange title is an eminently happy one ; for we know no uninspired volume which is a more appropriate companion for the meditative stillness which one seeks on the eve of the Sabbath , or which can better fit one " to be in the spirit on the Lord 's day . " And if the large and important class of men , to whom " Saturday Evening " is the busiest season of the week , would now and then drop their pens and reinforce the languid flow of thought by a few of these suggestive pages , they would find less drowsy hearers , and sow the seed of a richer harvest on the morrow . But it is time that we entered on the analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of this article . It consists of four lectures , " delivered at the instance of the Committee of the London City Mission . " The first is on the Exterior Characteristics of Spiritual Christianity . ' ' The most obvious external feature of Christianity is , that it is " a religion of facts . " Under this head our author presents us with a masterly array of argument against the rationalistic view of the Christian Scriptures , which would eliminate the supernatural element from the record , and reduce it down to a body of unauthoritative moral teaching , appealing for the sole evidence of its truth to individual consciousness . The impossibility of separating the miraculous from the ordinary // events in the gospel history , and the extreme naturalness of the former no less than of the latter , are illustrated with so much force and beauty , that the hope that we may induce our readers to become acquainted with the work itself alone prevents our making copious extracts from this portion of it . But within less compass than would suffice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can quote the following weighty remarks on moral evidence considered as differing in kind only , and not necessarily in its degreee of certainty , from mathematical or physical proof . " That sort of evidence may properly be called moral , which appeals to the moral sense , and in assenting to which , as we often do with an irresistible conviction , we are unable , with any precision , to convey to another mind the grounds of our firm belief . It is thus , often , that we estimate the veracity of a witness , or judge of the reality or spuriousness of a written narrative . But then even this sort of evidence , when nicely analyzed , resolves itself into physical principles . What are these convictions , which we find it impossible to clothe in words , but the results , in our minds , of slow , involuntary inductions concerning moral qualities , and which , inasmuch as they are peculiarly exact , are not to be transfused into a medium so vague and faulty as is language , at the best ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger portion of it rests , in no proper sense , upon moral evidence . To a portion the mathematical doctrine of probabilities applies ; - for it may be as a million to one , that an alleged fact , under all the circumstances , is true . But the proof of the larger portion resolves itself into our knowledge of the laws of the material world , and of those of the world of mind . A portion also is conclusively established by a minute scrutiny of its agreement with that intricate combination of small events which makes up the course of human affairs . " Every real transaction , especially those which flow on through a course of time , touches this web-work of small events at many points , and is woven into its very substance . Fiction may indeed paint its personages so as for a moment to deceive the eye ;  --  but it has never succeeded in the attempt to foist its factitious embroideries upon the tapestry of truth . We might take , as an instance , that irresistible book in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Paul. * It is throughout a tracing of the thousand fibres by which // a long series of events connects itself with the warp and woof of human affairs . To apply to evidence of this sort the besom of skepticism , and sweepingly to remove it as consisting only in moral evidence , is an amazing instance of confusion of mind . " It is often loosely affirmed that history rests mainly upon moral evidence . Is then a Roman camp moral evidence ? Or is a Roman road moral evidence ? Or are these and many other facts , when appealed to as proof of the assertion , that , in a remote age , the Romans held military occupation of Britain , moral evidence ? If they be , then we affirm , that , when complete in its kind , it falls not a whit behind mathematical demonstration , as to its certainty . " - pp. 352- 34 . It has of late been fashionable in certain quarters to maintain , that there is an essential distinction between facts and truths , as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is said , may rest on testimony , and be taken on authority ; but the vast , comprehensive truths of ethical and religious science can be received on trust from no one they must have their evidence in our own consciousness , before they can be embraced . We admit the distinction , but contend that its whole bearing is against the ground maintained by these soi-disant spiritualists . Truths are universal facts ; facts are particular truths . The latter , being finite , may be ascertained , comprehended , and attested by finite minds , and may be the indubitable subjects of individual consciousness . The former , being infinite and absolute , can be fully known and adequately attested only by that mind , which holds in its embrace all space , time , and being ; for omniscience alone can know , whether a broad and extensive fact has limitations and exceptions , so as to render it still a mere fact , or whether it has the largest possible scope and application , and is therefore a truth . Consciousness , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely proves that the individual has certain ideas or impressions ; it is wholly subjective , while all truth must , from its very nature , have an objective reality , independent of individual consciousness . The testimony of God , then , is indispensably necessary to the authentication of truth . And , in consulting the records of a professed revelation , we are seeking the testimony of God , not of man . But how are we to recognize God 's testimony , coming to us , as it must , through human witnesses ? We reply , that human testimony is amply competent to authenticate miracles , which are mere isolated // facts , - possible facts , if there be a God , - facts beyond all doubt , if attested by a sufficient number of credible witnesses ; and that miracles , disturbing , as they do , the normal course of events , and implying the immediate effort of the divine power for some express and important end , make God himself the witness for whatever truths are promulgated in connection with them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament , a religion of facts , as the exterior basis of the religion of truths . Our author 's next proposition is , that " Christianity is a religion of facts , with which all men , without exception and without distinction , and in an equal degree , are personally concerned , " - a seeming truism , but bearing that aspect only because our minds have been , as it were , bathed from infancy in Christian ideas . In point of fact , Christianity is the only religion that has ever had existence , which has not been exclusive and invidiously aristocratic in its earthly privileges , and in the promised joys of its paradise . All others shut out from favor and hope multitudes of the race , on the score of nation , sex , rank , or profession . Indeed , the universality of the Christian religion occupied a prominent , if not the chief , plai*e among the objections urged against it in the primitive ages . The arrogant Jew looked down upon it with scorn , because it welcomed the Gentile into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the early pagan objectors , Celsus and Porphyry , expend more bitter invective than on its extension of privilege to the poor and illiterate , to the rustic and the slave . The third proposition in this lecture is , that " Christianity , as a religion of facts , induces a new relationship between man and his Maker " ; and the fourth , that " the facts of Christianity , when admitted as true , are of a kind to excite , and to maintain in activity , the warmest and the most profound emotions of which men are susceptible , according to the individual constitution of their minds . " The treatment of these points is marked by the calm and subdued fervor of one , whose daily experience is made up of the most profound and exalted religious emotions , and who has so far completed the work of self-consecration , as to serve God with the whole mind , no less than with the whole heart and strength . The external facts connected with the promulgation of // our religion having thus been discussed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of the second lecture . These are defined to be , first , " justification through faith " ; secondly , " the sovereign and abiding influence of the Holy Spirit in renovating the soul " ; and , thirdly , " that a cordial reception of these truths brings with it a settled and affectionate sense of security , or peace and joy in believing , which becomes the spring of holy tempers and virtuous conduct . " These truths , though nominally admitted as essential and vital by all Christians , can not be expounded or enlarged upon , without our entering on the field of polemic theology , which is for us forbidden ground . We can only say with regard to this lecture , that , while we would commend the explicitness and frankness of its statements as a worthy precedent for writers on this class of subjects , who are sometimes prone to employ words for the purpose of concealing ideas , we personally have no sympathy with its distinctive theological character . We pass therefore at once to the third lecture , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This , for its calm and elevated tone of sentiment , for its firm position on the eternal laws of the moral universe , for its lessons of practical wisdom , not adapted to the times , but fitted to make the times what they ought to be , deserves to be printed in golden letters , or , to speak more literally , ought to be published as a tract by thousands , and sown broadcast through Christendom . It presents such views as are needed , in these days of philanthropic effort , to redeem the great causes of human virtue , freedom , and progress from the contempt into which one-idea men of grovelling minds and impenetrable hebetude on all but a single class of subjects are fast sinking them , and to reunite philanthropy and piety , which God has joined , and which can not dwell apart without dishonor . The leading idea of this lecture is , that Christian morality is not a code of laws , but a set of principles , and not so much a set of principles , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of love and devoted allegiance to the Supreme Being , who , as our Creator , Redeemer , and Sanctifier , unites in himself every possible claim upon our " affectionate loyalty . " The gospel , indeed , has its commands and its prohibitions ; but these are not de // signed to act directly upon the human will . They suppose that xviii already subdued to the purpose of obedience , waiting for guidance , asking the way of duty ; and these precepts are designed , not to force the unwilling , but to direct the willing soul . With the ancients , manners and morals were coincident ( as the very etymology of our word morals indicates ) ; virtue was outward and mechanical ; and whatever goodness of heart a man acquired he was supposed to gain by the sedulous practice of prescribed routines of right conduct . Christian virtue , on the other hand , has its seat in the heart , and thence gradually subdues and governs every department of the outxvard life . The first and great commandment is , " Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and the second , of love to our neighbour , is simply a corollary from the first . Piety and charity are the one tree of life . We call it piety , as it strikes its deep root into the clefts of the Rock of ages ; charity , as it spreads wide its healing branches , to bless all whom its shade can shelter , or its fruits nourish . Christian ethics , consisting thus of the various modifications of a great principle , have received but slender services from those who have attacihed themselves to single portions of the gospel law , considered as a formal code , and have labored solely to carry into effect isolated commands or prohibitions . Movements of this kind , whether by individuals or combinations of men , when most promising at the outset , have spent themselves after a little season , and have been followed by a decided reaction , sufficient to counterbalance the seeming good that they had wrought . Meanwhile , as fast as men have become Christianized , abuses , wrongs , and evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have crumbled and fallen without hands ; and the temple-walls have risen upon their ruins without sound of axe or hammer . There is wrapped up in the great principles of the gospel , in its scattered and informal illustrations of duty , and , above all , in the godlike traits of its Founder 's life and character , an infinite wealth of ethical truth , motive , and energy , which developes itself from age to age , as fast as men are able to receive , use , embody , and establish it , and no faster . In the same Scriptures we read more than our fathers did ; our posterity will read more than we . The way in which Christianity reforms the world may be // illustrated by specifying some of the more striking evils and vices , which it found deep seated in the very heart of humanity , and refined and adorned by all the charms which wealth , wit , and learning could throw around them . We might take for our first illustration the abounding licentiousness of the Roman empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reader of Horace and Juvenal has become familiar with forms of pollution so gross and vile , as to be now banished from the very speech of men , which were then practised and defended by persons of unimpeachable social standing , nay , by the very priests at the altar , - which formed the theme of song in circles of the highest culture and most fastidious taste , - which have their memory perpetuated in verse that can not die , by minds not destitute of lofty sentiments and impulses . Purity and chastity were unknown virtues . Cato , the severe , inflexible Cato , commends a young man for frequenting brothels . Cicero , in defending M. Ccelius , says " Si quis est , qui etiam meretriejis amoribus interdictum juventuti putet , est ille quidem valde severus , negare non possum ; sed abhorret non modo ab hujus seculi licentid , verum etiam a majorum consuetudine atque concessis . " The marriage bond was but a rope of sand ; and scandalous divorces , on no pretence hut that of lust , stained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not , as in the East , an imprisoned slave , was yet worse , alternately the tyrant and the victim never , almost never , the chaste spouse of one husband , and the faithful mother of an unmixed progeny . In the Roman empire there was scarcely a pure house , around which could be grouped any of the numberless associations of fidelity , love , helpfulness , and permanent union , which go to make up the meaning of that most complex of all words , home . The excavated cities of Italy , which have embalmed for our own times the domestic forms and manners of the old world , show us the houses of the most wealthy absolutely destitute of what could be called family apartments , where the relations of a pure and virtuous household could be preserved inviolate . The guest-room , the banqueting-hall , the courts sub dio , are ample and splendid ; the lodging-rooms , the private apartments , are less commodious , less carefully sheltered , than the berths and state-rooms of a modern steamboat. // Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first advocates of Christianity went not forth with bitter denunciation and harsh invective . Had they assailed these vices directly , and sought to put them down either by cogent reasoning , powerful rhetoric , or indignant expostulation , their zeal would have been fruitless , and not one of them would have left his mark in the annals of the race . But they taught men and women everywhere , that they had within them souls , the image and the temple of God , that an omniscient eye was upon them , and an allsearching judgment in reserve for them . They unfolded the beauty of holiness , the worth of inward peace and purity , the blessedness of a conscience void of offence . They shed over the hearts of men a sense of divine and infinite love , and awakened reciprocal sentiments of gratitude and devotion . They thus diffused through the proud capital , and among the remotest provinces of the great empire , an atmosphere in which the contagion of degrading vice could not spread , and its deadly wounds were healed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moral universe . As fast as worthy notions of man 's spiritual and immortal nature gained ground , the reign of impurity was checked , and maxims and habits of self-restraint and self-respect obtained currency . Home , Christianity 's best earthly godsend , grew into being . The connubial relation was made sacred and enduring . Forms of vicious indulgence , which had sought no concealment , shunned the light , and were branded with shame and guilt . Woman rose from her age-long degradation , and for the meretricious robes of a tenant at will in her husband 's house , clothed herself in the modest graces of a Christian wife and mother , and took her place at the domestic and public altar , as man 's honored peer and partner . Vicious elements , that seemed thoroughly kneaded into the whole mass of society , have thus been purged away by the silent gradual working of Christian ideas and principles ; and in place of a social condition , characterized by high culture and elaborate refinement , yet presenting no one healthy feature , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that is wrong and evil , in its basis and its essential laws can neither need change , nor admit of improvement . The sanguinary and murderous spectacles , which consti // tuted the chief public entertainment for all classes of citizens in ancient Rome , were gradually exterminated by the same noiseless process of moral influence . There was no fierce onslaught upon gladiatorial shows , or upon the revolting conflicts of men with savage beasts . They seem never to have been made the subjects of peculiar animadversion or special effort on the part of the early Christians ; and the exhibition of fanatical rage against them would only have called forth new zeal for their continuance , and have cast their opposers to be torn in pieces on the arena , for the sport of a depraved populace . But men , when they became Christians , absented themselves from these spectacles , and bore against them their silent testimony , backed by the entire weight of pure , sober , dignified lives and manners . Every Christian household became a radiating point for sentiments of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of society , these barbarous amusements sunk into such desnetude and neglect , as hardly to need a formal abrogation . The effect of Chrstianity on the institutions of government belongs to the same category . The Christian Scriptures , indeed , prescribe no form of government ; and , as they enjoin quiet submission , rather than seditious and violent resistance , even to unjust power , they have all along been quoted by the friends and upholders of tyranny in behalf of the extremest views of passive obedience , and have often been represented by the champions of human rights as opposed to civil freedom ; yet , if we compare the ancient world and modern Christendom in this regard , we shall find abundant reason to deem Christianity the parent and friend of liberty and of popular institutions of government . We are prone to be misled by the frequent mention of the Greek and Roman republics ; and multitudes infer from this mere name , that there existed in the classic ages political institutions which recognized the equal rights of all classes of citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Athens , where as great a degree of freedom was enjoyed as in any one of the Grecian states , the right of suffrage was indeed secured to all , except the very numerous class of slaves , which sometimes bore to the free population the ratio of near twenty to one . But the free citizens were divided , according to their wealth , into four classes ; and those of the lowest , though possessed of the profoundest 15* // wisdom and the loftiest virtue , were for ever barred from any part in the public administration , were not eligible to any civil or military office , nor were they permitted to speak in the public assemblies ; while almost all the power of the state was confided to two separate senates , to neither of which could any be chosen but men of the most ample fortune . The other Grecian states were all , to a greater or less degree , exclusive aristocracies ; nor can the discriminating student of history find any thing to authorize the cant phrase , in which modern rhymesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberty . " Nor yet was Rome ever a republic in any assignable sense of the term . Its first government was a limited monarchy , which gradually consolidated itself into a despotism , and maddened the privileged aristocracy to a revolt on their own account ; and the downfall of royalty had no other effect upon the people at large , than to substitute a multitude of tyrants for one . There was , indeed , after this the show of popular suffrage ; but it was a mere empty mockery . The Roman people voted by centuries ; and the patricians were divided into centuries containing a hundred citizens each , while the plebeian centuries each contained several hundreds , and , in course of time , even thousands . The centuries were called to cast their votes in the order of rank ; and the lower centuries in the scale were not summoned to present their suffrages , except when a division among the upper gave them the casting vote , so that most questions were decided by a minority of the people , without any opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were , indeed , numerous struggles on the part of the common people to get possession of their just rights , and these struggles were in some cases attended with partial and temporary success ; but always ended in a firmer riveting of the chains , until at last the people learned to love their fetters , and to cringe in utter abjectness of spirit to their oppressors . Greece and Rome were , politically speaking , the brightest spots in all antiquity . Everywhere else there was despotism unquestioned , untempered , iron-handed . And how is it even at this day out of the pale of Christendom ? What organized Mahometan or pagan government is there which does not disfranchise the great mass of its citizens , and count their property as rightful plunder , their lives as a free sacri // fice to transient resentment or momentary whim ?

Of the thrones of Christendom , there is not one which has not quaked and tottered . Of arbitrary forms of government yet surviving , there is not one , into which popular elements have not been infused , not one , which deems itself independent of the favor even of its lowest and poorest subjects . There is not a spot of earth in any Christian country , where a man can be trampled on with impunity simply because he is poor , or where a serf , or peasant , or laborer can be murdered by autocratic power , without his blood 's borrowing a nation 's million voices to cry to heaven for vengeance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law , or incapable of claiming justice , and , if justice be withheld , of engraving his appeal deep in the popular memory , that dooinsday.book of tyrants . Now , in bringing about this new order of things in the political world , Christianity ha* never gone forward to attack existing institutions . It has , on the other hand , acquiesced in such forms of outward organization as had been bequeathed by former generations or created by circumstances ; hut has infused into them its own spirit of freedom and humanity . It has said alike to rulers and subjects , " All ye are brethren . " It has reminded the great men of the earth of the power of one yet greater , to whom they are to give account for their exercise of authority . It has planted in the bosom alike of noble and of peasant a consciousness of native freedom , an independence of thought and feeling , to which kings must needs bow , and nobles can not refuse their homage . It has made prominent , and keeps perpetually before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their common parentage and their common destiny , on which the whole fabric of equal rights rests . Its work is , indeed , as yet but imperfectly done ; // and the fanatical apostles of liberty imagine that it could be far more promptly and effectually wrought by outcry , forcible resistance , violence , and blood . Outward forms of government may , indeed , be overturned in a day by blind , brute force ; yet the same force may the next day reinstate them . But the cycles of man 's moral progress , though they embrace ages in their circuit , return not upon themselves again , so that the ground once won for humanity is never lost . We are mining a rich and favorite vein ; but we must forbear . XVe close our remarks on the subject of this admirable lecture by a brief extract , which condenses in a few situpie paragraphs what we conceive to be the true theory of social progress . " Let the Gospel , in its genuine energy , pervade a community , and each ancient abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , to be questioned and rebuked , and will at length yield to this sovereign influence . We confide too little in the heavenly efficacy of Christian principles , when we labor to effect reformations on the lower ground of utility , or of a temporizing expediency . " And yet even when argued on these lower grounds , the purity of the Christian ethics seldom fails to win a triumph . Some old injustice , some immemorial wrong , which has worked as a canker within the social system , is at length brought under notice . This interference of " busy zeal " is at first hotly resented . The originators of the protest look again to the grounds of their objection , and strengthen their argument . The reasons they advance compel attention , and are examined , and then the entire code of Christian ethics , as applicable to the evil in question , is brought to bear upon it . The result , whether it be more or less definite , and even if the first protest be overruled , is to raise the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the rule of morals into closer contact with the consciences of all who are sincere in their Christian profession . The Gospel of Christ has thus won another triumph , in preparation for that which shall be universal ; and to the eye of an intelligent observer these successive evolutions of Christian morality are clearly predictive of such a triumph . " If Christianity be yet upheld in its purity , and if it be permitted to work its way forward , a time must come , when the acceleration of its progress shall attract all eyes , and shall begin to date its periodic advances , not by centuries , but by years ; or even by months and days . The world is governed less by the direct influence of known and fixed truths , than by variable // feeling , reverberated from all sides ; just as the temperature of the atmosphere is maintained , not by the full sunshine , but by the radiation of heat from all surfaces on earth . Men individually - or at least those who are open to moral influence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual acquaintance with what is right , but that diffused sense of right which a few , who intensely feel it , have shed around them . " Thus it is that every powerful impulse communicated to the social mass by energetic minds reproduces itself , until even the few almost lose their distinction of feeling more than others , and of thinking more justly ; because they have brought the many to think and feel with them . " - pp. 122- 124 . The last lecture is on " Spiritual Christianity , the Hope of the World at the present Moment . " It claims to be thus regarded , inasmuch as it attaches infinite value to the individtml soul , and embraces within its charity every human being , however vicious or degraded , regarding each as cap able of redemption and an invited heir of immortality . Then , too , as a system of unbounded mercy , it infuses its own loving , philanthropic spirit into the heart of every true disciple , making him earnestly solicitous to relieve every form of physical or moral destitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies , to the well-being and happiness of his fellow-men . It also includes , as an essential element , " a law of diffusion ; and we must , in this instance , use the word law in both its customary senses , as intending a statute , or sanctioned command ; and an impulse , or force , or established mode of action ; as when we speak of the laws of nature . " The spirituality of the Christian religion , too , makes it a constant force , independent of , and superior to , every established institution , even its own , which it may outgrow and survive , taking to itself new forms of organization , and polity , to suit the temper or meet the demands of each successive age . And finally , " spiritual Christianity offers a ground of cordial combination , for all purposes of religious benevolence , among its true adherents . " So far as the discussion of these points is concerned , we entirely coincide with our author in his whole course of argument and illustration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thus rendered to the cause of our common faith . We are not prepared , however , to be wafted along with him in an under-current of national self-glorification , which pervades the lecture , and of which the following may be taken as a specimen . // " We turn to the altogether peculiar position which we , the people of England , at this passing moment occupy , in relation to the human family . Has not the part of an Elder Brother of this great family actually fallen upon the English race ? and have not the solicitudes of such a relationship actually become ours ? Are we not by many interests , and by motives higher than any interests , compelled , in some measure , nay , to a great extent , to think for all , to care for all , to defend the weak , to forefend the strong ; and is there not now pervading the people of this country , even as a temper which has become characteristically British , a kindly sympathy in what affects the welfare of each race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , as has never belonged to any other people , in any age ? If many partake not at all of any such feeling , they are fewer than those who are alive to it in a good degree . " With all the paths of the world now mapped before us , and with means of communication , which , for practical ends , condense the population of the earth , as if the thousand millions were crowded upon a ball of one third the diameter ; and with actual colonial possession of a large portion of the earth , and with moral possession , by high character and repute , of almost the whole of it ; and with all these uncalculated and untried means of influence now ripened , and presented afresh to our hands , who is it that can altogether control those mingling emotions of patriotism and of expansive benevolence , which become us , occupying as we do a position , whence we may go forth to conquer the world , not for ambition , not for wealth ; but for Truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , and as we do , in so great a measure , entertain the feelings proper to it ; so is there a reciprocity of feeling widely diffused among the nations . British political influence or national supremacy apart , the British feeling , - its honor , its justice , and its humanity , are in fact understood in the remotest regions , and are trusted to by tribes whose names we have not yet learned to pronounce . The several designations by which English benevolence , in its various forms , styles itself , have , as watch-words of hope , traversed the ocean , and have pervaded wildernesses ; and these titles of our organized philanthropy have already wakened the dull ear of halfcivilized continents , and are reverberated from the hill-sides of the remotest barbarism . " It is true that England is looked to , as the helper , guardian , guide , of the nations . And assuredly it is the CHRISTIANITY of England which gives depth , substance , life , to her repute through the world , as the lover of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 159 , 160. // How far British honor , justice , and humanity may be " trusted to by tribes whose names we have not yet learned to pronounce , " we are unable to say ; but we doubt whether any strong confidence can be reposed in them in China or Affghanistan . Nay , there are certain tax-ground , overworked , down-trodden , even unfranchised , portions of the population of the British islands , to whom the application of such terms to the collective character of the nation must seem bitter irony . The England of our author is a certain ideal of the loyal and patriotic recluse , which a moderate conversance with newspapers , parliamentary enactments , and orders in council , could hardly fail to dissipate . Christianity is , we believe , the hope of the world ; but seeing the overmastering lust of power and territory , which marks ( and with so many deep furrows of moral ignominy ) every portion of the Anglo-Saxon race , we dare not identify either the mother country or our own with that pure and gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless the nations of the earth , and raise suffering and degraded man , all the world , over , to the liberty , purity , and dignity of a child of God and an heir of heaven . But it is not for our boastful nation to rebuke in terms of severe censure this honest national pride , however ungrounded . We wilJ therefore close our article by commending the work before us to the serious regard of the friends of religion and humanity , and by applying the leading thought of this closing lecture to two separate topics , both of vast moment ; the one involving the most sacred rights of the present and all coming generations , the other having reference to questions often anxiously mooted by the timid and distrustful . We would speak of Christianity as the sole hope of the world , as regards the permanence and progress of free political institutions . The unbeliever , though he profess republican principles , is just such a friend to republican institutions as Samson was to the congregated nobles of Philistia . His hands are upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in efforts to rend them from their base . Unless mankind be traced from a common father and to a common home , outward , adventitious distinctions become intrinsic and essential , and lay a fair and just foundation for the encroachments and extortions of the richer and stronger , and for the abject , brute-like submission of the poorer and // weaker . In that case , might becomes right , and selfishness law ; society has no bond , and imposes no mutual obligations ; and the whole community naturally and necessarily divides itself into the two great classes of the preying and the preyed upon . If the infidel 's creed be true , there is then no foundation on which a republic can be built . So France found by sad experiment ; for never , since the world was , were human rights so outrageously violated , liberty so utterly subverted , man so trampled upon by man , as in the French republic under the auspices of atheism . Those God-defying , self-styled democrats , Danton , Marat , Robespierre , and their colleagues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier times , that , placed at their side in judgment , the most relentless despots of the old world might appear with clean hands and honest and generous hearts . And thus was France tossed in the whirlpool of democratic tyranny , till she deemed herself only too happy to exchange her hydra-headed despot for the sole caprice and unbounded power of a single tyrant . Nor was it till she had recalled her priests , rebuilt her altars , and reestablished in the general mind a reverence for the objects of religious faith , that she could obtain from a righteous Providence the tempering of autocratic sway by popular representation and constitutional liberty . We would , finally , speak of Christianity as the sole hope of the world in respect to the permanence of modern civilization . It is certain that Egypt , Persia , Greece , and Rome successively attained a very elevated standard of civilization and refinement , but were subsequently overswept by ignorance and barbarism , and left mighty and significant ruins as the only relics of their days of renown . What assurance have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization of our own times , and that the countries , now the seat of science , art , and literature , may not again be given over to darkness and desolation ? Our assurance that this will not be the case is derived from the importance which Christianity attaches to the individual man , - from its extension of equal spiritual rights , privileges , and hopes to all of every class and condition . When a crafty old Roman wished to indicate to the treacherous magistrate of a rival city the best mode of destroying that city , he walked in his garden by a bed of poppies , and struck off the heads of the // tallest with his cane ; thus intimating , that , could a few of the chief citizens he destroyed , the fall of the city would be placed beyond a doubt . This anecdote illustrates the great point of distinction between ancient and modern civilization . Ancient civilization did not penetrate the mass of the community . It descended not to the cottage , farm , or workshop ; but was confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , and the galleries of taste . It shone only on the tallest heads . These , of course , were at once lopped off or hopelessly humbled , in a civil revolution or barbarian inroad and the civilization , of which they had been the sole representatives , passed away with them . The populace left behind , having never participated in it , could not of course perpetuate it . But modern , Christian civilization is individual in its character . It leavens the whole mass . It permeates every vein and artery of the body politic . It descends through every ramification of the social system . it dwells no less in the cottage than in the palace , no less in the workshop than in the drawing-room . It has for its defence , in every nation , not a chosen host , " fit champions , though few , " hut a grand national guard , a general militia , in which every name is enrolled , and every poor cottager and daylaborer bears arms for his fireside , his country , and his God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exterminating the races of Christendom , or blotting out the light of Christianity . Its star of hope and promise is the still culminating star of Bethlehem.
