txt RESPECTING a book so original as this , and written with so much power of imagination , it is natural that there should be many opinions . Indeed , its power is so predominant that it is not easy after a hasty reading to analyze one 's impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence . We have been taken and carried through a new region , a melancholy waste , with here and there patches of beauty ; have been brought in contact with fierce passions , with ext#emes of love and hae , and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand . This has not been accomplished with ease , but with an ill-mannered contempt for the decencies of language , and in a style which might resemble that of a Yorkshire farmer who should have endeavored to eradicate his provincialism by taking lessons of a London footman . We have had many sad bruises and tumbles in our journey , yet it was interesting , and at length we are safely arrived at a happy conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the incidents passed through , is one of uneasiness and gloom ; even the air of summer , so reviving to city dwellers , does not dispel it . To write or think about the tale , without being conscious of a phase of sadness , is impossible ; which mood of the mind , if it appear to the reader , let him not attribute to an over susceptibility , unless he has read the book with no such impression himself . We shall take for granted that a novel which has excited so unusual an attention , has been or will soon be in the hands of most of our readers of light literature , and shall therefore write rather from than upon it . We will not attempt an outline of the story ; it is so void of events that an outline would be of small assistance to any who have not read it , and would only be tedious to those who have . It is a history of two families during two generations , and all transpires under their two roofs . The genealogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader 's recollection we give it in a note.t If we did not know that this book has Wuthering Heights . A Novel . By the Author of " Jane Eyre .

We are so far pedantic as to agree with John Kemble in thinking that " oblige " is more becoming to royal mouths than " obleege . " With ladies who should be habituated to the use of forms of speech like those which occur in every page of this book , we can see how a gentleman should altogether fail in any attempt at love-making , though he might be able to hold discourse with a western boatman in his own dialect , and be so well accustomed to the language of bar-rooms and steamboat saloons , that he could hear the eyes and souls of those around him " condemned , " to use the words of Mrs. Isabella Heathcliff , " to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions , " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies that in the process of love-making , one of the surest tests by which they can distinguish a gentleman and man of sincerity , is in his style of speaking . He will not be very fluent - at least not without some encouragement - some betrayal to him of a consciousness that he is attentive , and that his attentions are not wholly displeasing ; but the little he does say will be in the selectest words . If he is allowed to entertain a reasonable expectation , he will grow eloquent in private , and perhaps his idol will hear the most poetic expressions leaping from his lips unconsciously . The secret opinion which such a man entertains of his mistress is , that she is all that is pure and lovely ; and his great wish is to be worthy of her goodness , and to protect her from all the roughness and badness of the common world . Now , we may suppose a case where a young lady appreciates this feeling on the part of her admirer , looks up to him with a correspondent lofty opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she has read Wuthering Heights , let her be extremely careful not to let its style affect her conversation . A little bad grammar even , is not so sure a quencher of the rising flame , as slang expressions or brutal unrefinement . There is a certain decorum in language as well as in manners or modes . We may express the deepest thoughts , the most ardent passions , the strongest emotions , without in the least offending propriety . We are not called upon to affect surliness or bluntness of speech ; and where a whole book is in this style , whatever may be its merits , this is a simple obvious defect , the first to impress itself upon the reader , and *bfrii6 means the least serious . Suppose this book were not written with so much power and suhtlety , and with so large an infusion of genuine truth and beauty , the judgment of the public would at once condemn it on account of its coarseness of style . It would then be seen how much of the coarseness was affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book , which render us almost insensible , while we are reading it , to a language which , to say the least , was never that of well-bred ladies and gentlemen , to excuse this language-even considering the coarseness wholly unaffected and unavoidable-a part of the substance of the writer 's very self ? We think not . The book is original ; it is powerful ; full of suggestiveness . But still it is coarse . The narrative talks on in a way that if an attempt to imitate it be ever made in a parlor , the experimenter should be speedily ejected . It ought to be banished from refined society , because it does not converse in a proper manner . Setting aside the profanity , which if a writer introduces into a book , he offends against both politeness and good morals , there is such a general roughness and savageness in the soliloquies and dialogues here given as never should be found in a work of art . The whole tone of the style of the book smacks of lowness . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gentlemen , and was not afraid , indeed , Mther gloried , in showing it .

Not because he is worse than we are in the sight of Heaven , but because we have been educated differently , we should prefer our landlady not to ask him to tea . 1848. 573 // Society naturally crystallizes into classes . " A man is known by the company he keeps ; " and " birds of a feather flock together . " There is a necessity for manners ; and evil communications corrupt good ones . The difference between the polite and impolite is , that the polite manifest themselves to each other in words , looks and motions of grace and considerateness , whereas the impolite let the natural creature go uncared for .

The author of Wuthering Heights is both . His rudeness is chiefly real but partly assumed . We will give a few examples . The following is put into the mouth of a young boy telling how his playmatc was bitten by a bull-dog " The devil had seized her ankle , Nelly ; I heard his abominable snorting . She did not yell out-no ! She would have scorned to do it , if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow . I did , though ; Ivocfferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom ; and 1 got a stone and thrust it between his jaws , and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat . " Afterwards he tells how she was taken care of in the parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one corner , and I resumed my station as spy , because , if Catherine had wished to return , I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million fragments , unless they let her out . " She sat on the sofa quietly , Mrs. Linton took off the gray cloak of the dairy maid which we had borrowed for our excursion-shaking her head , and expostulating with her , I suppose ; she was a young lady , and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine . Then the woman servant brought a basin of warm water , and washed her feet , and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus , and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap , and Edgar stood gaping at a distance . Afterward , they dried and combed her beautiful hah* and gave her a pair of enormous slippers , and wheeled her to the fire ; and I left her , as merry as she could be , dividing her food between the little dog . and Skulker , whose nose she pinched as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant blue eyes of the Lintons-a dim reflection from her own enchanting face-I saw they were full of stupid admiration ; she is so immeasurably superior to them  --  to everybody on earth ; is she not , Nelly ? " He has previously thus described the parlor " The light came from thence ; they had not put up the shutters , and the curtains were only half closed . Both of us were able to look in , by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge , and we saw-ah ! it was beautifula splendid place carpeted with crimson , and crimson-covered chairs and tables , and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold , a shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the center , and shimmering with little soft tapers . " These are examples of simple vulgarity , or want of a refined perception . Their occurring in a work written with so much strength , that in reading hastily , one hardly notices them ( and thousands such ) as blemishes , does not redeem them . In another place the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates , must have been written by a little imperfectly educated girl in the very year of the Declaration of American Independence " An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine , and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics . " An awful Sunday ! ' commenced the paragraph beneath . I wish my father were back again . Hindley is a detestable substitute-his conduct to Heathcliff is atrocious -- H. and I are going to rebel-we took our initiatory step this evening. * * All these instances may be observed to be not only vulgar , but vulgar in a peculiar way . They savor , to use a word which is the only one in the language that will express the thing , of snobbishness . Snobbishness is a development of human nature that manifests itself in various shapes ; but it everywhere is one in essence , and bears the saiiie relation to gentlemanliness , that Brummagem does to real plate . Thus we have , without a tariff , as genuine native snobs in this country as any of foreign growth ; probably there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English snob may be traced a certaixi , peculiar , easy fluency 574 June , // of expression , which has its counterpart also in the American . This peculiarity seems to be founded in a desire to assimilate the language of strong emotion to that of mercantile correspondence , and manifests itself in an eloquence which resembles that of business circulars . But as business correspondence is intended to conceal emotion , it forms a poor model for style , and hence it is particularly the duty of critics to be on the alert to detect its presence and expose it . The words and parts of sentences italicized in the above extracts , have a tang of Mantalini and Chawls Yellowplush . In reading the paragraph describing how Catherine was taken care of by the Lintons , one recognizes somewhat of the tone of another eloquent personage " Undoubtedly , ' says Cousin Feenix . In point of fact , it 's quite a self-evident sort of thing . I am extremely anxious , Major , that friend Dombey should hear me express my very great astonishment and regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed of every qualification to make a man happy , should have so far forgotten whatwasdue to-in point of fact , to the world-as to commit herself in such a very extraordinary manner . I have been in a devilish state of depression ever since ; and said indeed to Long Saxby last night-man of six foot ten , with whom my friend Dombey is probably acquainted -- that it had upset me in a confounded way , and made me bilious . It induces a man to reflect , this kind of fatal catastrophe , ' says Cousin Feenix , that events do occur in quite a Providential manner ; for if my Aunt had been living at the time , I think the effect upon a devilish lively woman like herself , would have been prostration , and that she would have fallen , in point of fact , a victim . ' " But the taint of vulgarity with our author extends deeper than mere snobbishness ; he is rude , because he prefers to be so . In the outset he represents himself as a misanthropist , and confesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologist to explain : - " The walk in ' was uttered with closed teeth , and expressed the sentiment , Go to the Deuce ! ' Even the gate over which he leaned manifested no sympathizing movement to the words ; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation : I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself . " " Exaggeratedly reserved " - another Jeamesism . " While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast , I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature , a real goddess , in my eyes , as long as she took no notice of me . I never told my love ' vocally ; still , it looks have language , the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears ; she understood me , at last , and looked a returnthe sweetest of all imaginable looks  --  and what did I do ? I confess it with shame-shrunk icily , into myself , like a snail , at every glance retired colder and farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doubt her own senses , and , overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake , persuaded her mamma to decamp . " This is a phase of human nature which we had rather not understand . If it ever was real with any living man , he was a very bad-hearted one , and a conceited . More likely the real truth with one who would write himself so affected a personage , was just the reverse-that some gay girl , seeing in him a person on agreeable terms with himself , experimented on him for her diversion , till she made him " deucedly miserable . " tlIIt is evident that the author has suffered , not disappointment in love , but some great mortifi&amp;ation of pride . Possibly his position in society has given him manners that have prevented him from associating with those among whom he feels he has intellect enough to be classed , and he is thus in reality the misanthropist he claims to be ) Very likely he may be a young person who has spent his life , until within a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only by some such supposition that his *peculiarities of style and thought can be accounted for . He is one who is evidently unfamiliar with , and careless of acquiring , the habits of refined society . We regret the necessity of proving his intentional and affected coarseness by examples . In the first place , several of the characters swear worse than ever the troops did in Flanders . Now , setting out of the question the morality or immorality of this practice , it is , as we have already observed , an offence against politeness ; not such a great one , however , but it is esteemed venial when used effectively by military or naval gentlemen , who have seen some service . It is not permitted to 1848. 575 // civilians in general society , though a little Mantalini " demmit , " escaping between the teeth in the heat of an argument , is readily overlooked . But common , rough swearing is a worse breach of decorum than disregarding the conveniences for tobacco saliva . And how much more in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deliberate ; he corrects his proofs at leisure . If a writer , therefore , permits his characters to swear , and that grossly , ( not like gentlemen , ) he does it knowingly ; he is aware that it is not customary or mannerly , and every time he does it , he is , therefore , *en rude But the writer 's disposition to be coarse is , perhaps , still more clearly shown by examples like the following : - " I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also . He stood by the fire , his back toward me , just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah , who ever and anon interrupted her labor to pluck up the corner of her apron , and heave an indignant groan . " And you , you worthless - he broke out as I entered , turning to his daughter-in-law , and employing an epithet as harmless as duck , or sheep , but generally represented by a dash . " Had the writer been simply , unconsciously coarse , he would , in this instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without adverting to the harmlessness of the word . But by alluding to its harmlessness , he at once uses it , and offers a defence of it . This as plainly evinces a conscious determination to write coarsely , as if he had quoted and defended a passage from Rabelais . He knew the word to be a low word , though not an immodest one , and he determined to show his bold independence by using and defending it . He was anxious to extend the resources of the English language . This and hundreds of other sentences show that he has got the maggot in his brain , that low words are the strongest , and low manners the most natural . He desired to write a book with " no nonsense about it , " and he has , therefore , been led into the affecting boorishness . Many persons , we dare say , especially among the young who have read the book merely as a story , and because it excited them , have been so carried away by its power as hardly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will take isolated paragraphs from any chapter , they will perceive them at once . Fancy two ladies sitting in a splendid parlor and interchanging their sentiments in the following brilliant dialogue : - " How can you say I am harsh , you naughty fondling ? ' cried the mistress , amazed at the unreasonable assertion . You are surely losing your reason . When have I been harsh , tell me ? ' " Yesterday , ' sobbed Isabella , and now ! ' " Yesterday ! ' said her sister-in-law . On what occasion ? ' " In our walk along the moor ; you told me to ramble where I pleased , while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathclifl ' . ' " And that 's your notion of harshness ? ' said Catherine , laughing . It was no hint that your company was superfluous ; we did n't care whether you kept with us or not ; I merely thought Heathcliff 's talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears . ' " Oh , no , ' wept the young lady , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Is she sane ? ' asked Mrs. Linton , appealing tome . I 'll repeat our conversation word for word , Isabella , and you point out any charm it could have had for you . ' " I do n't mind the conversation , ' she answered : I wanted to be with ' - " Well ! ' said Catherine , perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence . " With him ; and I wo n't be always sent off ! ' she continued , kindling up . You are a dog in the manger , Cathy , and desire no one to be loved but yourself ! ' " You are an impertinent little monkey ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Linton , in surprise , " &amp;c . This is the talk of two scolds . We surely need caution no lady reader of Wuthering Heights , against adopting such an use of language as is here put into the mouths of two of their sex . Doubtless there are quarrels , and poutings , and occasions among boarding-school misses , where they let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella ; but it is inconsistent with our notion of the delicacy and self4espect of a lady , to suppose she could listen to , much less utter such expressions . This we say because hundreds and hundreds of girls , whose papas take this Review , have read the last new novel , ( cried over it perhaps , ) and may possibly see these pages . They ought to be strongly cautioned against this wretched mode of speaking . They are the formers and judges of our manners , and if they allow such writings as this to ihflu 576 June , // ence their taste , our social assemblies will shortly exhibit such scenes as bave gained for Tammany Hall its peculiar notoriety . Mr. Tin Hunter will soon venture not to call on Miss Argent of a morning , without examining the caps on his revolver ; the fashionable dress for the opera will require the handle of a bowie knife to protrude from above the coat collar ; Count Barbarini will promenade Broadway with a double barrelled rifle , and the Rev. Dr. will confer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a French cuirassier . The influence which this book can not but have upon manners , must be bad . For the coarseness extends farther than the mere style ; it extends all through ; and the crude style and rude expressions are too much in keeping with the necessary situations . It deals constantly in ex*ggerated extremes of passion . From the beginning to the end , there is hardly a scene which does not place the actors in the most agonizing or antagonizing predicament possible . Let the reader run over the principal events of the story in his mind , and consider what a series of scenes it would make , if dramatized and placed upon the stage . Mr. Lockwood visits Mr. Heathcliff , and is attacked by sheep dogs in his parlor . He visits him again and is caught in the snow ; the dogs fly at him , his nose bleeds , Zillah pours a pint of ice water down his back and puts him to bed in a haunted chamber , where he has a terrible dream . Mrs. Dean then begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light between Heathcliff and Hindley . Then Mr. Earnshaw dies in his chair . Heathcliff and Cathy run away to the grange , and be is degraded for it . They lead a dreadful life with Hindley , who becomes a drunkard . Edgar Linton visits Catherine and falls in love ; she , after nearly knocking him over with a blow on the face , accepts him . But we will not continue the catalogue of scenes of the most disgusting violence , of which the remainder of the book is almost wholly made up . Catherine 's election of Linton and her reasons for it , as it is the main incident of the story , may be most properly taken to examine the naturalness of the passion . She at last makes a confidant of Nelly " Nelly , I see now , you think me a selfish wretch , but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married we should be beggars ? whereas , if I married Linton , I can aid Heathcliff to rise , and place him out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Catherine ? ' I asked . You 'll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon ; and , though I 'm hardly a judge , I think that 's the worst motive you 've given yet for being the wife of young *Linton . ' " It is not , ' retorted she , it is the best ! The others were the satisfaction of my whims ; and for Edgar 's sake , too , to satisfy him . This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar and myself . I can not express it ; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is , or should be , an existence of yours beyond you . What were the use of my creation , if I were entirely contained here ? My great miseries in this world have been Heathclifl " s miseries , and I watched and felt each from the beginning ; my great thought in living is himself . If all else perished , and he remained , I should still continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he were annihilated , the universe would turn to a mighty stranger . I should not seem a part of it . My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods : time will change it , I 'm well aware , as winter changes the trees . My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath : a source of little visible delight , but necessary . Nelly , I am Heatheliff-he 's always in my mind-not as a pleasure , any more than I am always a pleasure to myself  --  but as my own being ; so do n't talk of our separation againit is impracticable ; and- ' " She paused , and hid her face in the folds of my gown ; but I jerked it forcibly away . I was out of patience with her folly . " If I can make any sense of your nonsense , miss , ' I said , it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying , or else that you are a wicked , unprincipled girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heathcliff the same night ; if he bad not run away just at that juncture , and left her to a long brain fever , and finally to a marriage with Linton ; if they could have met but an instant , the reader is made to feel that all would be well . What she here utters was but the passing fancy of an extremely capricious , ungoverned girl ; her better reason , could it have availed in time , might have brought her to her senses . And so we are wrought upon to love her to the last . But is this natural passion ? Would the most imperious , impetuous and wayward young lady that can be imagined , ever 1848. 577 // have reasoned with herself , situated as she was , in the manner here represented ? So far as men may judge of female character , by considering it a reflection and counterpart of their own , this certainly is false and unnatural . Let any of our young gentlemen readers look fairly and honestly into their own hearts and ask themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position with regard to two of what Hook calls the " opposing sex , " that they could argue the question in their minds in this manner : " Here is one young lady whom I love as I do my own soul ; I can not live without her ; nothing on earth shall separate us . But at the same time I can not marry her , because we should be poor ; I will , therefore , take this other rich one , who likes me well enough , in order that it may be better in a pecuniary point of view ' for my real love ! " We do not ask if any young man would act on such grounds , but only if he can fancy a state of mind , in which he could for an instant seriously propose to himself to act thus . If there be any who can , he does not and can not know , what true manly affection for a woman is : he may marry , and continue his species on the face of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never have understood the love that Shakspeare could paint ; Juliet and Desdemona will have died in vain for him . For the affection that our best English poets have sung , requires the soul to be so constituted as to be disgusted with the very idea of marriage with another , while it has an affection for one . We do not understand , thank Heaven , this gregarious love , that favors Julia with fear and Susan in pride . However it may be in Paris , in England , and , we hope , in the dominions of President Polk , our young gentlemen have not yet arrived at that pitch of refinement , where they can turn away from the flame that burns brightly on the altar of one propitious divinity , and sacrifice themselves upon the cold shrine of another . Nor will we be so uncharitable as to believe that our Anglo-Saxon damsels are yet so sophisticated as to require or admit more than one true love at a time ; or that there are many among them , who , of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich man in order to benefit a poor sweetheart . If it be so , it were well that our professional t*n4 literary young men , who are compelled to a life of celibacy , should be permitted to know a truth which would enable them to bear their enforced condition with perfect resignation . We admit the facts are often seemingly against us . Fathers and mothers , with the aid of the family " Great Medicineman , " viz. , the priest , can often break down their daughters ' wills , and sell or dispose of their domestic produce , according to the quality of the article and the state of the market ; but the will , in such instances , is very apt to prove troublesome to the purchaser , and sometimes ends in a home consumption . These examples do not , therefore , affect the general truth . But it will be urged , and the author , with a great deal of tact , endeavors to make it so appear , that poor Cathy was unconscious of the nature of her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they had played together all their lives ; a kind of sisterly feeling for him was all that she was actually conscious of . This is more unnatural than the other . We can more easily fancy a girl marrying a man who merely pleases her , in order to benefit one whom she loves , than that being of a marriageable age , she should not know the nature of her feelings towards one man while on the point of uniting herself in wedlock with another . Can we suppose such a state of things as a young lady actually about to marry one man , resolving upon it , and all the while her sentiments in such divorcement from her passion , that she is innocently unconscious which of the two she would rather be forever joined with , in the chaste and holy bond of wedded love , that " Mysterious law , true source Of human offspring , sole propriety In Paradise of all things common else ? " This would be a condition of existence not admitting the virtue of chastity . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assuming , that it is time it should be said in the name of at least one half of the generation , upon whom has devolved the mighty task of peopling this vast continent , we hope that it never existed , or if it did , the subject was in a diseased condition . No writer has given us 578 June , // more exquisite pictures of female delicacy and purity than Godwin , yet his Henrietta regards her Clifford with no such passionless iciness . Indeed , were such damsels possible , we see not why there should ever be any more denouements to love tales ; all would be accomplished when the parties were brought within speaking distance of each other . And the course of love would run as smooth as the Dead Sea ; each lover might say in the words of Marvell " I would Love you ten years before the flood ; And you should , if you please , refuse Till the conversion of the Jews . My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires and more slow . " The physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on arriving at an age proper for marriage , do not allow of the ignorance which our author requires us to suppose in his heroine , not only in this place , but especially after Heathcliff s absence and return , when she is the wife of Linton and about to become a mother . We desire to put it to the common sense of discriminating readers , whether this is not a radical error in the delineai*ion of these ideal characters . Are they real beings , or impossible combinations of qualities ? Could Mrs. Linton , after Heathcliff 's return , desire his pre&amp;ence Without being conscious that her feelings towards him were such as his presence would only render snore intolerable , unless , as the author leaves us no room to suppose , she meant to be untrue to her husband ? We think that when any one considers the matter , he will find in what we have said above , a very plain explanation of what has been talked of as a puzzling character . Making all allowance for the influence of education , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in the early growth of affection teaches love to hide itself and affect indifference ; there is in these characters an absence of all that natural desire which should accompany love . They are abstract and bodiless . Their love is feline ; it is tigerish . Yet the work is carried on with such power that it excites a sense of shame to turn back to many of its most " thrilling " scenes , and reflect that we were able to read them with so little disgust . How horribly overwrought is the passage where Heathcliff finally embraces the dying Catherine " In her eagerness , she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair . At that earnest appeal , he turned to her , looking absolutely desperate . His eyes wide , and wet at last , flashed fiercely on her ; his breath heaved convulsively . An instant they held asunder ; and then how they met I hardly saw , but Catherine made a spring , and he caught her , and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my eyes , she seemed directly insensible . He flung himself into the nearest seat , and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted , he gnashed at me , and foamed like a mad dog , and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy . I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species ; it appeared that he would not understand , tho*gh I spoke to him ; so I stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity . " We will not inquire into the possibility or naturalness of Heatholiff 's treatment of his son . That there are fathers , however , in the real world who are capable of murdering their children to gratify their selfish passions , there can be no shadow of doubt . The explanation already given of the character of Catherine will apply in a more general form to all  --  to the whole design and scope of the story . The characters are drawn with dramatic force and made to seem alive , yet when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they vanish ; and we see that we have been cheated with illusory semblances . The children know too much about their minds and too little about their bodies ; they understand at a very early age all the intellectual and sentimental part of love , but the " bloom of young desire " does not warm their cheeks . The grown-up characters are the mere tools of fixed passions . Their actions and sayings are like those of monomaniacs or persons who have breathed nitrous oxide . When they hate , they swear and fight and pull out each other 's hair . When they are grieved they drink themselves to madness . When they love-we have seen how they behave in the extract just given . Agony is heaped on agony , till the deficient mass topples down headlong . The fancy gives out , and like a tired hound , rushes reeling to the conclusion . 1848. 579 // Yet with all this faultiness , Wuthering Heights is , undoubtedly , a work of many singular merits . In the first place it is not a novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conventionalities of life . It does not depict men and women guided merely by motives intellioible to simplest observers . It lifts the vei*and shows boldly the dark side of our depraved nature . It teaches how little the ends of life in the young are rough hewn by experience and benevolence in the old . It goes into the under-current of passion , and the rapid hold it has taken of the public shows how much truth there is hidden under its coarse extravagance . Very young persons are prone to fancy that the march of life , especially in our owa free country , is now , by the enlightenment of the age , all perfectly uniform and regular . But as soon as they fall fairly into the ranks , they begin to peiceive that there is still some hurly-burly and jostling , and that it requires resolution to keep from turning into characters resembling Heathcliffs . With a very limited experience , the proportion of honest men is seen to lessen . In a short time we begin to find that men with gray hairs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are plenty of such who will sell the very souls of their own offspring merely to keep up their dignity . Thei*e are plenty also who will treat boys and girls in the most overbearing manner , and then go into a great rage and persecute them inveterately on the least show of youthful anger . Boys often suppose that the old , especially those of some character and station , will regard them with kindness ; but they soon learn to make proper distinctions , and to cheat and flatter the right sort , thereby preparing themselves to be proceeded with in the same manner when their o*yn time comes . We soon find out , though it takes strong proof , that there is a large proportion among old as well as young who do actually regard nothing but money . And so it is with a th&amp;usand other truths which , in* early life , had only the force of rhetorical maxims ; they gradually , like the storms of the tropics , at first no bigger than a man 's hand , but rising and expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave us more and more in the gloom of despondence . The world has no confidence in the courage and strengh of youth . It gives no c*edit . It stands before the rising race like a bristling rampart . Let no young man fancy what lie might or could accomplish if circumstances were otherwise with him than they happen to be , if he had capital to start with , or if notl*ing ailed his heart . The weakest vagrant in the street can quiet his conscience with such apologies . Neither let any young man expect the fruition of any of his early hopes . They are all mere fictions of the fancy . He may change and change , and realize something resembling the dream ; but the apple of knowledge must be first eaten , and ever after there is a flaming sword turned every way before the original Eden . Or he may have pride enough to render him indomitable ; he gains nothing by it . Sooner or later he must succumb to wrong , or to disease , or age . But there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one may do this without being a misanthrope , without turning his back to the world , or treating it with discourtesy or indifference . A president of one of our colleges once said to a graduate at parting : - " My son , as this may be the last time I shall see you , and I shall never have another opportunity of dQing you any good , ( he had never improved any previous one during four years , ) I want to advise you : Never oppose public opinion . The great world will stave right on ! " WWether the graduate has ever opposed public opinion is of no consequence ; what we would particularly call attention to is the wisdom of the advice . Of course , if one is to go by public opinion , he must first ascertain , as well as he can , what public opinion is , and must then- cut out and fashion his individual opinion to conform thereto . This process must be the constant habit of his soul ; he must , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain what the very sacrifice renders it impossible that he should enjoy . The advice is so sound and may be of so much service , especially to the aspiring , among those whose occupations force them before the public , that it deserved to be printed . But at the same time , there is a certain class of well-meaning characters , who , we 580 June , // are well aware , can never act upon it . They will have their own way , or , if not , at least the way of no one else . They will think and speak for the truth , or what they deem such , as long as they can ; and the world may stave on as much as it pleases - it owes them nothing . They know very well what will be the result of the conflict ; they know that the world asks of every man to spread his soul and body on its terrible rack , and permits him no rest but in his grave . They know that life is accursed , that what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart , then the mind , beginning with its subtlest virtues , and at last the body . Notwithstanding this , these stubborn people are so invincibly obstinate , many of them , that they wilfully keep up a cheerful countenance , and persevere in being good-natured under all the whips and scorns of time . The mean gain victories over them , but the consciousness of their mehnness poisons the luxury of the triumph-  --  or if it does not , the vanquished do not mind . For they set great store upon animal comforts , and on the various sensual and sensible delights . They take a pride in a good digestion ; and lo ! when the crafty and envious think they have now overpowered them , they are making merry one with another , in a wholesome and proper manner . Their motto is , not " never say die ! " but , " never say die ! " or , as the Samoeid proverb has it , " Grinandbearit ! " It is to help such weakly constituted persons as these that Providence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , the sweets of contemplation , and the sure pleasures of literature and the arts . These are immortal and unchangeable . " A thing of beauty is a joy forever. ** But we need not dwell longer on these old and well-known truths . Our object in recalling them , has been simply to warn the young , whom these ideal personages of Wuthering Heights are now so strongly impressing , against the infection of unconsciously imitating them . Let no hopeless young gentleman persevere in a constancy like Heathcliff s , nor any forlorn wives in an attachment to others than their own bosom partners-if they can help it . If they must preserve their just revenges , let them endeavor to do it without injuring their bodily or mental health , calmly awaiting the proper opportunity to strike the blow . It were well also if they could keep their purposes profoundly secret ; for so they may forget them : " there is no grief , " says Sancho , " that time can not assuage . " Is there not , moreover , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this teaches us that we are not to undertake to right all wrongs , but to live them down , and leave their punishment to Heaven . The chivalry of youthful affection should yield before the eternal wisdom ; and , laying down the little things of today , we should nourish that greater revenge which has stomach for all eternitywhich is the love of right and hatred of wrong . Next to the merit of this novel as a work of thought and subtle insight , is its great power as a work of the imagination . In this respect it must take rank very high , if not among the highest . It is not flowingly written ; the author can hardly be an easy writer . Yet he has the power , with all his faults of style , of sometimes flashing a picture upon the eye , and the feeling with it , in a few sentences . The snow-storm which occurs in the second and third chapters of the first volume , is an example . But the effect of the description is often marred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " shimmering " in one of the extracts first quoted . The dialogue is also singularly effective and dramatic . The principal characters all talk alike ; yet they stand before us as definite as so many individuals . In this respect the book reminds us of the Five Nights of St. Albans . It is like that also somewhat , in the tone of the fancy ; the dream in the opening might have been conceived by the author of the Five Nights ; the effect is so like some of his own . Yet this novel has none of the loftiness of that splendid romance ; and whatever it may be as a work of genius and ability , is not worthy to be named with it as a work of art . That it is original all who have read it need not be told . It is very original . And this is the reason of its popularity . It comes upon a sated public a new sensation . Nothing like it has ever been written be . fore ; it is to be hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of good manners , nothing will be hereafter . Let it stand by itself , a coarse , original , powerful book ,  - -  one that does not give us true characters , but horridly striking and effective ones . It will live a short and brilliant life , and then die and be forgotten . For when the originality becomes ft*miliarized , there will not be truth enough left to sustain it . The public will not acknowledge its men and women to have the true immortal vitality . Poor Cathy 's ghost will not walk the earth forever ; and the insane Heathcliff will soon rest quietly in his coveted repose . We are not aware that anything has been written upon the rank that ought to be assigned to such works as Wuthering Heights in fictitious literature . In conversation we have heard it spoken of by some as next in merit to Shakspeare for depth of insight and dramatic power ; w*ille others have confessed themselves unable to get through it . But all agree that it affects them somewhat unpleasantly . It is written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained so admirably that it communicates this sickliness to the reader . It does in truth lay bare some of the secret springs of human action with wonderful clearness ; but still it dissects character as with a broad-axe-chops out some of the great passions , sets them together and makes us almost believe the combinations to be real men and women . It abounds in effective description , is very individual , and preserves the unity of its peculiar gloomy phase of mind from first to last . Yet the reader rises from its conclusion with the feeling of one passing from a sick chamber to a comfortable parlor , or going forth after a melancholy rain , into a dry , clear day . Now if the rank of a work of fiction is to depend solely on its naked imaginative power , then this is one of the greatest novels in the language . Not one of Walter Scott 's resembles it in assuming a peculiar and remote mood of feeling , and carrying it through two volumes in spite of the most staring faults and extravagances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an after-dinner conversation and tells a long story , full of chivalry , antiquarian lore , splendid scenes , characters true as far as they go , excellent sense , and thought , Which , if not deep , is free and manly . We rise from reading Ivanhoe younger than when we sat down . Even after his most tragic novel , the Bride of Lammermuir , the regret which we feel is not of that uneasy kind which the soul struggles to shake off ; we do not feel as if we had been reading a horrible murder in the Newgate Calendar . The characters are sublimed into the pure art-region ; the imaginative power is not exerted through an unfortunate individual experience , but it passes out through curious knowledge and plain legal thinking . Scott did not deign to entertain the public with his private griefs ; his ideal life had no connection with his actual one . He told his stories as stories , and kept himself so completely aloof from them that he wa* never known to be the author of them till circumstances forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more individual than he ; few men have passed away from the world in the last century who have left a plainer impression of themselves behind them . Only he is never designedly or consciously individual . We feel the force of his character in reading his novels ; the contact of his cheerful , resolute spirit , his true manly heart , quickens kindred qualities in the reader ; but it is not because the writer intends it , that they do . He is intent only on his tale ; he studies how to carry on his incidents , develop his characters , throw them into perple*dties and get them at last safely out of them . The world has long ago acknowledged his originality ; but it was by nursing no singularity that he was so . He meant only to tell his stories in a sensible , agreeable manner , such as should find him readers among gentlemen and ladies , and men of letters . Whenever he assumes a character , it is as unlike his own as he could make it . His originality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , which he no more controlled than he did the shape of his features . It seems that here should be made a distinction in all works of the imagination : whether the imaginative power be simply the confessing oneself to the world , or working under the sway of the will in a region entirely removed from the soul 's actual existence . One writer , stung by disappointment or mortified vanity , turns to the world and makes a face at it ; contorts 582 June , // his visage and unpacks his heart ; another , under similar troubles , takes advantage of the knowledge they have given him , and goes on as before , keeping himself to himself and working the harder-too proud to show a single tear . We do not inquire which of the twain makes the most judicious manifestation of himself , but which ought to take precedence as exhibiting a true healthy imaginative power ? Undoubtedly , though the first may exhibit the most vehemence of passion , the other is the greater artist . For the one who keeps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending them out to delight the world with their free flights , his soul dwells apart , like a star , in a serene heaven of contemplation . He weeps , if ever , in secret places , taken unawares by the bitterness of sorrow , but soon recovers his- serenity and labors to make the world more cheerful . Whereas the one who turns world-hater lives in the pity of other men ; he - sighs for sympathy , that always comes too late ; he can not use his powers except to relieve himself . He is like those passionate men who , when they suffer grief , play the tragedy hero to their friends-indeed , he is weaker than they ; for it is the duty of one 's friends to support him through his trials , and all of us have our failing points , but no one has a right to intrude his woes upon strangers . If we could look into the inner lives of the greatest attists , using that title in its largest sense , as comprehending all who address the world through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelists-it would then perchance be found that the guises under which they appeared through their works , have been in most cases the farthest possible from their real life-unless , indeed , as of many it might be truly affirmed , we consider their ideal life as more actual to them than their real , ina*much as it occupies the most of their attention . Outwardly , they may suffer sickness , poverty , yea , starvation ; with in , the rapt spirit holds high converse with the great ones of old , the living fancy bourgeons and plumes its wings , the active intellect toils like an iron engine . It is with such as if , while the body trailed on the dull earth , the soul expatiated in the golden regions above the sunset . In whatever fashion this power of throw VOL . I. NO . V. NEW SERIES . 36 ing aside the actual , and living two lives , develops itself , whethei* in poetry , lyric or dramatic , painting , music , novel writing , it will always be found to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its essence simply the power of being unindividual , and wherever the individual is mixed up with it , the observer does not fail to distinguish them by an intuitive perception . No man could , or should rather , plead for his life in the same way that he might make an ideal hero in a tragedy plead for his . The language of art is not that of real life . No living being ever conversed in Shakspearian dialogue . Yet no dialogue represents witty conversation better than the scenes with Falstaff . Though it affects the reader with the*fidelity of an actual report , yet when it is analyzed , it is seen at once to be quite another thing ; and besides , it is actually present . We might glance over all of the arts and select similar instances , but it is- not necessary for our purpose . There is a delightful class of artists , whose imagination , through ageident or habit , continually personates a single character . This is a development so much re -- sembling that of the misanthropist , that it requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the world an extremely ill-used person ; the humorist places himself in the shoes of some very agreeable one , as Isaac Bickerstaff , Robinson Crusoe , or Elia . Where this development is very peculiar and sustained till its originator almost takes on his imagined form of being , the world is very apt to charge him with being a self-worshipper . But it does not necessarily follow , because an artist manifests himself in that way , that he was an egotist . That is a matter to be decided on other grounds , by what his friends say of him* and by the course of his life . Supposing , which requires some confidence , the reader to be able to collect and unify these discursive remarks , we will recur to the previous question , as to what rank ought to be assigned to such works as Wuthering Heights . We have said , what all who have read it know , that it was original . Douglass Jerrold , in the newspaper advertisement , that , by one of those singular coincidences which make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // single instant , happened , as we wrote the last word , to stare us in the face , says , " We can promise our readers that they never read anything like it before , " - which is a4ding the opinion of one unsafe man to that of a good many honest people . A certain personal phase , not a pleasant one , is assumed and carried through it with great power . But this phase must have been conscious to the writer . He must have been designedly original . He must have set to his work with some such feeling towards the world , as he would probably think well expressed by the words , " There ! take that , and see how you like it ! " No truly great artist ever desired to place himself before the world in that attitude . The pride of genuine nobleness is more humble . It does not condescend to don the motley and please the general with fantastic tricks . In a word , that originality which is conscious to the writer , is not qenuinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that the author of Wuthering Heights has some unsound timbers in him ; the critical underwriters , to use a mercantile figure , can not insure him as A. No. 1 . He may make fortunate voyages hereafter , but the chances are against him . All that is really great and good in this book , might have been given in a l ? etter style , wahout its revolting pictures . Indeed , the writer might have been personal all peculiar , and melancholy even , if he had so pleased , provided his greatest solicitude had been to please the reader . As it is , admirable as is his power , he must be ranked not among the first writers of fiction . His book has the air rather of an exposi of his life-suffering , to use a Germanism , than a purely ideal composition . The world will not long be pleased with one who treats it with so much intentional rudeness ; it is an extremely sensitive crent*ure , and there are none it cuts the acquaintance of sooner than those who take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that they despise it . It seems when we have got through all that can be said of a writer 's style , thought , power , and all qualities appertaining to literary work , that in the end , the great test by which writers must be tried , is not Lheir excellence in particulars , but the esti mate which they allow us to make of their whole characters . A work of fiction is but the manifestation of its author 's self . In books , as well as in life , character is the great criterion . And we have a right , certainly in the case of an anonymous author , to express freely opinions resulting from a fair application of it . With all one 's disposition to fortify himself with reasons , in judging of a work of fiction , we inevitably come back to the first question , " How-does this affect us ? " All our candid examination of its merits only serves to analyze the impression with which we laid it down . For it is that alone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really operates upon the reader . He may be interested in the story , may see its faults and excellencies of style , may yield to its power , and still at the end he may feel a relief . TI ? ( ere may have been qualities of the author 's character , as shown through his pages , to which he does not take . He may be uneasily impressed by him : - just as when , in travelling , you sit down to the tavern dinner , and there comes a man with a thin mean nose , and plants himself at your side ; you speak of the day and the route ; all is very well , except the je ne sais quoi , which makes you glad when he takes himself away ; nothing was said beyond a few common sentences , and yet the man disgusts you . You have no particular dislike of him , yet you do not desire him to be by ; you feel that you could say to him with Dogb*rry , " I wish your worship well ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting may be wished , God prohibit it . " Just so the reader may be impressed after finishing a novel . We believe that the world requires of an author some evidence of moral health , as well as mental power . It must feel the gentleman in a writer ; the kind heart , the upright meaning , the , high-mindedness , from which a deep religious feeling is almost inseparable . It does not exact " the ponderousgravity of a didactic purpose ; it is sufficient if it can be secure that it is in the society of a man of decent manners , and honest and benevolent intentions . If we are legitimately impressed by Wuthering Heights , it will not in this respect answer so universally the requirements of the public as any of the novels of // Scott-because it does not bring us into contact with so agreeable a character . We instance Scott , here and above , for the reason that every reader ought to know and love him ; many other names among our best novelists would equally suffice for the comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , a man of courage and uprightness , a pleasant travelling companion ; it is , in fact , a certain remedy for nervous depression to run through one of his familiar stories-improving to bodily health as well as conducive to mental serenity . The effect of his letters is yet more invigorating . He seems to have lived , with all his troubles , in a region of perpetual sunrise , and , as we read him , there breathes upon us the air of morning . The author of Wuthering Heights is not so happily compounded . He has a peculiar obtrusive conceit about him which makes one nervous lest he commit some new gaucherie . So many of his fine passages ar&amp;marred by affectation that there is an uncomfortable struggle in* the mind whether to yield a too easy confidence , or be altogether disgusted . Yet the strength of his will prevails ; though we would , we can not shake him off . He is like a friend who continually annoys you with a want of tact , which is so obvious you are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this friend , for example , down Broadway , he will be suddenly smitten with the beauty of some child , and will stop and enter into conversation with it , utterly regardless of the natural astonishment of its mamma ; thus forcing you to blush for him and drag him away . If you walk with him in the fields , on Staten Island , or elsewhere , he will find some huge ferrapin , or boaconstrictor , and insist on bringing it home on his arm , leaving you exposed to the jeers of the populace , while he marches on sublimely insensible . He does not remember the prices of the commonest articles of purchase . But most of all he makes himself disagreeable in a book-store ; he appears to consider the clerks who officiate there to be so many Admirable Crichtons , and opens his recondite reading to them , while they stare at you grinningly , as who should say , " Art thou also green as he is ? " Moreover , this friend to whom the author of Wuthering4leights must be likened is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you their characters and finds out motives for them which they never dreamed of . He fancies he understands them perfectly , all the while you are quite sure he is mistaken . In his intercourse with them he sets out with a firm belief in his own infallibility , and makes all after developments conform to that hypothesis . The consequence is , he has *et with some rebuffs that have soured his temper and thrown a shadow over him ; yet he has lost none of his original faith in himself . Why he should have been so unsuccessful is a mystery , for his figure was well enough , and his conversatiop , though by no means that of one accustomed to the best society , was yet fresh and fascinating , But he looks upon women as a refinedsort of men , and they therefore are unable to dive him their confidence . Suppose such an impracticable man of talent to give the world a novel ; he w6uld make one very much resembling in sprrit this which lies before us . We might conclude a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ily thankir*g him for all that was good in it and expressing the hope that his next production might be less marred by seriou* faults and errors.
