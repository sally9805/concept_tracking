This to me , when to-morrow we are to be married . The more I think of it , the more I am convinced he 's been down to that plaguey theatre , that 's been showing in Squire Josh 's barn .

Captain Chunk ( Starting . ) What ! you that you were present at their diabolical abominations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know once  --  I never see such handsome sights . There was a bloody tyrannical sojer , King Richard 3 , that made nothing of chopping off heads by the dozens . But then he got rowed up Salt Creek at last , for there was another chap , that must have been a Colonel or a Major , tackled him , and fit like murder , and bime-by , he run his sword right through his body , so that it stuck out on t' other side , and that ere was the death of King Richard three . CAPT . Captain Chunk Zounds and the devil ! I see it all , and this accounts for your conduct . But I 'll never forgive you , you sha n't sleep another night under this roof ; I 'm done with you forever , and you sha n't have Jedidah . CUR . Curtis Look here , dad , you do n't know as much as a farrow hen . As for Jedidah , she 's been marked at for more than her heft . I used to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see a gal last night that cut Jedidah right out of her swathe . JED . Jedidah ( Rises and comes forward , C. ) Oh ! dear ! I can hold no longer .

But if I die , I declare and vow I 'll haunt your beside . CUR . Curtis And , Jedidah , you 'd do to act one of them women King Richard was so sassy to , for they did nothing but bulloch and beller , and jaw , and blow their noses . But oh ! in the fuss , that ere splendifferous angel  --  oh ! Jedidah ! was n't she a buster ? CAPT . Captain Chunk Oh , miserable boy ! CUR . Curtis Dad , I reckon you 've got the janders . I ai nt miserable no how you can fix it . I ai nt done nothing but laugh all night . You 'd ought to have seen the clown there ; his name was Gregory .

( Turns round , runs against CAPTAIN CHUNK , crockery falls and breaks , JEDIDAH screams . ) CAPT . Captain Chunk I shall go mad ! Oh , you scoundrel ! CUR . Curtis Yes , that 's the idee ! ha , ha ! Then all the people laffed , and hurra 'd , and clapped , and I could n't stand it , so I snorted right out , and laffed so much I tore my trowsers , and my shirt . But why do n't you laugh , dad ? CAPT . Captain Chunk Laugh ! I 've made up my mind you shall have a strait jacket and go to the Insane Hospital , and as for these miserable play-actors , their license shall be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CUR . Curtis Well , I 've made up my mind too : if they leave the town I 'll go along with them . They are a fine honorable set of fellows . After the play I took all hands into our store and treated ' em , and they said they 'd make a play-actor of me . And as for that ' ere gal I see 'd , I 'm desperate in love with her , and I 'll marry her right off . Miss Fanny Magnet is her angel-liferous name ; I 'm going to see her to-day , but first I 'm going to write her a love-letter , to let her know how savageously I dote on her . So , Jedidah , you need n't shine up to me any longer . JED . Jedidah Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! ! ( crying . ) CAPT . Captain Chunk I 'll go instantly and see this she-devil .

But I must n't lose no time ! I 'll write a love-letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it while I 'm dressing in my Sunday clothes . I 'll put on my yaller vest and stiffest shirt collar , and if my rig-out do n't take her fancy , then she 's fireproof . ( Sits at table . ) I do n't know hardly how to begin . I never wrote a love-letter . I suppose it must be in poetry . Gol darn it , this pen is as blunt as a rolling pin . ( Whittles it with a case-knife . ) Now for it . ( Writes . ) " I write , dear Fanny , for to tell , How in love with you I fell . Except Jedidah , you 're the fust That ever made my heart to bust . Jedidah , I have quit and cussed her , All for you , you little buster ! Your eyes , like lightning bugs , do glitter , You most consummate beautiful critter .

Give it to the bar-keeper , and tell him to give it , right straight off , to Miss Fanny Magnet , according to the direction . Now away , away ! ( Exit RICHARD , L. H. ) I 'll walk right through you if you longer stay . By mighty , I feel kind-o ' - curious ; I ai nt felt so since last Fourth of July , when I got so swizzled on gin and molasses . I 'm afeard to see Miss Fanny . I sha n't durst to say half as much as I 've written in that letter  --  though when I get my best clothes on , I feel darned fierce . I hate most to see Jedidah take on so . I must be an everlasting loss to her . I hope she ai nt got no real notion of committing susanside . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll cut her down , by hookey ! Then she talks about haunting my bedside  --  darn it , that would be worse than bed-bugs ! I 've heard of such things ! Introduces song , and exit R. H. SCENE II .  --  Room in a Tavern . Enter DOUGLAS DOUBLE and FANNY MAGNET , R. H. DOUB . Double It 's clear that something must be done . We 're on the " Road to Ruin , " and there 's " The Devil to Pay . " I think but of " Raising the Wind , " and I 'm the man " Who wants a Guinea . " The landlord has grown as crusty as his own mouldy bread , and I ca n't get credit at the bar even for a cigar . FAN . Fanny Well , I 've done all I could . You know I 've consented to be called Miss Fanny Magnet , when in fact I 'm Mrs. Double , and you 've called me a great attraction . Now , I should like to know how much I attracted last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and four pence . FAN . Fanny Well , we 've done worse than that  --  hope for the best . DOUB . Double Hope ! so I do keep hoping . Hav n't I been lingering here day after day ? Monday was our last night ; Tuesday  --  positively the last night ; Wednesday  --  definitively the last night ; Thursday  --  the ultimate performance . All depends upon my benefit to-night , when , if you really prove a great attraction , we shall quit the town with flying colors . FAN . Fanny How are you going to play the endless variety of pieces you 've advertised ? Why you 've put up half a dozen . DOUB . Double Cut ' em , cut ' em . Cut and come again , my maxim .

CAPT . Captain Chunk ( Without L. H. ) I tell you I will come up ; offer to stop me and I 'll knock you down . DOUB . Double Eh ! what 's the meaning of this noise upon the stairs ? FAN . Fanny I say , Double , if it 's any one to see me , I 'm not at home , you know . DOUB . Double It may be somebody for tickets  --  business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , I can not easily forget the comical actions of that yankee . Ah ! who comes here ? Enter CAPT . CHUNK , L. H. CAPT . Captain Chunk ( Aside . ) Ah ! there she stands , the sarpent . I ca n't bear to look upon the critter , for I never was in such company before . I dare say she 's some old harridan , all paint and wrinkles . ( FANNY turns to him . ) Why she 's as likely a looking gal as Jedidah . I thought I 'd blaze away the moment I saw her , but somehow my spirit is leaking away as fast as it can . Oh ! I 'm so tender-hearted ! FAN . Fanny To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit ? CAPT . Captain Chunk ( Aside . ) I 'll put myself into a bit of a passion . FAN . Fanny Pray be seated . ( They sit . ) CAPT . Captain Chunk ( Aside . ) Dear me , how very polite ! However , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam , is your name Fanny Magnet ? FAN . Fanny Yes , sir , that 's my name  --  at your service . CAPT . Captain Chunk ( Aside . ) Yes , and anybody else 's I suppose . ( Aloud . ) Pray , ma'am , do you know my son ? FAN . Fanny Why , what a strange question ! I do n't even know you . CAPT . Captain Chunk My name is Chunk , old Captain Chunk . I 'm selectman and captain of militia . My son , a good-for-nothing fellow , came to see you act out last night . FAN . Fanny Well , sir , I trust he was pleased with the performances ? CAPT . Captain Chunk Pleased , ma'am ! why the boy 's as crazy as a coot . He has done nothing but holler and scream all the forenoon , and call for his horse , and talk about Richard , and Catesby , and the devil knows who . FAN . Fanny Ha , ha ! this must be the youth of last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Chunk No ma'am  --  it is n't all , ma'am . He has engaged to marry Jedidah Pratt , his cousin , ma'am , and till last night he liked her very well , but since he 's seen you he 's treated poor Jedidah shamefully , and talks of nothing but Miss Fanny Magnet . FAN . Fanny La , sir , what could he see in my face to admire ? CAPT . Captain Chunk Well , I do n't know what , ha , ha , ha ! You 're not so bad looking , after all . Now I look at you again , you 're a smart nice gal . But do n't try to get Curtis away from Jedidah  --  it would break her heart . FAN . Fanny My dear sir , I could not do it . ( Smiles . ) CAPT . Captain Chunk I do n't know that ; egad , if you smiled on him as you did on me just now , it would be all over with him . You pretty little  --  I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I declare , you 're a nice old gentleman ! CAPT . Captain Chunk Am I though ? Well , perhaps I am , though I never found it out . FAN . Fanny Yes , you are ; and if your son is only half as well bred , and as good  --  CAPT . Captain Chunk Come , now , none of that , Miss Fanny Magnet , or you 'll make me wrathy again . But between you and I , I should very much like to know what you did to tickle Curtis so last night ? What did you act out ? FAN . Fanny Why , first , I spouted , for instance , and then I danced , and then I sang a little . CAPT . Captain Chunk Sang ! what , can you sing ? I dare say you can , you little rogue . I beg your pardon , ma'am . I love singing , and as far as Old Hundred goes , I 'm something of a fist at it myself . Pray , let 's hear you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man will never do for me , For May and December can never agree . " CAPT . Captain Chunk Why , will nothing but a young man serve your turn ? Egad ! you sing like a bobalink . You 've made me feel so merry , I verily believe I could dance . FAN . Fanny So could I , you dear old man . ( Sings " Buy a Broom , " and waltzes him round the stage . ) CAPT . Captain Chunk Dear me , young woman , how improper . I declare you 've set my head whirling , and my brain keeps whizzing like the in'ards of a clock in a quinsy . You 've absolutely turned my head . If you acted out so with my son , no wonder he came home last night as crazy as a coot . DOUB . Double ( Without , R. H. ) " Limbs do your office , and support me well , " Bear me but to her , then fail me , if you can . " FAN . Fanny There 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if he sees you here he 'll be in a dreadful passion . CAPT . Captain Chunk Well , well , I 'll be gone . I ca n't find it in my heart to scold you  --  but just try , and do n't love Curtis Chunk . I know it 's hard to resist him , for he takes after me  --  but now , do n't spile him . I 'm off . Think about Jedidah  --  I 'm going  --  it will be the death of her  --  I 'm gone . Exit L. H. FAN . Fanny Well , this is truly whimsical . Enter DOUBLE , R. H. DOUB . Double " The sun of heaven methought was loath to set . " Pray , Fanny , who was that tiresome old man ? and what were you talking about ? Your conversation was full five lengths . FAN . Fanny He 's the father of the youth I captivated last night , so now you know the secret . DOUB . Double The deuce he was ! Here , there came a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reading . It contains a request to see you , enclosing the following verses . ( Reads and laughs . ) FAN . Fanny Oh ! do let me see them . DOUB . Double When he comes I 'll kick him out . FAN . Fanny No , Double , do n't play the farce of " Turn out " ; leave him to me , and I 'll show him how to play the " Double Dealer . " DOUB . Double What ! trust you with a fascinating young man ? FAN . Fanny Yes , you must , Double . " Believe me for mine honor , and have respect for mine honor , that you may believe so . " Exit R. H. DOUB . Double Devilish fine woman , though I say it that should n't . In the metropolis she 'd draw  --  she 'd be a great attraction . So should I , I 'm sure .

Double I mean , you 're fond of shows ? CUR . Curtis I want to know if I ai nt ? though father keeps one up so darned tight , I ca n't get a lick at ' em once in a hundred years . Last night was the first time I ever seen a play acted right out . At first I thought you were all swizzled , and you might have heard me sing out " Tomatoes , do they act so daytimes , or are they all tight ? " But bime-by I began to see through it . Come to think , it was n't the fust big show I ever see , ' cause I carried Jedidah to see the Mammoth Caravan ,  --  and was n't that a snorter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ! ha ! You are no greenhorn . CUR . Curtis I want to know if I am not . No , no , not I ! Do n't I know a thing or two ? I rather guess I do .

Double Nor I , upon my soul , you have a noble figure for the stage . CUR . Curtis I 've a darned good mind to go along with you . What wages do you give a green hand ? DOUB . Double Well , that depends upon circumstances . CUR . Curtis Try before you buy , that 's father 's maxim . Well , I do n't think I could act without a little practice .

Curtis And then , when it came to the fightin ' part  --  by mighty ! would n't I jump around and lick everybody I come across . I would n't let that tarnal Richmond lick me like he did you . I 'd have that old skewer out of his hand , and kicked him out darned quick . DOUB . Double But , as you say , you could n't have done it , without practice or study . Now , I 'll be your instructor . Come , let 's rehearse a speech or two . I 'll spout a line and you repeat it . Are you ready ? Now , you must take the stage . CUR . Curtis Where to , tarnation ?
