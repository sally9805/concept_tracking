EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION . The story of " Venice Preserved " is partly founded upon St. Real 's History of the Conspiracy of the Spaniards against the Republic of Venice , in 1618 . Voltaire compares the author of this History to Sallust ; and pronounces it superior to the English tragedy  --  an assertion , which , like many others from the same source , was the convenient sentence of an adroit but reckless ignorance . The merits of St. Real are undoubtedly great ; but Otway 's indebtedness to him is exceedingly slight ; and it is remarkable to see how ingeniously , from a few meagre historical details , the great dramatist has constructed one of the noblest imaginative works of which literature can boast . The names of nearly all the dramatis person , with the exception of Belvidera , are taken from St. Real ; but their characters are Otway 's , and his plot is almost wholly original . The true Pierre was a Norman corsair , who had accumulated a fortune by plundering ships in the Mediterranean . He was eventually strangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate . Jaffier was of Provence , and appears to have engaged in the plot against the state from his friendship for Pierre , and the prospect of gain . History says nothing of his wrongs , or his love for the daughter of Priuli ; and he was shaken in his faith to the conspiracy , not by the tears of a woman , but partly by his detestation of the sanguinary speech of Renault ( in which Otway follows the history ) , and partly from being struck with compunction during the spectacle of the Doge 's wedding the Adriatic , when his imagination contrasted the public rejoicings with the desolation which was to follow . After disclosing the plot , and experiencing the perfidy of the Senate , who had promised him the lives of his friends , he was made captive while bearing arms against Venice , and drowned the day after his arrival in the city . Renault , according to St. Real , was an old French gentleman , who had fled to Venice for some unknown cause , and there became acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than riches , and glory more than virtue . He had abilities , courage , a contempt for life , and a passion for distinction . The affront towards Belvidera , of which Otway makes him guilty , was a pure invention of the author , unsupported by any trait which history ascribes to Renault . Few plays owe so much to the pruning-knife for their success as this . In its unexpurgated state , " Venice Preserved " leaves an impression far less favorable to the genius , as well as the moral sense of the author , than in its present abridged and rectified shape . In the language of Campbell , " never were beauties and faults more easily separated than those of this tragedy . The latter , in its purification for the stage , came off like dirt from a fine statue , taking away nothing from its symmetrical surface , and leaving us only to wonder how the author himself should have soiled it with such disfigurements . Pierre is a miserable conspirator , as Otway first painted him , impelled to treason by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his character , as it now comes forward , is a mixture of patriotism and excusable misanthropy . Even in the more modern prompt- books , an improving curtailment has been introduced . Until the middle of the last century , the ghosts of Jaffier and Pierre used to come in upon the stage , haunting Belvidera in her last agonies , which , Heaven knows , require no aggravation from spectral agency . " This tragedy is believed to have been originally acted about the year 1682 . " Pierre and Jaffier , " says Jackson , in his History of the Scottish Stage , " in the estimation of the theatrical world , are equal in rank , and excel each other in representation only , as the particular talents of the actor elevate or lessen , in the idea of the spectator , the importance of whichever part he assumes . I have seen Garrick and Barry alternately in both parts , and the candid critic was doubtful where to bestow the preference . Mr. Mossop , indeed , raised the character of Pierre beyond all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at a distance ; but , had he attempted Jaffier , I am confident he would , with Barry in Pierre , have stood far behind . " Of this same Mossop in Pierre , Davies , the biographer of Garrick , remarks :  --  " His fine , full-toned voice and strong expression of sentiment , gave uncommon spirit to the warmth and passion of the character . In the interview with the conspirators , in the third act , he threw a gallantry into his action , as striking as it was unexpected . But he greatly excelled in the vehement reproaches , which , in the fourth act , he poured , with acrimony and force , on the treachery and cowardice of Jaffier . The cadences of his voice were equally adapted to the loudest rage and the most deep and solemn reflection , which he judiciously varied . " " Mr. Garrick , " says Davies , " when fixed in the management of Drury Lane , resigned Pierre , in which part his fire and spirit were not equally supported by grandeur and dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and deserved approbation many years . The temporary frenzy , with which Jaffier is seized , in the fourth act , on fancying that he saw his friend on the rack , has not since been equalled , nor , perhaps , ever will : "  --  ' He groans ; Hark , how he groans ! his screams are in my ears Already ! See , they 've fixed him on the wheel ! And now they tear him ! Murder ! Perjured Senate ! Murder ! ' " The enthusiastic power of Garrick presented this dreadful image to the audience with such astonishing force , that they trembled at the imaginary picture . In all the softer scenes of domestic woe , conjugal tenderness , and agonizing distress , Barry , it must be owned , was Garrick 's master . " " Mrs. Cibber was long the Belvidera of Barry and Garrick . Every situation seemed to be formed on purpose to call forth her great skill in awakening the passions . Mrs. Siddons has , in this part as well as many others , fixed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a resistless torrent , has borne down all before her . In person , just rising above the middle stature , she looks , walks , and moves , like a woman of superior rank . Her countenance is expressive ; her eye so full of information , that the passion is told from her look before she speaks . Her voice , though not so harmonious as Mrs. Cibber 's , is strong and pleasing : nor is a word lost for want of due articulation . She excels all performers in paying due attention to the business of the scene . Her eye never wanders from the person she speaks to , or should look at when she is silent . Her modulation of grief , in her plaintive pronunciation of the interjection , Oh ! is sweetly moving , and reaches to the heart . Her madness in Belvidera is terribly affecting . The many accidents of spectators falling into fainting-fits during her acting , bear testimony to the effects of her exertions . She certainly does not spare herself . None can say that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of this and some nine other plays , of various merit , none of which , however , now keep possession of the stage , was the son of a clergyman , and born at Trotting , in Sussex , England , in the year 1651 . His tragedy of the " Orphan " was for many years as attractive in the representation as " Venice Preserved ; " but the plot is of a character to render it distasteful to a modern audience , although it contains passages of remarkable beauty and power . Otway is said to have tried his fortune on the stage as an actor , and to have failed  --  not an unfrequent case with dramatic authors . He appears to have earned but a precarious subsistence by his pen ; although from the little we can glean of his history , the inference is , he was improvident , and easily led away by gay , dissipated companions . One of his biographers gives a melancholy account of the destitution of his latter days , and states , that he was reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cravings of hunger , from a gentleman , who , shocked at the distress of the author of " Venice Preserved , " put a guinea into his hands ; that Otway was choked with a piece of bread , which he had immediately purchased . He is said to have died the 14th April , 1685 , at a public-house on Tower Hill . This story is contradicted by Dr. Warton , who says that the poet died of a distemper brought on by a severe cold . Out of Shakspeare 's unapproachable domain , we know of no tragedy in the English language to compare with this in the earnestness of its passion , the depth of its pathos , and the aptitude of its language . Although it has not been represented of late years as frequently as formerly , it will be long before it is super- seded in its foremost rank in our acting drama . CAST OF CHARACTERS .

Priuli ( R. ) No more ! I 'll hear no more ! Begone , and leave me ! Jaf . Jaffier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall ! My lord  --  my lord ! I 'm not that abject wretch You think me . Patience ! where 's the distance throws Me back so far , but I may boldly speak In right , though proud oppression will not hear me ? Priuli . Priuli Have you not wronged me ? Jaf . Jaffier Could my nature e'er Have brooked injustice , or the doing wrongs , I need not now thus low have bent myself To gain a hearing from a cruel father .  --  Wronged you ? Priuli . Priuli Yes , wronged me ! In the nicest point , The honour of my house , you 've done me wrong . You may remember ( for I now will speak , And urge its baseness ) when you first came home From travel , with such hopes as made you looked on By all men 's eyes , a youth of expectation ; Pleased with your growing virtue , I received you ; Courted , and sought to raise you to your merits ; My house , my table , nay , my fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used me To your best service ; like an open friend , I treated , trusted you , and thought you mine : When , in requital of my best endeavours , You treacherously practised to undo me ; Seduced the weakness of my age 's darling , My only child , and stole her from my bosom . Oh ! Belvidera ! Jaf . Jaffier ' T is to me you owe her : Childless you had been else , and in the grave Your name extinct ; no more Priuli heard of . You may remember , scarce five years are past , Since in your brigantine you sailed to see The Adriatic wedded by our duke ; And I was with you : your unskilful pilot Dashed us upon a rock ; when to your boat You made for safety ; entered first yourself ;  --  Th ' affrighted Belvidera , following next , As she stood trembling on the vessel 's side , Was , by a wave , washed off into the deep ; When instantly I plunged into the sea , And buffeting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of mine . Like a rich conquest , in one hand I bore her , And with the other dashed the saucy waves , That thronged and pressed to rob me of my prize . I brought her , gave her to your despairing arms ; Indeed , you thanked me ; but a nobler gratitude Rose in her soul : for from that hour she loved me , Till for her life she paid me with herself . Priuli . Priuli You stole her from me ; like a thief you stole her , At dead of night ; that cursd hour you chose To rifle me of all my heart held dear . May all your joys in her prove false , like mine ! A sterile fortune , and a barren bed , Attend you both : continual discord make Your days and nights bitter and grievous still : May the hard hand of a vexatious need Oppress and grind you ; till at last you find The curse of disobedience all your portion . Jaf . Jaffier Half of your curse you have bestowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young boy , sweet as his mother 's beauty : May he live to prove more gentle than his grandsire , And happier than his father . Priuli . Priuli Rather live To bait thee for his bread , and din your ears With hungry cries ; whilst his unhappy mother Sits down and weeps in bitterness of want . Jaf . Jaffier You talk as if ' t would please you . Priuli . Priuli ' T would , by heaven ! Jaf . Jaffier Would I were in my grave ! Priuli . Priuli And she , too , with thee : For , living here , you 're but my cursed remembrancers , I once was happy ! Jaf . Jaffier You use me thus , because you know my soul Is fond of Belvidera . You perceive My life feeds on her , therefore thus you treat me . Were I that thief , the doer of such wrongs As you upbraid me with , what hinders me But I might send her back to you with contumely , And court my fortune where she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jaf . Jaffier Indeed , my lord , I dare not . My heart , that awes me , is too much my master : Three years are past since first our vows were plighted , During which time , the world must bear me witness , I 've treated Belvidera like your daughter , The daughter of a senator of Venice : Distinction , place , attendance , and observance , Due to her birth , she always has commanded : Out of my little fortune , I 've done this ; Because , ( though hopeless e'er to win your nature ) The world might see I loved her for herself ; Not as the heiress of the great Priuli . Priuli . Priuli No more . Jaf . Jaffier Yes , all , and then , adieu forever . Pausing with clasped hands There 's not a wretch that lives on common charity , But 's happier than I ; for I have known The luscious sweets of plenty ; every night Have slept with soft content about my head , And never waked , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full ear of corn , Whose blossom ' scaped , yet 's withered in the ripening . Priuli . Priuli Home , and be humble ; study to retrench ; Discharge the lazy vermin of thy hall , Those pageants of thy folly : Reduce the glitt'ring trappings of thy wife To humble weeds , fit for thy little state : Going , R. Then to some suburb cottage both retire ; Drudge to feed loathsome life ; get brats and starve  --  Home , home , I say ! Exit , R. Jaf . Jaffier ( C. ) Yes , if my heart would let me  --  This proud , this swelling heart : home I would go , But that my doors are hateful to my eyes , Filled and damned up with gaping creditors ! I 've now not fifty ducats in the world , Yet still I am in love , and pleased with ruin . Oh , Belvidera ! Oh ! she is my wife  --  And we will bear our wayward fate together , But ne'er know comfort more . Enter Pierre , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , good morrow ; How fares the honest partner of my heart ? What , melancholy ! not a word to spare me ! Jaf . Jaffier ( C. ) I 'm thinking , Pierre , how that damned starving quality , Called honesty , got footing in the world . Pierre . Pierre Why , powerful villainy first set it up , For its own ease and safety . Honest men Are the soft easy cushions on which knaves Repose and fatten . Were all mankind villains , They 'd starve each other ; lawyers would want practice , Cut-throats , reward : each man would kill his brother Himself ; none would be paid or hanged for murder . Honesty ! ' t was a cheat , invented first To bind the hands of bold deserving rogues , That fools and cowards might sit safe in power , And lord it uncontrolled above their betters . Jaf . Jaffier Then honesty is but a notion ? Pierre . Pierre Nothing else ; Like wit , much talked of , not to be defined : He that pretends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is a ragged virtue . Honesty ! no more o n't . Jaf . Jaffier Sure , thou art honest ? Pierre . Pierre So , indeed , men think me ; But they 're mistaken , Jaffier ; I 'm a rogue , As well as they ; A fine , gay , bold-faced villain as thou seest me ! ' T is true , I pay my debts , when they 're contracted ; I steal from no man ; would not cut a throat To gain admission to a great man 's purse ; Would not betray my friend , To get his place or fortune ; I scorn to flatter A blown-up fool above me , or crush the wretch beneath me ; Yet , Jaffier , for all this , I am a villain . Jaf . Jaffier ( R. C. ) A villain ! Pierre . Pierre Yes , a most notorious villain ; To see the sufferings of my fellow-creatures , And own myself a man ; to see our senators Cheat the deluded people with a show Of liberty , which yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them our hands are free from fetters ; Yet whom they please , they lay in basest bonds ; Bring whom they please to infamy and sorrow ; Drive us , like wrecks , down the rough tide of power , Whilst no hold 's left to save us from destruction . All that bear this are villains , and I one , Not to rouse up at the great call of nature , And check the growth of these domestic spoilers , That make us slaves , and tell us ' t is our charter ! Walks , L. Jaf . Jaffier I think no safety can be here for virtue , And grieve , my friend , as much as thou , to live In such a wretched state as this of Venice , Where all agree to spoil the public good , Aud villains fatten with the brave man 's labours . Pierre . Pierre Returns to L. C. ) We 've neither safety , unity , nor peace , For the foundation 's lost of common good ; Justice is lame , as well as blind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make them , ) Serve but for instruments of some new tyranny , That every day starts up , t'enslave us deeper . Now Lays his hand on Jaffier 's arm , could this glorious cause but find out friends To do it right , oh , Jaffier ! then might'st thou Not wear those seals of woe upon thy face ; The proud Priuli should be taught humanity , And learn to value such a son as thou art . I dare not speak , but my heart bleeds this moment . Jaf . Jaffier Cursed be the cause , though I , thy friend , be part o n't : Let me partake the troubles of thy bosom , For I am used to misery , and perhaps May find a way to sweete n't to thy spirit . Pierre . Pierre Turns , L. and looks over R. shoulder . Too soon ' twill reach thy knowledge  --  Jaf . Jaffier Then from thee Let it proceed . There 's virtue in thy friendship , Would make the saddest tale of sorrow pleasing , Strengthen my constancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ruined ! Jaf . Jaffier That I long since knew ; I and ill fortune have been long acquainted . Pierre . Pierre I passed this very moment by thy doors , And found them guarded by a troop of villains ; " The sons of public rapine were destroying . " They told me , by the sentence of the law They had commission to seize all thy fortune : Nay , more , Priuli 's , cruel hand had signed it . Here stood a ruffian , with a horrid face , Lording it o'er a pile of massy plate , Tumbled into a heap for public sale : There was another making villainous jests At thy undoing : he had ta'en possession Of all thy ancient , most domestic ornaments ; Rich hangings , intermixed and wrought with gold The very bed , which , on thy wedding night , Received thee to the arms of Belvidera , The scene of all thy joys , was violated By the coarse hands of filthy dungeon villains , And thrown amongs the common lumber . Jaf . Jaffier Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what ? Jaf . Jaffier That I 'm not worth a ducat . Pierre . Pierre Curse thy dull stars , and the worse fate of Venice , Where brothers , friends , and fathers , all are false ; Where there 's no truth , no trust ; where innocence Stoops under vile oppression , and vice lords it . Hadst thou but seen , as I did how , at last , Thy beauteous Belvidera , like a wretch That 's doomed to banishment , came weeping forth , Whilst two young virgins , on whose arms she leaned , Kindly looked up , and at her grief grew sad , As if they catched the sorrows that fell from her : Ev'n the lewd rabble , that were gathered round To see the sight , stood mute when they beheld her ; Governed their roaring throats , and grumbled pity : I could have hugged the greasy rogues ; they pleased me . Jaf . Jaffier I thank thee for this story , from my soul ; Since now I know the worst that can befall me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have borne The roughest wrong my fortune could have done me ; But when I think what Belvidera feels , The bitterness her tender spirits taste of , I own myself a coward . Bear my weakness , If , throwing thus my arms about thy neck , Embrace . I play the boy , and blubber in thy bosom . Oh , I shall drown thee with my sorrows . Pierre . Pierre Burn , First , burn and level Venice to thy ruin . What ! starve , like beggars ' brats , in frosty weather , Under a hedge , and whine ourselves to death ! Thou , or thy cause , shall never want assistance , Whilst I have blood or fortune fit to serve thee : Command my heart , thour't every way its master . Jaf . Jaffier No ; there 's a secret pride in bravely dying . Pierre . Pierre Rats die in holes and corners , dogs run mad ! Man knows a braver remedy for sorrow  --  Revenge , the attribute of gods ; they stamped it , With their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well the cause that calls upon thee ; And , if thou'rt base enough , die then . Remember Thy Belvidera suffers ; Belvidera ! Die !  --  damn first !  --  What ! be decently interred In a church-yard , and mingle thy brave dust With stinking rogues , that rot in winding-sheets , Surfeit-slain fools , the common dung o'th ' soil ! Jaf . Jaffier Oh !  --  Pierre . Pierre Well said , out with't  --  swear a little  --  Jaf . Jaffier Swear ! By sea and air ; by earth , by heav'n and hell , I will revenge my Belvidera 's tears !

I joy more in thee Than did thy mother , when she hugged thee first , And blessed the gods for all her travail past . Jaf . Jaffier Can there in woman be such glorious faith ?

Jaf . Jaffier Taking her hand . Oh , Belvidera ! doubly I 'm a beggar ; Undone by fortune , and in debt to thee . Want , worldly want , that hungry meagre fiend , Is at my heels , and chases me in view . Canst thou bear cold and hunger ?

Though my distracted senses should forsake me , I 'd find some intervals when my poor heart Should ' suage itself , and be let loose to thine . Though the bare earth be all our resting place , Its roots our food , some cliff our habitation , I 'll make this arm a pillow for thine head ; And , as thou sighing liest , and swelled with sorrow , Creep to thy bosom , pour the balm of love Into thy soul , and kiss thee to thy rest ; Part .
