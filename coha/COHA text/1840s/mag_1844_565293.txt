txt the vote is required to be unanimous . The rules commonly adopted by deliberative bodies , govern the churches in their business meetings . The assent of the sisters is expected in the reception of members ; but in all ordinary business they usually take no part whatever . 14 . Public worship. - Publie worship is usually conducted by the pastor or officiating minister , much in the same manner as in Presbyterian and Congregational churches . Formerly , laymen were called upon , after the sermon , to take part in the exercises , and this practice still continues to some extent . Written discourses are more common than they were in former times . BANKING . THE term " bank " is derived from the Italian " hanco , " a bench . In early ag*es the Jews of Italy used to assemble in the market-places , and seat themselves on benches for the purpose of loaning money ; and whenever any one failed , his bench was broken , hence the term " bankrupt . " Thus among the modern Europeans , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders . The first corporate bank was that of Venice . It originated about the middle of the twelfth century , from the necessity of a forced loan on the part of the duke Michael II. ; it was therefore the offspring of tyranny . A similar bank commenced in Genoa in 1607 ; another in Amsterdam in 1609 , and another in Rotterdam , 1635 . These , together with the bank of Hamburgh , incorporated 1688 , were all essentially banks of deposit and exchange , without the power Of expansion ; and they appear to have transacted the principal exchanges of Europe with great utility and safety , until the incorporation of the bank of England in 1694 , which first ushered a new , and as we believe , a ruinous principle into the world , viz , the principle of expansion  --  or the principle of giving out more bills than the amount of currency they retamed en hand ; thus expanding at will the currency of the globe . With this principle commenced a new career of disaster , before unknown in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , specious , plausible , and seemingly almost incalculable , it rapidly spread throughout almost all the commercial nations of the globe . It is needless to trace it in all its endless ramifications , through all its tortuous windings , its frauds , its delusions , and its impostures ; its frequent and protracted suspensions in the bank of England , its ruinous profligacy under the guidance of Mr. Law , while engendering the far-famed Mississippi scheme in France , by which a whole nation was rendered bankrupt ; and through its subsequent developments in our own country . In all these cases the principle is substantially the same , though its modes of operation are in general twofold : first , the bills are emitted and the currency expanded on the bare faith of the government , without any specie in reserve : second , the bills are emitted and the expansion ensues on the basis of a smaller amount of currency held in deposit ; varying from three to fifteen dollars emitted to one retained . Law 's Mississippi scheme , the old continental scheme , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of existing banks proceed upon the // latter . It is readily admitted , that in many respects there is much choice between these two modes of expansion : while so far as the fact of the expansion is concerned , and all the untold evils that flow from it , it is all one and the same thing ; and its results have been as uniform , thus far in the history of the world , as the results of the law of gravitation-though unfortunately not as uniformly good . Law 's hank in France , in the short space of four years , swallowed up two thousand two hundred and thirty five millions of livres . The repudiated issues of the continental Congress , recalled at one time , amounted to three hundred and seventy five millions of dollars , to say nothing of other issues and loans , probably amounting in all to thousands of millions . All these losses accrued upon the first mode of expansion , viz. upon the faith of the government . Since 1789 , the United States have proceeded upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in deposit , and the direct losses to the nation since that period , aside from all contingent and incidental losses , have been computed only at one thousand one hundred and ninety seven millions of dollars . The incidental losses , though incalculable , would doubtless far exceed this sum ; and though the evils of expansion by the first named mode are more rapid and terrific in their development , it may well be doubted whether they are either as deceptive or as fatal in the end , as the expansions on the second mode have thus far proved themselves to be , in this country . But we design to dwell upon these various modes of banking only sufficiently to indicate a radical defect in most of the treatises and discussions on the subject we have ever had the pleasure of reading , viz. the entire want of this indispensable discrimination . True , they sometimes barely advert to it ; they speak of various kinds of banks , as banks of exchange , of deposit , of circulation , &amp;c. ; but it seems not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might perform any one or all of these general functions , either with or without resting its foundations upon this smouldering volcano of expansion . Hence a sort of indiscriminate war on the one hand against all that bears the name of hank , repulsed by puerile eulogies of the same potent and engrossing word by those who have arrayed themselves in the opposite ranks . This is much as though half the nation should declare a war of extermination against all drinks , and the other half turn in to shout their praises , while neither party made any other discrimination in drinks further than to notice that some were red , some white , and some colorless , though all were aware that there was a lurking mischief somewhere about drinks , fraught with the most potent evils . Expansion is the intoxicating alcohol of banks , and no man can intelligently discuss or consider their operation , in past or present times , without at once putting his finger upon this principle , and separating it from all else that pertaii*s to the subject . We must detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been then two different kinds of banks in the world , banks of mere AccOMMODATION , ( if we may coin a term , ) which have conducted all the business of deposit , circulation , and exchange , either in whole or in part , without the legal power of expanding the currency ; and second , banks of EXPANSION , conducting the same operations with the power of legal expansion , more or less indefinite or restricted , and proceeding upon two modes ; first , upon the faith of the government ; second , upon reserved coin , which latter mode now prevails in the United States . To discuss at length // the relative differences and advantages of these two modes of expansion , or to go into a detailed history of the past and present operation of banks of expansion as contrasted with banks of mere accommodation , such as were those earher banks of Europe and some of a later date , would be foreign from the compass and design of this paper . All that can be done , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our readers can easily verify or refute , from the history of the past and the present . All men in modern times are sufficiently familiar with the meaning of the terms , " reaction , " " revulsion , " " hard times , " &amp;c. , in pecuniary interests . All who are to any considerable extent familiar with business , either in theory or practice , are also well apprised that these revulsions in commerce have become a sort of periodical epidemics in our times , whose periods and returns can be safely affirmed by all , while the shrewd financier is tolerably a*vare of their precise times . High prices in times of plenty arid peace , are the constant forerunners of these epidemic revulsions ; and at such junctures we hear shrewd practical inca remarklag , that " these times can not last long , " and while all others are eagerl y and giddily extending their business and their credits , these sagacious few are as busily contractin* and securing their own . To be able to know at what precise moment to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large commercial adventures ; or it is at least one indispensable item in the business . The course of these periodical expansions and consequent convulsions have , to our knowledge , never been more truly and graphically described , than by Mr. Biddle , in his letter to President Adams . They run somewhat in this form : starting at the lowest point in the scale , where we now are , ( or at least were a short time since , ) price begins to rise , business and confidence to increase , at first healthfully and propitiously ; but price still goes on rising ; profit is piled on profit , bargain on bargain , credit on credit , debt upon debt , and enterprise upon enterprise ; and all for most part successful in appearance , until the whole world seems one immense madhouse of traffickers , jobbers , and schemers , all ready to buy , flooded with wealth , and intoxicated with hope . The price of all things , lands , houses , ships , goods , produce , labor , and all else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the silly multitude seem almost to believe , that the very stones are soon to be changed into gold , and that they have little to do but to buy , cat , drink , and enjoy themselves . Hark ! there has a bank or a commercial house of great liabilities failed some thousand miles off " And what of that ? " What of that ? *vhy , at such times , it rings like a deathknell in the ear of every reflecting man in Christendom  --  the voice of war , or famine , or plague , could scarcely sound more terrific . He knows what is to come : he anticipates the era of mortgages , writs , suits , failures , sales , sheriffs , bankruptcies , broken fortunes , and broken hearts ; sinking or annihilated prices ; penniless princes ; beggared fbthers , weeping mothers , and starving children : lie hears already the great wail of the millions , shrieking under the tortures of " a revulsion . " I-Ic soon learns of another fuilure , and another , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards of commerce , trembling , pale , and palsied with dismay , not knowing whom to trust or what to do . Such is a revulsion : a scourge of Omnipotence for torturing the avarice of the nations , scarcely less terrific than the wars , plagues , and famines , that // 51 formerly trod upon the heels of their more bloody and ferocious crimes . TV/iat is the cause of these modern periodical revulsions ? We say modern , for we challenge the production of a single intimation of their existence in the whole history of the world , until after the introduction of the principle of expansion by the bank of England in 1694 . The first notices of them commence within less than twenty years from that memorable era , and they have continued their periodical return in all countries affected by this principle of expansion , ever since that time ; and still they have not appeared in any country removed from such influence . Doubtless prices have always varied from year to year on particular articles , according to the variation of supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this alternate running up and down of all prices , on all commodities , and these attendant terrific convulsions which the nations have experienced under the system of banking expansion , is , and ever has been , utterly unknown to all the rest of the world . And if history is true , such revulsions follow such expansions of the currency , as naturally and as necessarily as a shadow follows the substance . There are but four things in nature that could have produced the distress experienced in the United States during the last seven years : war , famine , plague , and expansion of the currency . We might perhaps add tyranny ; but it must have been a more terrific tyranny than that of Turkey or of Egypt . We once heard an intelligent man somewhat conversant with political affairs , assert in a public lecture , that there was one case of extravagant speculation and consequent revulsion on record , not connected with this principle of expansion , viz , the case of the " South Sea bubble " in 1722 : if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have found that the bank of England increased its stock ( and of course its expansion ) more than fifteen millions of dollars to meet that very exigency ; and this is the only case of the kind we ever heard cited for such a purpose : if there are others , the world ought to know it . True , it is easy to resolve all evils of the sort into general depravity , and that insatiate love of money which is " the root of all evil : " this may be morally the most profound view , but surely it has not become a new one . Since the days of Solomon , avarice has ever been a constant force in society ; and the question still returns , how does it happen that avarice , that old god , is in these modern days armed with this new instrument of incitement and self-torture , with which he lashes the nations through these intoxicating cycles of trade , onward , to the hideous , yawning gulf of a modern revulsion ? If avarice is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyre and Carthage , Venice , Genoa , Holland , Spain , and England , all loved gold ; and all were engaged in commerce , before the year 1694 , and yet we hear not a breath of these revulsions . In former days , merchants and others rightly supposed , that if they could escape fire , shipwreck , plague , famine , tyranny , and war , by an honest and prudential economy , their fortunes were secure ; but in these days , in times of profound peace and plenty , under a freedom matchless and unbounded , the man of millions , careful , prudent , and clear-sighted as he may be , begins each year without even a comfortable assurance , that he will riot end it a beggar . And if he keeps all his resources actively employed , at all times , he will be sure of that end at last .

" Whence this result ? Was it so in Tyre ? in Venice ? in Holland ? Or is it so in any other country now on the globe where the currency is not expanded and contracted ? If it is , let the advocates of expansion cite a sini*le case and we will admit it . The fact is , this principle of bank expansion has placed the whole money business of the globe upon the verge of a sleeping volcano , which warms and nurtures into unnatural luxuriancy and verdure for a time , only to heave the fiery fragments of its products to the skies , or whelm them in the sweltering depths below . The process is this . Price can be enhanced ( all else being stationary ) only by either increasing the amount or the velocity of the currency . The natural and healthful laws of trade , increase price only by increasing the rapidity with which the currency circulates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made to exchange more products or to pay more debts in the same time . Expansion on the contrary , increases price by increasing the amount of the apparent currency , while the real currency may be either in fact stationary , or even secretly diminishing . Price rises to a certain maximum , while the real currency s*aks by a withdrawal to a certain minimum , and then comes the explosive revulsion , and fortunes are scattered like the rainboxv mists before the blast of the tornado . To state by what inevitable laws these cycles of inflation and collapse are , and ever have been controlled , would require a volume rather than a few pages . It is a subject that can not be fully embraced or elucidated by single aphorisms . The fact of such a rise in price contemporaneously with the last expansion , we can however exhibit in short space , by quoting the price current of the leading staple commodities of the several years , along side of the amount of bank expansion for the same year , through the last cycle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of of Price of Pork . banks Wheat .

The last column shows the total circulation , or the ratio of expansion of all the banks in the United States for the same years . Local causes may have affected the price of some particular article , as of wheat in 1841 . But still the general swell of price follows the swell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hank circulation the last two years is left blank , the reports not being at hand : all know however that the contraction continued to increase . All the other years are taken from the official returns . We wish to say as little as possible about all the figures presented in this paper , being well aware that figures and the Scriptures , when left to speak for themselves , never lie but when forced to speak for other people , they become oftentimes the most mischievous , because the most credible liars in the universe . We // offer the above not as the basis of our conclusions , but merely as a sample of the class of facts to which we allude when we speak of the effects of expansion and contraction on price . Nor do we assert that other causes in this particular case did not affect prices ; we only affirm that expansion and contraction of the currency was a cause , and a leading cause . From this case it will be seen at once , that a debt contracted in 1832 , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products : while a debt contracted in the latter period , would swallow up three times the amount of products if paid in 1842 . If this periodical halving and trebling the value of all debts is not the result of a fluctuating currency , why has the world never experienced such results in any age or in any country , where the currency remained fixed and stable upon a metallic basis ? let so it is ; our recent expansion and consequent contraction , shook the whole globe so far as a fluctuating currency existed : while those countries and marts in which the currency is stable , passed quietly and tranquilly through the storm and if we may believe consuls and merchants resident at such ports , such calamities are there even at this day wholly unknown . The fact is , the power of indefinitely expanding the currency renders it as unfit for a measure or standard of value , ns wheat , or corn , or any other article which may be worth a given price this year , but one half , one fourth , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it absolutely annihilates one of the most essential requisites of all currency , viz , stability of value , and renders it as impossible to judge of its real value in other products , at any future day , as it is to judge of the future value of wheat , or pork , or corn , or any other article which may be trebled one year , and halved the next . We know there are many who attributed the last revulsion to the course pursued by the government , and some may pretend to even yet . Well , suppose we grant it . What sort of a currency then is that , which the touch of a single man can dissipate and scatter like the mists before the whirlwind ? Where , under the most absolute tyranny , had any man , or any number of men , this surprising power before ? Nowhere : unless aided by a currency based on wind . The feeble and factious government of these United States , could no more shake a solid currency in this way , than it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all unite to do their best at it . But it was the alarm : true , but what had power to create the alarm ? Men are wont to be more easily alarmed , when bitter exper*nce has once taught them that their dwellings stand over a magazine , which a single spark may inflame , than when they know there is nothing but rock beneath . True , all did not know this ; but there were enough who did know it , to feel and to give the alarm , long before the vulgar eye could discern the lurid signs that were flashing up in the commercial horizon . It is not denied however , that the government had power somewhat to modify both the time , and mode of the disaster . But to stop the revolutions of this fatal and sorcerous wheel of expansion , no government on earth has yet had power : those who shout on its top , must soon wail beneath its bottom , in despite of all that men or angels can do to the contrary , until the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system of expansion ? They are generally referred to under three heads . 1 . It stimulates industry and enterprise . 2 . It enables the banks to effect exchanges at less charge . 3 . It enables the country to export a part of their specie . We admit // that expansion does stimulate a sort of enterprise . The activity of England in the day of the " South Sea bubble , " of France in that of the " Mississippi scheme , " and of the United States during the last expansion were unparalleled . But what did that unnatural activity end in but in bankruptcy , desolation , and despair ? XVhat but in the delirium tremens of intoxicated enterprise ? We deny that it enables banks to effect exchanges cheaper than they could without any such principle , and if space were allowed , could easily prove it , both from the laws of exchange , and from the facts of history . The third point , the export of specie , is also all a delusion ; because the expansion necessarily goes to swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as this is the only advantage insisted on by Mr. Gallatin and many other of the most able writers in favor of expansion , we are disposed for argument 's sake to admit it , and to balance accounts with them and see how we stand on the admission . Mr. Gallatin estimates the advantage to the United States from this source at two millions of dollars annually ; this in five years would of course amount to ten millions . But the direct losses by banks , as reported in the American Almanac , from 1837 to 184* , in this country amounted to the following sums-omitting all account of the indirect losses from frauds , bankru ptcies , general distrust , and paralysis , in all branches of industry , which were at once beyond all calculation , if not beyond all conceptionLosses in bank circulation and deposite , ..... $44,000,000 Bank capital failed and depreciated , 294000,000 Bank stock failed and depreciated , 100,000,000 Corpany stock failed and depreciated , 80,000 ( 100 Real estate depreciated , 300,000.000 Total loss in five years , 818,000,000 Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five years by the principle than it would gain according to Mr. Gallatin 's own estimate in four hundred years . This would indeed seem to be a somewhat uncertain road to national wealth . But it will be said in this case the principle was not well managed . We know this is the fact . But when or where was it ever well managed in a free country ? We admit that under a strong monarchical government , which engrosses to itself and controls all the moneyed interests of the state , and which can at one moment with an iron hand check excessive issues , and at the next throw its giant shoulders beneath the falling ruin , and sustain credit in defiance of alarm , the most direful results of this principle may be averted ; though even here some may think that facts are against our concession . But how it can ever be controlled in twenty six or more democratic states , intimately connected in commerce but totally distinct in sovereignty , all inflamed with the mutual rivalries of wealth from without , incited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager for the Immediate profits of expansion , while few are aware of its dangers , with no power to resist the current of popular impulse , drift which xvay it may ; how such a principle-a principle at once so delicate , so delusive and so fearful , can ever be safely managed or controlled by such a confederation , is surely not so clear . Some have proposed to charter a Union bank of the United States strong enough to hold the issues of all others in check . This is plausible : it may be well to set the lion to hold the bear , provided you are sure you can trust the lion . But considering the nature of the beast , might it not be as well to keep out of the way of both . So far as such schemes tend toward the annihilation of the principle , that is , so far as they actually prevent expansion , they are doubtless good . The Boston banks have thus operated upon the New England currency , and contributed greatly // to its stability and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect for a time . But the difficulty lies here : self-interest alone regulates the issues of all expansive banks ; and this impels all alike , both strong and weak , to expand in times of excited prosperity , and thus add fuel to the flame , while all alike are forced to contract in those revulsions when money is most needed . Hence both the Bank of England and the old United States Bank were each several times forced upon the very verge of an explosion , which would have sent disaster through the land had they not escaped by the merest chances , on the one hand , or been sustained by the power of monarchy on the other . In both cases the credulous multitude walked over the yielding crust of the volcano , and because they did not actually fall in , they still fancy that there was no danger . Others propose to rid themselves of the dangers of expansion by surrendering all the known and obvious advantages of a paper circulation . But this scheme , even if not unwise , is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Union to effect all needful exchanges on a specia basis ; for there is at this moment more specie in the Union than there is currency of all sorts in active circulation ; and if every bill in the Union was annihilated at this moment , and the specie set in motion in their place , present prices might not only be sustained , but greatly increased by the increased activity of our coin , without any addition to the amount of the currency . But the economy and convenience of a paper circulation is so great , that people will endure the evils of expansion , though that expansion forms no part of the economy , sooner than forego the use of bank notes in some form . Besides , how we can with our nine hundred chartered banks and branches already in operation re .. turn at once to an exclusive metallic currency , without the most gross violation of chartered rights , it is not easy to see . Others have proposed to make the United States government the great stock-jobber for the nation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of treasury notes : while others still propose to throw the whole arena of expansion wide open to every man who chooses on his own responsibility to issue his notes . Both these remedies would probably terminate in a metallic currency by an utter destruction of all confidence in any other . But our experience under them would be terrible , though brief . Again ; we have adopted into our medley of democratic expansion , the absurd principle of diminished liability ; or the principle of allowing a man by law to contract liabilities with one hand , and refuse to meet them with the other . What he holds in one pocket he keeps to gamble with ; if he has good luck he will pay you ; but at all events you can not touch what he holds in the othe- . So here we are : some dozens of independent democratic states , with almost a thousand bladders of exchange already in being , and ready to swell the first moment there is a call for wind , and to scorch , contract , crack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's sun , with every body in general , and nobody in particular , responsible for their motions or their fate : and on this raft of bladders is embarked the commerce of the nation , and to a great extent that of the globe ! What wonder we find hard times periodically returning ? If all the imps of pandemonium should exhaust their wits in the effort , they could not devise a system of currency more utterly unmanageable , ruinous , and absurd . What then is the remedy ? We confess we do not believe there is any legislative remedy possible , short of an amendment of the Constitution , // making an entire recommittal of the control of the currency to the general government ; and even this is a doubtful measure . Meantime whatever palliatives may be applied should aim at oun single point-the prevention of temporary and fitful expansions . XVe do not insist that as things are , all expansion should be at once annihilated throughout the globe ; but we do insist that unless there is some definite , absolute limitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as regards single banks , there can be no safety in any form of credit whatever ; for a stable currency is the only basis of a safe credit . And this suggests the only practical remedy that the case at present admits ; which is so long as the ; urreney is as it now is , and must be for some time to come , let no man accept a long credit . Let all retail business be absolutely a cash business , and all wholesale business , either a cash business or on very short credits . A man who is fully aware of the present condition of our currency , and who will still lay himself liable for some remote day , or suffer incidental details to accumulate against him , is next thing to a madman . He knows not how much real value in products he will be compelled to pay if he promises so many dollars at a future day , no more than if he had promised so many coons . The real value of dollars may become one quarter , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present value , before the payday comes . KEEP OUT OF DEBT . This is the only practical remedy at present . This will itself prevent the exorbitant expansion of the currency , or if others will plunge into debt and draw upon the banks and thus expand the currency ; the man who is out of debt , at least escapes from the greatest evils of the impending catastrophe . This remedy is for the mass of the people to apply , and for all small retail dealers : if these regarded the rule , those who conduct a larger business might safely incur the hazards of short liabilities . This course has after all done more to hold the New England banks safe and steadfast than their system of supervisory control , which we admit to be good . Were the people of New England as improvident , and as reckless of their credit , and as eager for hazardous speculations , as the people of some of the other states , the control of a thousand Suffolk banks could never hold their system as steady and safe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done somewhat to save them , but their position and their character have done far more ; and any man who imagines that the same system would operate equally well for the Union at large , has but ill considered all the causes that are and must still be at work to produce a different result . When the people of other states shall become as shrewd and industrious , as careful of being trusted , and of trusting others , as are the people of New England , their banking system , had as it now is , will lose half its power for mischief without any further control ; and if New England was more provident and keen-sighted still in these respects , she would be still better off . It would give her more security ngainst the evils of the most absurd currency in the world than ten United States banks or fifty more Suffolk banks . But if the evils and hazards of expansion are so great , why has not the world discovered them before ? They have ; but they have ascribed the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have seen some of the dangers . More recent developments have disclosed more of them ; and such has been the awful experience of the last ten years , that many a heated partisan of 1837 is quite content to regard the whole topic of banking as an " obsolete idea " in 1843 . Amid much to be regretted , it can // scarce be doubted that the minds of our principal statesmen have made great progress on this subject under our recent experience ; their general silence is ominous of this ; all are beginning to see that a legal remedy is more difficult than they supposed , and that the extremes of no party were quite right . They have at least found that business could be transacted , prices rise , debts be paid , exchanges equalized , and credit confirmed , both without any United States bank , and without any expansion of the currency ; for such has been the actual condition of things the past year , while the currency needed in active circulation is still less than the amount of specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the specie basis . But we believe it impossible for any course of governmental policy whatever , to prevent a speedy return into the syren whirlpool of expansion and consequent revulsion ? No power of a United States bank can secure us from the evil , whatever good it might do in other respects . During the forty years such an institution existed , the country experienced these same periodical paroxysms , occurring at intervals and with a severity just in proportion to the previous expansion and in those forty years there were no less than sixteen years of bank sLispensions and depreciations , either total or partial , throughout the Union ; and we had in fact , then as now , the worst currency on the face of the globe . The report of the Chamber of Commerce of Manchester in 1839 , shows that the same disastrous effects have occurred periodically under the Bank of England , in spite of its unparalleled sagacity and power . The same report estimates the losses in consequence of the operations of the Bank of England on the currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in six great staples of the empire , at over two hundred mill Vol . II . 8 ions of dollars , to say nothing of the terrible individual and incidental results of this disaster . The terrible effects of expansion in France , as depicted by Mr. Irving , and the commercial stability and power which the virtual annihilation of the system under Napoleon gave to the empire , is well known to all . We have no Bonaparte here ; and in any thing less than a Bonaparte , we can see no hope of relief from our present system , however much we may deplore its existence , save in thesd five short words- " Do *OT Go IN J3IEBT . " Let the pulpit and the press both unite in resounding these words in the ears of the people , turning their minds from all hope of relief from any other quarter , and impressing upon them the true reasons , and the unutterable necessity of this advice in our present circumstances , until they shall see , and feel , and act upon it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger and th epossibility of such expansions and revulsions . And we believe it the only possible security . We believe that God has suffered this scourge of expansion to arise in the world mainly for two reasons  --  to chastise the avarice of the age , and to force men to regard the injunction , " Owe no man any thing ; " in other words , to compel them to live on their earnings , instead of on their imaginations and their hopes . This is the only source of relief and safety . Politicians , office-seekers , and demagogues , may and will talk long and loud of their various political remedies . It is all a noisy , clamorous , and oftentimes heartless brawl for party , place , and power . It is impossible for a democratic state essentially to relieve these , or any other kindred evils . They have followed , and they will follow us , through all modes of policy that can be devised short of a despotism . In all such matters the people of a free country will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in all save crime from within , and assault from without , they d o , and they most hold their own destiny , for xveal or for woe , in their own hands .

Sound the alarm there ; give the people knowledge , honesty , and prudence , and this as well as all other evils will prove powerless ; for these are in all cases , except war and crime , the only available saving influences in a democracy .
