" Letter - Bi-o Chuck-a-luck june the 14 teenth , 18 hundred &; 43 - Well , Kernul , I sees as how youve kwit Orleens and tuck up bout Videllai , but your nevver sed nuthin bout it to noboddy . Well Ime sorry fur your kwitten the cittee , but Ime glad youve jined that uther Bobb who is zactly thar with a kwil , and you ma sai " howdy " tu him fur me . Well I thot az that I might az well kill the roomeytiz by tellin you how I kill turkis , az to grunt fur nuthin . So hears fur a hunt . Well now fust you must have a rifel az iz zactly to the spec . Bout the fust ov Octobur we ginerally takes to huntin rigler in the scratchins  --  an mine you must hav a turky hown az iz bout 3 parts Dear Hown and the tother pinter , tho sumtimes haf and haf will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hown an dog az wer purty good , an a man cum along heer goin on 2 weez now az said az that he had wun az wur all dog , an that he wer fust raght ; but , az I sed at fust , a tuch of hown with a leetle pinter , maks a turki huntin dog sartin . As I was sain , you taks yur hown in the woods and you skeers up the turkis in the trees , an you pokes and kreeps sow az if you seed wun all the time . The fust thing you heer , you see the turkis goin in a streek off , then you must go on furder , an when you gits right , you must put sum bushes on a big logg and git behin it , an yelp on yur kwil , whitch must be of kane , or a wing bowne of a turki , az yelped coarse afor you killed it , will do . Wel you must hav a flint lok , an then yu la low , an snap an flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yu hexploads with a precushing gun the turkis they put and wawks Sphanish , which means a turki trot , an then to catch em yu must go on furder besides makin turkis wilde . Iv seen bad huntin make turkis so wild that they would run wen they heerd anybody yelpt , and they would run every time they gobbled . A feller down on Big Kooney sez az that heez seed em so wild az that they would cluck an put rown his tree an when the old wun cum up they would fly off an wait to kno for sartin it was her , an that he has seen em put their heds in swamp hols , an hollar logs afore they gobbled . But I cant certifi to this fellers tails , but sartin turkis kno what yu want an ai nt thar wen yu pokes yur hed rown a tree for em . Well , this kind of huntin continus tu about the Middel of febberry , an then yu must leav yur turki hown at home , az the hens begin tu lai thar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the fust of Octobure cums agin . Well , yu goz on mornins and evenins , an yu pokes an kreeps bout like snaix ( you kno how snaix goz ) an this wa sumtims yu gits wun an sumtims yu do nt git wun ; whil this iz goin on yu haz rale sport , and yu uze your kane or kwil so as to attrak the gobblers az iz now struttin an a gobblin off sum of that sort a feelin az iz purty kommon to awl the awnymals bout this seezen o ' the year . Sum peeple murder the turkis this time o ' year by roosten em ( finding their roosts ) an buckshooten on em , but no rale hunter wil do that , less he haz cumpenny az wants gaim , or sum ladi wants a turki tale for a phan , or sum sich want . Thar , I 'm got a nu twinge in mi fute , an feal kinder sleepy 2 , and maybee the romeytis ai nt jist about got me treed , but that diseease duz yerk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lait an ile kwit . Yourn az same az anne boddi . I always sines myself Stoke Stout , Tho Ime ginnerally called " OLD STOKE . ' Section Old Stoke Stout is one of the genuine turkey hunters of Louisiana , and we are glad that the " roomeytis " has driven him from necessity to use his " kwil " in the literary , as well as in the " turki huntin " ' line . He is unquestionably one of the best letter writers of the day , and would probably cut Willis out of the " National Intelligencer , " if he would make proposals to Messrs . Gales and Seaton . We hope to hear from him often , and we send our respects.  --  Eds . " Intelligencer . " STOKES 'S ADVENTURE WITH MR . STIGGINS 'S BULL . In the following letters , Mr. Stout details what we conceive to be one of the most extraordinary cases of Mesmerism on record , not excepting Miss Martineau 's . As this " science " is attracting considerable attention at this time , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour by the " sucking philosophers " of the day . As Stoke discovers an individuality in whatever he writes , like Carlyle , Sydney Smith , Macauley , and other eminent belles-lettres scholars , we give " the direction " of his communication to the " Intelligencer "  --  " Concordee Intelliggincer . " Videllai , Loozzanny , " Close to Natches , on tuther side . " In the corner , was the following :  --  " One Male Letter . " The letter itself should be included in D'Israeli 's next edition of his " Curiosities of Literature . " Here it is :  --  Letter - Stait of Loozzyanny On Bio Chuc-a-luch Close on to Crismus , Dec. twenty-4th . Mistur Eddyturs ,  --  Thar cum a tchap upp frum Bigg Koony las weake , askin after Old Stoke Stout ! an ' I'me jist a gwine to lett yu no az that peeple is tu bizzy bout peeple . Now I'me thru that part . I 've gott a sirkumstanse to relawt wat tuk plase 2 mee . Well ! the Bioz ar awl riz now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'me upp in the hills , tho ' I awllers date frum hum . Well ! tuther dui I went owt a huntin ' with that yere other feller frum Koony , an ' I maid owt tu kil won turki , twix mi gunn , an ' two or 3 stix , an ' mi dogg , an ' a harde runn . Arter I got threw , what with klimin the hills , an ' roomytis , I wur sort a drowzey , an ' putt offe mediately fur watur that I node waz klose down the holler . I diddent pull a bai leefe too drink out ov as fur kommon , but jist drapt mi gunn by the pathe , an ' tuck upp the holler a pease , an ' sot downe on mi kneas an ' pawz , an ' I mout an ' I moutent ov tuck 2 or three swollers , wen I heerde sumkin sai , " Phfo-o-o ! " loud nor I can rite it , an ' specktin what it wer , I sez to miself , " I'ze back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sott , an ' thar wur Old Mister Stiggins ' bull , thot old yaller feller yu kno , what haz the karracktur ov the ternest down , an ' moast dangersummest bull in the raynge . He lookt kinder puzzled , an ' I wer bent on keepin him in the dark , ov what I wer  --  fur I node him an ' his trix ultimately fur the last 10 yer . So I krept thru the mudd an ' water a lookin ' fur a hole to skrew intu , but the fust won I seed wer ockkypide bi 2 snaixs az wer wide wake , an ' I wer kumpeled to traval furder , an ' at laste fownd won crosst bi 2 rutes , an ' sum how or nuther I put miself in . Well , I waunted my gunn , but the bull stood rite furnenst whar it war , an ' then I lockt up fur a plase to krawl out at , but seed no chanse az I wur hemed in bi bluffs ' bout 8 foot hi . In this fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twixt the horns , an ' thout how mutch he mit way , an ' seed how strong he lookt , an ' felt I wur a fool for not killin ' him 2 yer afore ; an I lookt sharp , an ' stared , an ' grind mi teath , an ' winct , an ' maid mowths at him , but he only lookt fearser an ' fearser . An ' then I wisht him sich gude grasse , an ' sitch gude wawter , an ' sitch gude every ting , az I node he would finde in a field , I thot ov , a half ov a mile offe ; an ' I wished this harde awl the tyme , an ' I buggun to swett powurfullye , an it drapt offe ov mee . Well , sum how , whil I stared at the bull , an ' wisht him every whar ruther than whar he wur , " Old Tony , " that wus his nayme , lookt sleeplike , an ' I wundered if he mout be gettin ' asleepe shure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ; but he stude so purpendicklar , that I thout I wur gawn fur sartin . So I prayde what littell I node how , an ' kept starin ' the bull in the face all the tyme . Directly , for I'me unabell to maike any kawlkalashun of the tyme , ( now min ' , this iz a fac , ) I tell yu fur sartin , that old Mr. Stiggins ' old yaller bull , " Toney , " turned hisself rown , an ' maide rite far the very plase I'de been wishin ' him at . I gott out ov the hole , gathured mi gunn , maide trax up the nex hil , tu whar my kreeter wer hitcht , an ' I kwit them " scratchins " fur the laste time , kwicer nor I never maide owt ov any woodst yit . When I kum 2 like , an ' kood brethe a little , I buggun to thinck , an ' I wer pestured mitily ; an ' az soon az I gott tu the howse , I tells Mister Adverb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he saide to mee , " Yu mesmerized the bull , an ' then maide him gow tu the phield yu wisht him att . " It may be so , but I shall nuver furget the jogriphy ov that hollar in which the bull kawt me . Yours , az same as anne bodie . Stoke Stout .
