txt WE continue to occupy our pages to a considerable extent with the affairs of the present war . The time will come we hope , at no distant day , when we may feel ourselves at liberty to turn to other topics of great public concern-possibly , inthe estimation of some of our readers , already too long neglected . But , for ourselves , we regard this war as the great political and moral crime of the period , and for which the administration of the day is to be held responsible before God and man . We must do our part to hold the guilty authors of it to their just accountability . It is true , that in many other respects and particulars , this administration deserves , in our judgment , the severest reprehension of the American people , and we shall not fail in due time to lend a hand , in our humble way , towards bringing all its extraordinary merits before the country , under the light of a calm , but thorough and searching , investigation and review . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to think of the administration in any other aspect or attitude , than such as has reference to this war . Whenever we turn our regards that way , we see its gaunt effigy before us in helmet and plume , and brandishing its bloody spear , instead of wearing , as it ought , the civic wreath , and the garments of peace . At present , therefore , we are forced to deal with it as a fighting administration ; by and by , we may help to celebrate its civic virtues . Nor do we feel any apprehension lest the sympathy of our readers , and of the public , should not be found to go along with us in the feelings we indulge of the paramount interest which attaches to the whole subject of the war in which we are involved . One thing we know ; that no more fatal proof could be given that the country was ripening for disastrous revolution and ruin , than would be afforded by the passive and unconcerned acquiescence of the people in such acts and proceedings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of common probity , as have marked the conduct of the executive and administration in nearly every thing which concerns our relations with Mexico and the war . The subject to which this article will be devoted , is the mission of Mr. Slidell to Mexico . The administration having led the way into this war , manifests , sis is very natural , a particular solicitude to make the most of every occurrence in our relations with Mexico , which night seem to afford the United Stat* just ground of complaint against that power . The rejection of our minister was such an occurrence . As a mission of peace instituted by the administration , we are every way desirous , as between us md Mexico , that it should be set down to the national credit ; but we are not disposed to let // this affair pass before the American people , for one of the causes of the present war , or as tending to justify , in any the slightest degree , that military demonstration , under executive orders , which has brought the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we mean to show why we think , that this mission might have been , and ought to have been made successful , notwithstanding the conduct of Mexico in regard to it ; that a little less pretension and a little more patience would have done the work ; and , in short , that if the President had been as sincerely anxious to restore friendly relations between*the two powers , and secure a peace , on terms which ought to have satisfied a just and magnanimous nation , as he was to wring from the necessities , or the fears , of Mexico , concessions to gratify the spirit of territorial aggrandizement on our part , we should then have had peace , and this discreditable war would never have been heard of . This mission was instituted under peculiar circumstances , and no doubt , in its inception , is to be taken as evidence of a sincere desire on the part of the President to bring about an accommodation with Mexico . We had then a serious difficulty pending with England , and two wars at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the administration persuaded itself , no doubt , that if Mexico would consent to open negotiation at all with this country so soon after annexation  --  the great measure of offence-without striking a blow , she was probably ready , from the same considerations of inexorable fate and necessity , not only to submit , without a word , to the excision of Texas from her empire according to its ancient limits , but to yield also , on easy terms , other large portions of coveted territory besides . The public have not been permitted to see the instructions furnished to Mr. Slidell ; but we venture to say , when they shall come to light , it will be foxmnd that they contemplated the most imp ortant territorial acquisitions . In this , as in every thing else connected with t his Mexican business , we believe it will . flnally appear that the administration ham3 acted on the most erroneous and mistLken estimate of the Mexican character . To judge correctly of this mission , we must begin with recurring to the very singular att*.tude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico had denounced annexation by anticipation ; she had declared that she should regard it as a hostile act towards her , to be met , on her part , with the most determined resistance . Her minister was withdrawn from this country , and she refused to admit Mr. Shannon , our minister in that country , to any official intercourse with that government , and he was finally , after several months ' useless delay , compelled to return to the United States . " Since that time , " says the President in his annual message to Congress of December , 1845 , " Mexico has , until recently , occupied an attitude of hostility towards the United States-has been marshaling and organizing armies , issuing proclamations , and avowing the intention to make war on the United States , either by an open declaration , or by invading Texas . " And this attitude of hostility on her part was met by corresponding preparations and movements by our government . An efficient military force was moved to the right bank of the Nueces , and thus took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas proper , and looking towards Mcxico , while the Mexican coasts in the Gulf were occupied by our navy . Such was the state of things between the two countries when the attempt to bring about an accommodation was made by our government . Information had been received at Washington , which satisfied the government that Mexico was not at all likely to make any actual warlike demonstration , though she still maintained , and probably would continue to maintain , an attitude of hostility . It was believed that she was ready to be conciliated ; and such undoubtedly was the fact . The government was then in the hands of Herrera , who was sincerely desirous of coming to a satisfactory arrangement with the United States . This is testified to on all hands . Accordingly , in the month of September ( 1845 ) , instructions were sent from Washington to our consul at Mexico , " to ascertain from the Mexican government whether they would receive an envoy from the United States , intrusted with full power to adjust all the questions in dispute between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to the Mexican minister of state by Mr. Black , the consul , in the precise language of his instructions . The reply was promptly given by the minister , in terms which we shall // quote for the better understanding of the whole case . " In answer , " says that functionary , " I have to say to you , that although the Mexican nation is deeply injured by the United States , through the acts committed by them in the department of Texas , which belongs to this nation , my government is disposed to receive the commissioner of the United States who may come to this capital with full powers from his government , to settle the present dispute in a peaceful , reasonable , and honorable manner " As my government , " he adds , " believes this invitation to be made in good faith , and with the real desire that it may lead to a favorable conclusion , it also hopes that the commissioner will be a person endowed with the qualities proper for the attainment of this end ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreetness and reasonahleness of his proposals , will contrihute to calm as much as possible the just irritation of the Mexicans ; and , in fine , that the conduct of the commissioner on all points may be such as to persuade them that they may obtain satisfaction for their injuries , through the means of reason and peace , and without being obliged to resort to those of arms and force . " It was upon the acceptance of the proposals made by our government , in the terms here recited , that Mr. Slidell was sent to Mexico . A single glance at the language employed in this correspondence on the one side and the other , as we have quoted it , is sufficient to reveal at once to a casual observer , the very different views which the respective parties entertained in regard to the character of this mission ; and yet it is quite probable-certain , perhapsthat this difference was not , at the moment , perceived by either of them . On the one band , the President and his cabinet were blinded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission required by it , by the ambitious and covetous longings in which they indulged towards the proper possessions of Mexico . Their eyes were gloating over the lands of our neighbor , lying between the proper limits of Texas and the Great North River of the Mexicans ; including parts of four other departments of Mexico , with Santa F* , and then stretching away to the Pacific , and embracing the best portions , or the whole , of the Californias : and heaven knows how much more besides . Occupied with these visions of aggrandizement and glory , it was easy for them to find-in the circumstance of the ready assent of Mexico to listen to proposals for accommodation , after all that had occnrred to wound and dishonor her , taken in connection with the known distractions in her domestic councils-very sufficient evidence that her national spirit and power of resistance were already broken ; her ancient Castilian pride bowed and humbled in the dust ; or , at least , that nothing was left of it but the pompous and sounding phrase , falling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decayed and wasted greatness and glory . They saw in her , in short , a prepared victim ; ready for whatever spoliation they might think it judicious and prudent to inflict upon her . But , of course , appearances were still to be preserved and , under the arrangement made with our consul , the President prepared to honor Mexico , by sending her " an EnvoyExtraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary , to reside near the government of the Mexican Republic ! " Mr. Slidell received his letter of credence to this effect , and was forthwith dispatched on his mission ; neither the President , nor the Secretary of State , nor the Envoy himself , ever once doubting that Mexico , who had a few months before , in the most formal and marked manner , refused to hold any diplomatic intercourse with the United States , and put herself on her rights before the world as having been deeply injured , was now prepared , without any change in the condition of things , to re-establish diplomatic relations with us , precisely on the terms and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , much surprised and very indignant , when they discovered that nothing was farther from the thought of Mexico than to submit to such a humiliation-for so at least she regarded it . When the United Statestired of a state of things , which , if it was not actual war , certainly was not peace - proposed to Mexico to send her " an Envoy , intrusted with full power to adjust all the questions in dispute between the two governments , " it was natural that she should understand , looking all the while aL her own side of the case , that the United States were about to institute a special mission to remove , if possible , those obstacles which had stood in the way , and otherwise must continue to stand in the way , of a recurrence to their former relations of intercourse and // amity . There was one principal cause of the rupture between the two powersfor it was nothing less than a rupturenamely , the annexation of Texas to the United States ; and Mexico unquestionably looked to be appeased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded it ) , before friendly relations could be restored ; and she imagined , vainly enough as it turned out , that it was the special object of this mission , first of all , to offer her the atonement due to this offence . When the United States talked of sending her an envoy to adjust the questions in dispute between the two governments , she thought of nothing but annexation as having caused any dispute whatever , which had led to the interruption of the good understanding between them . The language of Mr. Peiia y Peiia 's note , which we have quoted , bears unequivocal proof of this fact-though it had escaped , as we kave explained , the observation of our government . The wrong which Mexico had received in the measure of annexation is especially referred to , and is spoken of in immediate connection with " the present dispute " - the one principal matter of difference-which " the Commissioner of the United States " was coming to settle . And the minister follows this up with the expression of a confident hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent and moderate , and so discreet and reasonable-that the Mexican people might see that they were about to " obtain satisfaction for their injuries " - namely , on account of annexation-by a voluntary reparation , without the necessity of an appeal to arms . In the correspondence on this subject , the Envoy , who was expected , was constantly called by the Minister , " the Commissioner , " and nothing but " the Commissioner . " And no diplomatic correspondence of the present day ever speak 's of an ambassador , envoy , or minister , of any grade , regularly accredited , and resident near the government of a friendly power , as a commissioner . Such a thing is unknown in modem diplomatic writing or discourse . We venture to say that Mr. Slidell would have felt no little surprise , if , having been received in Mexico in the quality of a minister or envoy , to reside near that government , he had then been addressed in some official note , as the Commissioner of the United States . In short , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who will look attentively at the correspondence in the case , that Mexico intended all the while to stand on the defensiveto maintain , at least in appearance , her attitude of hostility  --  and to receive a diplomatic agent , if one was received at all , rather after the manner in which such agents are accepted in time of war , with a view to negotiation and the restoration of peace , than in any other mode . It was her policy , and a point of honor with her , from the time she broke with this country , to regard herself , and to be regarded by the world , as in a state of hostility to us , only just short of actual and active war . And in this state it was that she was to receive , as she believed , a " Commissioner , " to offer terms of conciliation and peace , and not a minister to sit down at her capital as a resident , as if no interruption of the friendly relations of the two powers had ever taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the settlement of difficulties which had not interrupted , but which , if neglected , might , one day or another , interrupt the good understanding existing between them . It was all very well , perhaps , for our government to offer such a mission as that which was sent to Mexico in the person of Mr. Slidell ; but how it could have been expected that such a mission would be accepted , or how the administration came to imagine that Mexico had agreed to receive such a mission , after reading Mr. Peiia y Pefia 's note , would pass our comprehension , if we did not know how utterly incapable it has constantly seemed , in the blind pursuit of its own objects , of understanding the first elements of the Mexican character , or the first principles on which its conduct towards that people should have been regulated . Surely nothing would have been easier than to have arranged this mission , in the first instance , on the basis of a special agency , exactly adapted to the peculiar relation in which the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first of all , definite terms of accommodation and peace . In this there would have been no sacrifice of national honor , and no want of self-respect . It would have been a mission quite as honorable in all respects to the eminent gentleman intrusted with it . Mr. Slidell might have borne also , and at the same time , if such had been his ambition , a letter of credence , as minister , " to reside near the government of the Mexican Republic , in the quality of envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary of the // United States of America , " to which it is more than probable effect might have been given at an early day , after his reception in the more appropriate quality of a commissioner of peace . But we have no hesitation in saying that this last is the only capacity in which he should have been instructed , or in which he should have attempted to present himself , in the first instance , before the Mexican Republic . Had this been done , and had his instructions allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his demands , we do not entertain a doubt , notwithstanding the characteristic instability and distractions which reigned at the time at the Mexican capital , that , with a proper stock of patience and some judicious humoring of Mexican peculiarities , he might have made a treaty with that power , averting the impending war , and securing a perpetual peace , on terms alike favorable and honorable to both countries . Certainly it was not the way to bring about so desirable a result , that Mr. Slidell must needs make a descent on the Mexican capital , as if he had alighted from some superior region of brightness , bearing a gracious message to a perverse people , and denouncing woe and vengeance on them if found slow to receive him , in whatever ineffable shape he might choose to present himself . To offer himself as he was instructed to do , and as he did , in the quality of minister , commissioned exactly in the ordinary form , to reside near that government , was just to say to Mexico in her teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but war : " We conclude you have now swallowed your resentment about the affair of annexation , and think yourself a fool , for having indulged any feeling on the subject , or at least for having shown any such feeling , or talked about war . You have come to your senses , knowing your weakness in the presence of Anglo-Saxons , and by consenting to receive a minister from the United States , and renew intercourse with that power , exactly on the footing of the most friendly nations , without even a word of apology or explanation , you mean to confess before the world , that you have been wrong in this matter from the beginning ; that Texas belongs of right to the United States , and was rightfully acquired , and that nothing now remains for you but to hear what we have to propose in regard to boundary , and perhaps some further unimport*nt slices from your territory , in connection with the settlement of the claims we have upon you , when , with only a becoming degree of submissiveness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two powers will come to a good understanding in all things : and henceforward , as in times past , be the best friends in the world ; " XVe mean to say explicitly that , in our judgment , to send such a mission to Mexico as that with which Mr. Slidell was intrusted , was just to assume and proclaim , that Mexico had lost either the disposition or the ability to resent what she deemed , and had declared to the world , to have been an insult and outrage to her , and that she was willing to confess as much , by accepting a minister on precisely such terms as if nothing in the world had happened to interrupt the relations of perfect amity between the two powers . The only open act by which she had signified her sense of the injury she professed to have received , was that of suspending , in the most significant and marked manner , and with threats of war , all diplomatic intercourse with us ; thus breaking the bonds of amity between her and us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we should see fit to approach her , in a proper form , for that purpose . If then she had received Mr. Slidell , in the first instance , as he insisted on being received , or not at all , it would have been a virtual withdrawal of that only act by which she had manifested any sense of injury , and a virtual confession that she was satisfied on that score ; and , having no complaints to urge on her part , was now ready to enter on the subject of whatever complaints Mr. Slidell might have to make against her . What we have now said is sufficient to indicate our undoubting conviction , that there was that in the manner of instituting this mission of Mr. Slidell to Mexico , which was every way calculated to defeat its object . We hold the Administration to blame for not having placed it on a different and more acceptable basis , and especially after what seems to us so very plain on the face of Mr. Peiia y Pejia 's note , that Mexico expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rank and pretensions of Mr. Sliclell . But we have not yet done with the subject of this mission . We have no special impeachment of motives to offer in regard to the sending // of this mission . We are willing to take it for granted that it was intended in good faith , and undertaken with a sincere desire to bring about an accommodation with Mexico , and avoid a war . Our impeachment has reference to what we hold to be palpable errors of judgment in regard to it , and , amongst other things , in reference to the tone and temper in which so important and delicate a mission should have been undertaken and conducted . We do not mean to say that under the best conduct and management it would certainly have resulted in success , because we do not know to what unreasonable lengths Mr. Slidell might not have pushed his demands , under the instructions of the government . Of course , we have little confidence in the moderation and justice of an administration that has shown itself capable of risking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper boundaries of the American empire . With , however , a proper degree of moderation and justice , we see no reason why this mission of peace , if it had been instituted in the proper form and conducted in the right temper , should not have been entirely successful . Mr. Slidell arrived at Vera Cruz on one of the last days of November , and immediately pressed forward towards the capital . The news of his arrival on the coast had reached the city of Mexico on the 3d of December , and had thrown the Mexican government into great perplexity . Although the arrangement made with our consul , Mr. Black , by the government of Herrera , to receive a commissioner from the United States , had been an affair of the utmost confidence and secrecy , yet it had already come to the ears of the people , and was made a principal ground of assault on Herrera and his party . So long as no commissioner or minister was actually in the country , the government seemed able to stand up against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this juncture , it expected to be utterly overwhelmed if such a functionary should suddenly present himself at the capital . Mr. Black was immediately informed of the alarm and embarrassment felt by the government at the arrival of Mr. Shidell at Sacrificios , and he xva* earnestly desired , if it was possible , to prevail on Mr. Slideli not to come immediately to the capital , or even to disembark at that time from his vessel . " His appearance in the capital at this time , " said the minister of foreign affairs , " might prove destructive to the government , and thus defeat the whole affair . You know the opposition are calling us traitors , for entering into this arrangement with you . " The anxious desire of the government was for delay until the next month , when the new Congress , which had been summoned , would assemble , and when , under its countenance and protection , it might feel itself strong enough to enter on this delicate business . They declared that they had not expected the commissioner until January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital would probably produce a revolution which would terminate in the destruction of the present government . Mr. Black seemed every way disposed to do what he could in the premises ; he set out immediately from Mexico , and met Mr. Slidell at Puebla , eighty-five miles from the capital . His representations , however , did not arrest the progress of the minister , who made his entrance into the capital on the evening of the 6th of December . This was Saturday , and , as if afraid of losing something of dignity or advantage , whether to himself or his country , should he indulge in the least delay , in spite of the warning and entreaty which had been conveyed to him , he addressed himself promptly , on Monday , to the minister of foreign relations , in a note as formal and severe as if the Pope 's nuncio had written it to some Christian potentate who was suspected of " damnable heresy . " It ran in this wise " The undersigned , who has been appointed envoy.extraordinary and ministerplenipotentiary of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor to inform your Excellency that he arrived in this capital on the evening of the 6th instant , and requests to be informed of the time and place at which he may have the honor to be admitted to present his letter of credence ( a copy of which he encloses ) to the most excellent President of the Republic of Mexico , Gen. Jose Joachim Herrera . " So , Mr. Slidell had not only persisted in coming straight to the capital , where , he had been told , his presence at that moment would signally tend to the overthrow of the government of Herreraa government admitted to be sincerely desirous of negotiating with the United States for a peace-not only had he come // to the capital , but he had , at the earliest moment , proclaimed his mission , and demanded to be received and his commission of minister-plenipotentiary publicly recognized . The only effect which had been produced on the mind of the minister by the revelations made to him . at Puebla by Mr. Black , seems to have been to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was playing a game with him , or meditating bad faith towards him ; and anticipating , as he says he did , delays and difficulties in placing himself in relation with the government , he seems to have resolved to sound at once the depths of these de* lays and difficulties , and to know the worst . Nobody certainly can dispute the gallantry of his bearing on the occasion ; our doubt is about its prudence and wisdom . Mr. Black was the bearer of Mr. Slidell 's note to the Mexican minister of state , and the minister took that occasion to repeat to Mr. Black that they had not expected the arrival of the commissioner at so early a day ; that they were engaged in collecting the opinions of the departments with a view to strengthen themselves in regard to this mission ; that the government was every way favorably disposed , but the opposition to the mission was very powerful and compelled them to proceed with great caution ; that nothing positive could be done until the new Congress should meet in January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the minister 's credentials , examine them , and be treating en the subject . " To our apprehension , all this was uttered with perfect truthfulness and good faith ; nor can we see , with the admissions and declarations made by Mr. Slidell in the course of his correspondence with his government , how he could have believed otherwise-if , indeed , he did believe otherwise . More than once he expresses the confident opiniun that Herrera and his Cabinet were sincerely desirous of negotiating , and terminating all their differences with the United States . And he declares it to be his belief that " the great object of the administration is to gain time , to do nothing to compromise themselves , in the hope that if they can hold over until the meeting of the new Congress which will take place on the 1st of January , they will then he enabled to maintain their position . " It is a little strange , we think , after all this , that Mr. Sliddll should have borne himself towards the Mexican administration precisely as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first , that they were actuated solely by bad faith towards him and his government , and a desire and intention to amuse him for a time with false pretences , and finally to rid themselves of him altogether . Some such impression must have taken possession of him , when we find him , notwithstanding the explanations already given to Mr. Black , and notwithstanding his own convictions of the policy and necessity of extreme caution and delay on their part , impatiently following up his note of the 8th of December by reiterated demands for an answer . On the 13th he sent Mr. Black to the minister of state with a verbal message to this effect ; and on the 15th he addressed him another note , complaining of the delay , and desiring to be informed when he might expect to reply to his first note . Now we are free to say that we think this importunity , under the circumstances , was unnecessary and very injurious to the interests of his mission . The policy which the administration had wished to be left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they would receive the minister 's credentials , examine them , and be treating on the subject . " Their avowed object was to gain time until the meeting of the new Congress , when they hoped to be so supported in their position , as to be able to give effect and success to this mission . Delay was exactly what they wanted to save themselves , and save the mission ; and delay was exactly what Mr. Slidell would not consent to-though apparently aware of its importance and necessity . We think Mr Slidell conimitted a capital mistake in the first place , when he rushed on to the city of Mexico against the earnest solicitations of the government as conveyed to him by Mr. Black at Puebla . And then , we think , that having arrived at Mexico , he was too impatient to be recognized as " envoy-extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States of America . " Considering the condition of Ilerrera and the state of the government at that period , a few weeks ' delay would have been judicious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have saved **44;1275;TOOLONG thus have brought the mission to a happy termination . As it turned out , the goveminent of Herrera fell , as it had been confidently predicted it would fall if Mr. // Slidell then came to the capital ; whether it would have been able to maintain itself , if Mr. Slidell had not done so , we can not know ; but so much is certain , the prin .. principal weapon used against it was drawn from this mission , and the appearance of the minister at Mexico . We do not mean to say that Mr. Slidell would have been received and accredited by the Mexican Government , whether in the hands of Herrera , or Paredes , or of any body else , so long as he insisted on being admitted , if at all , as minister , to reside near that government . It is evident that from the moment a copy of his letter of credence was seen , this objection was raised , and it was constantly insisted on . It was , indeed , at last complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexican diplomacy ; and the true force of this single objection to the reception of the minister was spoiled , and rendered nearly ridiculous , by the bungling manner in which it was handled . Nevertheless the ob*jection remained . Mexico would not consent to receive a minister commissioned as Mr. Slidell was , lest she should be thought thereby to admit that she was reconciled to the measure of annexation , and reconciled to this country . It is not likely she could have been moved from this position . What the duty of Mr. Slidell was in such a case , and of our government , is plain enough , to our own mind . He should have stood still , and asked the President to send him a new letter of credence , by which Mexico might have been informed that he appeared there as a special commmissioner appointed to negotiate with her for an accommodation of the dispute which had led to the interruption of the friendly relations between the two powers , and finally for the settlement of all their difficulties , and for peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been and would have been received , either by the government of Herrera , or that of Paredes . So , at least , both administrations solemnly declared and proclaimed . And we think it was exactly at this point that the golden opportunity e. was lost by our government-of composing all our difficulties with Mexico , and securing a peace on terms mutually advantageous and honorable . Certainly , we need not tell Mr. Slidell , with his shrewdness and ability , that no advantage could have been won by Mexico , if with the proper commission and instructions in his pocket , the subject of Texas and annexation had been first brought under diplomatic discussion . Everybody understands how this sore place was expected to be salved over . And the consideration of that question could not have been more than begun , before it would have been discovered , that the question of boundary and its extension , and the question of our pecuniary claims , must come in of necessity , to help resolve the knotty point of annexation . Annexation had been effected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open question of boundary between us and Mexico ; and the Mexican government had been carefully and repeatedly informed and assured , from the first , that we were ready to a4just that question , in a manner the most liberal towards that country . This promised liberality had a meaning which could not have been , and was not misunderstood . We were willing to pay her liberally for Texas , with a liberal boundary-that was what we meant to say , and what we were understood to have said . And if Mr. Slidell could have thought it consistent with his dignity , to offer himself to Mexico , under proper instructions , as a " commissioner , ** to tender to that country terms of conciliation to this effect , who can doubt that at least he would have been received , and listened to with respect ? What the Mexican government wanted , first of all , was such a mission , and such reasonable proposals on our part , as might " contribute to calm as much as possible , the just irritation of the Mexicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Mexican people , ) that they might obtain satisfaction for their injuries , through the means of reason and peace , and without being obliged to resort to those of arms and force . " We have not a doubt that a sum of money , equal to one-tenth , or even onetwentieth , of the amount already expended in our war with that power , tendered , at the period referred to , in a spirit of justice , of conciliation , and peace , and with some proper consideration for the temper of the Mexican people , and the embarrassments of the administration of the day , would have secured us Texas with any reasonable boundary which might have been desired , and kept us out of a war . In the same operation , it is not improbable that we might have acquired , by a little extra-liberality , a desirable port for ourselves out of her possessions on the Pacific . No public man in this country , who is well informed in // regard to the state of our relations with Mexico at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitous to be appeased for the loss of Texas , through pecuniary considerations , if only they should be so addressed to her as to make it seem as if she was driving a free and profitable bargain with us , and was not selling her honor . As for fighting with us for the possession of the proper country of Texas - attempting to reconquer that country , and wrest it by force from the grasp of our firm hold upon it-that was a thing almost too absurd for her even to talk about , certainly it was the last enterprise she wished in earnest to undertake . What all her public men and leading characters agreed in desiring was , that we should afford them the means of offering to the Mexican people some justifiable , or at least plausible reason or pretext for giving Texas up to its destiny . Nor was this at all a difficult achievement for diplomacy , with all its boasted skill , to accomplish-else , assuredly , diplomacy is worth very little . Diplomacy was worth very little in this case , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this war . How easily it might have done so-how it failed , and why it failed to do so , it is the main purpose of this article to show . Texas , as we have said , was annexed with an undefined boundary . It was annexed on terms agreed upon between the authorities of that country as an independent power , and the United States . Mexico was not consulted , nor her consent asked , though she still claimed that Texas was not free from her political dominion . iBut though Mexico was not consulted in regard to the question , or the right of annexation , yet the very terms of annexation proposed by ourselves , made Mexico in some sense a party to the transaction . XVe had got Texas , with so much territory as the independent republic of that name had a right to convey , and how much that was , was an open question , to which Mexico was confessedly a party . Here was a chance for diplomacy to step in , and , by fixing a boundary where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal compensation on our part to Mexico , for whatever claim or interest she might have , or should fancy herself to have , on this side of that boundary , take to ourselves whatever " outstanding title " there might be in the case , and thus at once satisfy our own sense of justice , and smooth down all asperities towards us on the part of the jealous and offended Mexican . Strictly , we must know very well , that our title , derived from the Republic of Texas , gave us just so much territory as she had actually conquered , held and governed , in the progress of her revolt and revolution , and no more . So much annexation gave us , without regard to Mexico , and no more . But even how much this was exactly , was not undisputed . It gave us , doubtless , the ancient province of Texas proper , to the Nueces ; and across the Nueces , Texas had some quiet settlements , along the narrow valley of that river towards the Gulf , over which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim as a part of our bargain . But there was here even ndthing ascertained and certain ; and then beyond , Texas had shot her paper pellets over a broad domain , to which she set up a certain kind of pretension . Here , at least , our claim , as succeeding and representing the Texan Republic  --  a revolutionary government-was slight enough . And here it was , just in this dim and shadowy region , where champions on the one side and on the other might have waged eternal war on each other in the dark , with no definite result-here it was that diplomacy might have come in , to shed her peaceful light , to reconcile blind enmities , allay fruitless jealousies , and bring in unity and concord to reign in the place of fierce hate and revenge . Why might not Mr. Slidell , content for a while to act the part of a Commissioner , specially deputed to offer terms of conciliation to our sensitive neighbor , in regard to annexation , have so managed this business as to make Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , no ultimate wrong ? Annexation having become a fixed affair , a thing past and done , the people of this country were settling down upon it , and they would have been quite willing-glad even  --  to have seen something liberal done on our part , in the way of pecuniary gratification , to render Mexico comfortable under the loss of that valuable province , which , to the last , she persisted in claiming as her own . We should all have felt better and more respectable in our own eyes , if in the end , we had paid Mexico something for Texas . We paid for Louisiana , and we paid for Florida ; and we are sure our people would much rather pay something for Texas than take and hold it against any claimant whatever , by force of arms . To Mexico , at least , Texas was lost by conquest , and as we // took the spoil to ourselves , even if our own men and arms had not been principally used in that conquest , as they notoriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reputation for honesty and fair dealing no harm , if we had consented or endeavored to reconcile Mexico to this dismemberment of her empire , by offering to make her some pecuniary compensation for her exscinded province , wrested from her by violence , and found in our possession , without having cost the nation a dollar . Nor was it necessary , if a false pride on our part , revolted at the idea of doing a direct act of justice to Mexico post facto , that a specific offer of payment for Texas proper should have been made . There was the open question of boundary to fall back upon . Texas was ours by our own title ; but the sum of our rightful possessions under that name , was an unliquidated and variable quantity ; and , besides , our government wanted more than any just man could pretend to claim of right . And with this door standing wide open , diplomacy might have entered here , one would think , without much difficulty , and with eminent advantage . It demanded no superior skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might have been just and conciliatory towards her , and not discreditable to ourselves . A new and liberal boundary-new , as never having been before recognized by Mexicomight have been agreed upon for Texas ; and a fixed sum of money might have been stipulated to be paid by us for Texas , with this new boundary . Mexico might have renounced , or ceded , as formally as she might desire , all right and title to any part of the country this side of such boundary , to the United States , with full liberty on her part , if she chose , to hold up this treaty before the Mexican people , as incontestable proof , that she had not submitted to the wrongs of annexation , or yielded up Texas to conquest and force at the hands of any power , but had only consented , at last , at our solicitation , to allow the United States to purchase that country of her , and a peace with her at the same time , for a round sum of money . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted for the satisfaction of their own people ; and we see nothing in the sort of arrangement here suggested , either impracticable in itself , or too much for Mexico to expect , or too much for us to yield . It must not be forgotten that the Mexican authorities , at this period , were sincerely desirous of avoiding a war ; that they were unaffectedly anxious that the United States should so approach the business of negotiation , and propose such terms of accommodation , as to make it safe for them , in reference to the state of parties in the Republic , and the temper of their people , to entertain and encourage the advance we were making . The point of difficulty which they had to contend with at home , was the prejudice and hatred towards us with which the Mexican people had been inspired , on account of annexation . The administration was charged with treason , when it was found , or believed , that a minister from this country had been invited , or allowed , to come to the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most friendly nations , and as if no offence or indignity had been offered to the republic , or as if she had concluded to swallow her resentment without a word of apology or explanation . It was perfectly clear that no administration could stand up against this popular sentiment . No administration could hold its place , which should not appear , at least , to take sides with the people in this embittered feeling . Mr. Slidell appears to have been perfectly aware of all this , and yet he seems not to have thought it worth while to give the slightest heed to the suggestions which came to him concerning the proper mode of relieving the administration of the embarrassment in which it was placed . He saw but one mode of conducting his mission , and that was , to insist on being received as a minister-plenipotentiary and resident , or to demand his passports . Perhaps his instructions , and the nature and character of the enterprise on which he was sent , admitted of nothing less ; it is quite possible . We shall know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of ' the mission shall ever be disclosed . But supposing-if , indeed , we are at liberty to suppose any such thing-that some degree of moderation prevailed in the counsels at Washington in regard to the objects of this mission , and that it was not instituted with the absurd expectation of dragooning Mexico , first into an unconditional submission to the measure of annexation with any far-off boundary for our Texan possessions which we might see fit to name , and next into such further dismemberment of her empire , on our own teyms , as our own dreams of // avarice or ambition might prompt us to demand ; supposing , we say , that some sort of moderation , and some idea of common justice , prevailed at Washington on the instituting of this mission , we must be allowed , upon this supposition , to hear our humble but undoubting testimony against the conduct of the mission , as calculated , in every way , to create rather than allay irritation among the Mexican people , and to bring embarrassment and ruin on the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxious to bring all our difficulties to a prompt accommodation and settlement . If this mission was not undertaken by our government with a sincere desire for a friendly accommodation , and on terms of common and equal justice , it ought to have been ; and if it was , or had been , so undertaken , we see no reason why it should have failed , except on account of the form in which it was instituted and so ungraciously persisted in , and of the lofty and uncompromising spirit and manner in which it was attempted to be conducted . We have not a doubt if Mr. Slidell had been permitted , or could have been contented , to present himself to Mexico as a " commissioner , " charged to bring about , by all proper means , the former friendly relations of the two powers , so unhappily interrupted by the measure of annexation , that he might then have purchased a most liberal boundary in the South and West for Texas , for the sum of five millions of dollars , or a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , every trace of troublesome resentment towards us on account of annexation , and , so far , placing the two Republics once more on a footing of peace and amity with each other . The subject of our unsatisfied claims might easily have been disposed of in the same arrangernent . We do not say that a boundary could have been obtained to satisfy the ambition of the President . We do not say , even , that that boundary could have been carried quite up to the Rio Grande , though possibly it might have been ; much less do we say that we could have secured , in such an arrangement , as a part of our Texan possessions , the whole country of New Mexico , or Santa F* , this side of that river , and much less still that we should have been allowed to run our western boundary across from the Paso del Norte to the Pacific by the 32d parallel , and thus bring the whole of Upper California within our limits and jurisdiction . Possibly we might have secured a capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and repeat , is , that this very mission of Mr. Slidell to Mexico , if it had been instituted in the proper form , conducted in a proper manner , and undertaken for proper and reasonable objects only , might , at that time , have been made to result in the acquisition , for a moderate sum of money , of a liberal boundary for Texas-pushed as far South and West as would have been just to Mexico or profitable to us-and of course in quieting completely and forever all resentment and irritation in reference to that grand source of trouble between the two powers , the measure of annexation . The adjustment of our claims on Mexico , and of all other differences , would necessarily have been included in this arrangement , or would have immediately followed . Of the truth of all this the history of the mission itself affords abundant proof . And we appeal now to our countrymen to say-men of all parties who love their country and its true glory-whether , when peace with Mexico , on such terms and with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and grasp of the President , whether they think it was worth the while that such a peace should have been flung away , and the country plunged into such a war as we are now cursed with , merely because Mr. Polk was unwilling that his envoy should be called a commissioner instead of a minister , or because his own views of personal fame and political success led him to clutch at extended and vast possessions in Mexico , which he vainly imagined , as they could not be obtained by negotiation , might be easily and speedily secured by a military demonstration , or at any rate by a touch of our quality in actual war . To one or the other , or both of these causes , in our belief , it is owing , that peace with Mexico , on just and honorable terms , was not secured when it might have been , and that the dreadful alternative of war was adopted . We have a right to conclude-the country has a right to conclude-that Mr. Slidell 's mission would have terminated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two powers , if he had once been received , and negotiations fairly entered upon . The Mexican government , first under Herrera , and finally under Paredes , re* fused to receive and accredit Mr. Slidell , " as envoy-extraordinary and minister- // plenipotentiary to reside near it . " In both cases the refusal was in the same terms , and on the same ground . At the same time , and to the last , Mr. Slidell was explicitly told , and so was the Secretary of State , that that government would , " with the utmost satisfaction , " proceed to treat with the envoy for the settlement " of the diff*erences existing between the two countries " - those , namely , having reference to annexation , which alone had caused the interruption of their friendly intercourse-as soon as he would present himself as a commissioner , charged specially with powers ad hoc ; adding also this assurance , that , the way being thus opened , and friendly relations re-established , the government would then , of course , have no difficulty in receiving Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And who , we ask , would have been injured , whose dignity would have been compromised , or what interest of the country would have been sacrificed , if Mr. Slidell had received and presented a letter of credence and instructions to the effect insisted on by the authorities of Mexico ? He lingered in Mexico after his first repulse , until new instructions were received ; . but unhappily he was only instructed to insist on his reception in the shape and character in which he had first presented himself . It must be that , or nothing ; or rather , it must be that , or war ! War was the purposed alternative deliberately adopted in the case ; and it was not a question between negotiation , and war . All the while Mexico professed herself ready and anxious to negotiate ; what she promptly and constantly refused was , to receive , in the first instance , a minister-plenipotentiary to reside near that government . Still she offered to negotiate with a commissioner , invested with powers ad hoc ; and to this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part then it was not a question between negotiation and war , but it was a question between negotiation through his minister-plenipotentiary commissioned to reside near the Mexican government , and war . He insisted that the negotiator on his part should sit down at once at the capital of the Mexican Republic exactly on the same footing of an envoy from the most friendly nation , or there should be no negotiation at all . Negotiation should begin in this form , or it should not begin at all ; and the alternative should be war ! It is manifest that it was the deliberate April , purpose of the administration to take this terrible alternative , and make their appeal promptly to the arbitrament of war . War was denounced against Mexico by Mr. Slidell , as the inerntable result of her refusal to receive him just as he presented himself to her ; and from the first to the last , he tendered his opinion to his government at home , that nothing would bring these Mexicans to their proper behavior but allittle salutary chastisement ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we must flog them , like refractory children , to make them mind their manners ! We are not surprised at any ignorance of the Mexican character on the part of Mr. Polk and Mr. Buchanan ; but we confess that we are amazed that Mr. Slidell should have so mistaken that people . But this purpose of war , rather than that Mr. Slidell should be received by Mexico only as a commissioner with special powers to treat of differences and for peace , we want the country to understand how decided and deliberate it was on the part of the President . Mr. Slidell was told by the Secretary of State ; " You ought so to conduct yourself as to throw the whole odium of the failure of the negotiation upon the Mexican government . " " The desire of the President is , that you should conduct yourself with such wisdom and firmness in the crisis , that the voice of the American people shall be unanimous in favor p ' .. . of war . " In the mean time , the President , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive you , has ordered the army of Texas to advance and take position on the left bank of the Rio Grande , and has directed that a strong fleet shall be immediately assembled in the Gulf of Mexico . " This was the fatal order of the 13th of January , given two months before the " final refusal " to receive Mr. Slidell and which precipitated and brought on the war . And so determined was the President on his purpose of war , or at least on a hostile demonstration , that this order was given and this warlike movement made , on the sole authority of the Executive , while Congress was in session under his eye , which alone has the power to make war . Congress was not only not consulted , but the profoundest secrecy was attempted to be observed at Washington in regard to this movement . It is perfectly manifest that the President did not dare to trust the subject with Congress-composed , though it was , of a large majority of his parti // sans , in both Houses . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warlike demonstration , either in anticipatio'n of Mr. Slidell 's return home from his bootless mission , or upon , or because of his return . He could not then , or at any time before the first blow was struck , have made a case , upon which Congress would have declared war . We believe he knew this perfectly well ; and he sent an army to the Rio Grande , with the deliberate and full purpose that thus a case should be made , as with the sword of Brennus , which should admit of no alternative but war-unless , indeed , Mexico should be found to be frightened from her propriety by his military demonstration , and abjectly submit without striking a blow ; for we believe the administration was weak enough to dream of the possibility of a bloodless achievement on this score ! But so much , at least , the President was evidently resolved on ; if the Mexicans will fight when their fields and peaceful firesides are invaded-if they will fight when we point a battery directly on the public square of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to that , they must lose , and we shall win . And how was it that the President was so prompt and so resolved to take extreme measures against Mexico ? He was not a soldier ; was not bred in camps ; had never " set a squadron in the field ; " had not shown himself " sudden and quick in quarrel , " or " sought the bubble , reputation , in the cannon 's mouth . " What did he want of a war in Mexico ? Well , it was not , we suppose , so much the war that he wanted , but he wanted Mexican territory  --  a rich province or two , cut out of her dominion , with which to illustrate the first term of his Presidency ; and as his first essay  --  the mission of Mr. Slidell-had been met in a temper to promise little for his plans of territorial aggrandizement through that mode , he resolved to try the other tack . We acquit him entirely of the sagacity to foresee to what a terrible war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing the country . We do him the justice to believe that he fancied that a demonstration of war , or at most a handsome " brush " with Mexico , just to make her " feel our strength " - as Mr. Slidell had advised-would be enough for his purpose ; enough to make Mexico treat with him on his own terms , and dispose her to relax a little the firmness of her grasp on some of those broad acres of hers , which seemed , in his eyes , so desirable a possession for the United States , especially if he might have the credit of making the acquisition . Still , he could not know to what lengths and straits the country might be driven in the war which he undertook to provoke , and he was willing to run all the risks and awful hazards of such an enterprise . That it was territory  --  the vehement desire to extend the dominion of the Republic , as a measure deemed of all others most grateful to the Roman ambition of our people-which moved Mr. Polk to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to challenge her to the combat , has never been matter of doubt with us , and must now be am parent to every one who has taken the trouble to look into the whole history of this business . To take and hold New Mexico and Upper California , was a principal object distinctly avowed and earnestly insisted on , in the earliest instructions given to the military and naval commanders , sent out on their errands of conquest to these countries . These in* structions included the command of the President forthwith to set up civil governments in the conquered countries ! Proceeding from one audacious step to another , he actually sent out a military colony from the city of New York , under the name of a regiment of volunteers , for permanent settlement in California . And upon the success of these military enterprises , the President ventured , in his last annual Message to Congress , to congratulate the country on " the vast extension of our territorial limits . " Who could believe , in the face of facts like these , the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stale declaration , that the " war had not been waged with any view to conquest ! " But it was sufficiently characteristic of the whole of that extraordinary document , that he should assert nevertheless , in the very same paragraph , that the war , since it had been begun , had been carried into the enemy 's country , and should be prosecuted , to secure there " ample indemnity " for the expenses of the war , as well as for our pecuniary claims on Mexico . This , of itself , was a sufficient avowal that , in the convenient name of indemnity for the expenses of the war  --  a war demonstrably begun by the President hmself-the contest had been and should be waged expressly with a view to the per . // manent conquest of Mexican territory , and the dismemberment of that empire by the sword . But this avowal has been recently repeated , in a still more explicit form . The President has asked and obtained of Congress three millions of dollars , to enable him to bring the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this money was proposed to be used , and with what object , was disclosed in the Senate by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , on introducing the Bill . We had already taken military possession of New Mexico and Upper California , and the chairman declared that , in making peace , " he supposed no Senator would think we ought to get less " than these two provinces . And this grand object of the war was expected to be secured , as nearly as could be understood from the oracular explanations of the chairman , while some chief-probably Santa Anna  --  and some faction along with him , should be in the possession of temporary power in Mexico , by making a judicious application and advance of these monies " to pay the expenses of their army , and other expenses , " and thus to purchase of them a peace , with a cession of these territories to the United States ! In other words , the money was to be used , not to buy the territories , for which it was manifestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make peace with us , and cede us the territories , or leave them to become ours by the law of uti possidetis ! Of course , it was only in strict accordance with the designs of the President in the conduct of this war , as thus at last openly avowed , that his party in the Senate rejected an amendment to the Three Million Bill , proposed by Mr. Berrien of Georgia , which declared , by way of proviso , " that the war with Mexico ought not to be prosecuted by this government with any view to the dismemberment of that republic , or to the acquisition by conquest of any portion of her territory . " We have now given the readers of this Journal an account of Mr. Slidell 's mission to Mexico , according to our understanding of it , with the causes of its failure , and the fearful alternative of war to which the President so promptly turned , in the face of all constitutional impediments , and with objects so utterly reprehensible . They will judge of the whole matter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how they like this being driven or dragged into a war , under such circumstances , and for such objects . We believe that the administra tion , or the country , one or the other , is preparing for a day of terrible retribution . A very recent proceeding on the part of the administration furnishes a very apt commentary on the wisdom and dignity of its policy towards Mexico , and to which it so obstinately adhered , in the matter of Mr. Slidell 's mission . The two countries then , though not at war , were in a state of hostility rather than a state of peace . To restore friendly relations , Mexico insisted that we must send her a commissioner , specially invested with powers to treat of the causes which had interrupted these relations ; but the President refused to send a commissioner , or any other than a minister plenipotentiary , to reside near that government . And upon this he proceeded to actual war . But now it would seemat last discovered , after we have had the calamities and horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may be quite a proper thing , as soon as we can find . a door of admission open to us , to send a commissioner , one or more , with special powers , to treat with Mexico for peace and for the restoration of friendly relations between the two countries . It is understood that the administration applied to the Finance Committee of the Senate , near the close of the late session of Congress , to procure an appropriation of 50,000 dollars for this object , and expressly on the ground that though Mexico might be willing to treat with us , yet a diplomatic mission in the ordinary form might not be acceptable to her . If just this easy concession had been made to Mexico fifteen months ago , this war might have been avoided ! How it is to be ended , now we are in it , is another question . In our honest conviction , we can have peace with Mexico only by abandoning , and disavowing , in the most explicit manner , every desire , and purpose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy it has so long cherished of dismembering that empire for the sake of aggrandizing our own . It must return to some sense , or some show , of honesty and fair dealing , before Mexico will ever treat with us for peace . Of this we have no doubt . Till this is done , our battles and military enterprises will give us brilliant achievements and barren victories-nothing else ; while our intrigues with whatever Mexican chief , or faction , backed by a corruption fund of three millions of dollars , will bring us nothing but national disgrace and dishonor.
