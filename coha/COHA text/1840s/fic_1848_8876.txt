TO MRS . JAMES K. PAIGE , AND THE MANY OTHER FRIENDS TO WHOSE ENCOURAGEMENT I AM INDEBTED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMMENCEMENT OF MY ENTERPRISE , I VENTURE TO DEDICATE THIS VOLUME IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR AID AND SYMPATHY . INTRODUCTION . It is customary for persons , on first presenting themselves for enrolment in the motley ranks of authorship , to offer to those dreaded inspectors , the critics , some reason for appearing before them , some excuse for deficiencies , which may propitiate or soften those guardians of the public taste . In adopting this usage , I will endeavour to be concise . It has been said that the world is indebted for great works to " the pressure of want without , and genius within " ; but to the first clause of the above-cited inspiration , and to a love of publicity , I believe it is conceded that we owe a large portion of the literature of the nineteenth century ; by sufferance and custom , the former has come to be received as a valid plea for admission into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other . I will not commit the mistake of offering many statements in palliation of the crudeness of these performances ;  --  it is to personal friends alone that we can look for sympathy or patience with such details ;  --  one only shield will I venture to place between their defects and deserved censure , which is , that these plays were written between the age of twenty and twenty-three , a period at which much literary power or finish is not expected even of the stronger sex , with their superior opportunities of thought and study . With this excuse ( which , if not well grounded , must vanish before the first glance of fair investigation ) I will intrude no longer on the attention of the courteous reader , than to express here , as in my Dedication , my heartfelt sense of the exceeding kindness and encouragement which have enabled me to persevere in an undertaking that would have been otherwise so hazardous and painful .

The Scene is in the Province of Xaragua , in the Island of Hayti . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A grove before Roldan 's dwelling . Roldan , De Escobar , De Moxica , Reguelme , and other Spaniards . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan At length , my friends , our triumph is complete ! In yielding we are conquerors ! Colon No longer dares oppress the sons of Spain , But , awed by our resistance to his sway , Resigns his hope t ' enslave us . Here behold The treaty which our firmness has obtained ! The Admiral empowers me to resume My office of chief judge ; restores my lands ; Grants me extensive tracts within this province , With slaves to till the soil . For you , my friends , Whose loyal aid enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have required As just conditions ;  --  liberal grants of land , And , ' stead of tribute from the native chiefs , It is arranged that parties of their subjects , At stated times , shall aid to cultivate The soil allotted to you . On these terms We are agreed to lay aside our arms , And rest content beneath the viceroy 's rule . REGUELME . Pedro Reguelme Noble Alcalde , let us here repeat Our former vows of fealty ! To you We owe our freedom ! When the Admiral , Departing for Spain 's shores , gave to his brothers , Without authority from Ferdinand , The government of Hayti , you it was Descried the bonds they wished to rivet on us , And roused us to resistance . Led by you We still have triumphed . Here let each renew Thanks for the past ! Let all here bend the knee , Tendering their vows of future faith ! Alcalde , Receive my homage ! All kneel . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Thanks , my noble friends ! Roldan is not ungrateful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint Reguelme the Alcalde of Bonao . REGUELME . Pedro Reguelme Alcalde , you overwhelm me by thus adding New benefits to those before conferred . Your gifts make me your slave . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan My valued friend : Ever remain so . For you , Escobar , And De Moxica , and all others here To whom I owe support , the Admiral Has portioned out your lands within this province ; No lovelier spot on earth has e'er been found ; None worthier to be the soldier 's home . Here will we rest us from the toils of war , Secure from care ; here all is peace and joy . Nature with lavish hand bestows her gifts ; Let us enjoy them , and forget the world That lies beyond these valleys . ALL . All Live Roldan ! His will is ours ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan My friends , your generous faith Is dearer far than all the glittering wealth This Western world can give . If tyranny Should dare again uprear her serpent head , Roldan is yours to crush again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll meet For further council . You , De Escobar , Remain with me . ( Exeunt all but De Escobar . ) Confess , De Escobar , That this rebellion is a thriving trade ! ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar It has proved so with us ; thanks to the times , And to our leader ! Were the first less rough , The second less determined , and less skilled In all those arts that win the populace , We should have rued the attempt . Still , though success Has crowned our enterprise , you have not reached The prize at which you grasped ,  --  the government . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan But I am well content . Know , Don Diego , That in Xaragua I have found a prize Worth all the spoils of Hayti ! ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Ah ! a mine ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan A young , fair girl . ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Ambition yields to love ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Reserve your smiles till you have seen the maid , For , by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw ! ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Who is this wonder ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Anacaona 's daughter , young Alana , Whose sire , the proud cacique , Caonabo , Died of a broken heart , when , as a captive , He voyaged late to Spain . ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar You think to win This Western flower ? Perchance her vows are given To some young chieftain of her native isle . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Her heart is free as are the sun 's bright rays , And shall ere long be mine !  --  But see , who comes ? Behechio , the cacique . ( Enter Behechio . ) Welcome , prince ! What happy chance directs your steps this way ? BEHECHIO . Behechio One of my tribe brings news , that not far hence , Within the valley , a young Spaniard waits , Who seeks your friend Don Adrian , or yourself . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan A stranger , chieftain , or one of my hand ? BEHECHIO . Behechio My people know him not . ROLDAN . Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning ! I will hasten forth , Though now I ' ve little dread of foes . Perchance This stranger is some envoy from Columbus . If such , he shall be welcomed with due state . Exeunt . SCENE II . A different part of the valley . Guevara discovered alone . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara So , this is banishment !  --  to be condemned To dwell awhile in paradise ! It proves That chastisement is sometimes love . The ship In which I should have sailed for Spain is gone , And here , thanks to my sentence , I can rest , Until I 'm wearied e'en of happiness . This clime was formed for bliss ! Where'er I turn , New beauties meet my eye . Granada 's plains , So rich in nature 's charms that legends say The Moorish heaven hangs over them , must yield In splendor to Xaragua 's vales . But hark ! Drums and trumpets heard . What martial sound breaks on the slumbering air ? Trumpets ' and drums ' rude notes dispel the charm Which made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , was of earth . I see A numerous train , with all the pomp of war , Move slowly on . Is this to honor me ? Or rages discord ' mid these blooming scenes ? Near and more near they come ; I now descry Their leader 's waving plume and glittering spear ; How beautiful the sight , as on they march , Beneath the verdant boughs of those huge trees ! My pulses bound anew with knightly ardor ! Fled are th ' effeminate dreams of ease , in which These soft , luxurious scenes ensnared my soul ! Now , now I feel what folly ' t was to brave Columbus ' wrath , and so blot out my name From the immortal roll on which the world , In future days , shall read the glorious deeds Of those who gave to light these Western shores . The die is cast ! I 'm less than nothing here : So let me haste to Spain , and once again Stand forth among her chivalry , nor dream , In base , inglorious ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that I were there ! ( Enter Roldan , De Escobar , De Moxica , Reguelme , and a numerous train of Spaniards . ) DE MOXICA Adrian de Moxica ( advancing to Guevara ) . Hernando ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Adrian ! They embrace . DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Most welcome , cousin ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Most welcome to Xaragua , Don Hernando ! De Escobar , Reguelme ,  --  all my friends Are known to you , I think . REGUELME . Pedro Reguelme Welcome , my friend ! What tidings do you bring From the great city and the Admiral ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Most welcome , Don Hernando ! Would you see How well rebellion prospers in this province , That you have left the viceroy 's retinue , To grace Xaragua with your presence ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Knights , I thank your courtesy ; but let me ask , Why you approach me with an armed train ? Methinks , to greet a friend and countryman No war array was needed ! DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception should be framed to suit The rank you hold . I pray you let us know What title may be yours ,  --  if you are termed The viceroy 's spy or his ambassador ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica De Escobar , this insult to my friend  --  DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar May be avenged , if he can wield a sword ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Back ! back ! This quarrel 's idle ! What ! so soon Wearied of peace that you would slay your friends ! De Escobar , what means this insolence ? It should have been for me to ask the cause That brings Guevara here . Seor , I pray you , Excuse this rudeness ! ' T is so short a time Since it was needful to maintain strict watch , That we still deem each visitor a foe Until we know his purpose . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara No excuse , Seor , is needed . I have learned , ere this , That pardoned rebels still dread punishment ; Still by their perfidy judge others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , Or moves me but to laughter , that one knight Should cause commotion in your numerous train . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Are you an envoy of the viceroy ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara No . I am a banished man , and ordered here But to embark for Spain . DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica How ? banished , cousin ? How has Columbus dared assume such sway Over a high-born Spanish cavalier ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara It matters not ; the viceroy disapproved My conduct , and dismissed me from his suite . Arriving here , I found the fleet had sailed , So thought to task your hospitality . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan ' T is freely given for your own sake , Seor , And for your cousin 's . Rest with us , I pray , Until you ' re weary of this Western world , And pine for Spain . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Thanks for your courtesy ! But on these shores I may not long remain . I can not rest inactive ; here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must again receive me on her soil ; My sword need not rust there . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar There speaks Castile ! Guevara , in all honorable frankness , I pray your pardon for my rash suspicions ! While I esteemed you of Columbus ' train , My heart was closed against you . I was wrong . So there ' s my hand . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara And mine . ROLDAN Francisco Roldan ( to Guevara ) . The Indian drum ! Behechio , cacique of this province , Comes with his followers to welcome you . ( Enter Behechio , followed by a number of his tribe . ) BEHECHIO . Behechio Roldan , I haste to offer to your friend The welcome , which it is my will and duty , As chieftain of this province , to extend To every stranger . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Hospitality Dwells ever with Behechio . Behold My countryman , Hernando de Guevara , Who fain would see the paradise of Hayti Ere he returns to Spain , his native land . BEHECHIO . Behechio Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sought it with no ill intent , I trust you may find pleasure in its vales . All they contain are yours while you remain Behechio 's guest ; their fragrant flowers and fruits , The dwellers of the lake , of earth , and air , Are at your service ; so Behechio wills it . If your designs are evil , may the God Who rules us both preserve this peaceful land And happy people from your influence ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara I thank your kindness , chieftain , and , believe me , No evil wishes lurk within my breast Against your people ; may they long remain Peaceful and happy ! In Xaragua I 'm but a passing guest . A few short days Will see me pillowed on the ocean 's breast , Wooing your Western gales to waft me hence , Towards my natives shores . Those shores , indeed , Are far less peaceful and less beautiful Than thine own groves ; but , O , they ' re far more dear ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Lo , where approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger ! ( Enter a long train of Indian maidens , with Alana at their head , bearing in their hands palm-branches . ) Look , my friend , Upon these island beauties , and decide Between them and the vaunted dames of Spain . ( Alana moves aside , the other maidens kneel and place the palms at Guevara 's feet . ) MAIDENS . Maidens Welcome , O stranger , to Xaragua 's plains ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan And see , the fair Anacaona comes , Moving in state ; Behechio 's sister she , And widow of the chieftain Caonabo . Among her tribe she 's honored as a queen . Pay her due reverence , she is worthy of it ! Aside to Guevara . ( Enter Anacaona , escorted by Indian maidens and warriors . ) ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Princess , let me present my worthy friend , The cavalier Hernando de Guevara . ANACAONA . Anacaona The cavalier is welcome to my home ; Anacaona is the Spaniard 's friend . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Princess , my people own your constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel Much honored by a welcome so distinguished . I am a simple Spanish cavalier , Without authority upon your shores , And had no right to hope that such reception Would wait me from the princes of the land ! ANACAONA . Anacaona Think not , O youth , that to the great alone We haste to offer hospitality ; The name of stranger claims its sacred rites . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Which is your island goddess ? Aside to Roldan . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan She who stands Apart , and silently surveys the scene . De Escobar , mark with what native grace And dignity she 's stamped ! Not such the mien With which our high-born dames of Spain are seen ! In them art faintly mocks the noble air Which nature here bestows without constraint . Aside . BEHECHIO . Behechio Roldan , the feast awaits us ; with your friends Haste to partake it . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Chief , we follow you . Exeunt . ACT II . SCENE I. A grove , with a fountain in its centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anacaona . BEHECHIO . Behechio Another Spaniard ! Thus each day , each hour , Brings on these locusts of that far world ! Soon All Hayti will be theirs , and we their slaves ! Cursed be the light that to their longing eyes Displayed these shores ! Cursed be the favoring winds Which bore their winged canoes across the waves , Nor rent each beam asunder ! ANACAONA . Anacaona Brother , why This sudden rage ? What is ' t disturbs thee thus ? BEHECHIO . Behechio O , blinded to thy fate ! What dost thou ask ? Seest thou not day by day these Spaniards wrest Our freedom from us , yet canst coldly ask , What is ' t disturbs thee ? ANACAONA . Anacaona Is there some new wrong ? In yon fair-spoken Spaniard hast thou found A hidden foe ? BEHECHIO . Behechio ' T is not on one , but all , That my thoughts turn . How short a time has passed Since he whom in their foreign tongue they term Adelantado , brother to Colon , Entered our province with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark the end ! His followers return ,  --  their avarice And love of ease incited by these vales , Where Nature 's hand provides with lavish care For Nature 's children . Quickly they report The beauties of Xaragua , and , behold ! Ere long Roldan and his rebellious band Take refuge here from justice . ANACAONA . Anacaona You received And welcomed them . BEHECHIO . Behechio True . Think'st thou that I cared When these oppressive strangers left their prey , To turn and rend each other ? My word was pledged T ' afford my friendship to all Spaniards , nor Had I the power , whatever were my will , To guard my province from intrusion . ANACAONA . Anacaona But Why are you now thus roused ? Nor by Roldan , Nor by his band , have we been wronged , and now They ' re yielded to their chief , and are content To cease their strife . BEHECHIO . Behechio And turn their restless fury Again upon our people ! O my country ! Once free and happy , how art thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? Why ever dwell upon the gloomiest side Of our affairs ? Reflect how much more wise These strangers are than we ;  --  how wonderful Their knowledge seems to us ! Compare their ships , Which dare the angry waves , to our canoes ; Compare the dwellings which they raise with ours ; Note well their dress ,  --  th ' impenetrable garb Which bids befiance to the bow and spear ! Behold their weapons too ,  --  alas , how deadly ! A thousand , thousand things at once display Our ignorance and their skill . ' T is by the last They conquer us . Then let us rather seek To win from them the wisdom which is power , Than risk unequal strife . O mighty race !  --  BEHECHIO . Behechio And mightiest still in vice ! ANACAONA . Anacaona O , say not so ! Behold Columbus and his warlike brother ! BEHECHIO . Behechio Ay , they are good and great ,  --  as Spaniards may be ; No avarice inspires them ;  --  yet their hands Are stained with Haytien blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , alas ! in self-defence ; They were the aggrieved . BEHECHIO . Behechio Woman , rememberest thou Thy husband , the proud Carib , Caonabo ? Whose hands placed fetters on his free-born limbs ? Who tore him from his home , his wife , his child , And bore him in their ships far from the land Dear to his soul ? He died , Anacaona ! His eagle eye gazed madly on the bonds Which Spanish craft threw round him , and he died ! Not on the battle-field , where his strong arm Was ever first ; not ' mid his faithful tribe Did he depart ; but far on unknown waves His spirit fainted , and his proud form drooped ; ' T was there he died ,  --  died of a broken heart ! ANACAONA . Anacaona Behechio , spare , O , spare me ! BEHECHIO . Behechio Spare thee ? No ! Listen , while I recount the mighty deeds Of Spanish friends ! Hast thou forgotten yet The day , the fatal day , when down they rushed On Caonabo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftain 's loss ? Then , then , Burst the loud thunder and the brilliant flash Forth from the echoing forest , and thy friends , Like autumn leaves , were strewn upon the plain . Soon on their giant coursers came the foe Forth from their covert ; lance , and spear , and sword Drank Haytien blood , and o'er the prostrate forms Of Hayti 's sons careered the horses ; then They loosed the furious bloodhound on thy friends , Which , not more savage than their Spanish lords , Sprang at the throats , tore out the quivering hearts  --  ANACAONA . Anacaona Cease ! I entreat thee , cease ! Must I endure Again the tortures of that scene of woe ? Had Caonabo listened to my words He still had lived and reigned . Too well I saw That ' gainst the weapons of the Spanish band No Haytien could stand , and counselled peace . My words were vain , and vain are now my tears . But , O Behechio , be ruled by me ! Thy vales are fruitful , and thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O , let no rashness Destroy this peace , and desolate thy land ! BEHECHIO . Behechio The warning is not needed . No vain hopes Shall lead me to embroil my hapless tribe In useless strife . No ; though their doom must come , Let me not haste it ! May I never live To see my people 's misery ! to see Their hopeless ruin ! for the day is near When all their joys must end ; when slavery And labor harsh shall chase the dance and song Of the cool evening hours ! O , never more Shall liberty and ease resume their reign ! Sorrow , and toil , and care , the conqueror 's sword , Will do their work , and our unhappy race Must vanish fast beneath them !  --  But I see Alana comes this way . Let us retire , Nor darken with our griefs her sunny smiles . Exeunt . ( Enter Alana . ) ALANA . Alana How my heart beats ! I thought some one pursued , And , turning , caught the gleam of mail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will repose , And dream of days before these strangers came To fill our valleys with the noise of war . Hark ! hear I not a step ? No ; all is still . I feared it was Roldan who followed me , To fill my ear with tedious words of love . To-day I like him less than yesterday ; Yet know not why , for he ' s the same as then ; Perhaps I 'm changed ;  --  but I 'll not think of him . I 'll throw myself beside this sparkling fount , List to its gentle murmurs , and inhale The breeze that sports amid this verdant grove . Seats herself by the fountain , and gazes into it . ( Guevara enters gently behind and bends over her ; she sees his face reflected in the water , and starts up with a faint shriek . ) GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Fair wood-nymph , fly me not ! If I am bold In entering thy retreat , thy charms will plead Most eloquently my excuse ! ALANA . Alana Seor , Xaraguan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to charm Xaraguan youths , Whose hearts know no deceit . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara So young , so fair , And yet so stern ! Say , maiden , why you fled When late I sought to stay your passing steps . ALANA . Alana I thought  --  I feared  --  GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Am I so terrible ? ALANA . Alana I feared it was Roldan who followed me . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Ha ! here is rivalry ! ( Aside . ) Then I may hope You did not fly from me ? ALANA . Alana I thought not of you . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara That answer might beseem a court coquette ! Aside . Maiden , I have a sister , young like you , Who mourns my absence from my father 's home , With no kind friend to smile away my cares , Or share my sorrows ; could that sister think That in this Western land there was a maid , Young , fair , and gentle , who ' d compassionate Her brother 's lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not think That Western maids would spurn the stranger 's heart . ALANA . Alana Nay , judge us not so harshly ; we but fear His flattery . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Can Western lovers gaze On beauty 's cheek , nor let the heart 's emotion Burst forth from lip and eye ? Ah , not so calm Our Spanish youths ! With them ' t is Beauty 's glance That prompts to deeds of glory , Beauty 's smile That well repays all peril . Tell them not In Beauty 's presence to repress their rapture , Nor let their lips proclaim their soul 's devotion . Vain is the wish to bar love 's privilege . Thus do they kneel , and pay the homage due , And plead , as now I plead , for Beauty 's favor . ALANA . Alana How can I answer you ? I dare not think Your words are more than sport . I pray you , know That Western hearts , though not less soft and true Than those of other climes , yet do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor prize the love they win . Stranger , ' t is said That Spanish youths , although with many vows They bind themselves , know naught of constancy , But each fair maid in turn adore , and pledge Their broken faith anew . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Let not thy heart Harbour suspicion . ' T is the foulest guest That ever clouded the sweet sympathies Of youthful maiden 's breast . In sober truth , I love thee , fair Alana ; for my love Grant me some little hope to win thy heart . ALANA . Alana Alas , I fear that ' t is already won ! Aside . I can not say  --  I must begone ; I hear A stranger 's footsteps . She hurries into the cottage . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Like a timid fawn She bounds away , but bears within her breast The subtle dart of love . How beautiful ! The untamed daughter of the wilderness ! May it be mine to bear this graceful flower To other climes , and show the proud Old World That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold or gems , but woman 's charms ! ( Enter De Escobar . ) DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar I joy to see that in this calm retreat Time hangs not heavily upon your hands . You miss not , then , the viceroy 's mimic court ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara That had its pleasures , yet I mourn them not . Here Nature is omnipotent , and I Am at her shrine a fervent worshipper . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Worship not too devoutly at the shrine Of Nature 's children . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Escobar , your meaning  --  DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Is plain and friendly . But a moment since You parted from Alana . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara He who dares To play the spy upon me is my foe . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar You are too hasty . I am not your foe , But warn you for your safety . Know , Roldan Is fixed to wed this island maiden . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Ay ? Deem'st thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my will ? De Escobar , I am content that he should be my rival ; And when he will , our weapons shall decide Who best deserves to win this Haytien maid . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Truce with your folly ! Think you he will yield To such decision his so-cherished prize ? Reflect that he is powerful , and you Without support ; why , then , provoke his wrath ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara His wrath may serve to fright the simple Indian ; The belted knight but scorns so poor a threat . Say to Roldan that ' t will be seen , ere long , Which bears the best blade and most winning tongue . Exit . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Go , foolish boy , rush headlong on your fate ! Buy with your life an Indian maiden 's smile ! You have been warned , and I can do no more . Exit . ACT III . SCENE I. In Anacaona 's cottage . Roldan , Behechio , and Anacaona . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wed Alana . Though I can not woo In flattering phrase , trust me , you could not yield The maid to one whose love is more sincere . ANACAONA . Anacaona Win , then , her own consent , and she is thine . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Have I your favor , chief ? BEHECHIO . Behechio I am well pleased The maiden should wed one whose arm is strong To shield her from the woes which I foresee Must overwhelm our isle . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Then summon her . ( Anacaona retires , and reappears with Alana . ) BEHECHIO . Behe chio Now may her mother 's wit have taught her how This Spaniard must be answered ! Much I fear Her will from prudence will receive no council ! Aside . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan You know my love , Alana ; a blunt soldier Abhors delays , nor can with patience wait The thousand changes of the female heart . I pray you , therefore , say at once you 're mine . ALANA . Alana Spare me awhile , Roldan ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native freedom ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Such vain excuses maidens ever make . Bestow on me that gentle , fluttering heart . I have no wish to enslave it . Sure my own , Which you ' ve possessed so long , may be esteemed Sufficient hostage . Speak ! ALANA . Alana Not now ! not now !  --  How my head swims !  --  O mother , speak for me ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Maiden , this trifling I 've endured too long ! Bethink you that my heart , though rude , perchance , Has softened to your charms , and been full long The slave of your caprice ; that heart has rights As well as yours , nor must they be denied . I pray you to be candid . I would know If you can be my bride . Still no reply ? Perhaps among my followers you ' ve found Some knight more worthy to possess your love ; One whose more courtly grace and courtly words Eclipse so plain a wooer as myself ! Alana bursts into tears and throws herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if perplexed ; then kneels to Alana . Forgive me , loved one , if I seem too harsh ! Think that my happiness is in your power , And pardon my impatience ! Ah , those tears Reproach me more than words ! ANACAONA . Anacaona Urge her no more ! Go now , nor doubt my influence in your favor . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Thanks , princess ! I obey . Much I suspect Some other claims an interest in her heart . Who dares to rival me may dare oppose The hurricane 's fell wrath ! Farewell awhile . Chieftain , a word with you . Exeunt Roldan and Behechio . ANACAONA . Anacaona Whence are these passionate tears ? Why do you weep As if your heart must break ? What hidden grief O'erwhelms you thus ? Confide your sorrows to me . Can you not love Roldan ? ALANA . Alana Love him ! No , no ! ANACAONA . Anacaona And is he so abhorred ? You were not wont To name him in such tones . You have done wrong To listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALANA . Alana O , rebuke me not , Unless you ' re merciless as he ! ANACAONA . Anacaona My child , Thy present misery is rebuke enough For any fault thy inexperienced youth Has led thee to commit . Yet can it be That hatred to Roldan is the sole cause Of all these bitter tears ? Answer , my child ; Is there no other reason ? Ah , that start ! Then he was right ! Who is the rival ? Who Has won this heart that beats so wildly ? Speak ! ALANA . Alana I dare not say . Roldan 's last words still ring Upon my ear with most foreboding sound . Ah , woe is me ! ANACAONA . Anacaona Heed not his threats . Not all His arrogance shall win thee from me Should you consent  --  ALANA . Alana O , never ! ANACAONA . Anacaona So resolved ? This favored one , is he of thine own race ? A Spaniard , then ?  --  Don A drian ?  --  Not so ?  --  Guevara ?  --  Thy emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed to win ! His person , grace , and eloquence of speech Might well subdue a heart more hard than thine . ALANA . Alana Would we had never met ! Alas , I dread Roldan 's stern wrath ! ANACAONA . Anacaona What shouldst thou fear from him ? ALANA . Alana I think not of myself ; but , ah , my mother , Roldan 's fierce jealousy will never rest Until he learns who rivals him ! Alas , Death gleamed from his stern eye when he retired ! ANACAONA . Anacaona These terrors ill become a chieftain 's daughter . They live but in thy fancy . Come with me ; Subdue thy tears , and banish all thy cares . We will consult Behechio , and his judgment Shall guide us safely through this present trouble . Exeunt . SCENE II . Before Roldan 's dwelling . De Escobar and De Moxica . DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica My friend , you ' re in the Alcalde 's confidence ; How speeds his wooing with the Haytien maid ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . Why do you ask ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Because , a moment since , I saw Behechio and Roldan together ; Slowly they walked , and earnestly conferred . The chieftain 's brow was clouded , and Roldan 's Was black as blackest night ; as they were near Anacaona 's cottage , and full oft Directed there their gestures , I inferred That her fair daughter occupied their thoughts . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar ' T is possible . Roldan himself draws near ; If you are anxious , question him , I pray ;  --  And get his dagger through you for your pains . Aside . ( De Moxica draws back as Roldan enters . ) ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan A curse on woman 's fickleness ! A curse On my own folly , when I weakly thought That in this Western world the sex were free From the caprice which governs them elsewhere ! Perceives De Moxica . Ha ! De Moxica ! Eavesdropping ! Begone ! Have I no privacy ? ( De Moxica withdraws with a menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You must aid my wrath ! DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Command me as you will . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Must I repeat My weakness and my shame ? Well , listen then ! When first Alana 's beauty caught my eye , And with such words as lovers use I wooed her , She ne'er repulsed my suit , but calmly heard , Like one whose heart was free . From this I hoped That time and my devotion might create An answering flame . But when , scarce an hour since , Sure of my prize , I offered her my hand , In presence of her mother and Behechio , She answered with evasions , sighs , and tears , Nor could my prayers or threats gain further notice . ' T is plain I have a rival ; who he is I know not ; to discover him , my friend , I ask your aid . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Guevara is the man . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Ah , it is possible ! May the foul fiend , Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I allow him to bear off my prize ! What shall be done to rid me of this youth Who dares to rival me in love ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar I know not . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan No hesitation ! Quick ! devise some plan , Or  --  Laying his hand on his dagger . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Must it come to that ? Not so , Roldan ; Banish him , if you will , but harm him not . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Banish him ? Where ? To Isabella , whence Colon has driven him ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar ' T were a jest to see The Admiral 's proud from dilate with wrath At such presumption in the pardoned rebel ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Jest not , De Escobar ! By all the saints , This foolish girl 's so seated in my heart , That if I would I could not tear her thence ! Your counsel ! Quick , or it may come too late ! DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood . We will devise Some fitting means . Enter ; we ' ll talk within . They go into the house . SCENE III . Before Anacaona 's cottage . Alana discovered , seated by the fountain . Enter Guevara . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Here dwells my island goddess ! May she be , As heretofore , propitious to my vows ! Ah , yonder she reclines beside the fount , Like Venus gazing on her parent wave ! She weeps ! On earth who can hope happiness , When youth and innocence are prey to sorrow ? Alana , my beloved , whence are those tears ? ALANA . Alana Fly from me , youth ! Ah , fly ! Avoid my presence ! Danger and death lurk near me ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara True , my love . There ' s danger in those eyes , whose radiant glance Has pierced my heart . There ' s danger in each grace Thy youthful form displays . I own thy power , And yield myself thy captive . ALANA . Alana Cease , Guevara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrid vengeance ' gainst thee . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara This confirms The warning of De Escobar , and now , Whilst the fair maid trembles ' twixt love and fear , I ' ll wile the sweet confession from her lips . Aside . Roldan may threaten as he will ; while here I offer up my homage , thou alone Fillest all my thoughts . ALANA . Alana Guevara , O , forbear , Nor brave the Alcalde 's wrath ! Should he appear , Thy life would pay the forfeit of thy rashness . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Whence is his sudden fury against me , To whom , so short time since , he was a stranger ? ALANA . Alana I am the wretched cause . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Thou , fair one ? Thou ? Can he expect to bar all eyes save his From gazing on thy beauty , and all hearts From paying thee allegiance ? ALANA . Alana Ah ! he fears ,  --  He thinks he has a rival , though as yet He knows not whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernando de Guevara Jealous indeed ! If he possess that heart , Why should he rage against the hapless knight Who dares but gaze on thee , without a hope To win the treasure from him ? ALANA . Alana Well he knows My heart was never his , and now he fears That ' t is bestowed elsewhere . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara O , let me hope I have some share in it ! Turn not away , But listen to my suit . Say , by what vows Shall I convince thee of my truth ? To doubt Were cruelty . Behold , this crystal fount Shall in its glassy mirror bear such witness To my sincerity , as must remove Each shadow of a fear . See thine own charms ! Who can gaze on them and not be subdued ? Ah , yield thee , fair one ! Why shouldst thou deny To own , that , though a conqueror , thou canst pity The pangs thou dost inflict ? Give me the heart Which , trembling , flies Roldan 's unknightly wooing ! Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness ; ah , let thy lips Pronounce me blest , and thus confirm my rapture ! ALANA . Alana Ah , woe is me , that Caonabo 's child Dares not declare her love , but stands in awe Of foreign tyrants ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Nay , subdue those fears , And frame thy voice to words of love alone . ALANA . Alana Guevara , I am thine ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara And I am blest ! ALANA . Alana Yes , this weak heart is thine ! E'en though Roldan With his hard-hearted followers stood near To rend me from thine arms , I would confess My fervent love , and scorn his ill-used power , Which stoops to oppress a woman ! ( Roldan rushes in . ) ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Art thou here , Base traitor ? Fury choaks my utterance ! But words aid not revenge ! The clash of steel Is the sole sound required ! Defend thyself ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Ah ! This is to my wish ! Withdraw , fair maid , Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Caonabo 's daughter should be won , By my good sword ! ALANA . Alana Forbear , Roldan , forbear ! Ah , pity me , and cease this horrid strife ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Off , swarthy slave ! Why should I pity thee ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Begone , Alana , as thou lov'st me ! ALANA . Alana Slave ! Exit . ( Roldan and Guevara fight . De Moxica , De Escobar , Reguelme , and others , enter and disarm the combatants . ) ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Who dares this violence ? De Escobar , Thy life shall answer this ! Unhand me , sir ! DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar You ' ll thank me by and by ; meanwhile , your threats Fall harmless . GUEVARA Hernando de Guevara ( to De Moxica ) . Adrian , off ! Is he my friend Who steps ' twixt me and vengeance ? DE ESCOBAR Diego de Escobar ( aside to Roldan ) . Calm thy rage , Nor risk thy life in such ignoble strife ! How would your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict harmony Throughout the province , idly risk your life In brawling for an Indian maiden 's smiles ! You ' ve all to lose , and naught to gain ; for when Guevara is removed by banishment , The game is yours again . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan You counsel well ; But yet , such is my hatred to that youth That I should think my vengeance cheaply bought , Even at the price of life . Exeunt Roldan and De Escobar . REGUELME Pedro Reguelme ( to Guevara ) . Explain this scene , my friend . The Indian maid , Who led us hither , said not how you roused The sleeping tiger in the Alcalde 's breast . Revenge was in his eye . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara I 've done Roldan The injury which man can least forgive ,  --  I ' ve won from him the maiden of his love . REGUELME . Pedro Reguelme Look to your life , then , friend ! He 's not the man That will forget a wrong . You can not know The deep-laid craft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is my advice that you should quit the province ; You ' ll not be safe till then . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara And leave my prize To the Alcalde ? No , not so , my friend . Guevara never fled from man . Roldan May practise ' gainst my life , but to his craft I will oppose due caution ; open war I ' ll knightlike meet ! REGUELME . Pedro Reguelme Then be it as you will . But when you find your foes too many for you , Command my aid . DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica To mine you have the right Of friendship and of blood . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Thanks to you both ! Exeunt Reguelme and De Moxica . ( Renter Roldan . ) ROLDAN . Franc isco Roldan A word with you , Seor . GUEVARA Hernando de Guevara ( laying his hand on his sword ) . Ah ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan No ; not so . I meet you not upon such terms . Attend . Within this province I am as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band Of trusty followers attends my steps , To hear and execute my will ; Colon , ' Mid all his sounding rank and mockery Of princely state , even he had not the power To oppose me . Wherefore shouldst thou hope , young man , To brave me in my strength , and bear away This Haytien maiden from my watchful care ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Roldan , what right claim'st thou to wed this maid , Despite her own refusal of thy hand ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan The right of power . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Ay , true ! The unknightly taunt Suits well the plebeian lips that uttered it ! But canst thou be so base as to refuse To leave to our good swords the arbitrament Of this dispute ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Why should I grant such favor ? The arbitrament ' s already in my hands . Why should I stake upon my weapon 's thrust What is already mine ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Why do I ask The churlish blood that stagnates in thy veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble 's breast ? Why should I think The low-born clown , who basely gained his power , Could wield that power with honor ? Far too much I graced thee when I crossed my sword with thine ; For thy ignoble blood would shame the blade Which ne'er , before that hour , was drawn ' gainst one So far beneath the rank of gentleman . Coward and churl alike , thy heart knows not The throb of honor . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Coward , say'st thou , youth ? Take back the falsehood , or  --  GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Or thou wilt call Thine armed minions to avenge the scorn ? No ! I repeat it ,  --  Coward ! For what is he Who dares not with his sword assert his honor ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Dares not , thou misproud knight ! Full well thou know'st Nor earth nor hell can show the deed I dare not ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara I grant it , so ' t is base . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Have I not braved The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even against Colon Made firm resistance , till he did me right ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara O , doubly base , since , with unblushing front , Thou canst adduce thy vile ingratitude To prove thy claim to courage ! No , Roldan , The courage which ennobles springs from honor . Such courage hast thou as the venomed snake , Which rears its slimy crest behind its victim , And in his heel inflicts the fatal wound . ' T was when Colon was absent that you sought By your foul calumnies to undermine His hard-earned fame , and to possess his power . But you were baffled there , thanks to our queen , Whose high Castilian blood would never give Castilian subjects to such sway as thine ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan And what , then , is Colon ? His ancestry Can scarce claim more respect than mine . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Not so Who , when the sun slow rises from the east , Asks whence it comes ? Who , when the eagle soars On untamed pinions upward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus stands Alone , nor needs a brilliant ancestry . The glorious halo which surrounds his head Would render dim the most renowned descent ; Nor will men look beyond that blaze of fame To know if light or darkness dwell behind it . Columbus never erred , save when he raised A reptile , such as thou art , from the dust , Where , but for him , thou wouldst have crawled for aye . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan My patience vanishes !  --  Yet wherefore vent My passion to my own undoing ? He Whose hands are tied may vent in wordy war The rancor of his breast . Adieu , Seor ; You 'll learn full soon what ' t is to brave Roldan . Exit . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara The rebel caitiff ! Could I but arouse One spark of knightly ardor in his breast , Then might I hope my trusty blade would win The maid , whom much I fear will ne'er be mine , While he maintains such stubborn policy ; For he has strength , and I am powerless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I leave thee , Spain ? why quit the court Where happiness and honor bloomed around me ? For there each knight confessed my martial skill , Each beauteous dame smiled on me . Here Roldan , Who in our own land never could have hoped The honor of my notice ,  --  he can now Threaten a Spanish noble !  --  Dread his power ! Or yield my will to his ! As if I knew What ' t was to yield !  --  Not even Colon could teach Guevara such a lesson ! Let Roldan Look to himself ! The party which he formed Against Columbus may be lured to turn Against their leader . I will to the work , And teach this upstart churl how insecure Is ill-gained power . ( Enter De Moxica . ) Ah , welcome , Adrian ! DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Is he who brings ill tidings welcome ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Ah ! Ill tidings ! Trifle not , I pray you , cousin ! DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica You 're banished to Cahay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica By whom but our Alcalde , mighty man ! Who one day for a kingdom wages war , The next is battling for a woman 's favor . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara And has he dared do this ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica He dares do aught That ever mortal dared . Yet this , methinks , Is no such mighty deed ;  --  ' t is but to oppress One who is powerless . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara I will appeal Back to the viceroy ' gainst this flagrant wrong . DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Appeal thou to Roldan against Colon , And there is chance that thou mayst gain thy cause . Full well you know , that in our late rebellion , So void of means was he to take the field , He was content to purchase our submission By granting full assent to all our terms . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara True ; true ; I raved . What course can I pursue ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica What course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Moxica , no ! To leave you gentle maid , On whom my wooing draws the Alcalde 's wrath , Were a foul blot upon my knightly fame ! But for my fatal love , she ne'er had known Her present misery . I 've wooed and won This lovely one ; have vowed through weal or woe That my right arm should ever bear her up Upon life 's stormy path ; and shall I fly From the first cloud that lowers above our heads ? When I do this , then may my knightly crest Be humbled in the dust , my spurs hewn off , My spotless shield reversed ! DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Hernando , hold ! Where you can not resist , there is no shame In yielding . By my knighthood , you must go ! There 's no alternative . And for the maid , Your friends will see that she 's not forced to wed The Alcalde . If she 's fickle , like her sex , And to the present lover most inclines , You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force me hence ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica He will , Guevara . Let me give you warning ; Go , and in silence . In the Alcalde 's band Are those who would not scruple to remove One whom they deemed their leader 's enemy . Go to Cahay , and you may yet return . Resist , and you are lost . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Hear me , my friend . If I have marked aright , among the band Who with Roldan were late leagued in rebellion Are men of dauntless heart and iron hand ,  --  Devoted to Roldan while by the sword He ruled both friend and foe , but who detest The enforcer of the laws . DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica ' T is even so . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Those disaffected spirits must be mine ! DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica With time for combination , we 'll oppose The Alcalde 's tyranny with equal force . And now , away ! His watchful myrmidons Will soon appear to enforce their lord 's decree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alana . ALANA . Alana And will you longer urge me to bestow My hand upon Roldan ? Would happiness E'er smile on me if linked to such a Spaniard ? His evil passions would destroy my peace . ANACAONA . Anacaona Alana , I was wrong . I fondly hoped That his protection would secure my child From any woe which might o'erwhelm our land . No more I 'll importune you . ALANA . Alana Ah , he comes ! ( Enter Guevara and De Moxica . ) Welcome , Guevara , welcome ! At thy sight My terrors vanish , and my fainting heart Finds firmness in thy eyes . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara What fears my love ? Why throbs this tender heart ? Guevara 's arm Is vowed to thy protection ; let its clasp Assure thy gentle breast , where vain alarms Now hold dominion . ALANA . Alana Would that they were vain ! But no , Guevara . I can read our doom In the Alcalde 's eyes . Alas , my sire , How little didst thou think , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands Thronged round their mighty chief , that ever woe Would blight her youthful days ! No thought of foes From distant lands , more powerful than thyself , E'er crossed thy dauntless breast . But thou art gone ; And ' mid those hills where once thy haughty eye Glanced proudly o'er a tribe whose faithful hearts Throbbed high to do thy will , a helpless few , Enslaved , degraded , hide their hunted heads And die in woe , where once they lived in power . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Her words are daggers to my breast ! E'en so Have Spanish hands made desolate the soil , And trampled on its free and happy sons , And deluged Haytien earth in Haytien blood . Would that the deep remorse which wrings my heart Might reach each Spaniard who has raised his arm Against this hapless race ! ALANA . Alana I meant not to upbraid thee , but my thoughts With present sorrow contrast former bliss . Thou ' rt gone , my father , and thy helpless child Quails ' neath a Spaniard 's glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressor 's rod ! Whose men are women , and whose women call In vain upon those men to nerve their hearts , And die or conquer in their country 's cause ! ANACAONA . Anacaona Alana , cease , nor rend thy mother 's heart With vain complaints ! Thy words renew my woes . Past horrors rise again before my eyes . ALANA . Alana Forgive me , mother ! Let thy child 's embrace Banish thy anguish ! GURVARA . Gurvara I , alas , have helped To widow such a mother ! I have helped To render such a daughter fatherless ! Aside . Exit Anacaona . ALANA Alana ( to Guevara ) . Your brow is clouded , too . My rebel tongue Hath ill expressed the feelings of my heart , Since it offends the friends whom most I love . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara No , gentle one ; each word of thine to me Is far more dear than I can tell . ' T is I Whom ruthless fate condemns to grieve and pain The maid for whom I 'd die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am beloved Condemns me to depart from thy sweet presence . ALANA . Alana Guevara , leave me not ! In pity , stay ! If your deep vows of love were e'er sincere , Remain ! Protect the hapless Haytien maid , Whose love and faith to thee have caused Roldan To threaten direst vengeance on her head ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara And did he threaten thee ? Now , by the saints , But little hinders that I cast aside That honor which he knows not , and despatch The shameless ruffian with my dagger 's point ! And did this chance since last we met , my love ? ALANA . Alana Scarce an hour since . He vowed , whoever I loved , I should wed none but him ;  --  vowed with fierce oaths And threats against thy life . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara What saidst thou then ? ALANA . Alana What could I say ? I wept , which but the more Enraged his savage heart , because my tears Bore witness to my love . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my birth , That thus my fondest love must prove a curse ? Alana , I must leave thee , for Roldan Rules here with iron sway ; I have no power . ALANA . Alana Forsake me not , Guevara ! By thy side I know no fear ; but when thou art away , And the Alcalde , with his sullen brow And evil-boding eye , stands near , my heart , Always full weak , quails ' neath his threatening glance . Alas , if you desert me , it may chance That , overawed , I yield me to despair , And give my hand to him whom most I hate ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Alana , name not such a sacrifice ! ALANA . Alana Remain , and save me from it ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara I can die In your defence , but I can do no more ! O for the feudal band , whose serried spears So oft have been my pride and my defence ! In far Castile they linger , while their lord Must chafe and fret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Moxica Time flies , Guevara ! In another hour You 'll scarce be safe within Xaragua . ALANA . Alana Say , Is his life in danger ? DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica They who cross The Alcalde 's path are seldom safe . ALANA . Alana Then go ! O , haste away , while I remain ,  --  and die ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Despair not , dearest one ; we 'll meet again ! Ere yonder moon fulfils her destined course , Before again her silver crescent gleams Above these groves , Guevara will be here , To live or die for you , as fate decrees . Loved one , farewell ! ALANA . Alana Ah , stay , Guevara , stay ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara What would my love ? ALANA . Alana Nothing ; but yet I fear This parting is our last . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Be firm , fair maid , Nor heed the Alcalde 's threats !  --  She hears me not ! Quite overwhelmed with grief ! I will not go And leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come all the minions of Roldan , I will defy them all ere I 'll desert This unprotected one ! Hear me , my love ! Thy tears have conquered ; here I will remain While my life lasts ! DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Guevara ! are you mad ? Hear me , Alana ! If you love this knight , Or if you value your own life , control This passionate grief , and bid him not delay . Fear not Roldan ; for , by my knightly faith , You shall not be compelled to be his wife . But if to-morrow see my kinsman here I can not answer for his life . ALANA . Alana Ah , fly , Nor heed my weakness ! fly , ere yet Roldan Pours his fell vengeance on thy head ! DE MOXICA . Adrian de Moxica Ere this , But for De Escobar , thy blood had paid The forfeit of thy rashness . ALANA . Alana Some one comes ! It is Roldan ! Ah , save me ! ( Enter De Escobar . ) DE MOXICA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Moxica , naught with you . My errand 's with Guevara . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Well , Seor , What would you with Guevara ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar To repeat , As a command , my former friendly warning . ' T is time you turned your back upon Xaragua . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara I am aware , sir , of your master 's will ; It needs not repetition ; I 've no choice , And must submit . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar My master , as you term him , Like other men , uses the power he has As best may suit his humor . Some might find A thousand whims , which to their eyes would seem Far worthier of pursuit than is Roldan 's . His whim is to possess this Indian maid . My errand 's not to vindicate his will , Nor would I quarrel with you , though I ' m bound To enforce his orders . Trust me , Don Hernando , That this decree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thy real welfare . Haste to thy native Spain ; assume the rank To which thy birth and talents give thee claim . Thou art a noble youth , and pity ' t is That thou shouldst linger on these Western shores , To lose thy life in an ignoble strife . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara De Escobar , I thank you ! Your advice Is such as I should follow , but my will And duty are at variance . Oft you 've seen A bark , whose rowers faintly ply the oar Against the rushing current ; thus with me ; Duty , like some o'erwearied oarsman , pulls In vain towards the proper haven , while The current , inclination , bears me on Towards shoals and quicksands . Yet I must submit To your commands , but pray of you the grace To linger half an hour . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar I will await That time within the vale where first we met . An escort there attends . Meanwhile , adieu . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Adieu , Seor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Now There but remains to say the last farewell To thee , fair maid , whose image is enshrined Deep in my heart ; thou'lt have no rival there , Though we should never meet again . Weep not , Or you 'll unman me quite . Loved one , be firm ! I will return ; perhaps to overthrow Thy tyrant 's power . Good night , my love , good night ! Exeunt Guevara and De Moxica . ALANA . Alana Evil 's our parting ; evil was the hour When first we met and loved , but to be severed ! Each night I 'll sit and watch yon silver moon , Which moves so brightly , free from mortal cares , And as she slowly wanes I will rejoice That so much nearer is my love 's return ; For when with slender horns she faintly beams Anew along the sky , he will be here ; Preserve me , gentle Hope , until that hour ! Then , if he come not , welcome , welcome , Death , Rather than slavery . Exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernando de Guevara Here first we met , and here we should have parted . ' T is strange this Western wood-nymph should have fixed The heart where love had ne'er before the power To rivet his soft bonds ! But they ' re secured Beyond my power to loosen , and methinks I would not if I could ; they are too dear ! Yet what a sacrifice ! De Escobar Has struck the chord which never yet refused To answer the least touch ,  --  ambition ! Ah , Can I remain to waste my youth , my life , Perchance , my hopes of high renown , For the faint hope of conquering Roldan And winning young Alana ? Yes ! In vain Ambition holds her lures . I will be true To her who loves so fondly and so truly ; True to myself ,  --  for could I e'er know peace Away from her ? I love this gentle maid As knights should ever love , with faith and ardor . Her must I win before again I view My native Spain ; then will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem ,  --  The dearer , that't was won with blood and toil . ( Enter De Escobar , attended . ) DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Guevara , you are punctual . Behold A trusty escort . These , with due respect , Will guide you to Cahay . And now farewell . All joy attend you ! May you ne'er behold Xaragua 's vales again ! That wish should be The wish of all who deem Guevara 's honor Of higher import than Guevara 's pleasure . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Farewell , De Escobar ! I 'll think of thee As one well worthy of the spurs he wears . Exeunt severally . ACT IV . SCENE I. Before Anacaona 's cottage . Roldan , Anacaona , and Behechio . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Too long I 've humbly sued . The maid must know That he who begs the grace he can command Will list to no refusal . BEHECHIO . Behechio Spaniard , hear me ! I 've oft submitted to your tyranny Because my people 's lives were dearer to me Than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I have life . Our maids May mate with Spaniards when it is their will ; But while Xaragua 's tribes call me their chief , No daughter of Xaragua shall be forced To wed a Spanish master . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Say'st thou so ? And dost thou think to oppose thy will to mine ? The maid shall be my wife . BEHECHIO . Behechio Her will alone Shall govern her . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan My will shall govern her , And you  --  ANACAONA . Anacaona O , cease this discord ! What avails it ? Roldan , content you . You shall urge your suit To her who must decide it . Hapless child ! If from her Carib sire she had received The Carib spirit , she were far more fit To wrestle with her fate ! ( Approaching the cottage . ) Alana , haste , Come forth ! ALANA Alana ( coming from the cottage ) . What would you , mother ? Ah ! She perceives Roldan , and turns to retire . ANACAONA . Anacaona Remain . Exeunt Anacaona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not ; what do you fear ? If those who love you are received thus coldly , How would you look upon your enemies ? This little hand declares its mistress ' heart , And trembles in my grasp as if't were pressed By venomed snake . Alana , is this well ? Why should you hate me thus ? ALANA . Alana I bear no hate To aught on earth , except my own existence . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Hate aught on earth except its brightest gem ! Hate sun , and moon , and stars , and hide their rays ' Neath thy displeasure , but shine on thyself , The brightest star that e'er shed smiling hope Upon a wanderer 's heart , and beaconed him To shelter and to joy ! ALANA . Alana Alas ! alas ! A star hid ' neath dark clouds , whence jarring storms , Thunder and lightning fierce , burst forth . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Fair maid , Complain not of those storms , since thou hast power To shed thy smiles , and , like the noonday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALANA . Alana I once could smile . Those careless hours are fled . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Smile upon me , Alana , and that smile Shall be to us the sign of peaceful union Between thy race and mine . ALANA . Alana Would that a smile Were the sole pledge required ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Now aid me , saints ! For a blunt soldier 's brain lacks the swift wit To match a woman 's humors . ( Aside . ) No , Alana , Thy wish is vain . More than a smile 's required . This is the bond which shall unite our people . Takes her hand ; she withdraws it . Is this thy answer ?  --  O for some strong spell To chain the rising dragon in my breast ! Aside . Alana , since we met thou know'st I 've stooped To win thy favor as I would not stoop Even to my king , though such humiliation Would gain a crown . If I 've seemed harsh at times , The fear to lose thee moved me to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooing , It was not so when first I knelt ,  --  when first I told the tale which to a woman 's ear Is ne'er ungrateful . ALANA . Alana True , all true , Roldan ; But I was weak and foolish ; then my heart Knew naught of love ,  --  and I was wrong ,  --  most wrong . O , be thy wrath appeased by this abasement ! Kneeling . Forgive me , and forget me ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Maiden , rise ! Subdue these childish tremors , and be firm . I will address thy reason , not thy heart . Listen , Alana , and weigh well my words ; For on thy answer hangs the fate of him Who won the love which once I fondly hoped Would rest on me ; and on thy answer hangs , Perchance , thy people 's fate . Dost understand ? ALANA . Alana Too well ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Since Don Hernando now is banished , No longer will his presence feed the flame Which his false flattery raised within thy breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what thou wilt , But think not to asperse my absent friend . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Pique but a woman 's vanity , and straight She 'll speak , though she before were spellbound . Aside . He 's gone , nor will return ; ere this the ship Which has received him spreads her snowy sails To catch the Western breeze , and ploughs the wave Towards his native land . ALANA . Alana It is not so ! Revoke thy words , Roldan , in charity ! Say that thou hast deceived me ,  --  that Guevara Is still upon the island ,  --  and I 'll be Your slave ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan What frenzy seizes you ? Is't strange That this gallant , finding no longer hope To mar my wishes , has at length obeyed The viceroy 's orders , and embarked for Spain ? ALANA . Alana Thy words have wellnigh killed me ! Let thy sword Complete the sacrifice ! If this be so , Where shall I look for faith ?  --  I 'll not believe it ! He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft Of thine , Roldan , to crush still more my heart , And mould it to thy will . But thou shalt fail ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Hear me , Alana ,  --  ALANA . Alana Off ! I will not hear thee ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan By Heaven , thou shalt both hear and answer me In milder mood than this ! A soldier 's patience Is ever brief , and mine is of the briefest . Tax not my mood too far , for thy weak hand Has not the skill to rein it . ALANA . Alana ' T is a task I would not seek . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Hear me ! Thou seest thy race , Where'er they 've sought to oppose the Spanish arms , Fall victims to their rashness , and their homes Become the conqueror 's prize . Xaragua 's plains Have yet escaped , for peace still reigns between The Spaniards and thy tribe ; but this may vanish . Perchance the embers now exist of discord , And who can say how soon a blast may rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofttimes when the air is calm , the sun Without a cloud , and nature all at peace , Bursts forth the dread Urican , whose fell breath Brings universal desolation ? Know Man 's passions are Uricans , deadlier far Than those the warring elements produce . They have swept o'er this island , but have left One little spot of peace ,  --  this blooming province . Yet here they may burst forth , and strip these vales Of all their charms . Wouldst thou avert the doom ? ALANA . Alana At cost of life . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan I would that thou shouldst live , Not die for it . Behechio has resolved He 'll not bestow thee on me , save thy will Accompanies thy hand . ALANA . Alana Ah ! said he so ? Then there is help . O , I was most unjust To think that he would see me sacrificed ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Each word she utters more inflames my wrath ! Aside . If thou art wise , be silent , and attend . Behechio has threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Canst thou divine How this will end ? ALANA . Alana Would I could answer , No ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Behechio resists me ; thy weak race Stand forth to oppose the Spaniards ,  --  to oppose Their unarmed bodies to the sword and spear Of fatal steel ; while from the impervious mail Their arrows fall innoxious . Say , Alana , How must this end ? ALANA . Alana O man of violence , Destruction hangs upon thy lips , and death And desolation seem but sport to thee ! Where must this end , you ask ? Not where you wish . Thou know'st not , Spaniard , where it shall begin ; For when thy hand is raised against my tribe , I will commence the work , and in my breast Plant the first steel that 's bared , ere clasp thy hand Red with my people 's blood . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan And will thy death Avert thy people 's fate ? No ! by the saints , If thou shouldst dare the deed thou threatst me with , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying on thy noble mother , And hundreds of thy friends in chains around her , Writhing in tortures such as fiends invent To aid man 's vengeance . But why do I threat ? Life is too dear to one so young and fair , To be resigned so rashly . Thou hast heard The horrors of resistance ; listen now To the reverse . Consent to be my bride . My rank and power will shield thy native vales From the oppression which now desolates The rest of Hayti ; thou , fair maid , wilt be The pledge of peace and faith . This little hand Shall form a chain of concord , stronger far Than all the gold which Hayti 's isle can boast , Though it were forged in links which might withstand A giant 's grasp . I know thou lov'st me not ; I know the heart is gone whose wealth I sought ; Yet doubt I not in time it would return To its liege lord . Say , when thy homes are burned , Thy friends , or dead or dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woe Springs from thy love to one , who , far away , Knows not the desolation he has caused ? ALANA . Alana Roldan , you urge me cruelly . Alas ! I know your power ; I know my people 's weakness . But press not my decision ; give me proof Of the devotion you so oft profess . The summer moon is in her glory now ; Wait till she vanishes , and the next moon Uprears her slender horns . Be generous . Leave me in peace till then . Grant me this boon , And I will think it proves thy love as deep As oft thou'st sworn . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Alana , be it so . Weigh well my words , nor deem them empty threats ; For know , my head has never planned the deed My hand was slow to execute . Farewell ! Exit Roldan . ALANA . Alana I do believe thee . Not the incarnate fiend , Whose doings oft I 've heard thy followers tell , And tremble as they told , had less remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Than thou and thine to follow in his steps . ( Renter Behechio and Anacaona . ) ANACAONA . A nacaona Thy tyrant 's gone . ALANA . Alana He has . ANACAONA . Anacaona Thy tears attest The harshness of his words . BEHECHIO . Behechio Poor , trembling maid , Would I could save thee from the woes that hang O'er our devoted race ! ALANA . Alana I 'm doomed to be The foremost victim . ANACAONA . Anacaona Say not so , my child ! The Alcalde 's wooing 's harsh , yet by his threats He means but to affright thee . ALANA . Alana O mother , you are strangely blind ! BEHECHIO . Behechio You 're right , And you , Anacaona , wrong . Alas ! Will naught remove the film that form your eyes Shrouds every danger ? Caonabo 's death You can excuse , can see your daughter wronged , And vainly judge his enemies and hers By your own purity of heart . ' T is woe That thy own virtues must be made the snares To entrap thee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death can save thee from Roldan , And should rejoice if thou couldst school thy heart To hear his wooing patiently . ALANA . Alana I 've gained Some short delay , and promised , when the time He 's granted at my suit shall have expired , To answer , ay or no , his urgent suit . BEHECHIO . Behechio And if you answer , No ? ALANA . Alana He threats with fire And swift-avenging sword to desolate The province . BEHECHIO . Behechio Doubt not he 'll perform his threat . ANACAONA . Anacaona Why shouldst thou think so ? He has proved our friend . But thou , Behechio , art as suspicious As I am rash ; we should exchange our natures ; The first should be the woman 's fault ; the last Is far too oft the man's.  --  My gentle one , Thy sorrows are my own ! Thy every tear Wrings my fond heart ! Would that I had the power To banish thy distress , and give thee joy ! BEHECHIO . Behechio Poor fated dove ! Thou must yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps away Our rights , our wealth , our homes , our hearts ' best treasures , As they were autumn leaves ! Yes , thou must yield , And wed Roldan , or wed with misery ! ALANA . Alana What greater misery than to be his wife ? BEHECHIO . Behechio Would it be less to see his threats fulfilled ? ALANA . Alana Yet there 's one hope ! Guevara will return ! BEHECHIO . Behechio Call'st thou that hope , to see thy lover fall A victim to the Alcalde 's rage ? ' T were best For him and you he never should return . Subdue these tears ; my words are meant in kindness . Thou ne'er shouldst need to weep had I the power To master these intruders . List my counsel ;  --  ' T is given in love and truth ;  --  forget Guevara  --  ALANA . Alana Forget him ! Never ! yet , my dearest friend , Think me not wilful . Though Guevara 's love Is my sole happiness , could I but find Some charm which from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize Its aid . But no ! The blasts of time , of care , Of withering sorrow , may pass o'er my heart , Yet leave in its first power my youthful love ! BEHECHIO . Behechio Ah , thou art young , and know not how the touch Of time , of care , and sorrow can remove Emotions which to youth seem everlasting ! This time alone can teach . But thou hast seen What turmoil here Guevara 's short sojourn Produced ;  --  reflect what misery must ensure From his return . Seek not to lure him back . Roldan has wealth and power : his haughty heart Thy charms have conquered , and thy voice can rule . Is it not triumph to behold this man , Before whom others tremble , kneel to thee , And own thy word a law ? Resume that power . One smile , one word of kindness , would subdue His tiger mood . ALANA . Alana Sooner I 'd die than wed him ! ANACAONA . Anacaona ' T is cruelty to urge it ! No , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid Will yet arrive . So beautiful , so young , Who could be steeled against thy misery ? BEHECHIO . Behechio It is her youth and beauty which are doomed To cause that misery . But words are vain . The storm which must o'erwhelm us darkly lowers Above our heads . Too truly did my heart Forewarn me that Guevara would become The hastener of our doom , and its still voice Is fatally attested ! If his steps Again disturb our vales , the blood of those Who through his fatal passion fall must rest Upon his guilty head ; and may my curse Cleave to his soul  --  ALANA . Alana Hold ! Curse him not ! My love Should shield Guevara from your wrath ! BEHECHIO . Behechio Fond maid , Thy woman 's heart , which deems that all must yield To its weak passion , can not waste a thought Upon the woes of others . Go ! enjoy Thy dream of love ! Recall the Spanish youth , And let his kiss banish the short-lived tears My words call forth , while bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whose dying eyes shall curse thee when their lips Have lost the power of utternance ! Exit Behechio . ANACAONA . Anacaona Woe is me ! Where'er I turn , dissension dogs my steps ! Wealth , power , and rank , and joy were lost to me When false tongues lured my husband to his doom , And now my only hope of happiness , My loved Alana , droops . Ah , woe is me ! Exit , leading Alana . SCENE II . The forest near Anacaona 's cottage . Enter Guevara . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara And now methinks I 'm at the height of madness ! The man , who loses ' neath a foaming torrent A gem of price , and straightway seeks the wave , And vainly plunges to regain his treasure , Is not more wild than I. I am resolved Upon a desperate enterprise ; my life Each moment is at stake , and I must hold Both head and hand alert in its defence . Not the loud thunder in its sternest peal , Not the fierce lightning rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , Or more relentless , than Roldan , if once His will or interest spur him on . I come To win or die . Not knightlike may I stand And face my foe , but , like the treacherous thief , Am fain to gain by stratagem my treasure . Ah , yonder stands the bower where dwells my love ! Perchance in sleep Guevara is forgot ; Perchance she wakes and weeps . I 'll summon her ; A storm approaches , and no other roof Must give me shelter . ( Alana appears from the cottage . ) But she comes , uncalled . I 'll play the eavesdropper , and , standing near , Learn if she think of me . Conceals himself . ALANA . Alana ( coming forward . ) I can not sleep , For cruel dreams make slumber horrible . Wild clouds whirl o'er the moon , to whose decline I look for joy . Guevara , dost thou too Gaze with impatience on the slow career Of yon pale orb ? Dost thou too count the hours Which must elapse before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide thee back To sad Alana ? GUEVARA Hernando de Guevara ( discovering himself ) . Let this fond embrace Solve all thy doubts , and banish all thy sadness . ALANA . Alana Guevara ! Here ! O , this is happiness ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Short-lived , I fear ; but it is happiness . There 's care upon thy brow . ALANA . Alana Nay , heed it not . Say , how in safety have you reached me , how Evaded the Alcalde 's vigilance ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Thy heart should tell thee how imperious Love Fetters Time 's wings . O , wearily the hours Have passed since last we met , and my fond heart  --  And proud as fond  --  no longer could submit To banishment ! And for my safety , know That Love inspires his votaries with wiles No other power could teach . ALANA . Alana How dost thou hope To escape the Alcalde 's eye ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Thou , dearest maid , Shalt aid to save thyself and me . ALANA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Speak . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara First , thy mother 's love Must screen me from my foe ; and , next , thy care Must seek my trusty kinsman , De Moxica . ALANA . Alana I 'll fly , Guevara , to perform thy will , For fear some unseen chance should wreck my hopes , Ere they are fairly launched upon this sea Of doubt and danger . Enter thou the cot . Exeunt severally . SCENE III . Another part of the forest . A violent storm ; thunder and lightning . Enter a number of Spaniards . FIRST SPANIARD . First Spaniard The saints protect us ! O , that I were safe In Andalusia 's vales ! Not all the gold That e'er on Hayti 's island has been found Should tempt me back to face these hurricanes . SECOND SPANIARD . Second Spaniard Ah , Madre de Dios ! another flash ! I 'm almost blinded ! Holy Mother , hear ! Save me this night , and to thy shrine I vow Six waxen torches ! Virgin , save thy child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iago 's shrine will place An ounce of gold ! Sancte Iago , ora , Ora pro nobis ! THIRD SPANIARD Third Spaniard Think'st thou this wild storm Can make the Alcalde tremble ? FIRST SPANIARD . First Spaniard He has cause , As well as we who 've so long done his bidding . If I can ' scape the dangers of this night , I 'll serve some leader of more tender conscience . SECOND SPANIARD . Second Spaniard I ask no better leader than Roldan ; But since he has submitted to Columbus , And gained his office and his lands , I think He plays the judge upon his ancient comrades , Who fought for him when he was landless . Ah , Another flash !  --  another stunning peal ! Sure there 's some judgment in this hurricane ! Hark ye , my friends , you know the young Guevara FIRST SPANIARD . First Spaniard Ay , we do so ; of noble blood is he As any in Castile , and ever bore him Knightlike to high and low . But what of him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcalde To banish him , and some have dared to whisper That there was danger of foul play . Think you He 's been despatched , and Heaven has sent this turmoil To awe the guilty ? FIRST SPANIARD . First Spaniard Nay , comrade , Heaven forbid ! THIRD SPANIARD Third Spaniard Perchance his wrathful spirit rides the blast ! Ave Maria ! guard thy votary ! SECOND SPANIARD Second Spaniard Come , come , my friends ; we shall be needed elsewhere . Let 's haste for shelter to the Alcalde 's quarters . The hurricane , I trust , has spared that , though It has o'erthrown our frailer dwellings . Come ! Exeunt Spaniards . ( Enter Behechio , followed by Indians . ) BEHECHIO . Behechio Rage on , ye winds , and ye , terrific fires , Seek our oppressors ' hearts ! Sure Heaven in wrath Hath moved earth , air , and water to avenge The white man 's crimes . Not in the memory Of Hayti 's oldest sons hath such wild war Ere raged upon our island . Hated race ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O , list , ye raging blasts ! Bear off upon your wings of might each trace Of Spanish power , and I will bless your rage , And glory in my devastated vales , For hope and freedom will be ours again ! Exeunt . ( Enter Guevara . ) GUEVARA . Her nando de Guevara With joy I marked each tint of daylight fade ; With joy I marked the twilight usher in The friendly night . But such a night ! Methinks The fiends of hell shriek in the rushing blast , And ride upon the lightning . Ah , a crash ! A shriek ! Alana 's voice ! ( Alana rushes across . ) Stay thee , my love ; What terror wings thy steps ? ALANA . Alana Is't thou , Guevara ? I knew thee not , for haste and deadly fear Bewildered me . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Forgive my ignorance And blind impatience , which exposed thee thus To storms and dangers . ALANA . Alana See ! I am unharmed . But as I hurried homeward , a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned , and fell Just as I bounded past it . I have done Thy errand safely . All is well prepared , Thy kinsman bids me say . Near to my home , And unsuspected by our foes , exists A wondrous cave : there will I hide thee ; there At night conduct thy kinsman and his friends . Thunder and lightning . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara The heavens seem rent asunder ! ALANA . Alana Save , O , save me ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara My gentle one , could love 's protecting arms Ward off the storms of life , here wert thou safe . But calm these fears , my love ; a forest maid Should bear a stouter heart . That frightful shock Has passed . Look up , and let us hie away . Thou hast been fleet enough when I pursued , My forest bird ! fly from the storm as fleetly . Exeunt . ACT V. SCENE I. In Roldan 's dwelling . Roldan and De Escobar discovered . DE ESCOBAR Diego de Escobar Hath your suit prospered since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may endure me . I confess I much mistook this maid . She 's far more bold Than her soft air bespeaks her . I supposed A few harsh words would bend her to my will , As bends the willow to the rushing blast , But she withstands my threats with threats as dire . DE ESCOBAR Diego de Escobar You will have other work anon . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan How so ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar Your dealing with Guevara has aroused The wrath of many of your sometime friends , Whose birth , like his , is noble . They complain Of insult to Castilian blood , from one  --  ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Ne'er mouth it , man ! I know what thou wouldst say , And value not these whims of birth . The first Who raised this barrier of nobility , To lord it o'er his brethren , must have been Of race as low as they , and or by wealth Or valiant deeds achieved this boasted rank . ' T is ever to the founder of their race That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Fortune aids to rise Are , by their own confession , of more worth Than those who take her favors by descent . Think'st thou I care how my proud followers May chafe against my will ? Ay , let them fret ! ' T is but the stremlet dashing ' gainst the rock . DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar ' T is more . Your pardon , but I 've proved your friend . I tell you , sullen brows and swelling hearts Must not be urged too far , or rashly trusted . These knights are men of action , prompt to ire , Fierce to resent an insult to themselves Or to their privilege , and this they deem Outraged by De Guevara 's banishment . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Dost thou expect me to recall Guevara , And show these cavaliers my penitence For following my own will instead of his ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego de Escobar You must both watch and soothe these murmurers . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan And stoop to sue their pardon for this sin ? DE ESCOBAR . Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you should win their aid ; and now A little courtesy may well be spared To those who 've served you bravely . ( A soldier rushes in . ) ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan How is this ? SOLDIER . Soldier Angels protect us ! ' T was his ghost ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Whose ghost ? Speak , quick , or I 'll despatch thy quaking soul Forth from its earthly covering , that thou Mayst ne'er fear ghost again ! What wouldst thou say ? SOLDIER . Soldier Seor , the blast o'erthrew my hut ; I fled , But , by the horrors of the storm confused , I knew not whither . Suddenly a flash Showed me beneath the trees a stately form With ghastly face ;  --  ' t was Don Hernando 's spectre ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Thou gaping idiot , dost thou neglect A soldier 's duty ,  --  let a stranger pass thee Without a challenge ,  --  then with senseless clamor And tales of ghosts think to blind scrutiny ? Hence with thy fears ! Yet stay , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the princess ' dwelling . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan So ! It moved that way ? SOLDIER . Soldier My lord , I saw it sink Into the earth . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Thou'rt certain of the spot ? SOLDIER . Soldier I knew not where I was , until the lightning Disclosed the cottage through the trees . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Keep safe This wondrous vision . Breathe it not again , Or , by my life , thy tongue shall pay the forfeit ! I would not have my trustier followers Infected by thy fears . Go . Wait without . Exit soldier . Guevara has returned ! You trembling fool Has seen him . Why he prates thus of a spectre I wonder much . Would it were so indeed ! This needs attention .  --  Sank into the earth ?  --  I 've heard some whisper of a cavern , filled With treasures of the tribe , nor heeded it . But this new treasure must be looked to . We Must learn what hopes he has . Don Adrian Will know his covert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tampered with . At night yon fool shall guide us to the place Of his encounter . We must find this cave . Lose not an hour . You test these malecontents . I 'll to Anacaona 's cottage , there To seek this ghost that haunts my timid bride . Exeunt . SCENE II . Before Anacaona 's dwelling . Enter Alana from the cottage . ALANA . Alana The storm has long since passed , yet still I tremble As when its fury raged . Guevara says A forest girl should never know such fears ; But Spaniard and Xaraguan last night Trembled alike , nor blushed to own their terrors . ( Enter Roldan . ) ROLDAN . Franc isco Roldan Fair maid , methinks you would supplant the sun , So bright your eyes are beaming , while his rays Still sleep behind a night of clouds . ALANA . Alana The storm Struck horror to my heart . I could not rest , Even when its fury ceased . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Would thou couldst know The hurricane of love which in my breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alana Must I remind you of your promise ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan No . I have not yet transgressed it . When I said I would not urge your answer , I reserved A lover 's privilege to plead my cause And sue for favor . Have you ever thought On our last meeting ? ALANA . Alana Can you doubt it ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Ay ; ' T was possible that some more welcome theme Engrossed all place within your breast . ALANA . Alana Ah , me ! Can he suspect ? There 's meaning in his eye . I must appear unmoved . ( Aside . ) Did but my will Hold even course with duty , I had thought More deeply on that meeting ; as it is , What could efface it from my memory ? ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan She shrinks beneath my glance . ( Aside . ) And I may hope ? ALANA . Alana Why shouldst thou seek my love , when maids as fair Each moment meet thy view , who , proud as fair , Would glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn girl ! You know your power ,  --  know that my faithful heart Is yours alone ; so scruple not to jest Of those who can not rival your young charms . ALANA . Alana What shall I say ? The time is opportune To affect submission , and thus turn aside Suspicion , if he harbour it . Alas , ' Twill be a bitter task ! ( Aside . ) Methinks , Roldan , That flattery must be dear to Spanish dames , Since you , who call yourself a plain , blunt warrior , Invoke its aid so oft . A Haytien girl , Used to sincerity , may be forgiven For doubting . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Why , I 've wooed thee with soft words And with harsh threats . What will subdue thy heart ? Speak , and I pledge my soul to win the spell ! ALANA . Alana In truth , I could be grateful if your love Were more like reason , nor so wildly varied ; First seeking through my vanity to win , And next to crush me by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule my conduct by your will  --  ALANA . Alana Nay , now your question overleaps your promise . The moon has not yet waned . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Grant me one kiss , A pledge of hope and sweet forgiveness ! ( She shrinks , and turns away . ) Traitress ! Think'st thou I can not pierce the shallow wiles By which thou seek'st to blind me ? Tremble , girl ! I know Guevara has returned ; I know Thy mother shelters him . He has abused My former mercy , and his doom is sealed By his and thy own folly . ( Alana kneels to him . ) Off , I say , Nor hope I will relent ! ALANA . Alana Mercy , Roldan ! O , spare him ! Spare Guevara ! Wreak thy rage Upon my head ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan On thee ? No , thou shalt live To glut my vengeance ,  --  live to curse thy life ! ALANA . Alana It is already cursed , and I am cursed ! O , plant thy dagger in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roldan Thou shalt live to bless my sight With agonies that martyrs never knew . Thy lover 's corse shall blacken in thy view , And thou shalt gaze upon him till thine eyes Stiffen with horror . ALANA . Alana O , be merciful ! Let but Guevara live , and any doom Thou canst name for myself I will endure . ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan When you can pledge yourself to be my wife  --  ALANA . Alana O , no , no , no ! So great a sacrifice ,  --  Can I submit ?  --  O , whither shall I fly ? Kinsmen and friends , where are ye ? O Guevara ! ROLDAN . Francisco Roldan Alana , calm this frenzy . If to save Guevara be your choice , swear to obey My wishes . You are powerless . Think well . Another hour shall see this dagger 's point Drenched in Guevara 's blood . You tremble : swear ! Do you still hesitate ? Now , by the saints , If I 'm not quick obeyed , thy rebel blood Shall flow before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prey to woman 's caprice . One stroke shall set me free . She faints . So , my unruly tongue 's o'erleaped the mark , And , ' stead of forcing her into compliance , Has driven her senses from her . Sure my fate Decrees this stubborn girl to be my curse ! Bears Alana into the cottage . SCENE III . The cavern . Guevara discovered , as just awakened from slumber . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Here , like a beast of prey within his lair , I couch , and sleep , and wait the friendly darkness , Which brings me freedom and the breath of heaven . I know not whether noon gleams in the sky , Or night , with drooping lid , hangs o'er the earth ; For , through my fevered dreams , my unchained thoughts In minutes have performed the deeds of hours . At last a sound invades my tomb ; a rustling As of a young bird 's wing among the boughs . ( Enter Alana . ) ' T is night , ' t is night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shades , and makes this sepulchre Her throne . O my beloved , I may look Into thine eyes ' pure light  --  But how is this ? No smile upon thy lip ? thy cheek 's warm glow Quite faded ? Speak ! I 'm tortured by such fears  --  ALANA . Alana We are betrayed ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Betrayed ? How ? When ? By whom ? ALANA . Alana I know but this ; some dire , some fatal chance Hath to Roldan disclosed thy bold return . What demon hath he bought to track thy steps ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara This is some dream , some frenzy of thy fear . ALANA . Alana Too true , too fearful . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Why am I still safe ? ALANA . Alana Thank Heaven that even his keen , ferocious eye Hath never reached this spot ! Here , on thy breast , This very hour , let me expire , ere meet Again his hated glance ! O my own love , Such numbing terrors steal o'er my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can wish to live ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara If my retreat is unsuspected , all May yet be hoped . Shake off this withering dread ; Think but of vengeance , liberty , and love . ALANA . Alana O love and liberty !  --  sweet hopes , sweet sounds , That , ' mid the sunshine of my heart , breathed forth All harmonies of life , all melodies Of nature 's voices , as in day 's pure light The birds pour forth their joyous carollings , And thousand insects murmur their delights ; But as the sun sinks , sink those pleasant notes ; And as despair 's dark night falls on my breast , That music of my soul for ever dies ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara My woodland flower , so tender and so fair , Why must these blasts sweep o'er thy lovely head ? Yet rouse thee , dear ; ' t is treason to thy knight To shrink and tremble when his arm enfolds thee . Be firm awhile . How didst thou learn this danger ? ALANA . Alana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Who swore thy death , and pointed ' gainst my breast His gleaming steel , to force me to receive His loathsome love . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara For vengeance , Heaven ! Speak on ! ALANA . Alana A welcome darkness , like the shades of death , Hid all things from my sight and sense . I woke Within my mother 's arms . The fiend had fled . Approaching night obscured the earth and sky . With trembling step , yet cautious eye , I sped To warn thee , and to weep within thine arms . GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara My rage is a devouring flame , that preys Upon myself . When shall I give it vent Upon this ravening wolf ? Alana , speak Again my kinsman 's message . Said he not All was prepared ? ALANA . Alana All , all ! GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara This night The tyrant dies !  --  Yet what is death ? ' T is not Revenge . ALANA . Alana ' T is all I ask ,  --  ' t is safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides De Moxica to this spot ? ALANA . Alana My mother ; but a deeper darkness yet Must make the attempt secure . Why didst thou rush Upon such perils ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara For thy love , sweet maid , Which makes the peril pastime . Thou , for mine , Must rule thy fears and steel thy throbbing breast , For if we win , the victory is thine ; And if we fail , thou'It need to banish all The woman from thy heart , or die of woe . ALANA . Alana Ay , I behold thee now glorying in youth , In strength and beauty , yet a few short hours May banish the bright vision ,  --  ' t is too bright To bless my fond eyes long ! Yes , thou mayst fail . What then am I ? The Alcalde 's hopeless slave ,  --  His wife ! Forbid it , Heaven ! Yet what escape ? GUEVARA . Hernando de Guevara Save through the avenues of death there 's none . Alana , my own love , thou hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repays them all , but thou canst never know , If I should fall , the frenzy of my passion ,  --  Know all that proves its deathless truth : high hopes Of honor , rank , and fame , thy beaming glance Hath far outshone , and now I stake my life , And ask but one return ,  --  thy promise , love , Never to wed my enemy .
