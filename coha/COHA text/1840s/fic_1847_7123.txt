PAUL PERRIL , THE MERCHANT 'S SON : OR THE ADVENTURES OF A NEW-ENGLAND BOY LAUNCHED UPON LIFE . BY PROFESSOR J. H. INGRAHAM , AUTHOR OF THE QUADROON , ' LAFITTE , ' MONTEZUMA , ' &c.,; &c.; PART FIRST . BOSTON : WILLIAMS &; BROTHERS , 22 , CONGRESS-STREET . Preliminaries Main text CHAPTER I. The Yankee predeliction for wandering . Some account of Paul 's percentage . A few passages touching gentility . ' Paul and his brother . New England is the great population nursery of the American continent . The young shoots which it produces annually , are reared with an eye to transplanting , rather than for domestic growth . Of every seven juvenile plants five are sent off to be planted in the South and West  --  to thrive in Oregon or bear fruit in California . For a family of children born in the land of Pilgrims to remain there as men and women within sight of the smoke of the paternal home , is an event scarcely known . Where shall I emigrate  --  where shall I make my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy as he begins to discover a beard upon his lip . Such was the question our hero , Paul Perril , addressed to himself one sunshiny morning when he had scarcely reached his seventeenth year . This was , it is true , rather an advanced age for a spirited New England youth to put this inquiry for the first time , inasmuch as they are expected to begin to earn their living by the time they enter their teens . ' Indeed , two-thirds of the boys do earn their bread and butter at this early age . Cast an eye through the length and breadth of the land of steady habits , ' and for every man in business , you will find a smart little fellow in his employ , smart , shrewd , and with all his eyeteeth cut . Boys in Yankeedom are men before they have yet gone through the period of youth . They leap from their mother 's lap right into the bustle and activity of money-getting . They cast aside their tops and balls to grasp the sterner tools of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaned from home . It is well it is so , or there would be much unhappiness undergone , and many , many bitter tears shed by the courageous little exiles from the domestic hearth . Paul Perril was a Yankee boy throughout . He was frank and fearless in his bearing , quick-witted , shrewd and intelligent . He possessed , moreover , a very generous nature , was kind and benevolent , a little roguish withal , and had a heart large enough to embrace the whole world within the pinions of his kindly feelings . His birth place was in the valley of the Kennebec , one of the most beautiful regions of New England . The town was a thriving business place , situated upon the river bank , and contained , besides a long street filled with stores , several back streets lined with genteel dwelling-houses , shaded by trees , and mostly having before them neat flower-beds , besides spacious vegetable gardens extending far in the rear . The society was highly respectable , that is , it consisted of thirty-one or more families who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they were the families of merchants , lawyers , doctors and clergymen , and two or three retired wealthy men ; that they had green blinds to their houses ; that the houses were two stories in height ; ( for respectability never occupies small abodes ! ) that they contained a handsome front parlor , never used but two or three times in a year , and which the children ' were never allowed to enter ; that the parlor held a piano-forte ; that the daughters went to the boarding-school , and the boys to the academy ; and lastly , that they , the said genteel families , visited each other and no body else ; for those whom they did not visit were nobodyelses . ' One of the families of this exclusive caste of gentility had the good fortune to produce our hero . Peter Perril was a merchant , and by virtue of his pursuit belonged to the upper thirty-one . ' If perchance he had been a cabinet-maker he would not have belonged to this upper crust , but would have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in heart and head , hands and feet , the very identical Peter Peril , Merchant . There is , evidently , some profound and mysterious principle of gentility which , with all our observation , we have not yet been able to fathom , in buying a glass of rum and selling it again by the gill ' across the counter to red-eyed topers . For our part , though we may be singular in our notions , we think there is something much more genteel and elevating to manhood in taking a rough board and skillfully shaping it by sawing and planing and glueing and polishing it into an elegant book case , or a serviceable table . We confess we would rather the hand that held the saw were ours than the hand that extended the gill of rum ! Mr. Perril 's store was like all country stores . We would call them shops , ' but this word has been dropped by country merchants and bestowed upon the places where mechanics labor . Both are mere words . We do n't quarrel with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . The shop of the shoe-maker is a more respectable place than the store ' of the ramseller . But we are speaking of by-gone days  --  days when all store-keepers sold ram and thought no evil of it , at least the world had not then began to lift up its voice against the traffic . Now no merchant ' retails rum . No respectable store-keeper ' dare sell the fiery glass to the grovelling wretch who dares to ask for it . Now the finger of scorn and displeasure would be pointed at him . He , therefore , unless lost to all considerations of respectability , all regard for public opinion , banishes it from his store ' and by so much has taken from this word its odium . But twenty years ago , the time when we take up our story , all merchants ' in country towns were cup-bearers to the town topers . Peter Perril kept a store for the retailing of every thing under heaven , from a paper of pins to a puncheon of brandy . He sold dun fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fish-hooks and shingles , brooms and ginger bread , corn and candy , nuts and raisins , tobacco and cigars , domestic sheeting , calicos , tea , coffee , butter , lard , indigo , mats and hats , boots and mittens , scythes and apple-sauce , oats and pepper sauce , besides rum , gin , sherry , sherbet , and every other sort of liquor for making men beasts . Mr. Perril kept out of his store no article that would turn him an honest profit . He consulted the wants of the miscellaneous community and judiciously supplied them . His gains were small in detail but large in the aggregate . He was a thriving man . He owned his store and enlarged it yearly by additions , now to the side , now to the end , new an additional story . He built a house and furnished it , and held up his head with the best . He always went to meeting where he owned a pew . He never kept open later than five minutes to twelve of Saturday nights , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was a notable woman , skillful in household matters , and knew how to bring up a family of children , of which she had no less than nine . It was her aim to bring them up respectably , ' that is , to move in genteel society . She wished her sons to go to college , or be merchants , and her daughters to marry among the first in the land . ' But although Peter made money , he had many bad debts ; and a family of nine children , seven of them boys , is not brought up and fed and clothed and schooled by miracles . It was an expensive family , and became more so every year . The eldest son was sent to college , and there had to be maintained genteely ; ' for Mrs. Perril was quite above suffering her Henry to keep a school to help out his expenses .  --  Clarissa Ann had to go to Bradford Academy to learn piano-playing and other accomplishments . The next boy had to be fitted for College at the Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep up the respectability of the Perrils . Now , what with these nine burdens upon his back , Peter , at each year 's end , found that , although he was making money , he was not growing rich . He had four sons large enough to make their way in the world , and two daughters that might have maintained themselves by teaching or some other genteel pursuit , such as milinery or dressmaking . Yet these seven were all on his hands . To support them took all his profits . ' He at length began to lose money in some operations , and then he opened his eyes and saw that it was time they should help him in the matter of their own maintenance . He therefore boldly told his wife that the three boys who were at the Academy should go to trades at once . This idea filled the mind of Mrs. Perril with horror . The bare thought of one of her children becoming a mechanic was enough to throw her into a paroxysm of hysteria . She remonstrated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family . What will people say ? ' was repeated by her not less than a hundred times . Peter said he cared not what people said ; he was not able to maintain them , as they ate up and wore out all his profits . ' Henry may go through College , ' he added , and Sam may enter if he will help himself by keeping school . The rest of the boys shall go into stores or be bound out to trades ! ' You once would not look at a trade for your son , Mr. Perril . ' I was once a fool . I have grown wise . I was educated , as we have been educating our boys , in the notion that all mechanical occupations were low . I have learned better . I have found as good men who are mechanics as those who are store-keepers ; yes , I may say better . I believe that the mechanics , as a class , are the most honest and upright Their pursuits are far more honorable than mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Because I feel so . In a word , I have resolved to make my boys useful , and my girls too . Clarissa shall come home and learn housekeeping under your eye . It will save the girl , and make her fitter for a good man 's wife . Now , not another word . I am toiling day by day , only to spend . I want to get rich . I want to lay up something for our old age . I dare not trust to my childrent to help me then . Children are apt to forget the old people , or begrudgingly help them . No no , Mrs. Perril ; it is time we should take care of ourselves . I shall save full four thousand dollars in the next five years by putting out my boys to trades . ' Do n't put them to trades , then , but get them places , dear , in some genteel counting-room in Boston . I do n't see why they should go to low trades . ' Low ! Go down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mr. Doler 's jeweller 's shop , and then go into my store and see me up to my elbows in rum and flour , molasses and corn , and say which is the neatest , cleanliest , most genteel employment . But have your own way . I would make them useful and happy , therefore I would make mechanics of them . The merchant is daily harrowed by doubts , fears , perplexities , losses , disappointments , and a thousand other things that the mechanic knows nothing of . I will leave the matter to the boys . Let them choose . ' I know none of them will consent to go to trades . ' We will see . On Sunday after church , as they will all be at home , I will have the matter brought up . ' On Sunday , at the time appointed , Mr. Perril called his sons about him and made a speech in the spirit of the conversation just detailed . He then asked them what they would choose ? Three replied that they wished to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero , said he much preferred to go to a trade . This preference , however , had to yield to the will of the majority ; for one and all said that it would be a disgrace to them as clerks in Boston to have it known they had a brother who was a mechanic 's apprentice . Paul smiled , but made no remark . Mr. Perril frankly pronounced him the most sensible boy of the three , and gave him permission to remain another quarter at the Gardner Lyceum , where he was then at school . During the week his brothers embarked for Boston in a Kennebec coaster , under charge of their father , who was going up to buy goods . He got one of them a chance in a retail silk store , another he obtained a situation for in a thread and needle store in Hanover street , and a third he was so fortunate as to find an opening for in a genteel ' dry-goods store in Washington street . In the meanwhile , Paul availed himself of his father 's permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied himself to his studies , and availed himself of all the privileges which that excellent seminary affords the youth who seeks a good , practical education . It was on a cheerful sunny morning , the last day of his quarter , as he was standing near the Lyceum , waiting for his tutor to arrive , that he put to himself the inquiry in the first part of this chapter , viz : Where shall I emigrate ? Where shall I go to make my fortune ? And what trade or pursuit shall I engage in ? This , ' he added , is my last day at school . I am now seventeen . The world is all before me where to choose . I would rather be a mechanic than a store-keeper , but rather than either I would prefer being a seaman that I might travel to far countries and see the wonders of the world ! ' While he was thus meditating , the chapel bell called him into his recitation room , whither we will follow him in the next chapter , and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II . Paul 's thirst for adventure awakened . After Paul and his classmates were seated in the recitation hall , the tutor rose and remarked that he , that morning , had received a letter from a gentleman in Boston , which he was requested , by the writer , to read to the students . He then laid open to them the following epistle ; Letter - Boston Oct. 3d , 1827 . Sir  --  I am about going to South America for the purpose of establishing a mercantile firm . I wish to take out with me three or four young men , from seventeen to nineteen years of age , as clerks .  --  I am willing to pay their passage out from Boston , and to allow them a fair compensation for their services after we shall reach our destination . If , sir , you chance to have in your institution any youths who would like to embrace this opportunity for entering life and seeing something of the world , you will confer on me a favor by communicating to them my letter . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to say to them that the ship will sail on the fifteenth of the present month , and that I would like to have them here by the 13th , that they may make their preparations for the voyage . I refer you , sir , and the friends of such youths as may wish to go with me , to Colonel  --  , of Boston , S  --  C  --  , Esq. , of Salem , and P  --  T  --  , of Marblehead . You will oblige me by an early reply . I have made this application to your institution , as I am anxious to have young men of character and talent . I am , sir , your ob't serv't , JONATHAN BEDRICK . ' Letter - Now , my young friends , ' said the tutor , here is an opportunity for some of you who are now just about to leave the institution . It seems to me a very desirable one . Mr. Bedrick I know by reputation . I believe he is a highly respectable man ; and the gentlemen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you would be safe in embracing the proposition conveyed in the letter . If any of you are inclined to accept of it , you will oblige me by giving me your names by to-morrow , as I wish to reply then to Mr. Bedrick 's letter ! ' Before the letter had been half read through by the tutor , Paul had made up his mind to join the merchant on his expedition . The idea of visiting at once a foreign land , awakened all his aspirations after sight-seeing and adventure ; for Paul had not a little of the romantic and adventurous in his temperament . Mr. Haley , therefore , had no sooner done speaking than our hero rose in his seat and said , that he , for one , would consent to go . I will see my father to-night , ' he added , and I have no doubt that I shall be able to gain his consent . ' Three other youths , inspired by his example , and fired with the same ambition for foreign travel , ' instantly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their names were then taken down by the tutor , beginning with Paul 's ; and were as follows  --  Ferdinand Radworth , Henricus Hewitt , and George Fairfax . Thus was this important business settled without trouble or delay ; and the same night the tutor despatched his reply to Mr. Jonathan Bedrick at Boston . Paul lived but a short ride , in a neighboring town , from the Institution ; and the same evening made known to his father what he had done , and then asked his consent . Mr. Perril was by no means ungratified that his son had thus promptly taken himself off his hands , and was not backward in expressing his pleasure that he had , at length , resolved to make his way in the world ! ' And in a respectable profession , too ! That is every thing ! ' added the maternal parent . I knew , Paul , you had too much pride ever to consent to become a mechanic . You will go to South America , and I dare say , discover a gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home rich as Croesus , or the Wandering Jew . I should n't wonder if one day , you was able to buy the large house on the hill and ride in your own carriage . I only want to see the day when I have a son that can look down on these proud Errickson 's and Fawner 's ! Well , I 'll go to work and get your shirts and clothes ready and every thing nice for you to start . ' The rumor that our hero was about to go to South America , soon reached his brothers in Boston , and not a little roused their envy ; for to their minds a clerkship in a foreign country was a princely situation compared with one in Washington or Hanover street in Boston .  --  Distance , ' in this as in most other cases , lends enchantment to the view , ' At length the day came for our hero to quit his paternal roof and take his first step in the great world of action . He took a tearful farewell of his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trunk safely strapped behind , and then sprang into the waiting coach . The next moment it was whirling with rattling axles through the village street on the way to Boston . The third morning our hero arrived there , and was set down at the Commercial Coffee House , then kept by Mr. Merriam , on the corner of Milk and Kilby streets . It was were his father used to put up when he came to the city to buy goods , and he had told Paul to stop there , especially as he expected to be in town and to stop there before Paul 's vessel sailed . Our hero , after being shown to a room in the third story began , for the first time to feel himself fairly launched upon life . From this moment commences his Journal of rather History of his adventures , from which the remainder of the narrative will be given . We have done our part in introducing him to the reader . We now let him speak for himself . PAUL PERRIL 'S ADVENTURES . FROM HIS OWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in my room at the hotel , and had began to realize that I was fairly adrift on the world , I resolved that I would keep a journal of every thing that happened to me or in any way concerned me . I immediately commenced it , and I kept it partiy from memory , but chiefly from records made at the time , until the end of the Adventures which are to follow . From this Journal I have written the veritable History which now challenges the kind reader 's attention . I wish him in the outset to understand and believe that the narrative of events is truth and verity , not fiction ; for I , Paul Peril , am a man , not of straw , but of flesh and blood : and what I record I have seen , and of it bear a part . My narrative now commences from the moment of my arrival in Boston , on the morning of October tenth , 1827 . After the servant had set down my trunk , which I remember was covered with hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters P. P. in an oval of brass tacks upon it , I began to reflect complacently upon my new position . I was alone in a large hotel , no father 's eye , no mother 's care , a trunk of clothing , a new suit upon my back , and four dollars and thirty-four cents in specie in my pocket . I was , too , in the great city of Boston . I was destined to sail for South America . I was a clerk , in embryo , of some vast Commercial House . These ideas , in themselves , sufficiently great , were not a little amplified in imagination . I strutted up and down my little top-of-the-house-chamber , now casting an eye upon my trunk and upon the brass nails that formed P. P. , glittering evidences to the world that the trunk belonged to me , Paul Perril , and now admiring my new suit which Tim Lapboard , the tailor , had cut and basted , but which my mother , by the aid of good Anny Makeman , the village seamstress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jingled the dollars and coppers in my pockets , and dented the floor with my high-heeled boots . After I had sufficiently sacrificed to personal vanity and self , I was struck with the terrific noises that surrounded the hotel , and at times made the very walls shake . I looked out of my window and saw that it was occasioned by the drays thundering over the stone pavements ; but although I discovered the cause , I was none the less amazed by the uproar which nearly deafened me . At length I bethought me I would go out and see Boston , which I had heard so much of , and also pay a visit to my three brothers , who were clerks in stores here . So I opened my trunk and took out my hair-brush aud gave my head a Sunday-smoothing , and then brushed from my coat and trowsers every particle of lint , for I had an idea that in Boston every body went looking as nice as a pin ; that only the country folks dressed plain and wore old and soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a large town to see what wretched garments , what filthy wardrobes bipeds will hang upon their backs . After I had carefully performed my toilet and let the corner of a blue silk handkerchief stick a little way out of my coat pocket behind , I put on my cotton gloves and locking my door ( for I had heard of robbers ) I descended to the lower regions of the hotel . I at length reached the front door where the stage had let me down half an hour before . Two or three gentlemen were standing upon the steps , and in the street I beheld crowds as if all were hurrying to a fire , or an alarm had been given that a man was drowning . The number and hurry of the people , the throng of dravs and carriages , the thunder and overpowing rumble of the heavily laden wheels , the shuffle of feet , the confusion of voices , both bewildered and alarmed me . I stood a few moments upon the step , undecided and confused . I was afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the hurrying people , and so I resolved till they should get past , not to stir . But I soon discovered that there was no end to the passing , either of people or drays , and I then made up my mind to venture to proceed . But I had not taken two steps before I recollected that I did n't know where my brothers ' stores were . So I re-entered the bar-room , and seeing a respectable , middleaged gentleman reading a paper , I advanced to him , and taking off my hat I asked him very politely if he would inform me where the store of Mr. Jeremiah Burns was , this being the tape and needle store where my brother Josiah kept . He replied very gruffly that he did not know any such person , and that if I wanted a Directory I had better consult a printed one . What a Directory was I had not the least idea . I knew , however , that the gentleman was very much displeased , and believing that I must have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he would be so obliging as to tell me what a Directory was , I should be very happy to consult it . Look at that ! ' he answered , pointing with his finger to a wellthumbed book hanging by a string alongside of the desk . I approached it , and seeing the title of it and opening it , I learned that every body who lived in Boston had their names printed in a book , with the streets they lived in and the very numbers of the houses . While I was reflecting upon the ingenuity and convenience of this invention , and suggesting to my mind the expediency of having a similar one for our village , where , as there were fewer people , the task would be much less laborious , my brother Tom tapped me from behind on the shoulder . Ah , Paul , so you were poking over the Direc ' after some of our Num 's , eh ! Glad to see you in Boston alive . How does old ' un and every body else . Heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have been here twice before , to see if you had come . So you are going to Buenos Ayres . Devilish fine chance . I 'm half a mind to go off , too to some other country . Boston is getting too small to hold me . It is no place for a young man of spirit . Why , how rustic you look ! Who the deuce cut that coat ? ' Here my brother , who had rattled on without being interrupted by me , turned me round by the shoulder and coolly surveyed me from top to toe . I at the same time had not omitted to take notice that he was dressed in a very extraordinary fashion ; at least to my rustic vision  --  He wore a claret coat with a very high velvet collar , at least five inches broad , and a waist so fashionably short that the buttons behind scarcely came below the shoulder blade , while the two swallow-tailed skirts fell straight down , a yard in length , nearly to his heels . He were buff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs , and so short and small at the ancle that it seemed to me marvelious , in the first place , how he got them on , and then , in the second place , having got them on how he could sit down in them without bursting them at the seams . He wore also a green taffety waistcoat , that scarcely was long enough in front for a little boy eight years old , and my brother was full twenty , and over the vest was a green ribbon to which was attached a gilt eye-glass . From one of the pockets of the vest I could detect , peeping forth , the point of a pair of bright scissors , the signam of his profession as a dry-goods clerk . While he was surveying me , I was taking the survey I have just recorded of him . Now , at home , Tom used to dress like other people , Anny Makeman being the sole arbiter of fashion , and he having no other tailor save her . Here let me diverge to pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old maid , but one of the best old maids on earth . She was the chief support of aged parents , and heaven having given her clothes-making talent , filial duty unfolded her industry , she west forth sewing and to sew . ' She was a rare cutter , had undoubted genius in fitting , and her taste in style was undisputed . No one like her knew how to cut the paternal coat secondhanded into a new garment for the growing juvenile . She could get suits where a lawyer would have declared a non-suit ; and then how neat were her fits . She worked in every body 's family . She seemed to cut and make and sew for all the boys in town . She was in constant requisition , pre-engaged weeks beforehand . Boys would have to wait till each other had been fitted ; and the impatient striplings have been known more than once to take to the field and do battle for Anny Makeman , the vanquished to waive his prior claim to the victor . She had a calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled always when she spoke ; and was very patient with us boys in fitting and trying on . We all loved her , but I fear now , it was selfish affection . Her needle never rested . She was received in every family like one of it ; and no one withheld family conversations before her , for she never made mischief . She carried with her , from house to house , in her quiet bosom , half the domestic secrets of the town ; but she never repeated them . She was discreet and pious . She made me my first suit of long clothes , and I shall always love her for it . Twenty years have passed , and yet she still goes forth on her daily mission of cutting and making for boys of another generation . I called to see her last week . She was sewing upon a suit for a seven year old urchin . As I gazed upon her , unchanged by time , her shears , her cutting-board and the half-made suit , I was once more a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was making . But to my story . CHAPTER III . The Watch-house . After my brother had sufficiently inspected my outward man , he thus expressed himself : You think , I dare say , Paul , that you are perfection . Your clothes may be the thing ' down in Kennebec , but here they are decidedly green . ' My coat is olive , Tom , ' I answered , not comprehending the symbolical meaning of the word . And the wearer green , ' answered Tom . Well , as you are going off to a foreign country it ai n't much matter , but if you were to stay here in Boston you should never be owned for a relation of mine in such a long-waisted coat . ' I began to get a little irritated at my brother 's manner , for I knew that I was as well dressed as any young man in my native town . My clothes shone with the gloss of newness , my boots squeaked at every step their fresh origin from the last , and my white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . But putting down his words to the score of envy at my superior position as clerk to a foreign firm , I merely smiled my contempt for his observations , and asked after my other brothers . Oh , they are in fine health , ' he answered . We all have a capital time here . None of us keep open after eight o'clock , and then we meet at Bruce 's Soda Saloon and have a smack , and then are off to the theatre or cruising about the streets . Sundays we always ride out or have a sail in the harbor . ' Ride and sail Sundays ! ' I repeated with surprise ; for we had , at home , always been brought up with religious strictness . Why yes , Master Simplicity . Sunday in Boston ai n't Sunday in the country . Why , my dear boy , how many things you have got to learn . How inconceivably verdant you are , Paul ! Why what should we poor devils in stores do if we had no recreation of a Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stores at sun-up Monday morning , and are in them every day in the week till eight o'clock and sometimes till nine . If we never rode out Sundays what time should we have for recreation and unbending the mind ? I know a fellow who has been a clerk here three years who never had been out of Boston into Roxbury , Cambridge , or any of the beautiful towns in the vicinity , because he wo n't go Sundays , and week days he is a slave ! ' But you ought not to break the Sabbath , nevertheless , Tom , ' said I gravely . It is not our fault . The merchants should love avarice less , and give us every Saturday afternoon , or at least every other one . We could then recreate and on Sundays go to church . But every merchant loves money more than the souls of their clerks . Some , too , who are members of the church ; they keep their clerks in every hour of week days ; and so if the clerks recreate a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the poor clerk ! But do n't let us moralize here , Paul , ' added my brother , putting his arm through mine . We will walk up to my store , and I will tell old Hunks , that my brother has come to the city and I want an hour to go round with you to see your other brothers . He 'll give it to me , but he 'll pay himself for the loss time by keeping back one of my perquisite boxes . ' What are your perquisite boxes ? ' I asked ; for as the reader will see , I was ignorant of many things with which my city brothers were familiarly acquainted . Why they are the boxes goods come in . My Hunks gives me my board and perquisites . These latter amount to about two boxes a week on an average . These boxes I sell to draymen or others who give me a quarter a piece for them . This is all the spending money I get , and also half the clerks in Boston . Now Hunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one less box ! ' What a close hard man he must be ! ' I exclaimed indignantly . It is the custom . He is no worse than many others . Here in Boston every man 's look-out is for his own . No. 1 , letter A , is the chief care . If No. 2 wants a favor he must pay No. 1 for its full value . Time is money here , and every man pays for it and takes pay for it . You 've got a good deal to learn , Paul . ' I see I have , ' I replied ; but how is it if you get but fifty cents a week , you and my brothers are able to ride Sundays ? It must cost you a dollar at least for a carriage . ' A dollar ! ' repeated my brother with a smile . I guess it costs a two-fifty . Horses ai n't hired so cheap here as they used to be at Robinson 's stable , down in Kennebec . Why , you see , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up enough to ride every other . For we go three together ; and sometimes , on the bridge , take up a fourth crony . So we club together and have a fine spree at Fresh Pond . ' I am sorry to see you have forgotten the Sabbath , Tom , ' I said , quite shocked at the change which a year 's residence in Boston had effected in my brother , who , at home , had been very steady and moral . Well , I am no worse than others . When you are with the Romans you must do as the Romans do . ' With this proverb , Tom took me along with him out of the door and , together , we walked up the street . During the day I saw my other two brothers , and found them , in dress and habits and conversation , just the counterpart of Tom . They could talk of nothing but boating , riding , Fresh Pond , bowling alleys , and young girls of the town . They seemed to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of religion . They smoked cigars , drank wine at soda shops , and visited places where vice and profligacy nightly held their licentious levees . I had not been with them two days before I saw that they were by no means fit companions for one who still professed to have some respect for his character ; and so one night when they all three , accompanied by two other youths of similar calibre , came to my room to take me away with them , I firmly told them that I would associate with them no more . At this they all laughed , and my brother Tom paid me the compliment of saying that I had missed my vocation in conseuting to go out as clerk for a merchant ; that I was , without question , cut out for a parson 's clerk : and he went on to add that he had no doubt that he should hear of me preaching to the Patagonians before I had been in South America a twelve month . I laughed good-naturedly at this sally of Tom 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rallied before the two dressy young men ; but reflecting that I was ridiculed only for acting well , I restrained my impulse to answer him angrily . After trying to prevail upon me to accompany them they finally left me to myself , not a little to my gratification . The next morning while I was dressing a servant came to my room and handed me a note . I saw it was in Tom 's handwriting . I opened it and read as follows : Letter - Watch-house ,  --  street Dear brother Paul : Here we are in a fix every mother 's son of us ! After we left you last night we went to Bruce 's and had a first-rate oyster supper . About ten o'clock we sallied forth pretty well up ! ' If I had known how tipsy brother ' Siah was , I 'd have locked him up in Bruce 's back room before he should have gone out with us . Well , he was as drunk as a soger . ' He sang songs to the top of his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . I never saw but one chap before so tipsy and stand . Well , we got to the corner of Broomfield lane when ' Siah saw a Charlie , ' and so he began to sing , O'er the water to Charlie , ' adding some few personal impromptu , that made the watchman mad ; so he told us to keep quiet : for to tell you the truth we all joined in full chorus . I told the watchman , gentlemen had a right to sing , and that there was no law which put them under obligations to ask a Charlie ' what songs they should select for testing their vocal powers . At this , Charlie ' seized me by the collar , when brother Sam up fist and knocked him over . Charlie sprang up and then sprang his rattle . It was answered from half a dozen corners , and in two minutes we were every soul of us captured , though we fought hard . ' Sias was taken up out of the gutter and Sam was only taken prisoner after giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The upshot was that we were marched off to the Watch-house except Josiah , who had to be carried between two Charlies ; and the best of the joke was , although he was too drunk to walk he would sing , and all they could do , he kept up a rip-roarous serenade to all the houses we went by until we were safely lodged here . Now my dear Paul , I write to you to ask you to do what you can to get us off . The watchmen swear unless we pay them ten dollars , which is two dollars apiece , they will have us up before the Police Judge , and then our names will get into the papers and we shall be dished . We have turned our pockets inside out , and all we can raise is a dollar and fifty-two cents , brother ' Siah planking the two coppers . Now you have some money I know . If you have n't enough just go down to the bar and borrow the balance on father 's account , and tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he objects , tell him your trunk is in your room and shall be security . Now , my dear Paul , do this little act for us ; for we know you are a good fellow , and I am sorry I quizzed you . You know if we are put in the papers it might injure you ; for Mr. Bedrick might suppose you were quite as  --  as  --  as  --  ( what word shall I use ? )  --  never mind ! You might lose your chance of going to South America ; which we should be very sorry for , as it would be on our account . So not to have your disappointment on our three consciences , get the dollars ' and hasten to us without delay . The Court opens in an hour ; and if the Charlies do n't have the X by that time up we go ! Your affectionate and loving brother Tom . P. S.  --  Do get the money , dear Paul , that 's a fine fellow , and we 'll never say green ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.  --  Paul , my dear boy , do n't fail to get us out . We are shut up in a dog 's hole , and nothing to eat or drink . Our safety and only hope is in you . We must get out in time to open our shops or we shall all be shipped , and only for an innocent spree ! Do your best Paul , and we ' ll never forget you while memory holds a place in our souls . Your brother in limbo , Sam . P. S.  --  Put a small bottle of Cogniac in your pocket and half a dozen cigars ; for we are so confoundedly stiff we shall have to be carried home in hand-carts unless we are warmed . Tom . Sam . ' Siah . Section After I had finished the perusal of this precious epistle . I could not but laugh heartily at my brothers ' predicament , while at the same time I congratulated myself on having resisted their invitation to accompany them ; for I should without doubt have shared in their present disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , also , I could not but reflect how certainly departure from it was punished . The situation of my brothers both grieved and displeased me . At first I felt disposed to leave them to their fate ; but then I remembered that they were my brothers , and how their infamy , if they should be brought up before the Police Court , would reflect upon all the family . It did not seem just that I should pay for the release of the others , who were entire strangers to me ; but as my brothers had clubbed them altogether under the wing of the ten dollar bill , I had no other alternative than freeing them also . After some hesitation I at length resolved to aid them ; but with the determination of first obtaining their promise to give up all their dissipated habits and try and live upright lives ; though , I must confess , I had little hopes that if they made me such promises they would faithfully perform them . I had in my possession but three dollars and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave me five dollars to borrow . In my life I had never borrowed a dollar of any one . I felt now a reluctance to do so that every sensitive mind must experience at such a time ; for I am well persuaded that the most humiliating act that a man can be guilty of is to borrow money of his neighbor ; and the most humiliating position a man can be in is the debtor behind his time in the presence of his creditors . The sensitiveness which all proper men feel when they come to borrow money is a natural voice in the heart to warn us against sacrifising our native independence of character ; for with the first dollar borrowed , rings the first iron blow upon the links that bind the soul to moral vassalage . This sensitiveness , this fear and trembling , this besitating advance , this heightened pulse and stronger heart-beating , this deeper glow in the cheek , and down-dropping eye , these all eloquently say that the young man is doing a thing  --  that he is making some mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fellow-men . Let the voice of conscience , or sensitiveness , which warns us from evil , whisper to us that we are selling our birth-right of manhood . I can not too strongly urge upon every young man firmly to resist the temptation to borrow money . The habit once formed is destructive to the finest attributes of the character , and leads insensibly to the outer verge of all moral perverseness . There is , of course , a distinction to be made between loans ' of large sums for the purposes of going into business , and borrowing money ' in the ordinary acceptation of the phraseology . It was with no little difficulty that I prevailed upon myself to apply to the landlord for the money . I hardly know in what words I made known to him my wish , for I was too confused to note them . He , however , no sooner understood what I wished than he very civilly handed me the five dollars merely inquiring when I expected my father would be up . I told him in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all right ! ' I was relieved immeasureably by the ease with which I had obtained the money , and having inquired the way to  --  street I hastened to release my brothers and their two friends from the Watch-house . The street was not very far distant , and on reaching it , I found the Lock-up ' very readily . It was a small wooden building , resembling an Engine-house . Over the door was Ward number  --  . ' A large man was standing in it smoking a cigar , who answered my inquiry for the five young men who were taken up the night before , ' by bidding me follow him through an entry towards the interior . CHAPTER IV . The Trio Fraternal . The man whom I followed led me through a gloomy passage , at the extremity of which was a square apartment hung with watch-coats , glazed helmets , rattles , clubs , and other paraphernalia of the city watch . Benches , two feet wide , were placed against the wall , and worn smooth and polished with the greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them for the night . On one side of this room was a door , across which was an iron bar secured in a ring by a stout padlock . Into the wards of this lock my man inserted a key and turning it looked at me for a moment before opening the door with a searching glance . Are you the covey what the young sparks wrote for to get ' em out ? ' said he , as if to make sure that my object in coming was what he doubtless suspected when he first saw me . I am sir , ' was my reply . Then I guess they 'll be glad to see you , ' was his rejoinder , as he let the iron bar drop and pulled open the door . It led into a dark chamber , dimly lighted by an opaque looking lantern hung over head . I could not at first see objects distinctly , but I was made aware of the presence of my brothers , by a burst of joyous exclamations from the obscurity in which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden pallets . Ah , Paul , you are a noble fellow , ' cried my brother Tom rushing towards me and grasping one of my hands , while Sam took the other , and between them they had well nigh torn my arms from their sockets . Josiah came up and hugged me round the neck , swearing I was an Emperor , ' while a little in the back ground stood their two friends , who did not feel that they could assure so much as my brothers in making demonstrations of gratitude ; indeed , I had no portion of my body at their service unless they had each kneeled down and grasped a leg . I could now see the faces of my brothers , my eyes becoming use to the darkness . ' Siah looked pale and hollow-eyed ; and Tom 's optics had a sleepy look . Sam 's left orb was swollen and ornamented with a semi-circular blue ring of bruised blood ; while the coats of their two friends were sadly torn in the back and sleeves , the effects , doubtless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers had given utterance to their expressions of thanks for my prompt attention to their epistle , they released me and began to survey my features to see if they could read in them the ten dollar bill ' on which all their hopes depended . I assumed a very grave aspect . The last night , at my room , they were in the ascendency , ridiculing me , and looking down upon me as a person of no spirit . Now the tables were turned . The whole five , as it were , lay at my mercy . I felt like showing them my power , while at the same time I wished to manifest to them my disapprobation of their conduct . I am sorry , ' said I in my gravest manner , to find my brothers in such a place as this ! ' Here I looked round upon the rough plastered walls and mean appearance of the room . I never expected to find any with whom I claimed relationship prisoners in such a condition ! I assure you all that I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We are all confoundedly penitent , Paul , ' answered Tom in a whining one . We confess we have been in fault , and swear morality , if you only fork over the X , ' added Sam . That 's my dear good boy , Paul , ' stammered Josiah feebly and still tipsily , as if he had not yet become fully sobered ; just get us out o ' this and I 'll do any th  --  thing for you , wo n't we fel  --  fellows ? ' I will release you on one condition , ' I answered . Name it , Paul , ' they repeated altogether . That you promise to ride no more Sundays ! ' Done ! If we do may we get our wicked necks broke , ' they responded with commendable energy . That you stroll the streets no more nights ! ' I continued . If we do may we be locked up in the watchhouse ! ' said Tom with emphasis . Aye , or in Leverett street Jug , ' added Josiah solemnly . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to tipple ! ' Done as if it was already done , ' responded brother Tom slapping my hand . We 'll be as moral as a meeting-house , wo n't we boys ? You wo n't hear of us Sundays'cept at church ! We 'll reform the town ! ' Yes , ' reiterated Josiah , we 'll set an example to all the young clerks in Boston , and they shall go in our foot steps , and the soda shopses , and the Livery stableses shall all break down for want o ' cus  --  customers , sha n't they though ? ' This sentiment was echoed by the other four with unanimity . Now I have one other condition , ' said I. Name it and we 'll do it , if it is to go to prayer meetings before six o'clock every morning , ' answered my brother Tom with an oath ; for all three of my brothers I found had gained , with other things , the accomplishment of swearing since they had left the paternal roof . It is that you terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I am aware are no credit to you ; and to whom I doubt not you are indebted for many examples of profligacy ; for I was told by Mr. Merriam after you left last night that they were two of the hardest cases ' in town . Nay , young gentlemen , ' I added , seeing one of them bristle up , while the other clenched his fist , I do not fear your anger or your hatred . You are wholly at my mercy , unless you prefer going before the Police . I shall , however , for my brothers ' sake release you with them ! ' That 's noble , Paul , ' exclaimed Tom . You are a good fellow at bottom . So you have the money ! Do n't you think I was just beginning to think you had only come here to read us a lecture and then leave us to reflect upon it . But you are a trump ! ' I have no idea what a trump is , ' I answered ; I only know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances my father will approve of ! ' Here I saw Tom whisper to one of the strange young men , and the words green , not to know a trump , ' and from the other , dare say be never saw a card in his life ! ' reached my ears . A trump , my dear Paul , ' answered Tom , a trump is  --  is a devilish good-fellow . Is n't boys ? ' A devilish good fellow , ' repeated all-four , with the fawning readiness of persons who look to another for a present-favor . I do n't ask any praise , ' I answered in a serious tone ; for if you could be relieved in any other way I would not aid you , for it looks like conniving at your profligacy ; but as you have promised amendment , and as I still trust that you are not so far lost to honor or truth as to forfeit your pledged word , I am ready to do my part toward setting you at liberty . If you will inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will transfer it to him . ' To me , ' answered the man who had let me in , and who had listened to all I had said , and he extended his hand for the price of their liberty . I took from my pocket the eight dollars and a half and placed it in his hand , when the whole nice party of five set up a chorus of joyful exclamations and surrounded me in high glee . Tom then gave him the one dollar fifty he had raised in all their pockets . You are at liberty to go , young gentlemen , ' said the Captain of the Watch , for such was this dignitary , and I recommend to you to take the advise of this young man who seems to have more virtue in his little finger than all of you put together . Here , my young gentleman , ' he said turning to me , I read the note they sent you , and I know you are not rich , and had to borrow half of this . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I took a bribe I should lose my place . It is for me either to let them go at once , supposing they have not done had enough to haul ' em up to the Police , or else send ' em down to the Court . I did n't intend to buy off the young men , I only wanted to make ' em pay for their frolic ; and I find to touch the pockets is a good plan as any . The ten dollars I meant to have sent down to the Court as was my duty ; but as circumstances be , and you seem to have come hard by the money , and are such a moral young man , I return you not only your eight dollars , but the part they scraped together . Take it , and you my larks remember all your lives how much better virtue and morality fare than vice and busting ! ' With this speech the honest Captain of the Watch gave into my hands the amount he had received , and which he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would have prevailed upon him to take a dollar at least , as a present . But he refused ; and so we all bade him good morning and sallied forth into the street . Fortunately it was very early , or the breezy look of my companions might have told to hundreds of passers by their story . Tom 's sunken and red eyes , Sam 's bunged peeper , and Josiah 's tipsy look with the torn apparel of the others , were so many chapters of unwritten spreeing and Watch-house experiences . Tom took my arm affectionately while the remaining four locked two by two and followed after us . When each of the two cronies ' arrived at the point nearest his store he slunk off , and by the time I had reached Milk street my brothers only were with me . Now Paul , ' said Tom winningly , I propose that as you are flush you treat us all to a breakfast in at Bruce 's ; for we are confoundedly hungry ! ' I told them that I thought they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them first to do that and then come and breakfast with me . To this they finally consented , though not until Sam had borrowed a dollar of me , and ' Siah fifty cents , leaving me but the amount I had taken with me to the Watch-house . After they had left me I went in and returned the five dollars to Mr. Merriam , not a little grateful in my heart to the honest watchman for enabling me to do it . At length my brothers came in and we breakfasted together for the first time in eighteen months , our last meal together having been beneath the paternal roof . To say the truth the three young men behaved themselves very humbly and quietly at the table , and on my promising , at their urgent entreaty of me , not to mention the watch-house affair to their father , they looked as if they thought me one of the best friends they had in the world . I had no been in Boston four days , and it will be seen by the reader , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up no little experience of metropolitan life . I felt thankful that my fate had not destined me to a clerkship in a retail-store in the city ; for what I had observed of life among them did not by any means give me a taste for it . My brothers did not come near me again until the next evening , when they acted under a certain restraint , as if not perfectly at ease in my company ; and I was not at a loss to discover that their habits and tastes had grown so corrupt with loose companionship that they relished no society where they could not give a free rein to freer speech , especially upon the beauty of young milliners , their susceptibility to flattery , the ease with which their virtue might be conquered by a person of address ; also they loved to discourse about gay females of the town whom they had fallen in with in the streets in their night-wanderings , or else encountered at the theatres . They also discussed wines , oysters , their soda-shop friends , bowling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trio of brothers had twice been to horse races at Cambridge , feigning sickness as an apology for getting off from the store . In a word , I had not been with my precious brothers twenty-four hours before I had my ears shocked , and my sense of delicacy offended by their free and libidious conversation , not to mention the profane oaths with which from time to time they saw fit to garnish it ; and from them I learned for the first time on my reproving their profanity , that it was genteel to swear , and the sure sign of a man of spirit . But after the adventures in the Watch-house , my brothers were careful what they said in my presence that was offensive to my less genteel ears ; and as they were accustomed to no other conversation but such as touched upon such subjects as I had little sympathy with , they were mostly silent or talked very dully upon indifferent matters . In their eyes I was , doubtless , most wretched company , and I freely confess that in mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me the first day of our meeting in Boston , among other recounts of his life in town , ' that he had really seriously thought of keeping a mistress ! When he had explained to me what he meant , I was not slow in expressing both my astonishment and contempt . Since then , especially since the affair of the Watch-house , they had all been rather shy of me , looking upon me as a goat among the sheep , or rather a sheep among the goats . At length the time arrived when Mr. Bedrick was to be in town , for he was absent when I reached Boston , and I sallied forth to the counting-room in India street , where I had been informed by Professor Haley he was to be found . At this place I had not neglected to call on my first arrival , and there having learned his absence till such a day , I now once more proposed to present myself before the man to whom I was to commit my future destinies . CHAPTER V. The Foreign Merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man to the person who is to control him for some years to come in the character of a master , is one of no ordinary importance . While I was preparing myself to look my best in his eyes , by making my person as tidy as possible , I was busily forming in my mind 's eye some idea of his appearance . All I knew of him was that he was an elderly man , that his name was Jonathan Bedrick , and that he had very respectable ' recommendations . Having properly attired my person I sallied forth and took my way with a brisk step towards India street . At length I stood in front of the store in the counting-room of which I expected to behold the great South American Merchant into whose hands I had resolved to commit my destinies . The height and grandeur of the store enlarged my ideas of the personage who was to be found within . My heart fluttered , and I dare say I was paler than usual as I entered the street door and asked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Mr. Bedrick . Before replying he eyed me sharply , and then asked me , in a sort of confidential tone , if I was one of the young men whom he had engaged to go out with him to South America . Upon my frankly replying in the affirmative , he looked very grave , then smiled meaningly , then shook his head with a sympathizing air . I confess I was not a little startled , so was about to ask the meaning of these signs when he said : From the country , I dare say ? ' Yes , ' I responded for the twentieth time since I had been in Boston , astonished at the unfailing accuracy with which every body who had never seen me before knew my rustic origination . If I had had From Kennebec , ' written in chalk upon my back , the Boston folks could not have known for a greater certainty that I was a young man from down East . ' Better go back again , ' he said in a half impatient way , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back again . You ' ll be sure to cry over the milk after it is spilled , but it will then be too lateTake my advice and quit the concern ! ' It at once occurred to me that this young man , who from the fact that he never saw me before that moment , could have no particular interest in my welfare , and that he was desirous of getting me out of the way that he might jump into my shoes . I therefore smiled quietly and merely answered that I never expected to know every thing so long as Mr. Ignorance was in the world ! He looked very angry at my reply , and turning on his heel said very impressively , Go to the devil ! ' Not caring to take up his words I said nothing but walking past him into the counting-room I saw three persons variously engaged at desks , and a fourth seated at a table writing . I paused , and surveyed them , and came to the conclusion that the elderly man at the table must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment with close attention . He was about fifty one or two years of age , with a very high bald forehead , arched wrinkled brows , and a prominent aquiline nose , beaked like an eagle 's . His eyes were black , deep set , and restless , and one of them was kept nearly half shut , while over the other the corner of the thick eye-brow was knitted sharply . His mouth was large and heavily-lipped . His whole face had an aspect of shrewd intelligence combined with low cunning . I was not then much of a judge of physiognomy , else I had taken the advise of my friend who had sent me so civily to the devil , ' and gone back home without introducing myself to the man of my destiny . I do n't know how it was that I pitched , upon him as the only man in the counting-room likely to be Mr. Bedrick , unless it was that before him on the table lay a hat , and stick , and a pair of gloves , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiter would be likely to do ; and I knew that he only had that counting-room as his head-quarters until he should set sail . After I had surveyed his face and let my eyes wander over his snuffcolored coat and white snuff-stained waistcoat , and the ruffled bosom of his shirt , I mustered courage and advanced towards him hat in hand . I have called to see Mr. Bedrick , ' I said as firmly as I could manage to articulate at such an important moment , my heart all the while going like an engine worked by steam . Without replying at the instant he raised his head and keenly surveyed me , first dropping his spectacles which had been thrust above his forehead . I am that person , ' he at length answered in a nasal tone , and with an effort to appear amiably condescending ; for doubtless he suspected what my business was with him , and for reasons obvious enough now , was desirous of making a good first impression upon me . I have called , sir , with a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a note which stated my name , family , and connexions . Ah , very well , quite well , young man , ' he said , after he had completed its perusal . So you are one of the four young gentlemen recommended to me . I am glad to see you here in such good time . I like your appearance . You have never been in any business  --  always at school till now ? ' Yes , sir ! ' So much the better . You come to me unsophisticated , and without any of the bad habits young men get in town . It was that I might have highly respectable , moral , intelligent , upright young men with me that I conceived the idea of applying as I did by letter to Dr. Haley . The result shows the wisdom of my course . I have already seen this morning young Fairfax and Radsworth who report themselves ready to go at an hour 's notice ! ' So am I , sir . I have been four or five days in town ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am fortunate in getting such five young men , all of the best families in Maine , too , I learn . I want precisely such ; persons that I can trust , confide in , and who will confer credit upon me and my business . Do you know the fourth one , Hewitt ? ' Yes , sir , ' I answered ; my opinion of him gradually growing more favorable . Do you know if he has arrived ? ' Not yet , sir , I believe , though it is possible . I have not seen the other two yet , ' I answered . Is he as active and intelligent as you three seem to be ? ' He is a very clever , sir , and I believe an excellent young man .  --  He bore a good reputation for scholarship and character at the Institution ! ' That is what Healey writes . I am very fortunate in thus getting my young men . Where do you stop ? ' At the Commercial ! ' I shall want to see you and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes . We shall get off by the fifteenth . I hope you will get all things necessary for the voyage , especially thin clothing , which you will need in that climate . Now , good morning . I will send to you when I am ready to see you again . I would prefer you should not make this matter of going to South America an occasion of conversation , as I would rather it should pass quietly . In mercantile affairs secrecy is a great virtue , young man , as you will learn before you have been a great while with me ! ' With this counsel Mr. Bedrick slightly bowed and resumed his occupation of transferring an account from a slip of paper to a small sheepskin-covered memorandum-book that lay before him . I bowed very politely , as it became me to do , to a person of such consideration as a foreign merchant , whose clerk I was destined to be , and backing out of the counting-room I replaced my new hat upon my head , and proceeded to leave the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have usurped my place in the proposed foreign House , but not deigning to bestow upon him even a look of recognition , I walked forth and took my way back to the hotel . When I reached it I was told by Mr. Merriam that my father had just arrived and was gone up to a room . I hastened to him , and after the congratulations of our meeting were over , I informed him that I had seen Mr. Bedrick and that he had desired me to be ready by the fifteenth . During the day Hewitt arrived in a Kennebec sloop , which accounted for his delay , the vessel having been detained by contrary winds three days beyond the usual time required for her passage across the bay .  --  In the evening , we four adventurers and aspirants for wealth in South America , met together at my room , where we discussed our future prospects . We all agreed that Mr. Bedrick was a shrewd-looking old fellow , and on comparing notes generally we found that our opinions nearly coincided respecting him ; Hewitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor than either of us ; but he was an easy , quiet young man , who took every thing smoothly , and possessed the most immovable sang froid ; and no disappointment could have the effect of disturbing his equanimity . The next forenoon my father came in informing me that he had seen Mr. Bedrick , and was very much pleased with him . He said that he was every way worthy of his confidence , and that in surrendering me to his charge he felt that he was paving the way for my ultimate prosperity . He concluded a short chapter of advice to me touching my deportment when I should be solely under his care , by saying that Mr. Bedrick would call at one o'clock and dine with him , when he would like not only to see me but the rest of the young gentlemen together . By my father 's direction I then went in seach of them and invited them to my room to meet our future employer . At the hour set they made their appearance , and shortly afterwards my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room . We found with him Mr. Bedrick , who bowed and spoke civilly to each of us as we entered and took our seats . Mr. Bedrick , Paul , wishes to explain to you and your friends more clearly his intention respecting you , ' said my father . I have talked with him and am satisfied that he will be to you both a father and a friend ! ' Certainly , young gentlemen , that is my intention , ' answered Mr. Bedrick in his shrill nasal tone , one of his black , restless eyes shining out from beneath his contracted eyebrow , while the other was closely shut , like a man looking through a telescope . I hope I shall treat you in a manner as will almost lead you to forget you ever had another father ! I have two sons who go out with me . You shall have the same treatment precisely as they ! I shall know no difference between you . You are all my sons . I trust you will be as sons to me , faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sentiment , when he proceeded after taking a huge pinch of snuff from a tortoise-shell box that was never out of his hand : My intention is to sail on the fifteenth instant from this port for Buenos Ayres , in South America , in the brig Joseph , ' Captain Pright . I am going out for the purpose of establishing two Houses , one at Monte Video , the other at Buenos Ayres . I have my goods for the purpose on board the brig . I am also part owner of her . It is my intention to pay your passage out and to board and clothe you until you are twenty-one , giving you at the same time the privilege of making private speculations for your own benefit and profit . That is the country to get rich in a short time . You will with me get a thorough knowledge of the business and also of the language of the country .  --  At the age of twenty-one I will take you into the firm as partners , or set you up in new Houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my intention to establish agencies in numerous places so soon as I get my business fairly under weigh . Now you fully understand what I am to do and what prospects lie before you , young gentlemen . Hundreds of young men in this city would be glad to go with me ; but I want moral young men ; those who like you have never been hackneyed by the ways of vice , and who can start fair in the world with your unspotted character in your hands . Your parents , ' he continued , addressing my three friends , have corresponded with me , and I have replied to their letters . They express themselves highly gratified with the opportunity that is now offered you . Nothing now remains to be done but for you to sign this paper pledging yourselves each to give me your services until you severally arrive at the age of twenty-one . ' Here he unfolded a long document which he read to us . It embraced the sum of what he had already said , and we walked up to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine was given with a final flourish of unusual dimensions and expressions ; for in my mind 's eye I was already as rich as an Inca of Peru ; Mr. Bedrick 's plausible and eloquent account of his intentions ' and our prospects , ' having quite captivated my imagination and wholly removed from my mind the prejudice which I had in the outset conceived against him . He also , affixed his name to the paper beneath ours , and my father appended his on the left margin as Witness . ' Thus were the formidable preliminaries arranged , and we felt as if we were already at the head of our great commercial Firm ! Mr. Bedrick dined with my father who seemed much taken with him . At length the day on which we were to sail arrived . Information was conveyed to us that we must be on board the brig by three o'clock as the tide would serve at four , when the vessel would weigh anchor and proceed to sea . CHAPTER VI . The Embarking . At the suggestion of Mr. Bedrick we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having informed us that his eldest son , who had been in Cambridge , though whether he had graduated or not we never knew , was a good Spanish scholar , and would teach us as much of the language as we could learn in the two month 's voyage before us . I also laid in a few little articles that I thought might be of use to me , not forgetting a suit of thin clothes . I represented to my father the expediency of taking more summer clothing , but he remarked that as Mr. Bedrick had pledged himself to clothe us he did not feel called upon to go te such an expense , which ought in justice to fall upon the merchant himself . My father , as I have said , had a large family , and an expensive one , and his income was not as large from his business but that he saw the true value of every dollar that went from it to make purchases either for himself or his family . I was , however , tolerably well provided with clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed in the hair trunk already honorably mentioned . Yet my wardrobe was by no means ample , and would not have sufficed for me to start with on so long a voyage but for the faith both my father and myself had in the liberal promises of Mr. Bedrick . I dined with my father on the day we were to embark ; and I confess that the thought of leaving home for so long an absence saddened my spirits and quite deprived me of my appetite ; not even the glowing prospects of the future were able to cheer my gloomy feelings . To the youth who leaves home and country for the first time , it is a sad hour . The heart will linger over the scenes of past happiness , and the soul shrinks at the severing of the natural bond of affection and childhood 's fond associations . After dinner I followed my father to his room , where he gave me some excellent advise , and then took a tender farewell of me , although it was his intention to accompany me on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manifest feeling before folks , and so we parted then in anticipation of the more formal one on ship-board . At length the carriage came for me and my trunk , and my father getting into it with me , we were soon at the end of Long wharf , where we found Mr. Bedrick , his two sons , ( as I afterwards learned they were ) and my three fellow adventurers already in the boat which was to take us on board . My brothers were also there to see me embark and say good bye . ' The first words Tom said to me were it I had mentioned the affair of the watch-house to father . Upon my assuring him that I had not , he looked very much pleased and shook me warmly by the hand , saying that he hoped the next time he saw me I should be a rich man . The boat was lying at the foot of the pier-stairs and loaded down to the water 's edge with trunks , chests , demijohns , boxes and bags . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , but by dint of stowing closer we were all taken on board and the next moment put off from the stairs , rowed by two men . I now felt myself fairly embarked in life , and that the link that bound me to home and country was parted . The wind blew strongly from the North-West , and our boat was considerably tossed by the rough waves of the harbor ; but after a pull of a quarter of a mile we reached the brig , which was hove short with her topsails loosed and the men aloft . She was a staunch looking vessel of about two hundred and fifty tons , painted black , with quaker ports . We got on board one after the other , Mr. Bedrick remaining in the boat to see that his baggage was safely got out ; for I saw in the passage to the brig that he had quite a nervous solicitude for its safety . The deck presented no very inviting scene . It was cumbered with loose rigging , crates , boxes , bales , sails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there in the utmost confusion Nothing had been stowed or taken care of ; but left just as it had been taken in board . I made my way through the companion to a space at the stern , where stood a short , broad-shouldered man with black whiskers and a low , beetling brow , beneath which twinkled a pair of sharp grey eyes . He held a trumpet in his hand , and was swearing huge oaths , but without its aid , at the men on the yard . He wore an old black hat with the brim turned up behind through long contact with his coat collar , and his outer man was cased in a blue shaggy pilot-coat . I did not like his looks at the first , and my prepossessions were not made more favorable by being sharply ordered to stand out of the way or go below ! ' I went to the other side of the deck and took a position upon a barrel of apples , while my father mounted an oblong copper soda-fountain that with the others lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in the best manner they were able , for the Captain , such being the rank of the man in the pilot-coat , swore roundly at all as they came aft that he 'd have a clear quarter-deck while his ship was getting underweigh . At length , Mr. Bedrick got on board with his baggage , and coming aft , was asked by Captain Pright if all was aboard ? ' Upon being answered in the affirmative , he gave orders to the mate to man the windlass and get up the anchor . I see , my son , I must now leave you , ' said my father . Good bye , and do all you can to gain the good will of Mr. Bedrick , also while on board the brig of Captain Pright , and your voyage will be much pleasanter . He seems to be a cross man ; but it is , perhaps , because he is troubled about getting underweigh . I wish you a pleasant voyage .  --  Things look a little out of order now , but after you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , find every thing agreeable .  --  You are fortunate in having three companions as fellow passengers whom you know and who are your friends . When you speak a vessel write by her ; and as soon as you reach your destination send us home letters , and do this by every opportunity . I shall always be happy to hear of your prosperity ; and I have no doubt that the way is now open for you to become a rich man ? ' Do you go ashore , sir ? ' asked the Captain , addressing my father . Yes sir . This is my son , Captain . He goes out with Mr. Bedrick . He is young and new to the world . Such kindness as he may receive at your hands will be gratefully acknowledged by me ! ' Captain Pright slightly nodded and said gruffly : It is quite as much as I can do , sir , to take care of my vessel . Mr. Bedrick is the man for you to speak to ! ' My father looked displeased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand . I followed him to the gangway with a full heart , for I was already heartily sick of the brig and her Captain ; for from the manner of the latter I anticipated no very pleasant voyage under the auspices of such a petty tyrant as he seemed to be . I had too much pride of character , however , to betray my feelings to my father . He went over the side into a shore boat which had just unladen a freight of vegetables and fresh meat ; for the brig 's boat was already hoisted astern . I followed my father 's receding form with tearful eyes , and when he could no longer be seen I turned away and wept like a child . The anchor was soon suspended at the bows , the topsails were sheeted home , the spencer hoisted and spread to the wind which filled the upper sails , and the brig moved from her moorings each moment with increasing speed . Sail after sail was unloosed till the masts were white with canvass , and the spray dashed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and already beginning to feel the sinking sensation of the heart called home-sickness , ' I took my stand upon the taffrail by the side of my three companions and silently gazed upon the fading city . The wing of thought wandered from there to my native valley and hovering over home presented it to my memory in all its fond features . My mother , my ever kind and good mother , my sisters , my school-mates  --  all the scenes endeared to me with a thousand pleasing associations filled my mind and nearly overpowered me . I felt that I was leaving them all for years  --  perhaps forever ! Those who have never left their native land in youth know nothing of this sickness of the heart . Those who have felt it will understand it and sympathize with me . My three fellow-clerks doubtless had feelings kindred with my own , for they gazed back upon the city with very sorrowful countenances , and tears filled the eyes of at least two of them ; for they too were leaving friends , and home and country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beauty of the scenery around the harbor as we sailed down gradually drew my attention from myself . I gazed upon the snow-white Page image - Page 029. castle with its hollow embrasures frowning with cannon , and upon the green islands , and sloping hill sides of the main adorned with stately edifices with that interest which beautiful scenery never has failed to awaken in my bosom . The brig fairly under sail , the Captain began to give orders to clear the decks ! ' One after the other the boxes , bales , ank barrels disappeared below ; yet leaving all our baggage with Mr. Bedrick 's stores ' still in the gangway . Come , young men , ' said Mr. Bedrick , who had been fussing ' about his things to see if any thing had received damage by water or were broken , you must take hold and get your trunks below and then come up and help me stow away mine and my stores . Where shall I stow ' em , Captain ? ' In the steerage , ' answered Captain Pright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks , that were piled like a hecatomb near the capstan . Not an article goes into the cabin , sir ! You have got dunder ' enough there , Mr. Bedrick , to freight a line of battle ship ! ' My affairs wo n't interfere with yours , Captain Pright , ' retorted Mr. Bedrick sharply . The Captain made no answer , the pilot at that moment speaking to him . My trunk being near the steerage stairs I had promptly taken hold of it when Mr. Bedrick called upon us , for I was desirous of securing a good place for it , so that I could easily come at it when I wished to open it . I descended into the dark region between decks , and feeling round at length found a snug corner for it where I left it . I then saw that there were four rough berths in the steerage , the which I supposed , in my ignorance of nautical matters , were for the seamen ; and I wondered how they could be content to go to sea and sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , and alter him came Hewitt and Radsworth bearing with them all their worldly goods .  --  When they had each of them broken their shins against the stores strewn about , and nearly fractured their skulls against the beams overhead , they succeeded in stowing their things away to their satisfaction . We then stood together beneath the hatch-way and called a sort of council of war . I 'd like plaguily to ascertain to a moral certainty whether we are to board and lodge in this place , ' said Hewitt in his dry manner . Lodge here ! ' repeated Fairfax , who had seen something more of the sea than either of us , having been a voyage with a relation who was a sea-captain . Why I rather guess not . We are cabin passengers and not steerage passengers ! ' Then why did the Captain refuse to let the trunks go into the cabin ? ' asked Radsworth . Doubtless it was small , and he did not want to lumber it up , ' I remarked . That is the reason . Sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see Mr. Bedrick or the Captain putting us in here ! ' Come boys , ' called out Mr. Bedrick from the deck . Up here and go to work and lug all this down below . We shall be out at sea in an hour and then you 'll be so sea-sick every soul of you , you wo n't know whether you are on your heads or heels ! ' We went to work as he directed , though we thought that the duty of stowing his stores belonged rather to the hands of the ship than to young gentlemen passengers ' as we were . It , however , kept us from thinking of home , and we did the task so cheerfully and so well that in an hour 's time all the articles were not only conveyed into the steerage but compactly stowed away around the sides . Four soda-fountains , among other things , were brought down ; but as they were rather too heavy the seamen were called to give us a lift . Before they went below the Captain and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former declaring very positively that they should go into the hold with the freight , and the latter insisting on taking them into the steerage . We did not then know the value of these oblong copper vessels to Mr. Bedrick , or we should have ceased to be surprised at his tender care of them . He gained the victory , however , the Captain finally yielding with a muttering oath . This little circumstance showed us that our employer and the Captain had not much respect for each other ; and we could not but express to each other our wonder that Mr. Bedrick who owned a part of the brig and had freighted her with his own merchandize , ' should have engaged a Captain who had so little regard for his wishes . We were , indeed , surprised at Mr. Bedrick 's patience under such autocratic treatment from a man who , though Captain of the brig , was in truth , but an agent in his employ ; for Mr. Bedrick had told my father that he had purchased half the brig and employed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Ayres . We , therefore , unanimously voted Captain Pright a very disagreeable man , and my self-esteem which had been touched a little by his first rude speech to me , was healed ; for I reflected that the clerk could not expect more consideration than the Foreign Merchant . Having stowed the baggage we now went on deck . The light house was just astern , and the great blue plain of the open sea was spread out before us . The motion of the brig began to be-exceedingly unpleasant , and I had not been on deck ten minutes before I was taken with that sickness which outstrips in excrutiating wretchedness to the subject of it , all others . I told Mr. Bedrick , who was near to me tying up a package , that I would like to go to my berth if he would be so kind as to inform me which I was to take . Your birth is down there ! Take your choice , or draw lots among yourselves ! ' As he spoke he pointed to the steerage . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay my swimming head it was immaterial to me , as I then felt , whether it was in the steerage or in the Page image - Page 031. vessel 's hold . I followed the direction in which Mr. Bedrick 's hand pointed , and the next moment was stretched in one of the births .  --  There in the darkness and chilly atmosphere of the place , with every motion of the brig drawing at my very vitals , the sea dashing menacingly against the brig 's sides , close to my head , and the noise of feet and rattling cordage above me , I lay many miserable hours , with but one sensation  --  that of miserable suffering . A thousand times I wished myself on shore again , and bitterly did I lament my ambition for foreign travel which had brought me into such worldless woe . It was , however , a sort of consolation to me that my fellow-passengers suffered in like manner with myself . I had not been a quarter of an hour in my bunk before Hewitt came creeping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holding on by whatever came in his way for support . With a miserable groan he threw himself into the first berth that offered its repose , and there lay at intervals expressing his dissatisfaction that the sea was not made to lie smooth and not boil up in the fashion it did , merely for the sake of turning a poor landsman 's stomach . Sick as I was I could not but smile at some of his speeches , which were addressed rather to the empty air than to me . In a little while after he had got into his berth Radsworth came down with the cautions step of one who had hitherto walked on the firm earth . He looked the picture of woe . In trying to find his berth he was knocked over by a lurch of the brig and came rolling down upon me . At length he succeeded in getting into his berth , and there gave himself up to his misery . The wind seemed to increase and the waves to run higher each moment . The brig would sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once my heart was in my mouth lest she had actually accomplished that feat ; but hearing Captain Pright still swearing on deck I was reassured . Sometimes she would seem for a moment to be slowly ascending some mountainous wave ; then she would pause and hang perfectly still as if balancing herself ! then , oh horrors ! she would shoot , dart , dive down with the velocity of an arrow ! Who can describe the sensation of that descending motion ? It was to the shrinking soul like going down into the central heart of the ocean !  --  The very strings of life were drawn down with it , while a terrible faintness involves the whole man . What do you think of this , any how ? ' called out Hewitt in a dolorous tone after one of these horrible plunges . I would I was ashore , ' gasped Radsworth . I would give all I hope to be worth in all my life to come for a foot square of solid ground to stand upon . ' I from my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to open my lips . Where is Fairfax , I wonder ? ' asked Hewitt , after a pause , during which we had been all three busily reversing the action of eating our dinners , one of the most unwilling acts man ever performs , and always with an ill grace . I do n't think he 'll be sick , ' answered Radsworth , he has been on the sea once and has the advantage of us . ' Confound him , ' said Hewitt in a murmuring tone , it will be too bad it he ai n't sick too . ' If he is , he wo n't come into the steerage , ' answered Radsworth.  --  When I came down he was talking to Mr. Bedrick and saying he did not come aboard to be a steerage passenger , and he 'd have the rights of a cabin passenger . ' What did Mr. Bedrick say to that ? ' I asked . He said he should do as he said , that he was his clerk and must submit to his regulations . Fairfax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth in the cabin or make a row ; and as a row was already began to be kicked up in my stomach I retreated down here glad to find any place to lay in . ' Fairfax is quick and fiery , and will get into trouble , ' said Hewitt . Let us wait till we all get over this confounded sea-sickness , and then we can look after asserting our rights . Here comes Fairfax now ! ' While he was speaking our fourth man made his appearance among us . Are you sick , Fairfax ? ' asked Hewitt with a faint hope that he would answer in the affirmative . No , ' answered the young man , I am only mad . So you have all turned in . Well , you may lay there if you will , but I mean to have a berth in the cabin . It is an imposition to put us here . Bedrick , himself , is to live in the cabin and also his two sons who are no better than we are . Bedrick says we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough . I do n't like this beginning of things at all ; and if I had known that we were to occupy the steerage I would have seen him in Guinea before I would have come with him . There is his eldest son , too . He took the liberty to speak to me because I chose to address his father in plain words . I do n't like him nor the other one . Both of them look upon us as beneath them ; and I believe the old man regards us no better than as if we were bounden apprentices . ' I do n't see but that we will have to put up with it , Fairfax , ' said I , at least for the present . We can be more by ourselves here in the steerage than we could be in the cabin under Mr. Bedrick 's eye ; and I dare say we shall like this better than the cabin . ' That is what I was thinking , ' said Radsworth . Here we shall be independent and do as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes , ' added Hewitt with emphasis , and if any body dares to intrude upon our sanctum we will put ' em out by main force . If we are to live here , it shall be our castle . ' That it shall , ' answered Fairfax ; so boys , we will say nothing more at present , but hold on as we are . At night we 'll have a lantern swung from the beam , and we will try to make the best out of bed ! ' Did you insult Mr. Bedrick ? ' asked Radsworth . No , not a word . I merely told him in a firm tone what I believed to be our rights . I spoke civilly , though his son with the light hair and spectacles , he who is to teach us Spanish , and looks like a jackass , said that I was impudent and told me to mind how I spoke to his father . It is my private opinion , boys , that we shall have a muss ' before we get to Buenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed that those Bedrick 's and ourselves should ever pull together kindly . ' It is wisest , however , to be patient and forbear , ' I remarked . You know we have voluntarily placed ourselves under their father , and that at all hazards we are completely in their hands . ' Well , I am willing to be patient , ' answered the impetuous Fairfax , and I trust all will go smoothly , but blame me if I think so . ' Is old Bedrick sea-sick yet ? ' dryly inquired Hewitt with a peculiar shuffle of his nose which was habitual to him . He was looking white about the gills when I came down . His oldest son Edwin is already feeding the whales with his last shore dinner . ' " Well , I am glad to hear it , ' answered Hewitt ; I think I should feel much better if I had certain intelligence that Captain Pright aud his whole ship 's crew were playing the game the whale played when he cast forth Jonah ! ' Night came rapidly on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of us who would go into the cabin to sepper . As for ourselves the very knowledge that there was such a thing as food was abhorent to us . We had but one idea , and that was a solid rock . Such a night as I passed has had no parallel since in my experience either on sea or land . The wind had increased to a gale . The roar of the tempest reached our ears with the sound of the wild warfare of the tumbling surges . The masts and yards cracked ! the blocks shrieked piercingly ! the billows would break against the brig 's side with the force of a cannon ball and the noise of thunder , causing the vessel to shiver to her very keel . Every timber in her seemed to have a voice to complain , and all the live-long night kept up a wailing that was almost madness to listen to . Added to this was the constant and never absent fear , which as landsmen was natural to us , that we should every minute go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick in body  --  sick in soul  --  and wretchedly sick in spirit . There is no malady that pierces and penetrates to the joints and marrow like sea-sickness ! It makes the very soul faint within itself . At length morning dawned , but the light brought with it no relief . Day after day passed until the fifth day out before I was able to get upon deck or take a morsel of nourishment . Radsworth got on deck the day before us , but Hewitt was a full week below . At length the monster was conquered . We got over it after it had its course , as children get over the whooping cough . Our pallid visages began to resume their life hue , and our mouths to relax into smiles . We soon got our appetites aboard , and after we had been ten days at sea each man was able to eat his full allowance . Fair winds and pleasant weather spread cheerfulness around ; and as we four stood together one fine moonlight night just forward of the gang-way watching the sparkling sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not after all so bad an affair to go to sea ! We found Mr. Bedrick , who got well the last of all , disposed to be pleasant ; and as we had our meals in the cabin and lived pretty well , we said nothing more about the steerage . In fact , we had become quite reconciled to it , for with a lantern it was light enough , and we had arranged it so that it had quite a neat appearance . Our berths were good mattresses , and each of us had a blanket . So on the whole , things were favorable , and we were disposed to put the best light upon the matter . Captain Pright , now that the bustle of leaving port was over , proved to be a pretty clever sort of a man , though very illiterate , and wanting in many of the deceucies which are the salt of social intercourse . He would swear profanely , he would blow his nose with his fingers at table , pick his teeth with his fork and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , he would drink out of the pitcher , and after wiping his knife clean on his tongue would cut butter with it and help you ! But these were minor points ; and people at sea , especially those who sleep in the steerage , should not be two particular . Captain Pright was a fair specimen of a great many sea-captains who command vessels of a smaller class . He had risen from a cabin boy through all the stations to the command . He boasted that he had been to school but three months , and that he went to sea in his twelfth year , and had been attached to some vessel or other ever since . He was a man about forty , rudely framed , rough visaged , with a snub nose , little grey eyes , a dark complexion , and very low born looking .  --  He was imperious in command , and was fully sensible of the vast power that the law allows a captain to hold in his his hands , a power elsewhere in the social sphere unparalleled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power , and many of them become the most despicable tyrants over the handful of men whom circumstances have placed under their control . Passengers , indeed , do not always escape the exercise of their power , for on board my ship I am king ' is more than once hinted into their ears . Yet , at the bottom , Captain Pright possessed several good points of character which subsequently manifested themselves in our favor . The character of Mr. Bedrick I shall leave for future notice . I will however , describe my fellow clerks . Henricus Hewitt , the eldest , was the son of a highly respectable merchant in the town in which the Institution which we had left was situated . He was about nineteen , but looked as if he was full twenty-one . He was tall and loosely put together , and was at times ludicrously ungainly in his movements . At heart he was one of the best fellows ; he had good sense combined with a simplicity that to those who did not know him seemed stupidity ; yet out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightest wit . He had a heavy , dark brow , and a large , quiet eye of a bright brown color . His smile was pleasing and he was universally good-natured . He would bear a joke , and was sometimes made the butt of our superabundance of gay spirits . He had embarked on this adventure first , from a desire to see the world , and next , from the love of money , for which he had already manifested quite a covetous affection . As a scholar , he had been above mediocrity , though we soon found that there was no affinity between his tongue and the tongue Spanish . Radsworth was also of a highly respectable family , his father having been a General in the army during the last war . Radsworth was ambitious , spirited , adventurous ; and being just about to enter upon some pursuit when Mr. Bedrick 's letter came , at once resolved to embrace the opportunity of embarking upon the theatre of active business presented to him under the novel coloring of a foreign clerk-ship . His imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures of life which rose up to his mind from the pages of travellers ' books which he had read , and without more reflection he gave himself to the expedition . He was a little over eighteen , of a manly height , fair complexion , full blue eyes , rather too wide open to be handsome , and square cheeks and chin . He was light , active , and in vigorous health , as indeed we all were , In character he was without reproach , being truly upright and moral . In spirits he was cheerful , and inclined to take the world as he found it . In heart he was kind and brave , and faithful to those who confided in him . CHAPTER VIII . Calm on the Equator . In the preceding chapter I described two of my companions of the voyage and also the Captain of the brig . I will now give my readers a portrait of the remaining one , George Fairfax . He was a young man about nineteen , bold , daring , quick of temper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senator in Congress , and the Governor of his native State . He was a good scholar in mathematics , and knew something of navigation . He had been once to the West Indies as a sort of supercargo in one of his uncle 's vessels , and therefere had a knowledge of the sea which none of us could boast of . In person he was stout built , about the middle height , with a clear gray eye full of decision and fire . There was in him something of the dare devil , although he was by no means vicious . He had a high sense of his own rights , and was very firmly resolved never to relinquish them to any man . The eldest son of Mr. Bedrick , Ned , or Edwin , had been in Harvard , and left to accompany his father . He was about two and twenty , with light flaxen hair , a very light , sandy complexion , full fleshy cheeks , and small blue eyes , which were most of the time peering inquisitively at you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , with a slight roundness of the shoulders , dressed in black , and wore a plain gold ring on his little finger . He knew Greek , he knew Latin , he knew Spanish , he knew all languages . He was a great talker , very vain , very conceited , very arrogant , very self-assuming , very much wanting in natural common sense . He would have lorded it over each of us if he could have done so . He tried it , but found that it would not do . But I will not anticipate events . His brother William was in his twentieth year , and his opposite in tooks and character . He was a dark complexioned young man , with the blackest , sharpest eye ever set in a man 's head . His hair was black as a ravin 's . He looked like a handsome young Turk . He had a finely moulded figure , supple and athletic . His face expressed resolution and wild daring . He looked like one who would engage heart and hand in any reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to have had for an enemy ; yet who would prove a fast friend . Such then were the companions among whom my destiny had placed me . The first fifteen days out every thing went on smoothly , excepting the little cross-grained occurrences of the first day , already mentioned . We had by this time got to know something of one another , and fallen into a certain round of habits and employment for passing the time . I studied navigation and kept a journal . Fairfax played the flute , helped the sailors in the duty and made perpetual motion machines out of shingles . Hewitt did nothing all day but pore over his Spanish , forgetting the next day all he had learned the day before , yet persevering against hope . Radsworth read and studied Spanish and talked literature with the elder son of Mr. Bedrick . We all had our Spanish to look after , and the elder son was our teacher , and daily we made more or less proficiency . I took kindly to the language , and when I had mastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedrick , ' as we had got to denominate the Foreign Merchant , ' passed his time mostly in the cabin writing and looking over old accounts . He did not hesitate to call upon us to overhaul his trunks and boxes and bring and carry for him precisely as if we were his servants ; but we had plenty of time on our hands and did not refuse to obey him , though he might have asked his sons , who never did any thing . If , by chance , he called on either of them to bring him what he wanted , they would invariably pass the errand over to one of us . We bore all this quietly before them , but in the retirement of our steerage we did not fail to express our disapprobation and displeasure . We had found ourselves treated rather as menials than the sons of gentlemen , and our spirits rose against it . We consoled ourselves , however , with the hope that after we reached Buenos Ayres things would change and we should be treated as became our positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , be it observed , we attached no little credit to this distinction , regarding ourselves as quite a notch and a little more above domestic clerks . At length one day old Bedrick , whom we liked less and less the more his character displayed itself before us and to us , called Hewitt into the cabin and told him that he wished him to make his berth up every morning and take care of hir state-room . As Hewitt was of a quiet turn of temper and had a good deal of simplicity of character , the old man doubtless thought that he would comply without a demurrer . But he had no sooner proposed this menial service to him , than with flashing eyes Hewitt responded to him so as to be heard distinctly by me in the steerage , where I was engaged in sewing up a hole I had torn in the knee of my trousers trying to get aloft one of the futtockshrouds . Sir , I am no serving-man . I am astonished and amazed that you should presume to make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board this brig as a cabin passenger , and you put me into the steerage . I yielded without a word . You have since called upon me and my friends to do many things which your sons refused to do . I look upon myself quite as good as they , and have quite as delicate tingers . Sir , I consider myself your clerk . No clerk of yours shall through me be so degraded as to become a bed maker . I have too high a regard for you , sir , to suffer it . I hold your reputation in too high consideration to have it said that Mr. Bedrick 's clerks were nothing more than servants . This , sir , is my objection  --  my sole objection to complying with your request ! ' When Hewitt had ended this speech which he had commenced in anger but ended with a smile under his tongue , he went on deck leaving the old man quite thunderstruck . What a set of graceless rascallions I have got into my hands , or rather that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am half a mind to horse-whip them all round ! ' This speech we did not hear , but it was reported to us the same night by the colored steward , who was our friend , we having clubbed together and paid him a quarter of a dollar spiece one sunny morning as a bonus of more to follow if he behaved himself . Hewitt had no sooner got on deck than Ned , our Spanish master , met him and looking very pale with rage demanded to know why he had dared to insult his father . Your father has insulted me , ' answered Henricus firmly . You are all a set of  --  Of what ? ' I demanded poking my head up from the steerage hatch , for I had sprang up to go to the deck when I heard Hewitt leave the cabin . As I put the interrogative demand I caught his eye and his tongue faltered . No matter what , ' he added . If I was father I would make you  --  ' What ? ' repeated Fairfax sternly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cabin . Bill soon followed him , and there they remained a long while , doubtless discussing us . This little event originated a feeling of mutual suspicion and ill will between us ; and placed us in the position of two antagonistic parties . For several days the old man scarcely spoke a word to either of us and then only with angry brevity , while his eldest born maintained a dignified silence . He even refused to hear our Spanish lessons ; but as we had mastered our pronunciation we got along very well with our grammars without his aid . For nearly a week this state of things continued , when there came on a terrific storm . The brig labored heavily for many hours , and at length carried away her main-topgallant mast with the yard and sail . The sea broke over us with a clear arch , and on sounding the well we found we had ten inches of water in the hold . This alarming state of things called all our energies forth . The water was increasing , and we knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the bottom . All the hands were employed about the decks or loft , and we were called upon to man the brakes of the pumps . I took the handle with old Mr. Bedrick and Hewitt . Fairfax worked a brake with Spanish Bedrick , as we called the eldest son , and this contiguity of labor with the mutual danger did wonders towards removing the illfeeling which had sprung up between us . The fear of death destroyed all enmity , and kind words took the place of contention . The leak was finally discovered and stopped , and the storm abaiting with the rising sun , we were relieved from the apprehension of going to the bottom of the ocean with the life-blood flowing warmly in our veins and our hearts beating strong with health . The storm was a true pacificator , and for some days all went on smoothly . We were on good terms with one another ; our Spanish lessons were pursued with industry ; we played at draughts with the old gentleman , and backgammon with Spanish Ned . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a purity in the atmosphere wholly unknown to me before . The air was soft , and it was a pleasure to inhale it . We had run from Boston nearly a due Easterly course until we came near the Western Islands , when we struck the trade winds and carried them with us down to within three degrees of the equator . Here they died away , or came only at fitful intervals , accompanied by squalls and torrents of rain . Here , for the first time , we understood what a calm was . When within about a degree of the line , we were deserted by every wind . For several days not a zephr ruffled the glassy mirror of the deep . It rolled its long polished billows with a ceaseless swell upon which we were gently rocked as a gem upon a maiden 's bosom is moved undulatingly upward and downward . The sun was intensely burning , feeling like a furnace close above our heads . The decks were so heated that it burned the feet through the sole of the shoe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slumbering ocean ; for though there may be no wind the sea forever heaves its great heart , as the heart of a man asleep , nor ceases to rise nor fall . Our sails hung idly from the yards , and the sailors slept in the shade or indolently busied their fingers about some light work . At night the sun would go down in a sea of liquid crystal and rise in the morning from the same unruffled deep . I was fully able to realize the truth of the description of Coleridge 's cal ned ship in his Ancient Mariner ; ' for we lay day after day , Like a painted ship upon a painted ocean . ' The only relief we had was in occasional showers , which came upon us without wind . The rain fell literally in sheets Such descending floods as we experienced must be seen to be appreciated . The clouds poured out their treasures with the abundance and force of a cascade . The sound upon the decks was an incessant roar . The rain drops , in many instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fall . and came down in the visible form of flakes of water like transparent sheets of glass many inches broad . These showers would last usually from half an hour to two hours , and then pass away as suddenly as they came , leaving us to the full power of the fiery equatorial sun . We varied our monotonous life as well as we could , though before we had been five days becalmed we had nearly exhausted all our resources , except quarrelling , which at sea on such occasions , is a never failing resource for the listless and self-wearied , But Mr. Bedrick seemed disposed to keep the peace , and conciliate us , and his sons , finding we were not to be bullied or intimidated , treated us with that degree of consideration to which we thought ourselves entitled , clerks though we were to their father . We sometimes went into the sea barbing , stationing one aloft to keep good look-out for sharks , whose dorsal fin can be seen a great distance , cleaning the surface ere they approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from land , was a novelty , and we enjoyed it greatly . We also amused ourselves in hanging on the end of the fore studdensail boom and darting the harpoon into the golden dolphins as they glided slowly past beneath us . Sometimes a family of porpoises would play across our bows , one of which was speared and taken on board . I is flesh was served up as a rarity , ' and was very much like that of a wild hog . Sometimes , at night , flying fish flew aboard . Hewitt 's chief amusement was in fishing after mother Cary 's chickens with a bit of bread concealing the point of a pin-hook ; but success was not commensurate with his praiseworthy perseverence . CHAPTER IX . Crossing the Line . As it is not my purpose to write a history of my voyage , other matters of more interest calling for my pen , I shall only here and there touch upon incidents connected with the passage out . The main interest of my story will be found to commence as we enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I have no idea , for from the time we reached the third degree north latitude till we got two hundred miles south of it we had scarcely a breath of air ; yet Captain Pright kept her nose sticking south and south she made her way . We were , however , nine days accomplishing the five degrees , where calms and storms forever seem to reign . I remember that before we came to the equator , about a degree and a half above it , the north star set in the north . It had been daily , as it progressed southwesterly , getting lower and lower till it trembled in the horizon ; but when at length night came and I looked from the deck for this great light-house of the world , ' I felt a sadness and loneliness come upon my heart as I saw that it had disappeared behind the round globe . I now , for the first time , realized my distance from my native land . I felt that I was indeed beneath other skies ; and other skies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch of the heavens receded from the eye the south lifted its glorious universe of constellations to our admiring gaze . The southern cross for the first time glittered upon our sight with a thousand brighter stars all unfamiliar to our vision . The Magellan clouds began to rise above the southwestern horizon and fill our minds with wonder . We seemed to have passed from one globe to snother , whenever we gazed upon new heavens , all was so new , so strange , so wonderously beautiful . The usual custom of paying a tax to Neptune ' upon crossing the line , was by no means omitted in the present instance . The idea that something might be done to kill the dullness of the calmness revived us all . The tribute to the king with the sea-green beard , is paid only by the green-ones , ' that is , those luckless wights who have never before crossed the line . ' As the hour approached that the quadrant told us we should be upon it . all was preparation among us . There were none in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , save the Captain and the mate , and as we were not disposed to tax ourselves , we combined to select for a victim a green one ' among the erew , a poor unfortunate loafer who had by some ill-luck shipped in our brig , though he had never seen salt water before . The sailors all participated in the sport with that readiness which always characterizes them when a lark ' is on foot . One of their number , a good-natured , mischief loving old tar , vol  --  unteered to presonate Old Nep ! ' We got him down into the steerage and dressed him for the part . ' In the first place , we covered his head with a magnificent red turban ingeniously made by means of a red shirt folded with much taste . In the front of it was stuck a feather fan , which Hewitt had in his trunk , and which he said had been given him by the prettiest girl he had ever seen ! ' He surrendered it with manifest reluctance ; but the majority prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion . About his cheeks and chin a huge beard woven of oakum was suspended . It reached to his hips and had a formidable appearance . A pair of enormous spectacles were out out of a piece of sole leather and were mounted upon the bridge of his nose . They were without glasses , but doubtless this was an improvement , as it would be in most cases where spectacles are set astride the nose , to supply , we fear too often , the lack oi windows in the brain ; for spectacles are the insignia of windows we believe . We then manufactured a non-descript garment of old bags for our Neptune , in style something like an extremely long shirt , around the bottom was a such fringe a foot deep of oakum . In his right hand we placed a harpoon , and in his left a tin cup . We had nearly finished his toilet , when Fairfax came below with his arms filled with sea-weed , a floating vegetable production with long hairy fibres laden with straw-colored berries which often covers the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an island of yellow sand . This was what we wanted to complete our character . We trimmed him with it from head to foot , so that he looked like the genus of the sea clad in his-own proper regalia . At length Captain Pright with a smile announced to us that the brig was about on the equator , at least within a mile or so of it . This announcement was made forward , and the green hand ' was called up to see the line . He took his station on the cat-head and strained his eyes now ahead , now to penetrate the depth of water , one of them having suggested that it might have sunk a little under the surface . I had gone forward to see the joke ; and I have never been more amused with simplicity combined with honest credulity than in this young Vermonter 's case . Faith in the existence of a visible line , ' was plainly distinguishable in his visage . Thinking it a pity that such hearty faith should go unrewarded I went aft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black thread across the glass and then called him to the gangway to take a look through the spy glass and see if he could not make out the line ! ' It is very small , just as you see it on the maps , ' said I gravely as I handed him the glass . He had no sooner fairly got it to his eye than he brought his foot down upon the deck with a stout thump and opened his countenance with a broad grin of satisfaction . I see it , by jiggers ! ' was his ever memorable exclamation of unmingled delight . It looks for all the world just like it does on the school-map . Well , I never expected to see the Equator ! ' I hope you are satisfied with the sight ! ' asked Hewitt drawing up his nose with a snuffle . Yes , I would n't have lost the sight for a quarter of a dollar ' There is something more for you to see , ' I said , quietly drawing his attention away from the forecastle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck , having gone forward from the steerage between decks . Between him and the victim ' stood several of the men to screen him from view till he should get over the bows . He succeeded in getting over the head-board unseen , and when I saw the top of Hewitt 's fan ' disappear below the bulwark , I asked my man if he had ever heard of Neptune . Oh , yes , I 've heard of him afore I come aboard here ; and then I 've heard the men talk about him ; but do n't think I am to be taken in with that story . I do n't believe there 's such a chap a-livin ' . I know there 's a line ' coz I 've seed it through the spyin ' glass with my own eyes , but I ai n't quite so green as to believe there 's a human half-horse half-fish kritter as is king o ' the sea and lives on the line ! ' You ought not to doubt it , ' said Hewitt . Neptune is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard you , come and call you to account . ' You know , ' said Fairfax , that the line is his toll-gate . If he did n't choose to let ships go by they would n't be able to pass it . ' What 's that little black line ! It do n't look bigger than a hair ! ' he said with incredulous contempt . That is nothing . It goes round the world and is stronger than a chain-cable , ' said Radsworth . He used once to stop every vessel that went by and made them pay toll ! ' So I heard the men say , but I thought they was gullin ' me ! ' he answered beginning to believe . No they were not . But he do n't take toll now of any vessels except they have people on board that never have crossed his dominions . Then he comes aboard of them and demands toll , ' said Fairfax ; while Mr. Bedrick , the Captain and mate , and the tars were seated or standing near by , loitering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he take ? inquired the victim with earnest interest . Grog always , ' answered Bill Bedrick . If there is n't any grog he then shaves and takes off the beard instead . He has a great fondness for beards , as you will allow should you ever be on board a vessel that he should visit . ' I do n't care to be . But I know you are all laughing at me , ' he said half in doubt , half believing . Let Neptune himself say whether we are joking , ' I called out suddenly in a loud tone ; for I had been made chief manager of the play . ' As I spoke the watery god ' made his appearance coming over the bows . To complete his character , the old tar had fairly dipped himself into the sea , and now came in sight dripping with brine . The representation was perfect , and startled even Mr. Bedrick and the Captain , who had never before seen him . The god ' came slowly aft ; all eyes fixed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered with sea weed from head to foot . To describe the look of consternation , surprise , horror and amazement that appeared upon his face would be impossible . He started back , became as pale as a sheet and trembled in every limb . He looked round to us for aid  --  for sympathy ! He saw in all our faces well-feigned looks of fear and awe . Neptune came slowly on with heavy tread , and striking his tridant ( harpoon ) upon the deck at every step . He came within six feet of us , acd then looking round , sternly demanded the name of the brig that had entered his domains . Captain Pright replied promptly . Have you any seamen on board who have never before crossed my territories ? ' I have one only , ' answered the Captain . You need not point him out . I know the faces of all that I once have seen . Here stands the man . So , sir mortal what is your name ? ' Seth Bliss , ' answered the victim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old are you ? ' Twenty-three last hayin ' time ! ' Have you ever been this far from home before ? ' No , I ai n't , and I hope I never ' ll be agen . If you ' ll let me go this time , good Mr. Neptune , I 'll never come this way again . ' I must have my toll . Do you see this silver cup ? ' It is a tin one , ai n't it , sir ? ' I say do you see this gold cap ? ' repeated Neptune sternly . Yes , I see it . ' T is gold ! ' I want it filled to the brim with grog . This is the toll I demand of all who cross my domains . Fill it , and then I will let the brig go on her way . ' I hai n't any grog , Mr. Neptune . The Capt'n keeps all the grog , and ony lets us have a gill a day . ' Then if you have no grog to bestow upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bind him , and bring me a razor , lather and hot water ! Dare any mortal presume to cross my domains without preparing himself with the toll that all the world has paid to me from time immemorial ? Seize the presumptuous man , and let me take off his thin-faced beard for him ! ' Two of the sailors , who had attired themselves in sea weed to act as his attendants , now seized him and placed him in a tub half filled with sea water . One of them got a piece of an iron hoop and presented it to Father Neptune : while the other brought a bucket of tar in which was a swob made of oakum . A volunteer brought , also , a pan of slush . The victim looked as if he was about to have his throat cut . He called loudly on us for aid , and then implored Mr. Neptune ' to have mercy . He loudly entreated the Captain to let him have the grog and take the value out of his wages ! But all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it . His mouth was stopped with the slush with which his face was well besmeared by a zealous sailor : then followed a coat of tar with the swob . When he was well lathered Neptune ' began to shave him with great dignity . Do n't hurt me , father Neptune , ' cried the poor fellow . I 'll be as gentle as a lady ! ' and here the iron hoop came down across his face with an energy that made the victim groan audibly.  --  The operation of shaving ' lasted about ten minutes , for the old man of the sea ' was desirous , as he said , of leaving the face perfectly clean . At length the operation being ended , the victim was allowed to get up . Neptune then gave him a few words of good advice , and , followed by his two minions , who looked like moving monsters of sea weed , disappeared over the bows as he had come . We now hurried Seth below to the steerage , both to help the poor fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved himself after all a neat barber , and also to give the sailor who had personated the character an opportunity to come in-board and descend unseen by him to the forecastle . We comforted Seth with a stiff glass of grog and with our sympathies . Nothing was ever said to lead him to doubt the reality of Neptune 's existence , and to this day , these is little question but that he as firmly believes that there is a Neptune , as he does that there is an equatorial line ! CHAPTER X. Land ho ! After we had got about two hundred miles south of the equator , we fell in with the south-easterly Trades , and once more moved steadily and swiftly on our course . We were not many hundred miles from the coast of Africa for many days sail ; it being the custom of ships in going to South America to keep well to the Eastward , to avail themselves of the Trades , which blow from the coast of Europe northeasterly , and from the coast of Africa south-easterly . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees , which space is in the region of the Equator , and wherein reign calms and rains , squalls and fiery heat . Having well passed this fitful region , and once more feeling the influence of a steady wind which blows for weeks from one quarter , we rapidly run down our latitude . Nothing of importance occurred until we were in thirty south , when one morning we saw a water-spout about a league to leeward . Its shape was that like a huge speaking trumpet hanging from the clouds . Its smaller end nearly touched the sea which was in the wildest confusion beneath it . At length , it suddenly shot upward a slender column of water and joined it , thus binding the clouds and the sea in a strange union . The conjoined column we soon saw was in rapid motion , and in the direction of our vessel , its progress being dead to windward . We watched its approach with no little apprehension until it came within half a mile when it wheeled and moved several points away from us , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ears . Its path was marked with foam . Above it was a jet black cloud , from the bosom of which it hung and which supplied it with its volume of water . Suddenly a flash of lightning darted from the cloud followed by a sharp clap of thunder . Instantly the tall crystal link that bound heaven and earth together parted in mid air , half ascended rapidly and lost its form in the cloud , while the other section descended into the sea with the noise of billows dashing against rocks . The same afternoon we for the first time saw a whale . It was ahead of us when first discovered , laying motionless upon the surface , occasionally sending a jet of water into the air . As we advanced on our course and came near the hebemoth , he disappeared , slowly sinking beneath the surface , lashing the sea with his tail as he went down .  --  In a little while we heard him blowing astern of us , and looking round saw his huge bulk half exposed and rolling upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the westward , and was soon hulldown in the blue distance . The following day I was so fortunate as to spear a dolphin . It had been swimming along side for some time , and I had entertained myself with watching his graceful movements , keeping up with the vessel seemingly without any effort . In the water when the sun strikes upon his sides as he turns to it , his colors are very beautiful ; but it is when he is lying on deck and dying that he presents that splendid appearance which has made him so celebrated . Watching my opportunity with the grains ' in my hand , I succeeded in throwing it with such accuracy as to spear him . He struggled with a surprising outlay of strength , but with the aid of some of my fellow-passengers he was hauled inboard . I never saw any thing so beautiful as the hue his scales presented as he was expiring . They were like those in the lining of some rich Indian pearl , varied by the most dazzling prismatic changes . We found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no word ? ) his fish was very delicately flavored , though something dry . It was similar in appearance and taste to the pickerel . The next day we fell in with an English ship loaded with emigrants , bound to Buenos Ayres . She came so close to us that we could see the groups of poor emigrants crowding her decks in scores . The Captain , as the wind was light , came on board of us , gave us some English newspapers , took some of our American papers in exchange , had a glass of wine in the cabin with the Captain and Mr. Bedrick , and then returned to his own clumsy , slow sailing ship , the sails of which were old and brown , and looking anything but tidy . I have always observed the inferior appearance of English merchant vessels compared with ours . They are wanting in that cleanliness and comfort that characterizes the American . The Captains , too , generally are a rude , coarse set of men , without refinement and indifferent to it . This English brig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our Captain , though we had not much to boast of in this way . At length , we had run down our latitude , and the Captain gave orders to square away the yards for the mouth of the river La Plata .  --  The idea of soon seeing the coast of South America , and putting an end to our long voyage , which had now been fifty-six tedious days in length , filled us with hope and joy . We moved speedily on our new course for five days , when one morning after breakfast , the Captain electrified us all by giving the order for a man to go aloft and keep sharp look out for land . The man went not up alone . We all followed , some ascending to the main , some to the foreroyalmast head . We could , however , discover nothing around us but the wide circle of the blue ocean , and far in the south-western horizon a faint white spec which we knew to be a sail , and reported on deck accordingly . The Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see it on deck on account of the curvature of the earth , or rather the ocean . To a landsman the difference that a few feet elevation at sea makes in viewing a distant object , is always surprising when experienced for the first time . He does not easily conceive that the are of the circumference of the earth can be manifest within the scope of a human eye . Yet experience proves that it is apparent across a few leagues ' surface . We could , from aloft , see an object on the horizon that from the deck was invisible even with a telescope . The telescope would have had to see over the verge of the earth 's peripheny to take it within its range . A few feet up the rattlings will make a perceptible difference . I have seen from deck all the sails of a ship sailing along the horizon , but the ship herself was under the verge . By going twenty feet up the mast I rose above the arching swell of the globe sufficiently to bring in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the glass vessels far distant whose topsails only were visible . The sail that was now discovered , in two hours afterwards came so near as to be made out a whaler from Nantucket . She spoke us , asked the news , and passed on , saying she was to touch at Rio Janeiro . By her we despatched letters home , with the faint hope that they would ever get to the hands of our friends . But they were all received about three months after we had spoken the ship . Our look-out kept aloft , occasionally relieved until noon , when , just as the Captain was taking the sun , he called out that cheering cry which has made thousand of hearts leap with joy , Land ho ! ' Land ho ! ' was echoed by every voice on board ; and for a moment all was joyous confusion aft ; though the seamen I noticed betrayed no emotion . To them it is the same whether making or leaving port .  --  The sea is their home , and they are alike indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander . They know not the landsman 's joy at the sight of land ! We now went aloft , and from the main royal yard I was able to make out a faint brown line in the west , but so dim , so remote , so high up in the air ( as it seemed ) that I knew not whether to call it land or cloud . But gradually it developed itself from the line of sky and sea , between which it was suspended , and after an hour 's watching I thought I was able to detect wavy outlines that might be eminences or might be imagination . The Trades had left us two days before , and we wee now dependant on such winds as pleased to blow us along . These were fickle , as winds usually are , the kind Trades ' always excepted ; and we had not sailed an hour and a half after the land was made before the breeze died away , leaving our sails flapping , and our hopes of getting into the river before night , fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discontent . At one moment he would swear at the wind , at another at the brig , and then give the seamen a regular d  --  g all round by way of variety . Mr. Bedrick was cross , and we were one and all very much vexed with the wind for dying away , instead of being thankful and happy that we had got in sight of land . But such is human nature .  --  We forget our blessings the moment fortune frowns upon us . The sunshine is no more remembered when darkness and storms follow .  --  Men are grumblers  --  good for nothing ungrateful grumblers ! With enough to fill our hearts with gratitude , for bringing us in sight of the coast to which we were bound , we made ourselves wretched because the wind had left us in sight of it . I dare say we should have been less angry had we been becalmed an hour before the land was discovered . The calm lasted the whole day . The sun set in a glassy sea of fire . The moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All night we lay upon the bosom of the deep wooing the winds . None of us could sleep for asking every half hour if the wind had sprung up ? ' The Captain walked the deck all night whistling , and set the sailors to whistling for a wind . Morning dawned ; the sun rose , but with it did not come the breeze the Captain prophecied . The land , too , had disappeared . A man was sent aloft , but could see nothing of it . The current setting out of the river combined with the ebb of the tide had effected us where we were and drifted us to sea again ! Upon the discovery of this fact the disappointment and ill-humor increased . No one spoke civilly to his neighbor . The tempers of all had been soured by a long voyage of nearly sixty days , and also by certain events that will be narrated in the next chapter . At length the wind came gently from the South , and by noon we once more made the land , which proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on slowly until we were able to distinguish objects upon it .  --  The sight of this place , the day before , had filled us with deep emotions of joy . Land ! dear land ! ' It was happiness to gaze upon it . It now proved to be a barren and bleak spot , destitute of trees , and of a pale green hue , yet to our eyes so long weaned from earth it seemed a paradise . Our imaginations invested it with every beauty of scenery , and we felt that if we could place our feet upon it our earthly bliss would receive its consummation . The very smell of the land which came off to us many leagues was more grateful than the aroma borne on the gales of Arabia . We did nothing now but hang over the vessel 's side and gaze upon it . The water now assumed a grayish dingy appearance , and the lead was hove into the sea to ascertain the depth . Nearer and nearer we came to the Cape , and at length were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near it something that we guessed was a human habitation . About an hour before sunset we entered the river passing within a mile and a half of the low Cape upon which with the glass we made out a man half-naked , mounted on horseback , and watching us . The southern cape of the river being many leagues from the northern , was visible to us ; the river being at its mouth like a bay in breadth . The moon rose above the dark land on our right for the first time in sixty days that we had not seen it emerge from the water . As we ascended the river we could hear the welcome sound of dogs barking upon the shore ; and here and there in the interior shone fires which had been lighted for some purpose unknown to us four clerks , ' but which we had no little curiosity to learn ; for whatever we saw or heard now , were subjects of no indifferent interest to us , thus for the first time entering the waters and skirting the shores of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now arrived near the termination of our voyage , we were moved by various emotions with the prospect of soon landing at the city of Buenos Ayres , which was about two hundred miles up the river we had just entered . To enable the reader fully to enter into our peculiar feelings , I will now go back to a period about ten days previous to our making Cape St. Mary 's , the northernmost cape of the La Plata . After the storm and the imminent peril in which our lives were placed and which led to kinder feelings , we got on very well for about twenty-six or seven days , the general harmony only interrupted by those short squalls of ill-humor that will take place in the best regulated cabins where passengers get tired of the voyage , themselves , and especially of their fellow-passengers . We had , however , discovered our Mr. Bedrick to be a man of violent temper , and supremely selfish , and disposed to be arrogant in the exercise of his authority over us four young men . His eldest son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming , and with great pretentions to universal knowledge , withal extremely ignorant . The brother Bill we found to be fiery , reckless , indifferent whom he offended , and perfectly independent of his father and of every body else , doing just what his wild and wayward will dictated . Yet we got along pretty well with all three without coming to an open rupture , though we had to forbear a good deal with each of them . At length , as I have said , about ten days before we entered the river , a violent quarrel took place in the cabin between Captain Pright and Mr. Bedrick . What the cause of it was we never exactly understood , but from a few words we overheard , we supposed that it related to the payment of our passage out . In a little while the Captain came on deck looking as black as a thunder cloud . He had a cigar in his mouth which instead of lighting he walked the deck chewing at the end with the utmost zeal . Every little while he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck again . The Bedrick in spectacles had run down into the cabin as soon as the Captain came on deck ; but Bill , who was stretched upon the larboard hen-coop reading a novel , paid no attention to what was passing . It seemed to be altogether indifferent with him whether his father knocked the Captain down , or the Captain his father ; for he had had regular quarrels with both within the last twenty-four hours . As for ourselves , we did not love the merchant ' so well as to be sorry to see him in a difficulty ; and besides , a flare-up like this greatly relieved the tedium of the voyage . For some days past Captain Pright had treated us four with more than ordinary consideration . We had discovered that , as he grew cold towards Mr. Bedrick and his sons , he warmed kindly towards ourselves . We were , therefore , likely to be gainers by the present tremendous outbreak . So we remained quietly awaiting the issue . I was engaged by the capstan , which I used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brig ; Radsworth seated upon a coil of rigging , in studying navigation ; Hewitt bothering his brain over his Spanish grammar , and Fairfax lying at his length smoking under the lee of the weather bulwarks with his head in the bight of the foretopsail braces for a pillow . The Captain paced the deck untll he had munched up half the length of his cigar , and then throwing it away took another and called the cook to bring him a coal of fire . He now began to walk and smoke . The difference between chewing a cigar and smoking it was very soon apparent in the change that took place in his countenance . The cloud gradually passed off as if it had been ejected through his lips in the shape of tobacco smoke , and he began to look composed . At length , he paused in his walk , and looked at us with an expression as if he had something to say to us . But he turned away without speaking , glancing at the younger Bedrick as if he did not care he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Edwin Bedrick came on deck , his face as pale as ashes with anger .  --  He looked at the Captain as if he would like to annihilate him . Captain Pright smiled with malicious pleasure . Bedrick acted as if he wished to give vent to his displeasure upon him , but was prevented by that discretion which is known by the name of fear . ' So , you do n't like it that I have called your father an old rascal , ' said the Captain quietly ; for I suppose he has made his complaints to his petted son . ' You are no gentleman to abuse an old man like my father ! A man of the highest respectability , sir , ' cried Bedrick . Very respectable , ' answered the Captain contemptuously . You shall apologise to him for calling him an old rascal ! Brother Bill , do you care nothing att seeing your honored father insulted !  --  Captain Pright has had the audacity to call him an old rascal ! ' Well , I dare say Captain Pright knows him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryly . At this reply , we all laughed so heartily that Edwin Bedrick in great rage , began to rate us roundly , calling us ungrateful and without good manners , and that when we got to Buenos Ayres we should pay for it ! We made no reply , but laughed at his threats , and made up our minds within ourselves that we would not pay for it ' when we got to Buenos Ayres . At length Captain Pright interposed his authority , and told Bedrick if he did not be quiet he would put him in irons ! ' This threat silenced him , and he went grumbling below to talk over the affair with his father . Let me once get the boys there , ' we overheard the old man say among other words , and I will let ' em know who 's master . ' Yes , ' answered his son ; here Captain Pright snstains them . By the Lord ! when we once get them out of the vessel , we 'll make ' em smart for it , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain , looking at us and winking . He then came towards us and said in an under tone : I want you all to be on deck to-night in my watch . Bedrick and the boys will be turned in . You must come up one by one without disturbing any of them , for I have got something to tell you , that you ought to hear . ' We promised to obey him ; and then went forward and began to discuss the matter and try to guess the subject upon which he was to speak with us . At length the sun set , the night advanced towards twelve o'clock , when the Captain would come on deck , for he took the middle watch . We had all turned in by ten o'clock , but as soon as we heard eight bells , we began to turn out and steal on deck . The night was clear , with a bright moon that made the brig look as if covered with a cloud of snow . After the larboard watch had gone below and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every thing quiet , we went aft to where the Captain was standing smoking his cigar , which was never out of his lips . Well , my lads , ' he said , addressing us in a cordial tone , I am glad to see you on deck . The old one is sound asleep , and his sons , too , I suppose ; but to prevent surprises , I will just close the companion-way , so that if they take a fancy to come on deck they may be heard ! Now take seats about me on the hen-coop , and I will tell you what I have wished to tell you ever since I learned from some of your conversation I overheard a few days ago , that you were all four completely taken in ! ' Taken in ? ' we exclaimed . Do n't speak so infernal loud , ' he said angrily . I would n't have Bedrick know that I tell you this for all the world ! He might make something of it to get me into trouble . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deceit and downright fraud , my danger will get up . The old man is a confounded rascal , and he has crowned his rascality by deceiving you ! ' How has he deceived us ? ' we asked , filled with dismay . I overhearo you talking together one day about your prospects .  --  From your words I learned that you had been engaged by Mr. Bedrick to go out to Buenos Ayres to be clerks in a Mercantile House that he was to establish there and at Monte Video . ' Yes , ' we answered , that is what we are engaged for ! ' Well , you see , you will find yourselves confoundedly mistaken , my lads ! When I found from what I heard that you were laboring under a deception practiced upon you by Bedrick , I came very near blowing the whole affair at once and letting you know just what you were going out to South America for ! I saw that you were respectable young men , from genteel families , and were destined certainly for something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who and what you were , after the first week at sea , I confess I was surprised that young men of your education and appearance should have taken up with Mr. Bedrick , and consent to go with him on his expedition ! ' What expedition then is it ? How are we deceived ? What does he want of us ? ' we demanded , filled with alarm and indignation . I will tell you . You expect to become clerks in a respectable mercantile establishment . But you are destined for no such thing . Mr. Bedrick has nothing higher in view on his arrival at Buenos Ayres than to open a soda-shop ! ' A soda-shop ? ' we repeated , confounded . Do n't raise your voices so high , my friends ! ' said the Captain warmly . Yes , you are are destined for nothing more uor less than to tend soda shops in Buenos Ayres and Monte Video ! ' Our amazement was almost without bonds . It was only surpassed by our indignant anger at the duplicity of which we had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected and so strange , that after a moment 's reflection , recollecting the Captain 's quarrel with Mr. Bedrick , it occurred to me that he might only desire to injure him . I , therefore , remarked to the Captain when our excitement had a little subsided , that I thought he must be laboring under a mistake , for the cargo in the brig was certainly Mr. Bedrick 's . Not a dollar of it , ' he answered . Did he tell you so ? ' Yes . He said that he had freighted the brig with his goods for South America , ' was our reply . You have been thoroughly duped . All the freight he has on board are four copper soda fountains which you have seen . These are what he means by his goods for his Commercial House . I tell you truly he has no interest in the brig or her cargo . He has only these soda fountains and some jars of lemon syrup , which are all his stock in trade ! ' I had taken him and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with the owners , who are related to him , and who are glad to get rid of him at any rate whatever . The fact is , he has been a merchant somewhere in the North , and failed in business some years ago . Since then he has been fiddling round and doing little or nothing , and rather a burden upon some rich relatives , one of whom owns this brig . A few weeks before we sailed , Bedrick heard that there were no soda-shops in Buenos Ayres , but that one had been set up by an English adventurer in Rio Janeiro , which took amazingly with the Brazilians , who paid twenty-five cents a glass for their soda , and that the adventurer was making a fortune . So , starting on this idea , Mr. Bedrick proposed to the owner of the brig , who was his relation , that if he would purchase him four soda fountains , secure him a passage out to Buenos Ayres , with his sons and three or four clerks , ' ( yourselves , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer burden him . To this project the gentleman at length acceded . The soda-fountains were bought , and I was to take oat the whole expedition and land it safely in Buenos Ayres . Where or how Mr. Bedrick got his clerks ' I never knew until subsequent to your coming on board . What motive he had in deceiving you I ca n't imagine , unless it was that he believed ( what is true ) that it would be impossible for him to obtain four respectable , trustworthy young men to embark ten thousand miles to a foreign country to tend soda-shops . ' He , therefore , disguised the truth that he might get young men he could confide his commercial affairs to , ' knowing you could not help yourself after he had got you there ! ' But we will show him that we can help ourselves , ' was our resolute reply . But how is it , ' asked Hewitt that the merchants in Boston to whom he referred , sustained him in this deceit ? ' His relative was desirous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , and so gave his name to recommend him ; but I question if he was aware that you were kept ignorant of the precise nature of the business in which you were to engage when you got to South America . He would not have been a party to such a deception as that , much as he might wish to get the old man off . I have thought it my duty to let you know the whole truth , young gentlemen , ' continued the Captain ; and all the recompense I ask is that you will not say a word to any one of the matter while in the brig , whatever you do after you get ashore . Let not the old man or his sons suspect that you know the truth , but try and let every thing go quietly on , until we reach port . ' This we promised to do ; and after thanking the Captain warmly for making known the wicked deception which had been practiced upon us , we went below , and , seated upon our trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . CHAPTER XII . The Spanish Fisherman . The astounding intelligence we had received , made a deep impression upon us . We got little sleep that night . We talked over the past the present , and the future . We were not diffident in expressing our opinion of Mr. Bedrick , who had thus inveigled us into a scheme which had fraud for its basis . We one and all felt very positive that we had souls above soda-shops ! ' We were convinced thar nature never intended us to sell foaming glasses sweetened with lemon syrup to Spaniards or any body else , either at fourpence or twenty-five cents a glass . In a word , we were justly indignant at the deception which had been practiced upon us . We regretted our precipitancy in engaging with a stranger , but every thing had seemed outwardly fair and honorable . How to extricate ourselves from the trap in which our ambition to see foreign countries we had suffered ourselves to be taken , was now the great theme of consultation . Every night , when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devise ways and means for getting over the difficulty . In the presence of Mr. Bedrick we were respectful , more so than we had ever been , for we wished to prevent any suspicion of our knowledge of the true character of his mercantile establishment . We at length resolved , after many secret conclaves , that we would keep quiet until we reached Buenos Ayres , and then wait upon him in a body , represent to him our wrongs , and make a public declaration of our independence of him , his sons , and his abominable soda-shops . I had in my trunk a letter of introduction from my father to Colonel Forbes , the American charge d ' affaires at Buenos Ayres , and on the strength of this we made up our minds to wait upon Mr. Forbes and day before him our grievances in full , declare our abjuration of Mr. Bedrick 's authority , and place ourselves at his disposal and advice as to our future movements . When we had settled upon this plan , our minds became easier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts our resolve .  --  Having this power of redress , we were enabled to appear quite cheerful , and indeed we all were in high spirits . Whenever we came across one of the soda-fountains in the steerage , we never failed to give it an emphatic kick expressive of our supreme contempt . In this way the days went by , the old man unsuspicious of our knowledge of the truth , and believing that he was leading us like lambs to the slaughter . But with anticipated redress in our hands , we laughed at him . We felt a profound satisfaction in punishing him by depriving him of the clerks ' he had taken such pains to lure away from their native country . We anticipated with delight his dismay , his fury , his grief ! There was a question of conscience started by Hewitt whether it would be right and just for us to take our passage out from him now that we had decided not to remain with him . But after discussion , it was decided in the affirmative . Our argument was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraudulent engagement , and that he should be the loser by our passage ; that if we ever returned to the United States , it must be at an expense to us equal to our passage out ; and that , therefore , we were under no obligations to make any remuneration to Mr. Bedriek for his expenses . The Captain continued to warn us , from time to time , to keep our secret , and continued a good friend to us . We at length , as I have already mentioned , entered the river La Plata , and began to ascend it . The morning after we passed by Cape St. Mary 's , I awoke early , anxious to behold by daylight , the land of a foreign shore . It was just sun-rise when I reached the deck . To the south stretched a wide waste of water like the ocean , for the opposite shore was invisible on account of the river 's vast breadth , although we were fifty miles up it . On our right lay the northern bank of the La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It presented to the eye a low range of prairie or level pampa , broken here and there into ridges and bare hillocks . As far as the view extended this was the feature of the scenery of the shore , save that occasionally was visible a clump of stunted trees , which the Captain told us were peach trees . Not a living object was to be discovered ; not a sign of habitation.  --  Nevertheless I gazed on the land with longing eyes , wishing that the wind would die away so that we might take the boat and pull to the shore . To place our feet once more upon the firm ground we all felt would be a luxury . As we slowly ascended the brown-colored river , the shores began to present a less arid aspect ; and about ten o'clock we discovered a human habitation , and near it a drove of cattle . One or two human beings were also seen riding among the cattle . Towards noon we passed several wretched houses with flat roofs and surrounded by picket enclosures which contained cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were apparent . Those people . ' said the Captain , are half Indians , half Portuguese , who live by hunting cattle , and selling hides at Maldonado . We shall come to this place in two or three hours . It is a small town , defended by an old fortress , and belongs to the Republic of Buenos Ayres , as does all this country you see , which is called the Banda Oriental , and is the southern extremity of Brazil . The Emperor has it in his hands now as well as Monte Video , sixty miles above Maldonado . There is likely to be some difficulty about it , though , and I should n't be surprised if the two governments should come to blows . When I was last here they were menacing each other ! ' What is the cause of the hostility ? ' asked Hewitt ; for we were all profoundly ignorant of South American politics . Why , you see , when Buenos Ayres , a few years ago , declared herself independent of Old Spain , and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ,  --  Banda Oriental on the north , and Paraguay on the south side , in which the city of Buenos Ayres is situated . But not being able to defend the Banda Oriental against Spain , she entered into a treaty with Don Pedro , the Emperor of Brazil , with whom the Republic was on friendly terms , to keep the district and city of Monte Video against Spain until the war was ended . What the Republic was to pay the Emperor for this service , I never learned . At alll events , he consented to oblige them ; and as the first step , sent round from Rio Janeiro a fleet of twenty vessels of war , conveying twelve thousand troops to Monte Video , the capital of the Banda Oriental . If you will look at the map , you will see that Monte Video forms a natural southern out-post to Brazil , and a very convenient port for the empire . Don Pedro had doubtless learned this lesson in geography before the Republic proposed to him to keep the city from falling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayrean patriots secured the independence of their country after a long contest , at which Don Pedro quietly looked on . After the Buenos Ayreans had made peace with Spain , they called upon Don Pedro and very civilly thanking him for the good care he had taken of Monte Video , desired him to send back his troops to Rio , and surrender to them the charge of the city . Upon this the wily Portuguese thrust his tongue into his cheek , and very cavalierly told them to come and take it ! ' Is it possible such treachery can exist ! ' exclaimed Hewitt , his cheeks flushed with resentment . Don Pedro is no better than a blackguard ! ' Doubtless the Republic thought so when they got his answer , and saw how thoroughly they had been taken in ! ' Quite as grossly as we have been , ' repeated Hewitt with earnestness . Not a word of that , young gentlemen , ' said the Captain . Wait till you get ashore , and then you may say and do what you like ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Ayreans having just closed a protracted war , were in no condition to commence another , and so they quietly bore this injustice , but at the same time began to make warlike preparations . This was the state of things when I last was out here ! ' continued the Captain ; and I dare say by this time they are pretty nearly ready to blaze away at each other . I have no doubt but before you are six months in the country , you 'll see some fighting ! ' The idea of witnessing a battle was quite exciting to us , who had hitherto only read of such a thing . The reflections that when we reached Buenos Ayres we should find the country at war gave us all fine spirits ; for there is nothing that has such a charm to a young and ardent mind as war ! We thanked the Captain for initiating us into the politics of the country , and then began to talk about entering into the patriot service if we found the country in arms . This billigerent notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pacific turn of mind , but the rest of us entered into the discussion of the affair with great animation . The shores now presented a most interesting appearance , being varied with clumps of trees , enclosures , and a few cottages with low , flat roofs . At length we came in sight of the port and houses of Maldonado , and about five in the afternoon came abreast of the place . It was a small hamlet , without much beauty of situation , but still it was novel to us , as the first Spanish town we had ever seen . A few fishing boats were anchored off the old fort , and one of them rigged with a small lateen sail , run along side of us , and offered to sell us fish . We all ran to the gangway to gaze upon the man and his boat . He was tall and slender , with a face as dark as an Indian 's , black glittering eyes , and teeth like ivory . Upon his head he wore a sugar-loaf shaped woollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound about his waist by a leathern belt , at the same time kept up a pair of cotton trowsers fringed at the bottom . He addressed us in Spanish . Here now , young gentlemen , ' said Captain Pright laughing , here now is a good chance for you to try your Spanish on him . ' We were , however , something diffident of our powers ; but Hewitt ventured a Spanish phrase , which he read to him off his grammer with a pronunciation that was never approached . The phrase was , I believe , What o'clock is it ? ' which , put to a man who probably had never seen a watch , was laughable enough . No entiendo , ' answered the man , smiling and showing his teeth . He must be a Portugee Indian , ' said Hewitt , in defence of his prouunciation ; it is plain he do n't understand the pure Castillian . ' Let Mr. Bedrick try him , ' said Fairfax . He is a Spanish scholar ? ' At this , Edwin , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hesitation asked the man how he sold his fish . The man did not understand him , and Bedrick declared that the fellow did not know a word of Spanish , as he had asked him in good grammatical Spanish . We , however , questioned whether he himself did not know less ; for our progress in the language had showed us that he had but a mere smattering of the tongue he professed to understand , as he said , like his mother-dialect . As it did not require any Spanish or English to take fish and pay money for them , we made a purchase of a few , and also bought some vegetables from a boat that came off to us . Emboldened by the failure of Bedrick , our teacher , we all four went desperately the Spanish at the latter boatman , whom we succeeded in making comprehend our horrible Castillian , ' by means of a few English words judiciously thrown in , and some aid from expressive signs . It is true , we did not understand more than a word in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand all that we said , and a great deal more , we were perfectly satisfied . We made abominable work in the attempt to ask him intelligibly what the news was , and whether Don Pedro and the Patriots were likely to go to war . But the poor man , although he guessed we must mean something , and tried very hard to comprehend what it was , did not convey to our minds any clear idea that he understood what we wanted to learn of him . So we parted from him as wise as we met him , and proceeded on our way .  --  At sundown we were within fifty miles of Monte Video , which the Captain said we should reach by morning if the wind held . With this prospect , therefore , of soon seeing a large walled city , full of troops , and the harbor with vessels of war , we retired for the night , determined to be up early to enjoy the sight ; for it was not our intention to stop there ; but the Captain had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck the first object that met my eyes was the mount of Monte Video towering grandly from the horizon about nine miles distant , crowned with its angular fortress .  --  The hill , as we approached it , presented a beautiful appearance . It is shaped like a cone , and is three hundred feet in height , and the rest of the land around it being low , it is visible at a great distance . As we advanced , the towers and turrets and dome of the cathedral of the city of Monte Video lifted themselves over the surface of the intervening country , while near them was visible a forest of masts , the hulls of the numerous vessels being still concealed by the intervening land . It was a beautiful morning ; one of those soft , balmy atmospheres peculiar to this climate . The sun , reflected from the distant towers , flags , and battlements of the fortress , gave brilliancy to the scene . Up the river higher , were two or three vessels of war , which carried the Brazilian flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two schooners , moving along under easy sail , as if merely sailing for pleasure off the harbor . The harbor of Monte Video opens boldly from the main shore of the river with a entrance , entrance , flanked on the west side by the mount and its fortress , and on the east or right hand by a strongly built battery . The shape of the harbor is not unlike that of a pear , made a deep , spacious basin a mile wide , and more than that distance in length inland . The city lays within the eastern curve , upon gradually rising ground , and as we came in sight of it presented a fine appearance , its roofs rising one above the other , and the whole crowned by the cathedral with its dome and numerous towers . As we approached the mouth of the harbor , about a mile distant from it , I went aloft to get a more open view . From this elevation I was enabled to command a wide and beautiful prospect , of city , harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white flat-rooted villas , gardens and clumps of bright green trees . I enjoyed the scene with a zest that can only be appreciated by those who have been sixty-two days on the ocean without seeing land . It seemed like a new world opened to my inspection ; for the general features of what I beheld were all foreign and new to my eyes . We at length came nearly opposite the harbor , so that we could look in and see a huge ship-of-the-line dismantled and anchored directly in its mouth , pointing her triple battery towards us . The Captain told us this was called The Guard Ship , ' and was a mode much in use with the Spaniards and Portuguese for protecting harbors . We thought the town pretty well protected with the fort on the mount , the battery on the opposite point , and the guard ship lying between them with scarce room for two vessels to pass abreast , between her and the shores . Beyond the guard-ship we saw a fleet of at least two hundred vessels thickly crowding the basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their masts presented the appearance of a forest in autumn . I do n't like the looks o ' that at all , ' said the Captain , twisting his mouth up as he gazed into the crowded harbor through his spy-glass . Do n't like the looks of what ? ' I asked , for I was standing near him in in the main top , to which he had ascended with his spy-glass . Of so many vessels anchored in the harbor . It looks as if things were not altogether right ! ' Why , what do you apprehend ? ' I inquired . There are at least twenty-five Yankee flags flying at the mast-heads in the harbor , and half as many English . I do n't see what the deuce they are doing there ; and , besides , the harbor is full of Brazilian men-of-war  --  frigates , sloops , gun-brigs and schooners ! There comes an English armed brig out and standing down for us ! If she comes nigh enough , I will speak her , for things look squally . Keep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English brig ! She is luffing for us . ' Aye , aye , sir , ' answered the mate , and we came to a point and a half . The Captain then descended to the deck , while I remained in the top watching the approach of a large armed brig with English colors displayed at her peak , that had just come out of the harbor , and was standing down the river towards us as if bound to sea . As she approached it was plain that she intended to speak us , for she luffed up for us . The Captain called for his trumpet and sprang into the main rigging , where he took his stand , awaiting her ; for he was anxious to learn the news ; for he had began to suspect the true state of things . The English brig came down towards us beautifully , and as she approached , clewed up her topsails to deaden her head-way . I could look down upon her clean decks and see the double battery of dark guns and groups of men upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three officers in uniform . Our Captain , as soon as he had called for his trumpet , had ordered the colors to be set in answer to those flying on board the English vessel . Ho the brig , ahoy ! ' shouted a stern voice from the quarter-deck of the Englishman , as the two vessels neared each other on opposite tacks . What brig is that ? ' The Josephus , of Portsmouth , bound to Buenos Ayres . What brig is that ? ' The English Letter of Marque Queen Bess , ' bound to London . I have borne down to you , ' continued the obliging Captain . supposing you were bound up the river , to say , that war has been declared between the Republic of Buenos Ayres and Brazil , and that the blockade of the river above Monte Video was enforced five days ago . You will have to put into Monte Video , as five leagues above this the blockading fleet is stationed , and to reach Buenos Ayres will be out of the question . ' Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking trumpet towards him , and touching his hat in acknowledgment for his courtesy . Not at all , not at all , ' responded the Captain of the Letter of Marque , as he sheeted home his topsails again , while we filled away . for we had backed our main-topsail as he came near us . Now this is what I call slipping between the cup and the lip , ' exclaiming Captain Pright with looks of angry disappointment . After sixty-two days ' sail to reach a place , and get within twenty-four hour 's run of it , to be told we must go home again or put into some other port ! ' Why what is the matter ? ' cried old Mr. Bedrick , coming hurriedly up on deck , for he had been shaving below all the while ; what is it the English Captain says ? ' He says that Buenos Ayres is blockaded by a Brazilian squadron ! ' answered the Captain in a tone of ill-humor . Well , what is to be done ? ' asked the old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must either run the gauntlet or I must find some other port for the cargo of flour and Yankee notions . But I am not to be turned back unless I am compelled . If Buenos Ayres is blockaded I can get good prices for every thing on board if I can get up there . So I will just keep quietly on and see if I ca n't give them Portuguese the slip ! ' But if they catch us trying to run the blockade , ' said Bedrick , they will capture the brig and take her into Monte Video as a prize , and condemn her , and make us prisoners . ' I will put it to the vote of the passengers , and the majority shall govern my conduct , ' answered the Captain . Come , gentlemen , shall we stand on , or put into the harbor that is already filled with American vessels ? ' We four voted in favor of keeping on , and also the younger Bedrick ; but the old man and his elder born , proposed that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' answered the Captain . Flour will be a drug in Monte Video , for I dare say , every Yankee vessel there has it on board . If I can reach Buenos Ayres , I shall make my fortune , and enrich the owners . So I shall stand on and trust to the keel of my brig ; for I dare swear she is faster than any of the Portuguese craft in these waters ! ' You will stand on at your peril , Captain Pright , ' cried the old man . You know if we are chased and overtaken , we shall be fired into , and you will be answerable for life and limb ! And then if you are taken , the vessel is detained as a fair prize , and we will no doubt be thrown into a Portuguese prison ! ' I will , at all event , run the risk . The wind is fair and  --  ' He was here interrupted at this crisis by the report of a gun . We looked up and saw a cloud of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had just poked her nose out of the harbor and was bearing for us under all sail . She was about half a league distant . There , sir ! Do you hear that ? ' cried Mr. Bedrick as white as a sheet . Yes , sir , do you see that ? ' repeated his elder born , looking whiter than his parent , if possible . I command you , Captain Pright , to stop your vessel before we are all killed ! ' Gentlemen , I command this brig . If you interfere with my duties , I shall be compelled to order you below ! ' As he spoke , a second report was heard from the Brazilian . Instantly we all dodged our heads ; but the shot fell short of us , for we could see where it struck quarter of a mile to the leeward , dashing the spray high into the air . Captain Pright looked perplexed and dissatisfied . He smoked away at his cigar with unusual ferocity , while he glanced from his brig 's sails to the brigantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was sailing past the harbor at a speed of about five knots . The Captain saw that he was running a great risk in standing on , for if he was brought to his vessel might be seized for infringing the blockade ; as he knew the Brazilians would advance any pretext for the purpose of getting possession of his vessel and cargo . He saw , also , that the Brazilian brig was a fast sailer , and that if he even should out-sail her , he would find it difficult to elude the blockading squadron stationed fifteen miles higher up the river . The firing of the brig had also set in active motion the two armed schooners to windward , and they were rapidly standing for us . Affairs began , indeed , to look a little serious . Captain Pright seemed to think so himself ; for after taking a deliberate inspection of the three vessels , one after another , and carefully calculating his chances of being taken , he gave two or three fierce puffs at his cigar , and issued an order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind was from the south , and blew directly into the harbor , this manoeuvre plainly made known to the three vessels that we had concluded to behave ourselves and submit to the laws of war . The two schooners at once hauled their wind and went off about their own business , while the brig of war kept standing on for us , but without firing any more guns , greatly to our gratification . She was a black , ugly looking craft , with dark brown canvass , and a very smoky appearance altogether , like almost all the Brazilian vessels of war .  --  Her mainmast raked very much , while her foremast stooped a little  --  She carried very square topsails , and an enormously large jib and trisail . She showed six guns to a side , and was filled with dark-looking men in red caps and red shirts . In about ten minutes after we had squared away , she came under our stern , and hailed in good English : What brig is that ? ' The Josephus , of Boston , bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cross tone . Did you know that a blockade was enforced ? What do you mean by standing on ? ' demanded the officer in a stern voice . How should I know ? And if I did , it is my duty to do the best I can to make the port I am bound to ! ' You will back your topsails , and receive a boat , with an officer to take charge of you . ' There , what did I tell you , sir ! ' cried Mr. Bedrick . The brig is lost , and we are all prisoners . ' There will be little you will be likely to lose besides your liberty , ' answered Captain Pright , looking at us slyly . But the vessel is not to be taken . He only pays us the compliment to escort us safely in.  --  We have not run the blockade yet , though I would have done it if I could ! ' We had now backed our maintoptsail and the brigantine had done the same . She then sent a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middy , and was pulled by four dark looking Portuguese sailors in red caps with black locks and piercing eyes beneath . The boat came along side ; the gang-way ladder was let down to him ; the Captain stood about half way between the companion-way and the gangway port to receive him . He came on deck , slightly bowed round to us , and advanced towards the Captain . He was a slender , handsome looking fellow , with a dark cheek , and a large fine eye . He was richly dressed in the gold embroidered and gorgeous uniform of the Brazilian naval service , and wore at his side a magnificent sword . You are the Capitan ? ' he asked of Captain Pright in broken English : for he was not the officer who had hailed us , and who must have been an Englishman in the Emperor 's service , which was filled with them . Yes , I am the Captain ? ' You were trying to run de blockade ? ' I was trying to make my port . I hove to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , you will let me see your papers , and resign to me command of the vessel to take him into port ! If you had stood on five minutes longer , you would have forfeited your vessel ! Fill away again ! ' Captain Pright then invited him into the cabin to show him the brig 's papers , gave him a glass of wine , and treated him with remarkable civility , since , we all knew that it would afford him the greatest pleasure to pitch him overboard . We now filled away and stood into port , while the brigantine steered down the river after another vessel that was just coming into view . CHAPTER XIV . The Soda Fountains . It will be readily believed that this sudden change in our destination was by no means agreeable to all on board . Mr. Bedrick raved and seemed beside himself as we proceeded towards the harbor . We , however , after a little reflection , took the matter kindly . We saw that Don Pedro had very conclusively terminated our contract with Mr. Bedrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for if we could not get to Buenos Ayres , we could not of course be clerks ' in Buenos Ayres ; the affair , therefore , dropped to the ground of itself .  --  We would very much have liked reaching that city , because our thoughts and views had naturally been directed towards it ; though Monte Video appeared to be a city that presented to the eye of a youth every thing to please . But we thought if we could only have reached Buenos Ayres , we would join the patriots . It matters little , ' said Fairfax after the Brazilian officer had taken us in charge , it matters little to us where we go . We have declared ourselves independent of Bedrick , and the world is all before us where to choose ! I move that we put the best face on the matter and take the chances that are before us for by and by making our fortunes . ' Yes , ' I replied , and by going into Monte Video we shall have an opportunity of seeing the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am not sorry that we are going into this port .  --  We shall find a great deal to interest and amuse us , I dare say ; and as there must be an American Consul here , we shall have his protection and advise . ' Therefore , on the whole , this change in our destination did not materially affect our spirits . We had nothing to lose and all to gain by it . Our hopes with reference to Buenos Ayres had been wrecked already by the discovery of Mr. Bedrick 's treachery towards us , and all the objections that we really had to the change was , that we did not like to patronize a city that was fighting against patriots . Young and enthusiastic , and brim full of liberty , like all Yankee lads , we could not relish the idea of being detained in a city that was at war with a people that had just been fighting for liberty , and were now fighting for their rights . We thought that if we could get to Buenos Ayres , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while with the Brazilians we should remain passive , but indignant lookers-on . While we entered the harbor , I stood near the taffrail gazing upon the scene around us . The morning was bright and exhilarating , and every object appeared to the best advantage through the transparent air . Upon our left towered the sugar-loaf mountains , frowning with its lofty fortress , above which floated the emblazoned banner of the Brazilian empire . The walls were formidable with cannon , and the battlements were lined with troops , which were at drill upon the broad promenade the walls presented . Upon the sides of the hill cattle were feeding , and near the water-side were two or three fisherman 's huts , and soldiers washing their clothes in the river . We next passed the guard-ship , from which we were hailed in Portuguese , and our Brazilian officer replied in the same tongue , and we were suffered to pass on into the bosom of the harbor . We soon found ourselves in the midst of a fleet composed of nearly all nations , Yankee , English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the national colors designated them flying at their mast-heads . We sailed in among them , now hailed on one side from a Boston brig , now on the other from a New York or Baltimore ship , asking the news . At length we came to anchor within a quarter of a mile of the Mole , and farthest in the harbor of all the American vessels , save the Boston barque Conway , Captain Blakely , which was moored out ahead of us . Before we come to anchor , however , we had been boarded by a custom-house boat and our manifesto examined . After we had come to anchor , I passed some time in gazing off upon the town and upon the various objects surrounding us . All around us were vessels at anchor , among them a score of Brazilian men-of-war , like hawks lighted amid a flock of pigeons . Directly before me lay the mole , a sort of wharf , and the only landing place in front of the city . It was thronged with a mixed multitude like a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with boats from the vessels in the harbor . An opening at the further extremity of the mole exposed a narrow street in which laden asses and odd-looking carriages , drawn by mules , were disputing the way with the foot passengers . The appearance of the town struck me from its novelty . It was enclosed by a massive wall save at the mole , where it had been battered down by the British fleet in 1815 . The houses were flat roofed , built of brick , stuccoed and painted white or lemon color , with large vanes ornamenting the battlements . Upon them I beheld the inhabitants walking and gazing off upon the harbor . There were several heavylooking towers rising here and there in the city , and the vast bulk of a Roman Catholic cathedral in the centre gave an imposing finish to the outline . At length we were called to dinner in the cabin , our last dinner on board the brig . At the table we discussed the city and the circumstances which had brought us , and with such cheerfulness that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Captain , that perhaps he might open an establishment there , as the city was full of soldiers and foreigners , and that it might do as well if not better than Buenos Ayres ! ' I thought , sir , ' observed Hewitt , dryly , that you believed nothing could be done here , as so much freight was in the place . I should think that you would find a good many competitors in business and in disposing of your merchandize now on board . ' Why , no , Hewitt . In my particular business I shall not be so much interfered with . ' As the cargo that you have have on board is very large and valuable , I should think it would be difficult to command prices , ' continued Hewitt ; but Monte Video may , as you say , afford a good fountain ' to begin business . ' We could scarcely keep our countenances at this sally of Hewitt 's , and looked at the old man to see if he took ; but the word did not convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : for the very sound and form of the word had become identified in our minds with a soda-fountain ! ' I think I shall go on shore , ' said the old man , look about me , and see how affairs are . Come , Edwin , you will go with me ; but you young men , will stay aboard till I come back . ' We made no reply , and after the old gentleman had left the brig with his sons , Edwin and Bill , we held a meeting in the cabin , Captain Pright presiding . Now , my friends , we have got to the end of our voyage out , ' said the Captain ; and you will have to land here instead of at Buenos Ayres ; for I have given up the idea of getting there with the brig , as the blockade may be kept on for months . I shall , therefore , try and learn what chance I have for disposing of the cargo , and if I ca n't sell it to advantage , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I shall probably lay here four or five days , you are at liberty to make it your home on board till you can look for something to do . You are young and enterprising , and now that you are here in this country a fair field is open for you to make your way . If I was going direct to the United States I would let you have a passage back , and look to your friends for the payment ; but after I sell my cargo , I sail for St. Petersburg to take in a cargo of furs . The old man has gone ashore to see if he can find a place to open a soda-shop . ' Are you sure of this ? ' we asked . Yes ; he toid me as he left the vessel that he should hire a shop if he could , and at once remove to it , and set up his fountain . He said should try and get a place with rooms over it for an eating room and sleeping rooms for himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since you are all strangers here , and have not much money either of you with you to spend , you will stick by the old man until you can look out for yourself something better . He is bound to take care of you and give you lodging and food , and so I would let him do it , and keep your own money . Do n't think of going to a hotel and live like gentlemen with your little means , ( for he knew we had not between us four but about one hundred and thirty-five dollars , ) but keep by the old man . Let him find a house and shop , and set up his fountains : join in with him in all , cheerfully , and make the best of it . You can then look about you , and by and by something will transpire of which you can avail yourselves . ' We thanked the Captain for his advice , and after some warm discussion of the matter , we took into consideratisn the poverty of our pockets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . Yes , fellows , ' said Hewitt , I agree with Captain Pright . The old man is bound to look out for us . Let us stick in him like leeches till we can fasten upon something else . To be sure , it is not a very elevated mode of beginning the world , especially for young gentlemen who aspired to clerkships in a Foreign Mercantile House , to keep soda-shops ; but we will not mind that . We will stick to old Bedrick and sell soda for him , but we 'll not stay one day longer than we please . But he must not know any thing of our dissatisfaction . Let us fall into the traces kindly , knowing we can kick them off whenever we are so disposed . ' This speech was unanimously applauded ; and although we did not much like to make our debut in a foreign city as soda-shop boys , yet we were four in all , and in some sort sustained each other ; and , moreover , in consenting to this we felt that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose duplicity had brought us into such a position . Now , ' said Radsworth , let us go on shore . The boat has come back , and I am impatient to press the solid land once more . ' If we are to carry out our plan we must comply with the old man 's orders , ' said Fairfax . If we go ashore and meet him there , there will be a blow up ! He will be back soon , and let us wait and hear his report , and then it will be time enough to go . ' We agreed to this delay , and in about two hours the old man came off alone . As soon as he reached the deck , we saw he was in fine spirits . I have got a capital house , in the most public street , ' he said to the Captain . I have seen soveral English officers and others , who , as soon as I told them my intention , said I could make my fortune .  --  They are all impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the fountains brought ashore at once . I have two rooms on the street , and five above , and all for two hundred dollars ' rent . Come , Captain , I will soon relieve you of your passengers . Will you have the fountains and jars brought on deck ! Come , young men , spring to our aid . You have had two months ' idleness and play , and now you ought to take hold and work with a good will . ' What are you to do with the fountains , sir ? ' I asked quietly . Why you see , young gentlemen , ' said the old man , a little confused , I brought these four fountains out for the purpose of having a luxury for myself and you , and our friends ; for I was told that they had no soda-fountains in Buenos Ayres , and the climate was warm . But as we ca n't get up to that city , and as fortune has cast us here , it has occurred to me that I will just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and citizens , just to pay expenses till I can reach Buenos Ayres and establish my Mercantile House . I am told I can sell the soda for a quarter of a dollar a glass . We must all yield to circumstances . The fate of war has cast our lot here ; and as I shall remain here till the port of Buenos Ayres is open , I think it will be wise to do something to pay expenses . So if you have no objection amuse ourselves awhile with selling soda to the Monte Videans ! ' After a little conversation aside between ourselves for form 's sake , we told him that , under the circumstances , we would be willing to aid him in establishing his soda saloon , and perhaps act as clerks , ' but that we had no disposition to follow it as a profession ! ' We then went to work and helped convey the fountains into the boat , and all four of us accompanied them to the pier . Here he obtained the aid of negroes and had them borne through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We followed two and two , gazing upon the strange and novel sights constantly offering themselves to the inspection of our curiosity . CHAPTER XV . The Old Spanish Casa . After a very interesting traverse of the streets of the town , we at length came in sight of the domicil which Mr. Bedrick had hired . It was a massive-looking , prison-like structure , two stories in height , with a stone battlement surmounted at the angles by huge urns of a brown color . The windows were very tall and deep set , and protected by iron bars like those of a prison . The lower ones had no glass , but inside shutters instead . The house was of brick stuccoed , and once painted a bright lemon color , but it had become dark with age , and in every crevice grew little ridges of black moss . The outside had altogether a very venerable and antiquated appearance , and to our eyes seemed as if it had borne the storms and suns of at least five centuries ; but the true age of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short time the effects which in a more northern latitude are more slowly brought about . The house , or castle before which we now paused , was situated half way between the corners of the square , and opposite a very handsome edifice which was occupied as a boarding-house , or hotel for naval officers , and other strangers . Our next door neighbor on the right , was a little Portuguese cobbler in iron spectacles , who came to his door to take a look at our cortege ; and the neighbor on the right was an old Brazilian beldame who made cigars . Between these two our domicil stood . Its front exhibited a huge door of solid Paraguay oak twelve feet high , and made with a small gate or wicket in it for one person to pass through at the time . On either side of the door , was a tall , narrow-grated window , half-curtained with cobwebs . Above was a row of four long and narrow windows that opened upon an iron balcony . These windows opened to the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these was a heavy cornice , surmounted by the battlements and urns , as I have before described . Having reached the front of this mansion , we paused to take a survey of it and of the neighborhood , while the old man fumbled for the key to unlock the prison-like door to let us in . Our arrival attracted some attention . Negroes , driving by mules laden with brick , stopped to gaze ; soldiers halted to inspect us ; and from the blinds or jalousies of the dwellings across the street , we caught glimpses of sparkling eyes , that we guessed belonged to fair Montevideans . It took the old gentleman some minutes to turn the massive lock ; for the house having long been vacant the wards had got rusty , as well as the whole exterior of the edifice . There we stood , gazing and gazed upon , each of us with a bundle in our hands , and behind us , six stout , nearly naked Africans , carrying the soda-fountains . We formed quite a respectable and odd-looking procession . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and given the old man his aid , the bolt yielded , and the door turned shriekingly upon its hinges . It opened into a dark , cheerless apartment , paved with large square brick , which were here and there sunken , and with bare plastered walls stained with mould . The ceiling was full sixteen feet in height , and the naked rafters were visible in all their architectural mystery . The room was about twenty feet square , contained a window twelve feet tall , and grated , looking upon the street , and a door on the back side . Not an article of furniture , not a shelf , not a board was in it . Walls and floor were alike naked and desolate . The air , too , was chilly and damp , and I felt a chill come over both my heart and body as I entered and looked around me . It was for all the world like taking possession of a prison . We looked at each other and exchanged glances of blank dismay . Never mind , ' said Fairfax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands , and can quit the old man when we choose ; so let us hang on and see him through . We shall have amusement , if nothing more . ' Come my lads , ' said the old man , rubbing his hands together , partly from chilliness and partly from excitement , stir round and open the window-shutters , and let 's try and make things look cheerful ! ' Things had need to look cheerful , for gloom and desolation dwelt there without rivalry . We opened the broken shutters and let in a broad glare of light from the sun , which only served to show more vividly the wretchedness of the place . Things will look different by and by . I have already spoken for a carpenter to come , ' said Mr. Bedrick bustling about . We shall have a counter and shelves and fixings up here in no time ! ' Is this to be the shop ? ' I asked him . Yes . There is n't a better stand in the city . It is right on the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and within five minutes ' walk of both . The barracks are on the next street round the corner , and the French , English and American Consuls live just above us half a square . The street that runs west next to us leads directly to the chief gate of the city ; and taking all in all , I consider that we shall make money yet out of our detention here . It 's an ill wind that blows no body good ! ' Here the old hypocrite , who thought he had thrown dust into our eyes so as effectually to blind us to the truth , rubbed his palms together and chuckled , and began to stir about , ordering the negroes where to set down the priceless soda-fountains , cautioning them to beware of denting them against the bricks , though the ebony fellows could not understand a word of English save Dam ! ' which they emphatically used in reply to every word he said . Here you darkies , ' said the old man , place this one under the window ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down carefully ! ' Dam , dam , dam ! ' was the reply in a loud tone ; and so we had it for a few minutes a strange chorus , for each of the half dozen seemed to try to show his superior knowledge of the English language over his fellows , by using the word oftener and louder than the rest . The old man got fairly roused and irritated , and returned their English ' with a round of oaths that would greatly have edified them had they been able fully to appreciate their meaning . They were at length paid and sent off , when Radsworth and I left the shop ' to take a cruise round the premises . We passed through the rear door into a room smaller , but similar to the front one , with dark , stuccoed walls , a brick floor , and naked rafters blacked and festooned with cobwebs . It contained a large grated window and door looking into a small court . We went into the court or patio , which was about thirty feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long grass . In the centre was a circular cistern , upon the verge of wihich we saw two green and black lizards basking in the sun . At our approach they darted down inside and concealed themselves in the crevices . Around the court were several large old earthern jars , not unlike those described in the Forty Thieves . These stood against the stuccoed walls of adjacent houses , which formed the boundaries of the court . In the walls on one side were two windows high up from the ground and grated ; they had also glass doors through which the festoon of a rich crimson curtain was visible . Another side of the court , a door was let into the wall which showed that the court could be entered from that house . On the third side was a high brick wall defended by iron spikes . On climbing up a lime tree which grew by the cistern , we overlooked it , and saw in the court beyond an old woman seated upon a door-step clad in a red petticoat with a yellow handkerchief tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrinkled only as an old Portuguese woman 's can be , and was as swarthy as an Indian 's . She saw us , and flashing her dark glittering eye at us , she shook her five fingers at us , and poured forth a volley of unintelligible jargon , which doubtless contained more curses than blessings . Having thus taken a survey of the lower ground premises , we discovered and mounted a flight of stairs which ascended to a balcony on the outside of the rear of the house . This balcony was a sort of platform boarded and protected by a strong iron rail . It was six feet broad , and made a fine promenade . From it opened four windows into the body of the house . The glass doors were shut , but only latched , and , opening one of the halves , we entered an apartment that extended the whole breadth of the rear of the house . It was very different from the one below . Its floor was of smooth boards , its walls white , and around it run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ornamented with carved work , and altogether , the room had an imposing air . It did not contain , however , an article of furniture , save the half of a cigar box . We passed through the saloon , for such it might be called , from its height and dimensions , and entered the front room over that which had been selected for the shop . ' It was half the size of the saloon , ' having but two windows fronting the street . It was a fine chamber with fine ornaments about the windows and doors ; but like the rest it was chilly and desolate . To the right of it a door led into another room the same size , which also had two windows upon the street , the two rooms taking up the whole front of the house as the saloon ' did the rear . The four windows were protected by double glass doors and barricaded ; but on opening the doors I found that the iron frame-work or grating revolved on hinges also .  --  It had a padlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubtless had often been used by some jealous Spanish husband to keep his cara esposa safe from the wiles of wandering cavaliers . The window led us upon a balcony similar to that in the rear , but with a more elegant railing around it . I stood upon it gazing up and down the narrow street , which looked like one of those I had seen in old pictures of Spanish or Italian towns . It was straight and narrow , with sidewalks only before the best houses ; and all along as far as the eye could reach were the ranges of balconies and lines of urns surmounting the battlements . From some of the windows of the balconies projected long window shades of green , yellow or scarlet striped chintz , forming a sort of roof between the windows and the sun to protect from its rays the ladies who sat within it . These presented , from their number and variety of colors , a very gay and novel appearance .  --  Indeed , all was novelty to our eyes . Every thing around us was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The faces , the costumes , the carriages , the houses , the trees , the sound of voices , the very atmosphere were different . It seemed as if we had been but yesterday in Boston and to-day wafted by some magic power into the bosom of these strange scenes . The voyage seemed as a night 's sleep  --  a vacuum  --  a long monotonous dream ! We seemed to have laid down to sleep in Boston harbor , to awake from a dream of water and winds in the Portuguese city of Monte Video ! There was no gradual transition . It was sudden and as novel as it was abrupt . Our minds were filled with wonder and curiosity ; and as we looked around us we seemed to be gazing upon some old picture which had suddenly become animate and moving with life . It must be remembered , too , that we were scarcely eighteen , an age when the heart and soul drink in novelties as the young plants the dews . The streets were thronged with people . Negroes with naked limbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ferocious mustaches predominated ; and not a few of the latter were Africans ; for it was the system of Don Pedro to enlist blacks in his armies , who made excellent troops . They are at first domestic slaves , whom he makes free on condition that they join the army for life . The poor negroes readily embrace this new bondage , believing that they are free , when it is only a new and more rigorous form of slavery . We saw passing the balcony a knot of British naval officers who had just come ashore , and also moving up and down the street were many captains of merchant vessels , and not a few tars in blue jackets and duck trowsers . Now and then we could see a rich citizen go by wrapped in his velvet cloak and displaying his jewelled fingers . There were no females save negresses , in red or yellow turbans , brass bracelets on their naked arms and ancles , and dressed in short white petticoats and some gay-colored spencer . The only vehicles were a sorry-looking cart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn by mules , some with red ribbon tied to the tips of their ears . The mules and negroes did most of the carrying . Seeing upon the roofs of the houses several persons who seemed to be enjoying the air under awnings stretched over them , we thought we would try and see if we could find a way to our roof . By going round the balcony to the other side we came to a flight of steps in the wall which led us to the roofs . It was perfectly flat and covered with a cement of fine gravel . It was spacious and enclosed by battlements three feet high , which were the continuation upward of the four external walls of the house . At the four corners were four large earthern urns , five feet in height . The area of the roof was intersected by low walls , which were the extension of the dividing walls between the rooms below , so that the roof was divided into compartments answering to those in the story underneath . In these cross walks were openings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The roofs adjacent to our own were also flat and only separated from ours by the low battlements ; and so all along the street , both up and down , we had a prospect of flat roofs , battlements and urns , a singular and picturesque scene , and one which we gazed upon with emotions novel and pleasing . CHAPTER XVI . The Cafe . Having taken a survey of the ranges of the roofs , some of which were shaded by awnings ornamented with scarlet fringes , and on others of which were both men and women walking , or gazing down into the street , we began to take a look at the city in general . Our house was in an elevated position , and commanded a wide prospect . To the east of us , over acres of urn-crowned roofs towered two massive , grey-looking towers , and close by them a huge dome . These we were told afterwards were the dome and towers of the cathedral which fronted on the main square , or Plaga Grande . In other parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , but there was visible only one dome . Some of the houses had small towers or belvideres rising above the roofs on which were flag staffs . The consulates all had them ; and we could discover flying from them the flags of several nations , and among them the beloved stars and stripes ; ' beyond the square on which the cathedral stood we caught a glimpse over the walls of the county . On the West , we saw the harbor with its fleets of vessels of war , and merchantmen of all nations riding at anchor , and in the offing two or three Brazilian cruisers under sail watching to bring into port any vessel that might be steering past for Buenos Ayres . Beyond the harbor rose , like a sugar-loaf , the green mount , which gives its name to the city . It frowned with battlements from which waved in the wind the gorgeous heraldic ensign of Brazil . The broad bosom of the sea-like river flowed beyond , dotted here and there with a gun-boat or transport going to or returning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested us was a sight of the beleaguering camp of the patriot General Llavelliga on the sloping side of the hill about four miles to the north-west from the city . It presented a long line of white tents that looked like huge drifts of snow . We did not know then what camp it was , but afterwards learned it to be that of the Buenos Ayrean General . The reader is already somewhat familiar with the military politics of the country at this period ; and need not be reminded that Buenos Ayres was now at war with Brazil for the purpose of recovering the city of Monte Video and the territory of Bonda Oriental , of which the Emperor had unjustly deprived her . The Buenos Ayreans had just commenced the war , with , however , but few resources . She had but a small fleet of schooners and gun-boats , and but one corvette of twenty guns to compete with the hundred keels which Brazil promptly anchored in the river . This little squadron was blockaded in port , but daily gathering strength and increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of talents , courage , and military experience , was appointed to command an army destined to march by land against Monte Video to lay siege to it . Llavelliga crossed the river above Colorina with a force of two thousand men , and on reaching the Bonda Oriental side called to his standard the native Quachos of the country , with whom he was very popular . The Quachos are the country people of Bonda Oriental , who subsist partly by farming , but mostly by hunting wild cattle . They are a mixture of Indian and Spanish blood , are brave , lovers of their country , free of spirit as the Arab of the desert , are admirable horsemen , and make the best cavalry in the world . Six thousand of these half-wild , independent fellows flocked to the standard of the Buenos Ayrean General . Every man was mounted upon his own horse , armed with carbine , pistols and knife , and clad in a poncha , a red blanket with a hole in the centre to admit the head and let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caparisoned with gay hangings and little bells or tinkling chains of silver . They were small , graceful , fleet and hardy animals , and seemed even to share the spirit of the rider . The Quacho wore upon his long black locks either a turban of bright colors , or a sombero with a broad brim . They were fine-looking brigandlooking men , and hated the Brazilians most cordially . With this force , in all eight thousand mounted men , Llavelliga advanced down the coast of the river La Plata , and after two days arrived in the sight of Monte Video , and pitched his tent upon the hill-side , where we saw him , and about two weeks before our arrival . There he had quietly remained , waiting for artillery , which had been slowly following his march over the level pompas . In the mean while , he had been reconnoitering the town , his mounted Quachos sometimes riding boldly up within pistol shot of the gates , firing at the sentinels , and then galloping off with the velocity of the wind shouting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strongly walled around , save at the quay , where the opening was protected by a battery of cannon .  --  All around the walls was a deep moat half-filled with water let into it from the harbor , so that , with the harbor , water entirely surrounded it . The country immediately about the walls was open without tree or building that could cover any hostile party approaching them . The walls were twenty feet thick , in some places solid , in others hollow , and used for cells to confine malefactors . The top was a level promenade defended by battlements with cannon mounted in embrasures . Sentinels were stationed upon the walls at short distances apart all round the city day and night , and every fifteen minutes called out in Portuguese , in a loud , sonorous tone , All 's well ! ' At first their noise annoyed us , but by and by we got used to it as we did to every thing else here . The city contained twenty thousand troops , one half of which were blacks , officered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or governor-general , as he was denominated , had not taken any steps towards giving the Patriot General battle before his artillery should arrive . His time was taken up in reviewing the troops in the great square , and in offering up splendid masses in the cathedral for the success of the Imperial arms , and the total discomfiture of the Patriots . Thus up to the day that we arrived in the besieged city nothing had been done to open the country ; for Llavelliga had cut off all supplies from the interior . Provisions were growing scarce in the place , and vegetables were hardly to be obtained . The troops would soon have to depend upon the cargoes in the American vessels for subsistence or make a sortie to raise the siege . Such was the state of affairs at the time of our entrance into the beleaguered city . Having in some measure gratified our curiosity by the views from the balcony and roof , we descended again to the lower floor . Here we found the old man with his coat off helping drag boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wathersfield in Connecticut , who had sot up ' there , was unloading a negro of plane , saw , and other tools , for the purpose of building a counter , and putting the shop in a shop-shape appearance . Hewitt and Radsworth were good naturedly assisting the old man , and so we stripped off our coats and all went cheerfully to work . For the next five hours , there was a busy scene of sawing , planing , nailing , and by night we had the counter up , shelves placed around it , and a bench on one side of the room . Young Bedrick placed at the window a red and yellow curtain ( second-handed ) he had bought at a stall on the quay , and Bill occupied himself in drawing nails and hanging some pictures the old man had brought for the purpose of ornamenting his soda-shops . A negro woman previously whitened the walls with white-wash , and the pictures with the curtain set off the place and gave it quite a lively and respectable air . After the shavings were cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining in with the old man in his transports of self-gratulation at the improved aspect of things . Now , my lads , when I get my bottles with the handsome labels on them ranged on the shelves , and get my counter painted imitation mahogany , and my tumblers out , and my silver tubes for the fountain , and my decanters for the syrup . I think we shall make a tempting display ! ' We had eaten our dinner at the cafe a few doors below us , and thither we went for our supper . Our days ' work had given us good appetites ; and we four as we sat at one of the tables in the long hall , did full justice to the coffee and toast and sweet-meats set before us . Such coffee we had never before tasted ! The remembrance of it at this moment makes my mouth water . It was poured into cups that held a pint , and into which had been previously put two table spoonsfull of snowy sugar . The waiter came armed with a coffee-pot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . The milk was as boiling hot as the coffee ! He began by pouring from both into the cup holding them about a foot above the cup . The two liquids mingled foaming with the sugar . He continued to pour from both equally , till the delicious nectar ran over the brim , and filled half the saucer . In this manner he filled all four of our cups . The bread was snowy white and delicious either as toast or fresh . The sweet-meats were new to us and perfectly delectable . As we eat we felt in good humor with the old gentleman , and naturally resolved that we would stick by him , and do all the service in our power till we saw him fairly set ou his legs and under full tide of success . But where are we to lodge to-night ? ' asked Hewelt , who never forgot creature comforts . I have wandered all over the old castle , roof and all , and I do n't see any thing like accommodations The old man says he has mattresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul Freelove , has offered us beds for tonight in his house , ' answered Radsworth . After we had each paid a real , ( twelve and a half cents ) for our supper we rose and passed out through the crowd of noisy , smoking , talking officers and citizens that filled the place . The jargon which they uttered was wholly unintelligible to us . Our acquisitions had been in Spanish for the Buenos Ayrean market and not in Portuguese . So our study , so far as we could now avail ourselves of its results , was quite thrown away . On our gaining the street it was just growing dark . We hastened to the shop , ' not feeling perfectly safe to be abroad after dark in such a city : for we had already heard from the carpenter an account of it that by no means led us to take a fancy to thread its streets when the sun was gone . He told us , to amuse us no doubt , that three persons had been assassinated in the last ten days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we found the old man supping on bread and herring with a glass of brandy and water to wash it down . His hopeful son Edwin was munching a cracker dipped in ginger preserves , and doing justice to a bottle of claret at sixpence the bottle . Bill was not to be found . He had doubtless gone foraging for better quarters than either the carpenter or the shop would offer him ; and , indeed , we had seen but little of him during the day ; save when occasionally he would drop in upon us with a cigar in his mouth , look round very coolly , and ask how we came on ? ' He played the gentleman to perfection , and no doubt thought we were poor taken-in-devils , who dared not say our soul was our own ! We , however , kept our own counsel , knowing very well what we were about . In a little while the carpenter came in and we accompanied him home . The house was on a retired street near the harbor . On our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called out what sounded to us like ken low ! ' but stood for quien va la ! ' who goes there ? ' Camordas , ' answered the carpenter . Pasen ! ' answered the soldier , and we passed him by turning into the middle of the street , as he would not let us walk by near where he stood . It was not so dark but that I could see he was a mulatto of huge proportions , and a ferocious aspect . We caught a glimpse of the interior of the guard-house , and saw by a lamp in it that some score of soldiers were there drinking , smoking , sleeping , and playing at cards or dominoes . Through a large arched way we got a sight of the barracks and crowds of soldiers moving about , while a deep hum of voices reached our ears . Them be the barracks , ' said Freelove in a broad nasal tone , that sounded delightfully like home-land ; there ai n't less than three thousan ' soldiers quartered in that yard . It kivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stow ' em like sheep in pens ! ' Suppose we had been passing this place alone , and had been challenged ? ' asked Hewitt . Why if you had n't answered , they would have called three times , then pulled trigger and blowed you to blazes ! ' But supposed we had answered a friend ? ' They would n't understand it . When any on ' em challenges you next time al'ays sing out as loud as they do , Camaranda . ' That means comrade or friend . You must speak pesky quick , for they do n't let much time pass between the challenges . I like to ba ' been shot by one o ' the rascals when I first came here . I was walkin ' along thinkin ' and did n't hear the first challenge  --  nor the second ; for one gets so used to hearin ' ' em by and by they do n't heed ' em . Well , the first thing I knew was bang ! ' and a bullet whistled right close to my cheek . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em to have heard me clean out to the Patriot camp . But here 's my house and shop all in one ! Let us go in , and you are welcome to the best I 've got ; though ' taint so good as it might be ! ' CHAPTER XVII . The Yankee Abroad . The habitation of the Connecticut man was , in outward appearance not dissimilar from our own , though of less height and dimensions . It had the same dingy-yellow stuccoed front , large , gatelike door , and long , narrow , grated windows . It had a flat roof , battlements and urns upon the angles . The street upon which it stood was narrow , closely built , and inhabited chiefly by artizans ; the shop being on the ground floor and the dwelling-house over it . The street was quite dark when we reached Mr. Freelove 's door , and not a lamp illumined its obscurity through its whole length .  --  Here and there , from some curtained upper window , a ray of light streamed across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attached through a hole to the latch inside . It opened into a dark passage , wide enough for a coach to enter .  --  On one side of this passage was a door that led into a room where he worked at his trade , and the other side was a similar groundfloor apartment where he kept his lumber , provisions , and wood for cooking . Passing through the paved arch we entered a small court entirely enclosed either by high brick walls or the rears of adjacent buildtngs . Several doors on two sides of the court led into small rooms , or more properly called cells , that had served the former proprietor for bed rooms for his servants : but one of them was now occupied by an old negress , who , hearing us , came hobbling out with a bit of wax candle in her hand . Ah , dat you , senor massa ! ' she said , looking at him and then at us . Who am estos jovenes ? ' Yes , it 's me , Juana ; estos caballetos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . You must have supper right off , old woman , and then shake up the two extra beds for four ! ' Saul spoke this partly in English and party in Spanish , and then kindly translating it to us , added ,  --  I and Jenny here get along , between us , first rate . She-speaks a little English , I a little Spanish , and between us make out to understand each other . ' I thought Portuguese was spoken here instead of Spanish , ' I remarked . So it is , since the Brazilians have been in possession ; but before they came , Spanish was the language . Old Jenny was slave to a Spanish family that escaped , and she speaks only Spanish ; and I learned all I know here afore the Portuguese took possession . You ca n't get Jenny to speak a syllable of Portugee ; she 'd have her head taken off first . But come , now , let 's go up stairs . ' With these words he led the way with a light the negress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outside of the building to a piazza projecting from the second story . We entered a large room , furnished with chairs , a table , book-case , and clothes-press , all of his own make , be informed us . The walls were hung with three or four pictures in mahogany frames , one the head of Washington , another the representation of the battle of Bunker 's Hill , a third the victory of Perry on Lake Erie . The floor was covered with straw matting , and the whole apartment had as great an air of comfort as could be well obtained in one of those old castellated Spanish houses . Now , my friends , ' said the worthy carpenter , as he placed the light upon the table , you see where I live and jist make yerselves to hum . Things ai n't here so nice as they be in the States . for the Spanish do n't know now to live But one soon gets used to their ways , though he 'll never forget his own . I see one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in my bed-room to hum , when I was a little boy , and I brought them out here to keep the old place in memory . I 'm as glad to see you as if you were my own kith or kin . It does my soul good to see any body , if it be the meanest feller on airth that sails from Yankee land . There is a chap that used to be a reg'lar loafer in Weathersfield and nobody 'd ever speak to the critter , he was so low in character and habits . Well , he was finally driven to sea , and his vessel put in here . I was going up to the cathedral square one day when I met him and knew him . The sight of the mean feller made my heart boil right over with affection for him ; for somehow I saw all Weathersfield in him . I shook his hand as if he had been my father , invited him home to dinner , talked with him all about everybody , and when he went away I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did me so much good to see and talk gab with him about the old place and people . Now , after supper , we 'll have a talk about New England ; and though none on you do n't come from ' Necticut , you 're jist as welcome . Railly it is a sight jist to look on your fresh , young faces that look jist like them to hum , ' specially after lookin at none but dark people so long . I 've been here in this country seven years , and I feel a yearnin once more to eat some pumpkin pie and spiced dough-nuts . I think sometimes if I had a drink of new cider I 'd be willing to give fifty dollars for it . Then there 's the onions and the turnips , and fresh pork , and apples and mince pies , and Thanksgiving days , the huskings , the sleigh rides , the skating , the courting , the singing-schools  --  darnation ! I shall go right off the handle if I think on ' em any more ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times at hum eenamost makes me crazy . Come along here with supper , Jenny ! ' You mean to go back sometime ? ' I asked . I guess I do . If I died here afore I went back to New England , my bones would n't lay still !  --  they 'd be stealing aboard some home-bound ship and hiding in the hold till she reached Yankee land ! I do n't mean to die here , and that 's the reason I am alive and hearty now , coz when I 've been taken down I 've swore hard that I war n't goin to and would'nt give up the ghost here ! So no sickness could get a good hold on me ! ' Ca n't you make pumpkin pies and spiced dough-cakes here ! ' all at once asked Hewitt , who had been soberly ruminating upon this subject ever since Saul had mentioned it . You might just as well try to make Old Hundred out of Yankee Doodle . I tried it once , but I could n't find a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan ; and as to pumkin pies , I haint seen a pumpkin since I 've been here . I tried to make a pie out of plantains out it war n't genuwine pumpkin and that makes all the difference . ' So it does ! So it must ! ' gravely responded Hewitt . What do the people eat here ? ' Well , they eat fixins . Garlic goes into everything they cook .  --  They never saw a roast trukey or boiled chicken , nor a round o ' beef . Every thing is hashed and fricasseed and garliced to death . They never seed a pie and I do n't believe know what baked beans is ! How my mouth waters when I think o ' baked beans and Indian pudding , what used to be our Sunday dinner to hum ! Sunday ! Bless you ! there ai n't no sich a thing as Sunday here , and how should they know anything about baked beans ! I hai n't been to meetin since I 've been here ! They have mass , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troops and have sham-fights , bulf-fights , theatre shows and parties ; and all the niggers dance fandango on open ground by the walls . I read my bible through reg'lar once a year , sing Old Hundred and Mears every Sunday night , read a sermon , and sometimes make a long prayer . So I am meetin ' minister , and congregation all to myself ! Did you ever see one of the priests here ?  --  But here comes that lazy critter , Jenny , with the waiter . ' As he spoke the black woman , who wore a faded yellow turban on her head , gold rings in her ears , a brass circlet on her left arm , a blue woollen petticoat , with a pair of huge , black , splay feet projecting half knee high from beneath , made her appearance . In her hands she bore a large , wooden tray , dark and polished with grease , upon which was a coffee-pot , a milk-pot of boiling milk , cups and saucers , sugar-bowl , and a huge plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cranberries . The whole looked very inviting . She spread a snow-white napkin upon a table which Saul and I placed in the middle of the apartment , and arranged the plates with great neatness . She then poured out the coffee and milk together , as we had seen it done in the restauraut . Come , my friends , let us take seats to the table , ' said Saul . We drew our chairs around it , and Saul paused and looked around upon us . Do n't you think , ' said he , with an emotion in his frank countenance that moved us to respect , do n't you think that when I look round and see so many home-land faces , that I feel for all the world as if I ought to ask a blesssing . My father always did : and this occasion makes me feel like old times . ' We should like to have you , ' said Hewitt , respectfully and reverently bending his head . Then I will ; for the sight of you all and the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The carpenter then folded his hands together and closed his eyes , and asked a blessing with a solemnity that commanded even the silent attention of the old negress . We all did justice to the supper ; at intervals of eating listening to our host 's account of the people of the place , the state of things , and some advice as to our proceedings in a town which was not only filled with troops but beseiged from without . You must be quiet and mind your own business , ' said he . If you are challenged by a sentinel , as you will be at every corner and sometimes every ten rods , answer quick and say amigo ' or carmorado . ' If a soldier wo n't make way for you to pass quietly , walk around him , as any Yankee independence might give you a bayonet through your body  --  for thev 'd as lief kill a man as a dog , darn their skins !  --  or a lock up for a month in the calaboose ; and if you once see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord 's prayer and hang yourself . It 's full o ' robbers , murderers and cut-throats , thieves , prisoners of war , niggers and devils , and all in one large stone room , as long and high as our Weathersfield meetin has ! If you see the Governor-General and his suit riding along , touch your hat to ' em , and keep out of the way of their horses heels , for they 'll not pull rein to keep from running over any body . Do n't quarrel with any body that wears a sword or uniform , or you 'll get the worst of it . Keep your own tougues in your heads and do n't talk politics ; lor , being Yankees , you will , of course , take the side of the Patriots outside , and if you are overheard you will be arrested . ' But can they know what we say , as we do n't speak their language ? ' asked Hewitt . There are plenty of spies about that understand both languages .  --  Do n't trust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Host going by and do n't want to kneel to it , why just step in some shop door or take off your hat . If you keep it on you 'll be bayoneted as sure as deth . I liked to have been once ! ' How was that ? ' we asked with interest . I had just made a small table for the Consul , and was carrying it to his house , when the Host came full upon me down a cross street .  --  Everybody dropped right down upon their knees in the mud or on the pavement , and began to eross themselves . The Host came on through the middle of the street with its gilded banners , its canopy sapported by four priests , and a whole procession of monks . A platoo of soldiers marched afore them with fixed bayonets to clear the way . I stood my table down and kind of leaned over it , for I 'd never kneel to the beast of Babylon . Wall , I forgot to take off my hat and was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and catching the hat on its point . I made a grab at it and got it , when another bayonet was launched at my breast . I should ha ' been run through if I had n't caught up the table and caught the point . The bayonet went into it an inch and broke off short . The Consul has the table now , saying , he 'd rather it as it is than have a new one made ! ' What an escape ! ' responded Hewitt . Why , it 's as much as a man 's life is worth to live in such a place ! ' Yes it is ; but only just be on the look-out and you 'll get along pretty well . ' I wonder you are living now , ' said Radsworth . You must make money to stay here , Mr. Freelove ! ' Yes . I have laid up pretty well . I 've cleared the matter ' of twelve hundred dollars a-year . I calk'late I shall take home with me ten thousand dollars next spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make first-rate pumpkin-pies and nut-cakes , and buy a farm and live there till I die . ' We then beguiled the evening talking , and gaining no little information from our host , when at length we were startled by the heavy report of a cannon , followed instantaneously by a swell of instrumental music . That 's the eight o'clock gun in the square . Nobody goes out after this hour without a pass from the captain-general . That music is the governor 's band . It plays every night an hour before the palace , and I 'll do them justice to say , that they have good music here and no mistake . There 's upwards of seventy instruments in the band ! Jist hear ' em ! They are a third of a mile off from us , and yet it sounds as if it was in the air right over our heads !  --  Some evening we will get a pass and go up to the Grand Square and hear ' em ! ' We opened the windows and listened with delight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine airs in the most masterly styleSuch music neither of us had ever before heard . At nine o'clock it ceased ; the city became still , save the challenges and calls of the sentries , which were heard almost every ten minutes , and had a singular effect to our unaccustomed ears . Now , my friends , I 'll show you to your beds , ' said Saul taking up the light and passing into the next room . CHAPTER XVIII . The Night 's Lodging . The apartments into which our kind entertainer conducted us were in an ell on the same floor with the room we had taken supper in.  --  To go to the rooms we had to walk along a balcony from which doors opened into them . From this balcony steps led down into the yard . You see , these bed-rooms are small and do n't look very inviting , but Spanish houses al'ays look like prisons , and you ca n't make ' em look any other way , ' said Saul as he placed the light upon a niche in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little image when he came , left by former occupants . There was no window in either of the rooms , which communicated by a door . A chair , table and wooden bedstead covered with a mattrass comprised all the furniture . Things ai n't so nice as you 've been accustomed to to hnm , I guess ; but as you 've been sleepin ' so many weeks in a ship , I guess you 'll think any lodging a shure fit for the President , as I did ! Well , good night . You wo n't want many bed-clothes coz the nights is ' mazin ' hot , and I rayther guess you 'll be glad to keep your doors open . You can blow out the candle or keep it burning , and talk as long as you want to . You see it 's a wax one . They do n't burn nothin ' else here . I ca n't find a taller candle in the whole city . Every nigger burns wax , and when you go into the Cathedral you 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fourth o ' July flag staff ! ' The good fellow then bade us again good night , and left us together all in one room . We seated ourselves upon the bedside a few moments and then began to talk over the events of the day . We , however , soon grew sleepy and paired off to bed , Hewitt and Radsworth taking the one in the next room and Fairfax and I the one in the room in which we were . I opened the door after taking off my coat and vest and stepped out upon the balcony ; for the night was close and oppressive . It was a clear star-light atmosphere I gazed upon the heavens and tried to recognize stars that I had seen at home . But I was beneath new constellations . The North Star , the Great Bear were far northward below the Equator . The Sword of Orion was just visible close to the northern horizon . The Southern Cross , the Harp , and the Magellan clouds were above me . I gazed on the latter with curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , never setting . They are three in number , forming the three angles of our equilateral triangle . Two are of a whity , cloud-like appearance , and the third is black to the eye , being so much darker than the blue depths of the sky as to be strongly relieved against it . They are called the Magellan clouds from being vertical to the Straits of Magellan . At Montevideo , which is nearly in latitude 35 South , they were almost in the zenith . I had not then heard of Synime 's Theory , which indeed was not then published . He accounts for these clouds in the following manner ; and as it is the only satisfactory one I have ever seen , I give it as I heard it from his own lips so me years subsequently . The earth being open at the poles has a verge which intersects Magellan on one side and Van Dieman 's land on the other side of it . A person at the Straits of Magellan looking across this verge or shadowy chasm of five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . He will not , however , see it on a level with his eye , but it will be thrown by refraction so as to appear at the zenith ! In a word , he sees it distinctly overhead ; and it revolves with the earth always seen overhead , as well at sunset as just before dawn . It is plainly to his eye a part of the globe . Now the map will show you that the two southwest points of New Holland and Van Dieman 's land if seen across a school globe depressed or sunken in as above , will form a triangular aspect to the eye , Van Dieman 's land being within the verge , and beyond the sun 's rays is in shadow and looks dark , while the two great capes of New Holland being in the sun-light appear white . This is Synime 's theory ; and is recorded here by me for what it is worth . It certainly is the only plausible explanation ever offered for the simultaneous revolution of this phenomenon with that of the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balcony , was invaded not only by the hoarse cries of the sentinels , stationed in all parts of the city , but by a confused howling and barking of countless dogs .  --  Such a yelping never before assailed my ears . It seemed to me that there must have been at Montevideo one dog to every biped , and subsequent observation led me to believe that there were seven to every human being . At length I bade the night good night , ' and entered my little room to go to sleep . I threw myself upon the bed along side of Fairfax , who was sound asleep . From the adjacent room I could , however , hear mutterings not loud but deep , from Hewitt , and an occasional exclamation of impatience and anger from Radsworth . I was not long left in ignorance of the cause . I had not been five minutes in bed when I found myself covered with animals I had but little knowledge of before . An army of fleas had taken possession of me . In a moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scratched desperately , but at length anable longer to endure the intolerable itching inflammation produced in every pore of my skin by their bites , I leaped from the bed and seizing the light , examined the mattrass . They literally swarmed hopping over it , and one fairly hopped into my eye . I was appalled . I rushed out upon the balcony in my shirt and shook myself , while every nail of my ten fingers was coursing over my body with ceaseless industry . My cuticle was all on fire . I was nearly wild with the fever and inflammation . I ran down stairs into the yard where I had seen a cistern , and without more ado I sprang for it to bury myself up to my neck . It contained no water . I stumbled over a bucket in one corner of the court . It seemed filled with water . I took it up and poured it over my naked body . Such a stench as rose from it I never encountered . What it was I know not to this hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coals of fire Exposure to the air brought on the itching worse than ever . I fairly howled in concert with the dogs in the street . I was goaded to madness . The pavement of the court I soon found swarmed with fleas , and they bit my feet and ancles . I danced and for relief rolled in a heap of shavings . While I was indulging in this amusement , down came Hewitt . I ca n't stand this , no how ! ' he cried . What the deuce is that in the shavings ? ' It 's I ! ' I answered savagely . Have they driven you out ? ' I am devoured ! My skin is covered with nettles ! I had as lief sleep on a bed of cowitch ! For gracious sake tell me where there is water , ' he cried as he found none in the cistern . I could not tell him . he raced round the court in his shirt like a madman . Finally he found a brick-bat and began to rub himself down with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Radsworth soon came out on the balcony , and seeing us in the court , for the stars gave considerable light he hurried down and called for water in the name of mercy . But I will not attempt to portray the horrors of this our first night in Montevideo . I shall never forget it to my dying day . We wished for day which seemed as if it would never come to our relief . At length the dawn broke and we dressed ourselves , our skins fairly streaked with blood . As the sun rose the itching subsided ; for the bites of fleas cease to annoy after day-break ; and fortunate it was for us it is so . Fairfax had slept the night out without being awakened , but the spot where he lay was dappled with blood that had been drawn from him . We tried to find the fleas by daylight , but not a villian of them all was visible . Where they had hid themselves we ceuld not divine . At length our host made his appearance . He found us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his domicil . You are up early ! How did you sleep my friends ? ' he asked very kindly . Sleep , sir , ' said Hewitt answering for the rest . Not a wink have we had the past night . We do n't wish to say anything against your lodgings , Mr. Freelove , but we were too many in a bed ! The fleas fairly drove us out ! ' Fleas ! Them is the nat'ral production of the country . So you did n't get any sleep for ' em , ' he said laughing . Wall , I know how to feel for ye ; but you 'll soon get used to ' em ! I dare say they did put into ye some last night , coz they do n't often get sich sweet pumpkin flesh as yourn . You do looked streaked a bit ! ' We were bitten to death , ' I answered . We might as well have slept in a beehive ! ' Wall , I 'm plaguey sorry ; but it 's the country and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have to get me a whole skin of India-rubber half an inch thick . But I got used to it after a while .  --  Fleas ' ll never bite a man twice in the same spot , never . But when you 've got bit all over once nice you need n't fear ' em . They do n't trouble the natives a bit coz there 's no fresh places on ' em to bite ; but strangers do suffer some till they get fairly ' noculated . They do n't bite me now coz they 've put their proboscises into every tarnal pore of my skin ! ' I do n't think then I shall be bitten again , ' said I , for I do n't think there is a fiesh place left on me ! ' We are certainly comforted by what Mr. Freelove says , ' said Hewitt gravely , with his habitual twitching of the nose . Are they as bad in other houses ? ' I do n't calculate there 's any difference to speak on . Fleas is as natural to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  But you 've got through the worst of it . Come let 's go down and see what Jenny 's got for breakfast . ' I lingered a moment to take a sun-rise view of the surrounding country . Not far from me rose the gloomy walls of the calaboose , and behind it stretched a long range of the battlemented walls on which sentries were walking . Beyond I could discern the naked country , destitute of tree or house for a mile outside the walls ; but farther off I saw pleasant villas in the midst of groves and gardens , and farther still a white church with a hamlet at its feet , and still farther the white tents of the Buenos Ayrean army . Here and there along the open ways I could detect parties of horsemen galloping at full speed , their sabres flashing in the sun . The sound of the morning gun had already ceased echoing from the castle on the Mount on the opposite side of the harbor , and the bells of the cathedral were ringing still their loud call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military music , and life and activity had taken the place of the dreadful night we had passed . A slight breeze fanned my temples and invigorated me , and following the rest below I soon gave evidence that my want of sleep had not destroyed my appetite . We had an excellent breakfast , delicious coffee , hot rolls , beef-steak and roasted yams . After breakfast we sallied forth to seek out our Merchant , ' and learn how he and his hopeful sons had passed the night . We did not leave Mr. Freelove 's hospitable roof , however , without returning him our thanks for his kindness ; and as we knew he would feel offended if we offered him pay , each of us , in the course of the day , made him a present of a book , which we saw pleased him more than a doubloon would have . The streets presented a lively appearance , At every step we saw something to attract our curiosity . We met a regiment of black troops in scarlet coats and white trousers marching to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of officers grouped about the doors of the cafes , or opposite the quarters of their generals . These officers were mostly young men , many of them strikingly handsome and wearing mustaches . Their uniforms were very splendid . Some of their frock coats were covered with silk and gold embroidery . I noticed a very beautiful boy of fifteen , who wore a uniform perfectly gorgeous , and at the same time graceful . I afterwards learned he was a Colonel . His father was a duke . Indeed most of the officers were nobles.  --  Now and then we beheld a war-worn warrior , his face scarred , or an arm or leg lacking , and features hid in enormous mustaches . For hair on the face the negro soldiers took the palm . Some that we saw showed only their glittering eyes through a mass of hair . They looked like bears doing military duty . At every corner we were challenged by a sentry . We responded Comarada , ' and passed on unmolested . Hewitt , however , came near being beyoneted just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spokesman , as he wanted to speak at least one word of a foreign language . He was challenged just as he went ahead of us.  --  His answer was Caramba ! ' This is a word that is constantly in every Spaniard 's or Portuguese mouth , and is an exclamation of surprise equivalent to The devil ! ' or Indeed ! ' Is it so ? ' &c.; &c.; Hewitt mistook it for Comarada , comrade , ' and thundered it out . The soldier looked at him with angry surprise , brought his bayonet to the charge and challenged again . Hewitt found he was wrong and yelled out St. Jago , ' for Amigo , ' friend , the word he wanted . The soldier rushed upon him with his levelled bayonet , and Hewitt turned and run . I could not help laughing , serious as the affair was , for the soldiers had orders to shoot down every person that did not respond properly to the challenge . Amigo , ' I cried , springing forward and laying my hand on the soldier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I said in my best Spanish . He understood me , and with an oath returned to his post . From this moment I was dubbed interpreter of our party ; for I had spoken Spanish and so well that I was understood by a Portuguese . It is true I had paid very close attention to the language on the voyage and had committed to memory several hundred phrases . One of these I now found useful , and gaining confidence from this success I resolved to speak Spanish at every opportunity , even to Portuguese ; the two languages being so analagous that the citizens of the two countries find little difficulty in understanding one another . At length we reached our shop . ' CHAPTER XIX . The Arrest . When we entered the shop ' we found the old gentleman busy at work preparing to charge his soda-fountains . He looked as bright as a lark and seemed to be in fine spirits . Ah , good morning , boys , ' he said . I am glad you 've come . You should keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . We have enough to keep us all busy . A dozen gentlemen have already called in to get a glass of soda . I am losing ten dollars clear every hour the soda is delayed ! ' Hope you slept well last night , sir ? ' said Hewitt dryly , though he had five minutes before privately expressed to us the wish that the fleas had flayed him . Have n't had such a night 's rest since I left Boston ! ' Confound his tough old hide , ' said Hewitt aside to us . He has the cuticle of a rhinoceros . But here comes Ned . He looks pale enough . How did you sleep , sir ? ' asked Hewitt gravely . Sleep ! I liked to have been eaten up . I never knew the like .  --  The fleas in this country have bills like forceps . I walked the roof all night , ' and he twisted up his face till it seemed as if the rim of his spectacles twisted too . Did you have any fleas where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered Radsworth . Come boys , do n't talk but work . We must have every thing ready by noon . I mean to charge two of the fountains and set ' em up ready to sell from by twelve o'clock . ' By twelve o'clock , for we went cheerfully to work to help him , we had the fountains ready , the pipes screwed , the syrups and tumblers all set out upon the counter , and everything put in apple-pie order . Ned had cut out of blue and yellow paper a scolloped border for each shelf which he had nailed on , and had suspended paper festoons around the window and over the pictures that hung upon the walls . The whole interior had quite a respectable and inviting look . As I had some skill in lettering it fell to me to paint in red letters on a blue ground upon small boards the signs of the establishment . I had them both ready by two o'clock and stuck out on either side of the door . As signs in Montevideo are hardly known , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done in Spanish , the other in English . They read as follows :  --  Agna de Soda . ' Soda-water . ' The charge of one of the fountains was given to Hewitt , and the other I took ; for the affair had got to be for us by this time quite amusing , and a joke that we took no little pleasure in carrying through . Doubtless the old gentleman thought all this while that he had four very precious docile fools to deal with . But our time came by and by . We let him have his now . In a few minutes the room was filled with customers . English and American naval officers , sea-captains of all nations , and Brazilian officers of both services . We could hardly draw fast enough for the thirsty crowd . The quarters of dollars poured in upon us as fast as the old man could gather them up . It was a new thing . Many of them , particularly the natives had never seen soda before . Its sparkling coolness was refreshing . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I drew four tumblers for one fierce Brazilian naval captain , in succession , for which he threw down a Spanish dollar .  --  Old Bedrick was in raptures at this wonderful success . The sweat poured down his cheeks with excitement . All day the demand contioned with but little abatement . The old man charged his fountains four times . Hewitt and I were relieved by Fairtax and Radsworth , and sometimes Edwin would condescend to draw a glass for a customer . It was a hard day 's work . We were glad when it became night ; for then all places of business closed , save three or four cafes kept open by special license from the Governor . We closed our shop and went up stairs to supper , where also we had dined . Bedrick having commissioned William , his son , to cater , and look after these matters . To do Bill justice he-did his duty by us . He got the beds up , the parlor ' ( I mean the large saloon ) furnished with furniture brought out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He proved himself a good house-keeper , and when we went up stairs at the close of the day 's work , ( which had brought the old man in two hundred and thirty-seven dollars , ) we found a nice supper set out for us , and every thing in the bed-room looking quite comfortable , ' The walls to be sure were bare , and the floors brick , and every thing had a prison-like look from the peculiar structure of the mansion ; but things were so much better than we looked for that we were quite pleased . The old gentleman had grown so rich in one day that he had no appetite to eat . He had put all his money in a shot bag , and it lay by his plate . He looked more like eating its contents than those of his plate and cup . A wax candle stood in the centre of the table , and we seven sat around it , and made , I must say , a very merry supper . We were all in the best of humors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him as a father , but resolved to run away from him , nevertheless , the first good opportunity . That night we slept better ; for I had taken the precaution to elevate my mattrass upon the table , while the rest slept upon the roof or upon boards laid from the window to a bench . The old man , between joy , and dollars and fleas , did not get a wink 's sleep . I heard him up half the night , and always heard at the same time the clink of silver . I dare say he passed the night counting his gains and killing fleas . I do not say the fleas did not trouble me . They were few , however , compared with those that made my acquaintance the night preceding . I do not think I was bitten by more than a hundred and fifty on this second trial of sleep vs. fleas . Affairs went on swimmingly for several days . The soda was a great card in the town , and took well . The receipts , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for many then came in to taste it who never came a second time . Our custom , therefore , settled down into a certain number that imbibed it as a luxury . The old gentleman was shrewd . When he found the soda palled , he added Port wine to their glasses , and so introduced the soda-sangaree to the Brazilian palate . At other times he added coniac . The latter took admirably , and in a few days the simple soda was rarely called for . We however did well , and as the old gentleman had two other fountains , he resolved to hire a shop at the other extremity of the city near the gate , and place in charge of it , Fairfax and Radsworth , with his son Edwin to oversee . He therefore , made a selection , hired a room at the corner of two frequented streets within sight of the principal gate , and not more than a hundred rods from it . To this place he removed the two soda fountains , and having employed our friend Freelove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no objections to taking charge ; for it was our policy to live on the old gentleman as long as we found it for our interest , looking round us in the meanwhile for some opportunity of bettering our condition . We were not a little mortified at times on finding ourselves treated coolly as inferiors , by young officers , both English and American , who came into our shops , when , forgetting that we were bar-tenders ' we presumed upon our birth and education and respectability at home , to converse freely with them . We , however , pocketed the slight , knowing that we were only playing at soda-shop for the time being . After we had been a fortnight in Montevideo , both shops were in full blast with their four fountains . The old man now passed his time in making the soda and trotting between his two shops , which were about half a mile apart . He took upon an average one hundred and fifty dollars a day in both places together . We lived in the rooms over the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then got matters in full tide of success began to play the petty tyrant . He compelled us to rise at daybreak , and follow him to market with baskets like servants . This we had to do , or else break out into open rebellion before the time was ripe . He wanted to make us wash for the family , ' two at a time each week , and also to act as cook by turn . We positively refused to do any other washing than our own , but consented after some parleying to cook . He would have compelled us to make the beds and keep the house clean , but we told him we would not , and that he must hire a black woman . Finally , he consented to do so , but as she could not speak English nor he Portuguese , they quarrelled a dozen times the first day in their own dialect , and at night the old man kicked her out of the house . Half an hour afterwards we were at supper , when four black soldiers headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in silence . The old black woman hobbled in in their rear . That is the old man , ' she said in Portuguese , pointing fiercely at our merchant , ' who became very pale , while we looked on dismayed . You owe this woman two dollars for her day 's work , ' said the sergeant sternly in Portuguese ; pay her or come with me to prison ! ' What is that he says ? ' asked the old man looking at his son for an interpretation . Ned interpreted as much as he understood and I what I comprehended , and so made it clear . I do n't owe her a cent ! She lies ! She undid every thing I told her to do , I wo n't pay her ! ' Que dice el caballero ? ' asked the sergeant turning to me and addressing me in Spanish . He says , ' I answered after a moment 's reflection upon what Spanish I had learned , he says that he do n't owe her anything ! ' Then he must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired the old man . That you must go to the calaboose ! ' You had best pay her father , ' said Ned as white as a sheet . It 's robbery , downright robbery , ' cried the avaricious old man taking two dollars from his waistcoat pocket , and throwing them at the woman 's head . She grinned and picked them up and was going off , when the sergeant called her and compelled her to relinqnish to him one of the dollars , which she did with very ill grace . The whole party then left us to ourselves . The old man are no more supper . He did not like this summary way of administering justice at all . He abused the city , the soldiers , the government , and every negro woman in general , and this one in particular . Our friend , the carpenter , soon came in and turned the tide . He said he had obtained a pass for us to be out till ten o'clock , and that if we chose to go with him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the Governor 's band before the palace , and visit some of the saloons and cafes , and show us something of the city . The old man would have prevented our going , but without paying him any attention we sallied out , each armed with a stout cudgel , and some of us with daggers . Although we had been a fortnight in the city we had seen very little of it , so closely had we been kept in our shops ; once in a while , only , could we get half an hour to ramble through the streets . Evenings we dared not venture forth on account of the strict military police .  --  The most we saw of the city was mornings going to and from market . At such times we were entertained with a variety of novel and interesting objects . The streets , at that hour , were filled with negroes , the men nearly naked , and the women in gay petticoats and flashy turbans . The dogs , too , that we encountered were innumerable . Their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acted like gaunt wolves or starved hyenas . They would sometimes assemble in scores in the middle of the street , or by the side of an old wall growling , snarling , and fighting savagely over carrion . They turned aside for no one . Not even horses galloping past could move them . They would show their sharp , white fangs , and snap at the horse 's legs .  --  These animals always sheered from them with fear . We were told by Freelove that when very hungry they will attack negroes carrying marketing and if he defends it , it is at the risk of being torn in pieces .  --  He said , also , that he saw a wounded man who had been stabbed and was running from his murderers pursued by a pack of these dogs , who getting the scent of blood , took up the hue and cry , overtook him , leaped upon him , bore him to the ground and literally tore him in pieces and devoured him . We saw these dogs in hundreds about the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cautions sitting in groups of twenty or thirty at a little distance waiting to pounce upon the offals after the marketing was over . I am puzzled to tell which we dreaded most , the dogs or the soldiers . The latter were lawless , wanton and cruel . They knew that any act of aggression against the citizens would be overlooked by their superiors , and they were always ready to insult . That so few outrages were committed by them is surprising , when they were at liberty to run any body through the body they chose . The market stalls were occupied wholly by black women . Among them and the numerous individuals of the race I encountered in the city , which is as full of negroes as it is of dogs or of soldiers , I saw for the first time the pure Afric slave speaking his own jargon with his fellow . They were nearly naked , of a shining black , their breasts and faces tatooed , and the feature excessively ugly and brutal . It is worthy of remark how soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw one day at work upon the mole about thirty blacks , strong , athletic fellows with only a piece of white cotton about their loins , which , I was told , had only been landed seven weeks from Africa . They were unloading a Brazilian brig , and seemed as docile and laborious as those who were born slaves . You can tell the newly imported slave by his nakedness , and also more truly by a certain Indianlike wildness in his eye and movements . Most of the slaves wore amulets about their necks , beads , bones , sharks ' teeth , brass or copper rings , which also encircle their wrists and depend from their ears .  --  Those who are Catholic christians add crosses . I have seen several with iron collars rivetted ( for life ) on their necks by their masters . I have seen them with their backs striped like the hide of the zebra with the welts of the lash . They are seemingly , withal , a mirthful race , especially the females , who are ever chattering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got into the street we took our way , under the guidance of Saul , in the direction of the grand square . The night was not dark , a new moon giving us its light . The shops and stores were all closed , save here and there a pulperio ' or grocery on the corner , the proprietor of which had license to keep open until the gun fired . The outside of the houses as we passed along were , therefore , on the ground story , silent and dark , wearing that gloomy aspect peculiar to all Spanish towns . Every door seemed rather the inlet to a prison than a house or shop . The shops indeed were large desolate-looking places , unenlivened by the showy windows and display of goods that render them , in Northern cities , so attractive to the eye . The Spanish dry-goods dealer does not hang his goods about his door , and as he has no sign , it is difficult to distinguish the stores from dwellings until you are in the door . The second stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first floor . The windows always open upon balconies , and are shaded by gay-colored awnings , some of them very beautifully fringed . The ladies sit at them to gaze down upon the street and form attractive objects for the eye of the passer-by . As we now passed along , lights streamed across the streets from nearly all the second story windows , which were open and through which we could hear talking , laughing , and the sound of the piano , and often the notes of the guitar , accompanied by rich female voices , mingled with manly tones . The crimson , orange , or blue drapery of the long windows , lighted up by the candles from the parlors within , gave the whole street a brilliant appearance . We often stopped to listen to the mirthful laughter of the young girls and the melody of the guitar . At one house , beneath the balcony , we saw an officer wrapped in a cloak , who was thrumming a guitar , while from the balcony two ladies bent over listening . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did more to make us realize that we were in a foreign country than anything else . We could not see the faces of the ladies , but presume they were young and handsome Saul told us that a rich Brazilian merchant lived there , who had three handsome daughters , and that somebody or other was always playing the guitar to them .  --  We all felt a great desire to see and become acquainted with these Brazilian beauties ; but our aspirations somewhat fell when we recollected that we were no longer young gentlemen ' upon a par with good society , but merely soda-shop boys  --  bar-tenders ! This reflection made me , at least , resolve that I would soon change my position and prospects in society . At the pulperias , ' on the street corners , we passed groups of soldiers , mostly black , lounging about the steps , or else inside , playing dominoes  --  a favorite game with all classes  --  cards , drinking or smoking They did not molest us , though they did not move aside to let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . On our way we passed the residence of the English Consul . It was brilliantly lighted up , end the sounds of music and dancing met our ears , while figures moving in the graceful waltz flitted past the window . This is the English Consulate , ' said Saul . He gives a party to all the English , French , and American officers and citizens . ' I should like to have had an invitation , ' said Fairfax . I see there dancing two or three American midshipmen much younger than I am . ' You wo n't be likely to get invited to such parties , I calculate , ' answered Saul , dryly . It 's only the distinguished folks and respectable citizens . When you get invitations to the great parties here , I guess they 'll invite me too ! Folks are mighty nice here who they invite . I guess if any of them English or ' Merican officers should see you in there and remember you sold them soda-water , they would give the cold shoulder and perhaps ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' This rejoinder of Paul 's stung me as well as my companions to the quick . It revealed to us out true position . We saw that we were sacrificing our respectability , ' as the world calls it , by remaining with Mr. Bedrick . We saw that we were looked upon , not with reference to our true position as members of families of respectability at home , but merely as shop-boys , bar-tenders in Monte Video , just as we should regard others whom we saw in our situation . Our pride was touched . We said nothing then ; but each one mentally resolved , as we found , on comparing sensations afterwards , on immediately quitting the old man and trust to fortune for something else to do . To remain as shop-boys , we felt would he a bar ( without a pun ) to our obtaining situations in respectable mercantile houses . Our minds were at once made up , as with gloomy and bitter feelings we left the gay scene behind , from which we were excluded , wholly from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was in the lowest class of pursuits We soon reached the Grande Plaza or Square , and as the Band entered it from the barracks at the same moment we did , our attention was drawn off from ourselves to the scene around us . The square was a large area , having on one side the Cathedral , on another the Governor 's palace , and the public offices , halls of justice , &c.,; on the remaining sides . The buildings thus surrounding it were of grand proportions , and being built in the massive style of Morisco-Spanish architecture were imposing to the eye . The palace was directly in front of us ; and being lighted up by numerous torches , held in the hands of soldiers stationed before it , presented a striking appearance . Its masses of light and shadow had a fine effect . The band escorted by a detachment of the imperial guard , after marching along , by tap of drum two sides of the square , drew up before the palace . In a moment afterwards the Cathedral clock tolled eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was discharged , the explosion shaking the very ground upon which we stood . At the same instant the Band struck up a brilliant national air , and for a time the whole universe seemed to my senses filled , swelling , crashing with music . We listened for an hour to a great variety of pieces , marches , waltzes and even dirges . At nine they ceased playing , another gun was fired , the Band wheeled into column , and escorted by the Guard , marched across the square at a lively air played upon the drum and pipe , and soon disappeared in the street leading to their barracks .  --  The torches were extinguished , and in ten minutes silence reigned over the square . A few of the windows of the place were lighted , and from the interior of the Cathedral a faint glimmer like twilight was perceptible . Have you been in the Cathedral ? ' asked Saul . We replied in the negative . He then proposed that we should enter and see it by night , for it had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , made a man feel as if his soul was in a nut-shell . ' We crossed the square in a body , arm in arm , Saul going in advance a step or two . When we came to the entrance of the dark , towering mass , we were challenged by a sentinel , who was concealed in the shadow of a butress . His Quien va la ? ' was the only intimation of his presence . Amigos , ' answered Saul in Spanish ; for he had such an extreme dislike of the Portuguese invaders that he would not speak their language . Let me see your pass , senor ? ' demanded the soldier , in harsh Portuguese . Saul held it out to him . The man opened a small dark lantern which was hung at his belt and examining it , said , Bon ! ' and stood aside to let us pass on where we chose . We entered the church through a vast entrance wrapped in darkness , our way guided only by the distant glimmer of seven wax candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced deeper into the vast pile  --  vast to our ideas who were conversant only with New England meeting-houses  --  were solemn and tinged with awe . The light of the candles only lighted up the altar , with its gold and silver vessels , its gorgeous apparatus of a gorgeous worship . The nave and extremities of the Cathedral were buried in profound darkness , in which the twilight that prevailed near the altar was lost . We could behold neither the roof nor the sides . It seemed like looking off and upward into infinite darkness . Saul and the rest passed slowly on , with their hats carried reverently in their hands , and their steps noiseless ; yet so deep was the stillness , that the rustling of their motion awoke the unillumined silence of the distant corridors in faint , rustling echoes , as if spirits were passing by . I let the others walk on , to gaze more nearly upon the magnificence of the altar . I remained alone , to indulge in the new and heart profound emotions which the place awakenened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths , flinging to its surface thoughts and sensations I had never experienced  --  that I knew not were in my being . A feeling of awe took hold upon me , and I remember that the idea of God and Eternity pressed upon me with irresistible power . A shadowy form , a foot-fall in the dim corridor drew my attention , and presently it approached me across the paved floor , for the vast floor was paved with marble and unobstructed by pews , and as it came nearer I saw it was a priest . He passed close by my side , lingered and regarded me in the indistinct light , and then saying kindly Benedicite ! ' proceeded on his way acrooss the church . I followed his retreating figure till it blended with the darkness ; then I heard a distant door open and close again with a loud echoing sound . I followed him in my heart with feelings of interest , for he had blessed me , knowing me not  --  but looking upon me only as a brother of God 's great family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics , but the religious awe inspired by the place I was now in and the gentle Bless thee ! ' of the muffled monk opened my heart and dissipated my prejudices . Since then I have travelled more and seen more of mankind ; and every year 's experience has taught me to be charitable to all men , ' and regard every man as a brother for whom Christ died . I have learned to look over the barriers of sect and see the man beyond and recognize in him God 's image , and an heir of Christ 's kingdom . We are charitable towards men of no religions , we are charitable towards the heathen-man : but when we encounter those who differ from us in modes of worship or in articles of christian faith we hate them ! A christian sectarian who will scrcely eat bread with one of another denomination , will find no cause for quarrel with a Chinese or Hindoo . He will not hate him ! But he does hate and revile his brother who , knowing and believing the true God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as he worships . I have seen good men of all faiths . All creeds are good that lead men back to God . The various and diverse denominations of christians constitute , like the beautiful rainbow which is composed of seven colors , one beautiful whole that shall span earth and heaven . But I am not cheating my readers into a sermon . Alone I slowly walked around the interior of the Cathedral . Niches , in which stood richly attired Madonnas , St. Johns , St. Peters , and St. Pauls , alternated with large paintings of scenes from the New Testament , relieved the walls ; but owing to the obscurity , were but faintly visible . The floor in front of the altar was literally paved with sepulchral slabs covering the crypt where slept the distinguished dead .  --  Some of these bore armorial bearings , and the inscriptions of all being in Latin , were easily made out by us . The altar was a grand pile of splendor . It is impossible to describe its magnificence . It presented to the eye a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; of gilded columns , silver arches and silver pillars ; golden candlesticks , rich silken and velvet drapery , scarlet purple , azure , and orange colors ; silver crucifixes , crosses , statues , all of solid silver and gold . Altar rose on altar in a pyramidial series of platform , each accession in elevation more glorious than the lower .  --  The whole dazzling structure was crowned by a blazing cross of precious stones . All this was seen by the light of seven wax candles which burn day and night before the alter . They were seven feet high , and stood in pillar-like candle-sticks eight feet in height , of solid silver . I was moving away from the spot on which I had stood beholding this scene of elaborate magnificence , when I was startled by a low sobbing near me . I looked in the direction whence it came , and discovered a female keeeling before the altar . She was obscured by the shadows of the railings , which , interrupting the light from the candles , fell across the crypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I gazed , she seemed to be at prayer , for I heard low words in a soft but sad tone . I was deeply moved . I drew nigh and passed her twice with a heavy step . But she took no notice of me  --  she seemed to be wholly wrapped in her grief and devotions . I felt tempted to speak to her and assure her of my sympathy ; but I reflected that she might not be able to understand English and I could not speak Portuguese . While I was thus deliberating she rose from her knees , and crossing herself glided away towards the corridor on the right of the altar . I followed her and saw her enter a low door and disappear . I began to think then of what I had read in old romances , and it seemed to me as if I was acting a part in one of them . What I had seen was so in keeping with the place , that all the romance of my nature was kindled . I fancied , for she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tyrannical father , who had compelled her to take the veil ; that her lover  --  for I gave her a lover  --  had pined away and died of grief and was buried beneath the crypt ; and every night she came to weep and pray upon the tomb ; for she had been kneeling on a white marble slab . I went back to see what was inscribed upon it , when to the discomfiture of the latter supposition of my story , I found that the person whose memory it commemorated was an Archbishop of seventy , who had died half a century ago Seeing my friends about departing , I now hastened to join them , and together we left the place . Here is a marble basin , ' said Saul , where they keep what they call holy water . " As he spoke he laid his hand upon an indistinctly seen urn of white marble that stood by the door . Every body dips their finger in it going in and coming out and makes the sign of the cross upon their breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it for , and she said it was to keep the devil from going in with ' em , and when they come out to keep him from getting into ' em ! ' With this remark of Saul 's we emerged into the square , and took our way towards home , which we reached without any adventure , but not without being challenged or stopped at every guard-house we passed on the way . CHAPTER XXI . The Battle . Upon entering the house we found the old man up waiting for us . He met us with an angry look and demanded very fiercely why we had staid out so late . It was about half-past nine . Neither of us made any reply but passing him proceeded to our rooms . We heard him foaming and fussing and calling us all kinds of names as we closed our door and fastened it . Striking a light we set it upon a table and called a council of war . It is time , ' said Fairfax , that the old man and ourselves came to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by retailing soda and Port wine sangarees to the officers of the navy and army , I for one will do it no longer ! ' Nor will I ! Nor I ! Nor I ! ' was the unanimous response . Softly boys , ' said Hewitt . We must move with discretion . We have caught ourselves in a scrape and we must act prudently to get out of it . ' If you choose to remain , ' answered Radsworth , you are at liberty to do so . I think you have a sort of hankering for the old deceiver . You seem to be on better terms with him than any of us ; and he likes you better than the rest of us ! ' I have acted prudently only . You know we are dependent on him and until we can find other employment must continue to be . This I have thought of . If I had money I would not stay another day , but dress up and go and board at the British Coffee House till I could get a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where should we go ? Where should we sleep to-morrow night ? I have not but thirty dollars in the world , and each one is worth its weight in gold to me so far from home . None of you have much more . Paul , here , says his father forgot to leave him any when he took leave of him on board the brig , and he was too much taken up with parting to remind him of it . ' I have ninety-five dollars , ' answered Fairfax very positively . What Hewitt had said was the truth . My father had not given me any money , and I had not asked him for any , supposing he would leave some with me at parting . In the hurry and grief of separation , I did not again think of it , and perhaps , he did not ; at any rate , I had with me but seven dollars and a quarter , and ten thousand miles from home , without a friend or acquaintance , and only eighteen years of age . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed to despair . We were healthy , had a good flow of spirits , plenty of hope and were ready to do and dare ! Your ninety-five dollars , George , wo n't last long if you go to a hotel . They charge three dollars a day . ' You shall all share with me . We will make one purse in common , boys ! ' he said generously . All our riches together will make about one hundred and seventy dollars . I propose that we quit old Hunks in a body to-morrow and trust to fortune for the inture ! ' I do n't think so , ' said the moderate Hewitt . Let us stay and save every dollar till we shall need its use . ' I propose , ' said I , that we in the morning come to an understanding with the old man . Let us have a regular talk ' with him , let him know that we are acquainted with his duplicity , and then tell him that it is our intention to quit him and throw ourselves upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become alarmed , and then we will propose to him that if he will pay us each a dollar a day we will consent to remain with him until we can do something better , or get a passage back to the United States . We shall thus be getting money for our services , and laying up something for a day of necessity . If he refuses we will then wait upon the Consul , state our grievances and the trick that has been put upon us in thus luring us from our native land and be guided by his advice . I have a letter in my pocket from my father to Colonel Forbes , our charge d ' affaires at Buenos Ayres , which I will show to the consul in testimony of our respectability ' and let him understand that we are not exactly bar-boys . ' This speech of mine was received with general approbation , and it was decided unanimously that this course should be adopted . I never thought of the Consul , ' said Hewitt with an air of surprise . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of our country to protect us and all other Americans . We 'll get the weather side of old Bedrick yet ! ' And rubbing his hands he chuckled and snuffled his nose at the idea . We now retired to bed . I slept little for the fleas , and for thinking of the step we were about to take in the morning . I may observe here that I was less and less annoyed each successive night by these miserable natives , and was rapidly bringing to a successful test the remark of Saul , for I had not been a fortnight on shore when nearly every pore in my body had been pierced by their bills . About daylight I was awakened from a drowsy sleep into which I had fallen by a heavy cannonading mingled with musketry . In my half-waking half-asleep state I fancied that it was a thunder storm accompanied by hail rattling upon the roof . I heard , however , my companions rousing up and calling out that there must be fighting . I sprung to my feet and hastily dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharges of artillery , and the flashes of the explosion reddened to the zenith and lighted the room , for it was yet scarcely day . While I was putting on my coat the old man came running in in his green flannel gown crying in great trepidation : There is a battle ? There is a fight ! They are attacking the town ! What shall we do ? ' I did not answer him , but hurrying on my dress hastened to the roof of the house , which I reached at the same moment with Fairfax and Bill Bedrick . I have already said that the top of our house commanded an extensive view over a portion of the city , the harbor , the curve of the opposite shore , and the castillated mound . Upon gaining the top of the house and mounting the battlement , I witnessed a scene that made my blood thrill with wild excitement . The castle upon the Mount , a mile and a half distant from the place on which I stood , was in the act of being stormed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismounted and acting as infantry , were surrounding its base , swaying this way and that like the waves of the sea , now pressing forward like an overwhelming billow , now retiring a little to renew its onset , while from its van , its bosom and its flank flashed sheets of flame which gave light to the terrific scene . The castle which they were assaulting was enveloped in smoke and jetting flames from the artillery which from the embrasures poured its fire upon them . In the harbor four of five vessels were opening their broadsides upon the patriots , raking them across a low piece of ground which lay at the foot of the hill . The roar of artillery , its red glare in the heavens , like incessant sheet lightning , the rattling of musketry , the sharp ringing of pistols , and the cries of those engaged , which distinctly reached our ears , presented a scene such as I had before no conception could be enacted on this lower earth , The tops of the houses were crowded with spectators , whose vivas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition of the highest excitement . Drums sounded to arms , bugles swelled upon the air from every quarter . General officers dashed up and down the streets , now this way now that , encircled by their staffs , giving orders to their aids as they galloped by . In a few minutes after I had reached the roof I beheld a regiment advancing at a round trot from the Grande Square , their officers with waving swords and loud voices encouraging them on . They passed along the street beneath me like a torrent . Then appeared a detachment of cavalry galloping after them at full speed . Then from a cross street came battalion after battalion of infantry and artillery , all pressing forward towards the quay . I soon saw the object of this movement by beholding several barges filled with troops launch out from the mole and pull across the harbor . All the boats of the fleet were in requisition .  --  Barge after barge crowded with men rapidly pulled across towards the scene of contest . While I was looking , Saul Freelove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle . Wall , it 's a sight one do n't see every day in the States , but since I 've been here I 've seen so much fighting I 've got a sort a used to it ! I came over here as I could n't see the castle plain from my house , and to tell you all you need n't be frightened , it 'll soon blow over . The darned Brazilians think they 'll do somethin ' by sendin ' over their sogers in the boats , but the patriots ai n't going to be caught in a trap . They know what they are about ; though it does seem a sort of foolish thing to take a castle without artillery ! Look and see how them brave sellers climb up the walls .  --  There 's bloody work going on there , and God have mercy on their souls . It 's as bad as Bunker Hill ! ' Can you tell how many patriots there are engaged ? ' I asked . About two thousand I should guess ; but they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then there is sich a smoke and firing ? ' I wish I was there in the midst ! ' I cried with youthful enthusiasm . I would like to help the patriots . ' You 'd wish yourself back again , ' answered Saul dryly . Jest see them fellers tumble off the horses and roll down hill . See them horses without riders flying like mad towards the country . You be like never to see Boston State-hus agen if you was there ! ' Nevertheless I felt as if I should very much like to be there . I had caught the spirit of battle , and I almost wished for wings to fly to mingle in the conflict . The interest of the contest grew each moment more absorbing . Battalion after battalion marched through the city , embarked at the mole , and pressed towards the opposite shore where they disembarked and formed under cover of the fire from the shipping . In the meanwhile , the assailants strove to possess themselves of the fortress with a bravery that was wonderful . Unintimidated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy and galling discharges of musketry from the battlements , they pressed round the walls with ladders and fascires . We could see the brave men fall here and there from their horses and objects descended swiftly and heavily from the walls into the moat which Saul said were soldiers slain by the patriot 's fire . At length the detachment which had landed began their march , about fifteen hundred in number , to attack the rear of the patriots ' force . Now Llavelleja will get caught in a trap if he doesn'tretreat , ' said Saul . The Brazilian means to try and cut him off from his camp ! ' While Saul was speaking I saw the patriots , from whom I scarcely kept off my eyes , make a movement simultaneously to retire . The infantry , or rather those that were dismounted , I saw disappear in a sort of a ravine , while the cavalry , forming in a close column and bearing off their wounded across their saddles , began to trot down the hill .  --  They were in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ravine . Them are the men we saw disappear on the other side o ' the hill , ' said Saul . They left there horses there so as to attack on foot , and now they have gone and mounted again . That 's jist like them Quacho rancheros ! Now they fight on horseback , now on foot , jist as it happens . They be the bravest fellers in the world , Yankee boys always excepted . But they haint got the old castle this time . But they go off with flying colors and sounding bugles ! ' The patriots had indeed found it expedient to retire ; but they did so as if they did not fear their foes . They moved in a compact column at a free but not a hurried trot , with banners glancing in the sun which was just rising , and bugles sounding . We could hear their tirrah-tirrah ! through the still air where we were . They passed within a third of a mile of the Brazilian battalions , which drew up in order of battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of horse passed them without notice , and in a few minutes wound into a gorge between two low peach hills , and disappeared towards the interior . A cannonading had been kept up after them from the fortress , but I saw that only one shot appeared to take effect , from witnessing some slight confusion in the midst of a column and a brief detention in the rear of some score or two of the horsemen , who appeared to be lifting wounded companions upon their horses . The Brazilian force did not pursue ; but after a little delay about two hundred of them were detached from the line and marched towards the fortress , which they entered . The firing from the shipping ceased , and also that from the castle , and silence once more reigned over the scene of war . With a small pocket spy-glass , which I now recollected I had in my trunk , and which I regretted I had not thought of before , I was able to view the battle ground with much nearer proximity . I could plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hill-side , and fancied I could make out the stiffened features of many a fallen patriot . I counted seventy-four dead bodies of the patriots , and upwards of a hundred horses . Carbines , swords , pistols , so far as I could make out , were scattered in all directions . I could see no bodies of Brazilian soldiers save near the gates ; for those that fell had been shot upon the walls and had plunged into the moat . It was a bad scene , and it was a relief to remove the glass from my eye and place again a wide distance between . My heart sickened at such slaughter . My sympathies were with the patriots . They had not been beaten , but had returned only to avoid collision with a superior force of fresh troops . We gathered together in a group , we four , and talked over what we had witnessed . One idea seemed simultaneously to take possession of our minds . I was the first to give it language by saying to them : How would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking of , ' they answered almost in the same breath . Then the way of honor is open before us , ' I answered . If we leave Bedrick we leave him to join Llavelleja . Is it so ? ' Yes , ' was the response of all three . We joined hands upon it and then obeyed the call to breakfast ; for if men fight they must eat too . Nothing can be done in this world , without beef , bread and coffee . CHAPTER XXII . The Resolution . The scenes of the morning had given a new turn to our thoughts and a direction to our energies . We now beheld before us a field not only of action and honorable employment but a patbway to fame . We breakfasted in good spirits and afterwards went each to our respective shops ; for we decided to keep perfectly secret our plans until they were fully matured . We , therefore , assumed extraordinary diligence in business during the day in order the more fully to disguise our purposes . Our shop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the score of the fight than had been on any previous day , not excepting that on which we opened the establishment . The battle was the only theme of conversation among all visitors , among whom were naval officers from the French , English and American vessels of war in the harbor . During the day we were honored also with the presence of the commander of the castle , and several of his officers who had taken part in its defence . One of them was wounded and had his arm in a sling . They talked valiantly of their exploits upon the walls . From the conversation of several parties I got the facts of the affair . It appeared that General Llavelleja had , the night before , secretly marched from his camp at the head of a detachment of about two thousand of his cavalry , for the purpose of surprising the castle . His force proceeded without discovery to the base of the Mount , about five miles distant from his camp , where he separated them into three divisions . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the hill and took a position , in ambush , directly under the walls at the rear of the castle . The second detachment of seven hundred men was sent to a ravine at the foot of the hill , where it dismounted , leaving their horses tethered , and there formed in column , ready for the signal of onset . The third and main body remained in saddles at the base of the hill , directly in front of the main entrance to the castle and about five hundred yards distant , the ascent to the gate from their post being gradual , the hill being in shape not unlike an ant hill , the castle crowning the whole . The motive for this disposition of his forces was the fact Llavelleja knew that every morning at dawn , the main gate of the castle was thrown open for the soldiers to go down to a spring a hundred yards from it to get water to cook with . Upon the opening of the gate , therefore , the detachment in ambuscade were to rush forward and surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then have fallen easily into their hands . Having made this disposition of his forces under cover of the darkness , he awaited until the dawn for the gate to be opened . When at length the day began to break , he , in person , drew so near to the gate that , it was said , he heard the turning of the bolts as it was unlocked . The moment the gate was opened and the soldiers with their buckets began to come forth , he wound his bugle and dashed at the entrance with the whole of the ambush at his back . So sudden was the onset and surprise that he fairly gained the entrance , cutting to pieces about a score of the soldiers which had come out and wounding and slaying several that opposed under the portcullis . The garrison , however , met him with courage , and the officer in command had presence of mind enough to drop the portcullis in the very midst of the melee , cutting in two several of the combatants of both parties that were fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot general gave a general order for storming the citadel . Now opened the cannonading upon the advancing cavalry of the main body which had awakened the sleeping city from its repose , and me among the number . The failure of this bold attempt I have already stated . The British and American officers whom I heard discussing the affair , called it a gallant thing , though some of them were disposed to censure the Patriot general for not waiting for his artillery before he planned such an expedition ; while others ridiculed the idea of employing cavalry to storm a fortress . But others urged that as all his army were cavalry , it was in character ; and besides , the cavalry drawn up at the foot of the hill could be made available in protecting the infantry , should a sortie of the whole garrison be made and drive it back . All the forenoon barrows laden with wounded soldiers from the castle passed the shop on the way to the hospital . The enthusiasm , however , of the citizens was not damped by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general joy throughout the town . Men spoke of it as a great victory ; and in the afternoon salutes were fired , flags displayed , and other marks of victorious triumph manifested . In the evening the Governor-General , who had witnessed the battle from the cupola of the palace , gave a ball , and fire-works were let off in the Grande Square . Exultation was on every Brazilian visage . It was said that the detachment of fifteen hundred men which had been sent across the harbor , would be the next day increased by four thousand more , and an attack would be made upon the patriot camp . All was excitement and warlike enthusiasm . Our Consult , it was said , asked the Governor General why a sufficient force was not sent over at the time to follow the retreating patriots and press them into their camp , cutting them to pieces in the confusion of their discomfiture . His reply was that he apprehended that the attack was only a ruse to draw his attention and the flower of his troops in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city gates and endeavored to carry the town . The Brazilian General 's opinion of the courage of the patriots was flattering to them , to say the least , that he should suppose four thousand men would be able to take a city garrisoned with seventeen thousand ! surrounded by a wall thirty feet high , which was defended by a moat as many feet deep and sixty feet wide , filled from the harbor with water , which flowed all around the city like a circular river ; the gates double , protected by drawbridges and portcullis , by a strong guard and cannon frowning above them ! But the truth is , the Brazilians stood much in fear of their brave foes , and attributed to them prowess in arm worthy of the heroes of ancient Greece or the Scythian warriors , whom , indeed , they not a little resembled . Llavelleja was sustained only by his six thousand Ranchero cavalry in his siege . The Buenos Ayrean Government had no fleet , save a few gun boats , two or three schooners and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York merchant ship , but which the Patriot Government purchased and converted into a vessel of war . This vessel was the flag ship of the little squadron which was under the command of Admiral Brown , once an English officer , but for many years in the service of Buenos Ayres ; a brave , daring man , a finished seaman , and a thorough fighting sailor . This squadron was at this time blockaded in Buenos Ayres by the Brazilian fleet which I have already spoken of as stretching from shore to shore about fifteen miles from Montevideo . The siege of Montevideo was therefore incomplete , and would have been had Llavelleja 's force been fifty thousand men ; for so long as the harbor was open to the Brazilian vessels the place could not be starved out . But what the patriot wanted in means was supplied by invinsible courage , energy , and love of country . They had the sympathy of all the Americans and French in the port , and of most of the English , who , however , could not so entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty and cordial wishes for success . The character of the patriots and the patriot general inspired us with the strongest interest ; and I was filled with the greatest desire to see him . The analogy between the Republic and our own enlisted our national pride . We had been told that she had adopted our constitution almost literally , and that her form of government was modelled after our own . We knew that her people were brave , and were combatting on the side of justice and right . Our resolution , therefore , to take part with them was confirmed the more we reflected upon it . There we were , thrown upon the world , as it were , by an act of duplicity on the part of one who should have been our protector and friend . We had the world all before us where to choose . It was either ignobly to return home , if we could get a passage , or carve out our fortunes with our own hands . The war closed all avenues of business but selling soda-water , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy of the patriots seemed to invite us . They needed every arm that would volunteer in their cause . The idea of fighting in the patriot cause thrilled our youthful bosoms ! There was a charm , a fascination in the very word ! We might also rise rapidly to fame  --  our country might yet hear of us with pride ! Our determination was taken . We that night got together , and after talking the whole matter over with a gravity becoming a Napoleonic council , we made up our minds to take the first opportunity to join the Patriot force outside of the city . We were divided in choice of the service however . Fairfax and myself were inclined , after reporting ourselves to Llavelleja , to proceed to Buenos Ayres and join the squadron under the gallant Brown ; for we both had a fancy for the sea . Radsworth , whose father was a general officer in the last war , and Hewitt , preferred the military service . Fairfax and I were not disposed , be it understood , to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Ayres . We expected to fight , and wished to . A report was in town that Brown was then preparing to sail down the river with his little squadron , to break the blockade and open the river , at least temporarily , to the vessels waiting below to come up . We hoped to reach him in time to take part in the affair . Thus having settled matters for the future , it only remained for us to embrace some opportunity for quitting the city . This was likely to be a difficult object to bring about . The only outlets from the place were by the gates towards the country , which were triply guarded , or by the mole on the harbor side . The next morning after the battle , the old man came into the shop , and said he was going on board an American ship which had just come in , to hear what news there was from the States . Now young men , ' he said , speaking through his beaked nose and looking very authoritative , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my punctuality . I expect you to remain in the shop .  --  Do n't leave it Perril , on your peril , as you did yesterday . If I maintain you I shall expect you to give me every minute of your time .  --  Now see that I am obeyed . My son Edwin goes with me . Have you seen William ? ' I have not since yesterday , ' I answered . The dog ! He will yet get his head taken off or be put in prison . He is always adventuring about . I do n't know but I shall have to try and get him a place in Ford &; Co 's House ? He is getting unsteady and wild ! ' Well might the old gentleman say so . His son was as wayward and independent as the wind . He was a handsome , reckless , fiery young man , with an utter contempt for his father , and a merciless quizzer of his literary brother , Edwin . He was a good fellow at heart , but a perfect devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but dressed elegantly and passed his time in cafes , or flirting with such young Spanish girls as his impudence aided him to get acquainted with .  --  Once in a while he would lounge into the shop and chat awhile , take a glass of soda-brandy , smoke two or three cigars and then disappear .  --  He was , however , on excellent terms with us ; and well knew that we did not intend to remain with his father any longer than we could help ourselves ; for finding him friendly we had told him . He kept our secret , and said frankly , that he did not blame us ; for the old man had fairly taken us in . ' He added , too , that he was surprised after he had seen more of us on board the brig , that such a set of young men as he found us to be , should have consented to go out to Buenos Ayres , to tend soda-shops ! But when we , as a few days after our arrival we did do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he warmly professed his ignorance of before ) he expressed his indignation and said that we should but serve the old man right to quit him at once , and let him find others to tend shop as he could . We did not , however , fully let him into our secret purposes . CHAPTER XXIII . The Fate . After the old gentleman had quitted the shop to go on board the newly arrived vessel , I went to the door to watch him safely down to the quay . I then took my hat and arming myself with a dirk and pistol to protect myself against dogs and bipeds both , I left the shop and took my way down a street that led to the walls . Fairfax was well aware of my object , it having been previously arranged , and promised to tend both fountains till I returned . My motive in thus stealing away was to take a survey of the walls and gates and see what chance offered for our escaping on the country-side . My intention was to go quite around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open space or street next to them extending their whole circuit . In some places this space widened into broad , open ground like a square , covered with piles of offal and swarming with dogs . One of these squares was called Congo Square , and was the favorite resort of the negroes on holidays for dancing the fandango . The street which I took to go to the walls was narrow and filthy and inhabited by the lowest canaille of the city . I passed numerous pulperias thronged with drunken soldiery and villainous looking-ruffians . No one , however , molested me , as I sauntered carelessly along ; and being dark complexioned and having black eyes and hair , I was the more readily suffered to proceed as I looked like a young Spaniard or Brazilian , having , indeed , been more than once taken to be one .  --  So I attracted no particular attention and went on in security where blue eyes and fair hair might possibly have been in peril . Two-thirds of the way down the street I was met by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched a soldier writhing with pain . His shirt was stripped off and his naked , braway chest and shoulders were crimson with blood flowing from a gun-shot wound in his neck . I heard one of the soldiers answer in reply to a question of one standing by that the man had been a sentinel upon the walls and was just shot by a Quacho rider  --  that is , a patriot horseman . They were bearing him to the hospital . This sight had called to my mind what Saul had told me , viz : that the Quacho cavalry will often ride up within carbine shot of the walls and pick off the sentinels . They approach in this way :  --  Wild horses , be it understood , are always roving and browsing about in the vicinity , and can be seen in large troops from the walls . Some of them sometimes gallop up close to the walls neigh a sort of defiance and then scour away over the low hillocks that break the barren surface of the region within a mile of the walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay no attention to them . The Quachos , who are the best horsemen in the world , taking advantage of this , strip themselves of all superfluous clothing and armed only with a carbine advance within a mile of the walls mounted as usual . They then worm their way nigher and nigher behind the hillocks driving a score of wild horses before them ; until they get as near the walls as they can . They then throw themselves partly off their horses , sticking to his side by one hand upon the mane , and the feet twisted under the hams . In this manner they gallop forward keeping the other side of the horse next to the walls . The sentry , seeing no rider , for the Quacho is hidden on the other side of the horse , to which he clings like a leech , takes no beed of him , regarding him as one of the wild steeds of the pampas . As soon as the Quacho finds himself within shot of his man he throws himself across his courser 's back , discharging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moat or falls wounded upon the battlements , while the horseman retires with the speed of the wind waving his carbine above his head , and shouting defiance . In this manner had this man been shot , who , from the examples he had before his eyes of the fate of many of his comrades , ought to have been better on his guard . Near the foot of the street I passed a door of a house before which I saw a small gilt cross in the hand of a little child dressed in white with flowers in her hand she held a plate on which were a few pieces of money She offered it to me , and upon my asking her ( in my best Spanish , in which I was daily improving so as to talk pretty well ) what it was for , she said it was to pay for masses for the soul of a little infant , her sister ! As she spoke she directed my attention through an open door into a room where upon a table and covered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold paper , and wreathed with flowers . Entre usted , senor ? ' said the little girl as I placed a medio ( a sixteenth of a dollar ) in the plate , a sum , which I thought more than adequate to pay for all the sins the little babe had committed in this wicked world . I entered and gazed upon the wax-like features of one of the loveliest infants I ever beheld . Its little fingers were clasped upon its breast and held a small silver gilt cross and a rosebud . A coronet of fresh flowers bound its temples . It was arrayed in a snowy white embroidered robe and looked like a sculptured cherub . There was no one in the room but an old negro woman in a white scarlet gown and scarlet turban , who was incessantly making the sign of the cross in the air , and muttering aves , ' while I gazed down upon the child . Leaving this house I continued my walk to the foot of the street , where the caliboose was situated . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full thirty feet high , something like a gothic church window , looking upon the street . It was strongly grated with a lattice of iron bars like a gigantic cage . Around this window was collected a motley group of both sexes and all colors and costumes , who were gazing in upon the prisoners or talking with them through the bars . I stopped to view the scene . The window was literally covered to its top with prisoners who had climbed up the bars on the inside over one another 's head to look out , and hear , and see and talk with their acquaintances in the street . Such a noise I never heard .  --  It was a jargon of voices that gave one a good idea of Bedlam . Some were talking from street to grate at the top of their voices , some swearing , some calling out , some laughing , jeering , mocking and shouting . I stood for a few moments appalled . I then crossed the street and drew nearer to get a better view and look into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were nearly as naked as they were born , spying me out , thrust out their murderous looking hands or their old caps and called vociferously for dinero , dinero , senor ! ' money , money ! ' One fierce , bearded , piratical villain , who was twenty feet above me , in particular , made his loud demands . I chanced to have in my pocket about ten or twelve coppers which I threw against the window . Such a scramble , such oaths , such superhuman exertions to get possession of those that fell inside , it is impossible for words to do justice to . The piratical villain from the top , let himself down over the backs of his fellows beneath him , like a panther descending a tree . The window was deserted , and fifty miserable wretches were scrambling upon the floor of the prison under it for the coin . In the midst of the uproar and quite satisfied with what I had witnessed , I withdrew from a scene which could hardly be paralleled in hell . Such visages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grating , would degrade the devil . Ferocity , brutality ; lust , fury , hatred , malice , all were stamped there with the seal of unmixed depravity . Many of them had not been shaven for weeks . Many of them wore chains upon their wrists , which clanked harshly upon the ear at every movement they made . Many of them were without other clothing than the upper portion of ragged trowsers bound about their waists with a bit of rope . Some of them were native Africans who had been but a few weeks in the land and had been put in for murdering their masters . Some of them were domestic slaves . Some were mutinous seamen of the fleet . Some were soldiers , either deserters or assassins . Not a few were professional pirates and midnight assassins . The room in which this miscellaneous band of wretches were confined , was about sixty feet in length , thirty high , and twenty-five wide . Here about one hundred prisoners were herded together , day and night , without distinction of crime . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were thrown all persons , indiscriminately , who came under the censure of the Government , or who incurred the displeasure of the Captain-general . I shuddered at the thought that circumstances , which were yet unforeseen , might make me an inmate of that Infernal Saloon . After leaving this place I passed on a little farther and reached the open space that separates the streets from the walls . I walked along with my eyes closely surveying their height and scanning their situation . All that met my eyes was a lofty mass of stone crowned by battlements with sentries pacing along the sky-line with their muskets at their shoulders , At the base were heaps of rubbish and offal , and digging into them for food , were the usual hordes of hungry dogs , howling and snarling like a pack of famished wolves . At length I came to the first gate , from which a fine street extended into the very heart of the city , losing itself in the Grand Square .  --  Here were groups of soldiers lounging about , and four sentinels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guard houses also flanked the entrance , in which I saw soldiers playing at dominoes , smoking and sleeping . Over the gate also stood a sentry with his face to the country a sort of stationery vidette . The gates were closed ; but a small wicket in it was partly open that was just large enough to admit a man at the time . While I was standing looking , I saw a peasant admitted with a bag of vegetables upon his back . He seemed well known to the guard , and many questions were put to him . An officer came out of the guard-house and questioned him , and he was then strictly searched to see if he bore any letters from the patriots ; for no man was trusted , however well known . Even his bag of vegetables was poured out and overhauled ; and then only he was suffered to proceed up the street into the city . After he moved away , I lounged up to the gate , and as the wicket was still open I stooped down to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rewarded by a friendly musket which was pressed side-ways so forcibly against my breast that I had nearly tumbled over backwards . The hint was accompanied with a friendly admonition to keep out of the way and mind my own business . I was minding my business to the letter ; for I had come there for the very purpose of seeing the chances that might offer for escape . I did not , however , tell the sentry so , but walked away well satisfied that there was no hope of reaching the patriot army by the gates . END OE PART FIRST .
