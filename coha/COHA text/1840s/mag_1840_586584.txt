txt A WRITER in the Westminster Review remarks , that the two men of the present age , who have most strongly influenced the minds of their countrymen , are Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Jeremy Bentham . Without questioning the accuracy of the observation , as it respects Coleridge , we think there can be no doubt of the truth of so much of it as applies to Bentham . Whatever may have been the influence of the former , whose researches were mostly in the region of abstract thought , and whose sympathies were altogether with the past , it must have been of that occult and delicate nature which only a few learn to appreciate . But the influence of Bentham , with his practical cast of mind , with his rugged sense , with his contemptuous disregard of authority , with his bold onsets upon cherished modes of faith , and with the immediate interest attached to all his inquiries , must have made itself felt speedily , and that in a shape which might be easily recognised . He addressed himself to affairs connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of his investigations had not arrested attention , it would have been owing , not to those investigations themselves , but to his peculiar manner of treating them . // lie was , however , equally successful in the selection and in the treatinent of his subject . Few men ever lived that have infused their convictions more deeply into the minds of their contemporaries . During his life , his works , though not without reputation , were hardly estimated at their real value ; and it was only after they had founded a distinct and independent school of thinkers , when the worth of his conclusions had been brought to a practical test , when a host of accomplished and persevering disciples had forced them upon the consideration of tbe British Parliament , when discussion had proved their validity , and hostility and denunciation had revealed their strength , that Bentham was acknowledged as the great luminary of his era , the leader and teacher of the vast , ever-expanding , and all-conquering patty of Reform . Since then , his place as the nucleus of that party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things as they are must be gathered , has been admitted . It is an undeniable fact . Jeremy Bentham is the father of law reform , the founder of legislative science , the powerful advocate of political emancipation , and a distinguished friend of the moral advancement of the human race . In this capacity we propose briefly to consider his merits , accompanying our comments only , with such personal notices , as are necessary to enable the reader more thoroughly to comprehend the man . First , then , a few words of Bentham himself . He was born in London , in the year 1747 , and was remarkable in childhood for the quickness of his parts , and the solidity of his judgment . At three years of age he read for amusement Rapin 's History of England ; at eight was a skilful performer on the violin ; and at thirteen commenced his collegiate studies in Oxford . It was at this early period that his inquiring and conscientious turn of mind manifested itself ; for being required to sign the Thirty-Nine Articles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act ever afterward proved to him an occasion of deep regret . He looked upon it as deliberately setting his seal to what he thought to be false , as a species of self-degradation which disturbed the clearness of his moral convictions and broke the integrity of his spirit . His father , who was an attorney of some note , gave him the opportunity of becoming a profound and skilful lawyer . Nor did he fail to prosecute his studies with immense labor and research ; not , however , in the spirit of those who ordinarily pursue that prolession , but with the discrimination of a philosopher and the zeal of a philanthropist . He was sooth disgusted with the technical falsehood he found pervading every branch of the law , which , in conriexion with the repugnance excited by its indirectness , inconsistencies , unjust arrangements and barbarous phraseology , inspired him with the ambition of devoting his life to its reform . The first fruits of his purpose appeared in a short essay , called a Fragment on Government , published anonymously in 1776 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written with singular clearness // and vigor , but hypercritical in its tone , though distinguished in many passages by astute observation , and reasoning at once logical and profound . It is some sign of the estimation in which this work was held on its first appearance , both as a literary and philosophical performance , that it was successively ascribed to Lord Camden , Lord Mansfield , and to Mr. Dunning , one of the most accomplished lawyers of the day . It was followed by the publication , two years afterward , of a review of the " Hard Labor Bill , " with observations relative to jurisprudence in general , which contained the germ of several sagacious doctrines unfolded at length in later and more detailed works . Then came the " Defence of Usury , " a tract of remarkable force , and one of the best specimens of the exhaustive mode of reasoning ever printed . In less than two years , the " Introduction to the principles of Morals and Legislation " appeared , being the first extended and methodical exposition of his peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place at once among the thinkers of the day . The originality of its arrangement and expression , together with the boldness of its views and the pertinacity with which they were pressed , arrested the attention of the leading minds of that period . Some few hailed the new teaching as the harbinger of more liberal and consistent methods of treating the great questions of government and moral science , but more looked upon it as an extravagant reproduction of exploded theories , better adapted to excite merriment , than to awaken inquiry , or to become the occasion of a radical and comprehensive reformation of the laws . Many , however , confessed the peculiar vigor and acuteness of the author 's intellect , although few were inspired with confidence in his judgment . Yet the book worked its way . One after another , distinguished men were compelled to admit , if not the soundness of his conclusions in detail , the general necessity of subjecting law to a thorough revision . Meanwhile , the author himself , apparently content to allow his theories to bide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlets upon the various minor and collateral branches of the great subject to which he had given his life . Draughts of codes , essays on political tactics , on colonial emancipation , on pauper management , on parliamentary reform , on church abuses , on the art of instruction , on the liberty of the press , on codification , and a hundred other matters , followed each other in rapid succession . But a treatise on the " Rationale of Judicial Evidence " was the largest and most elaborate of the works then published . It was filled with profound thoughts and instructive suggestions , and soon became the foundation of important changes in the law of procedure . No one read it without acquiring a deep conviction of the reach , strength , astuteness and integrity of the intellect from which it sprung . It detected the absurdity of the old practice with so much skill , exposed it with so much point and vivacity , and unfolded a better scheme with so much // judgment and tact , that it readily obtained for the author the reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatises , and those not among the least important , were published in French , and possessed a wide continental influence before they were generally known to his countrymen . This arose from the careless habit of writing into which , in the latter part of his life , he suffered himself to fall . Abandoning that clear and nervous style which marked his earlier works , he indulged in loose , irregular , and unintelligible modes of expression . His thoughts were not written out , but dotted down , sometimes in briefest outline , and at others , in an uncouth and perplexing jargon . Catalogues , synoptical tables , summaries , references , brief hints , interspersed with long dissertations , composed the bulk of his manuscripts . Fortunately , these fell into the hands of an ardent and accomplished disciple , in the person of Dumont , a citizen of Geneva , for some time an eloquent preacher at St. Petersburg , but who had come to London at the request of the Lansdowne family . There he formed the acquaintance of Bentham , and entered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . Never was a literary friendship formed under happier auspices . To a thorough appreciation of , and profound reverence for , Bentham 's genius , he united great patience of labor , a quickness of apprehension , indefatigable public spirit , and a felicitous style of writing . " His manners , " says Lord Brougham , " were as gentle as they were polished and refined . His conversation was a model of excellence ; it was truly delightful . Abounding in the most agreeable and harmless wit , fully instinct with various knowledge , diversified with anecdotes of rare interest , enriched with all the stores of modern literature , seasoned with an arch and racy humor , and occasionally a spice of mimicry , or rather of acting , but subdued , as to be palatable it must always be , and giving rather the portraiture of classes than of individuals , marked by the purest taste , enlivened by a gayety of disposition still unclouded , sweetened by a temper that nothing could ruffle , presenting especially perhaps the single instance of one distinguished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time of any one 's attention , and never ceasing to speak that all his hearers did not wish him to go on , it may fairly be said , that his conversation was the highest which the refined society of London and of Paris afforded . No man accordingly was more courted by all classes ; no loss was ever felt more severely than his decease ; and no place in the most choice circles of literary and political commerce is so likely long to remain vacant . " To this man was committed the task of compiling , arranging , condensing , filling out and translating several of the best of Bentham 's manuscripts . rphe services which he rendered in this way were an invaluable assistance to his master , but not so great as has sometimes been represented . Says Mr. Macauley , himself one of the most eloquent and accom* // pushed living writers of English- " If M. Dumont had never been born , Mr. Bentham would still have been a very great man . But he would have been great to himself alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility of those vast American wildernesses in which blossoms and decays a rich but unprofitable vegetation , wherewith the reaper filled not his hand , neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosoni . ' It would have been with his discoveries as it had been with the Century . of Inventions . ' His speculations on law would have been of no more practical use , than Lord Worcester 's speculations on steam-engines. * ' But this is a mistake which does great injustice to Ben*ham . As much as he was indebted to Dumont , it was only for a small part of his fame . To say nothing of those works in which the latter had no hand , works that under any circumstances would have raised the author to eminence , it must be admitted that as Bentham had the power to be perfect , it is probable , had there been no overtures of friendly assistance , he would have undertaken the task which another accomplished for him . Dumont was at all times solicitous to decline the merit of having been the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said he , " I have no share , no claim of association in the composition of these works . They belong entirely to the author and to him alone . The more I esteem them , the more desirous I am to disavow an honor which would be an usurpation as contrary to the faith of friendship , as it is repugnant to my personal character . " Again , he observes : " My labor , subaltern in its kind , has been limited to details . It was necessary to make a choice among various observations on the same subject ; to suppress repetitions ; to throw light upon obscurities ; to bring together all that appertained to the same subject ; and to fill up those gaps which in the hurry of composition the author had left . I have had more to retrench than to add ; more to abridge than to expand . The mass of manuscripts put into my hands was considerable . I have had much to do in attaining correctness , and preserving uniformity of style ; little or nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me only the care of economy . " This* while it explains the nature of Dumont 's labors , acquits Bentham of the debt with which in Mr. Macaulay 's essay he is charged . The work at the head of this paper presents , in a portable form , the best summary of his doctrines that has been published . It is a translation , by Richard Hildreth , of Boston , from the French edition of Etienne Dumont , originally printed in Paris in 1802 , with a supplenientary essay upon " the influence of time and place on laws , " which does not appear in this edition . If any person would obtain a correct general idea of Bentham 's system , without wading through the ponde* rous and often repulsive tomes over which the details of it are scattered , he will find all that he wishes in this succinct yet compre*. hensive collection of Dumont . It is distributed into three parts , th // first giving the general principles of legislation ; the second , the principles of the civil code ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manual of political and legal ethics it is an inestimable offering , and the thanks of the community are due the translator for his attempt to render its doctrines more widely known to the Amencan public . He has introduced it seasonably ; at a time when the subject of law reform is beginning to be agitated in the legislatures of several of the States , and when the young men of the nation , as we fondly believe , are attaching themselves to sentiments of democratic freedom and progress . It will aid the efforts of the latter in their researches after truth , and the former , should they resolve to be guided by its tenets , would find it a treasury of important instruction . We should augur the happiest results as well to our habits of thinking as to the moral condition of society , from a profound study of its contents . The legislator who should go forth armed with the weapons of this magazine of thought would prove an invincible champion in the cause of justice and truth . Let us , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the fairest , as well as completest method of stating it , we shall confine ourselves , as near as may be , to the expressions and reasonings of his own treatises . His fundamental principle , supposed to be present to the mind of the reader in all his works , is , that the public good ought to be the object of the legislator , or , in other words , that general utility , ' sometimes designated as the greatest good of the greatest number ' is the only legitimate foundation of legislative science . This utility , to which a clear and distinct meaning is to be ever attached , is exclusive of every other principle , and is to be faithfully applied to all cases of legislation , by the most rigid processes of a moral arithmetic . Nature has placed man under the dominion of pleasure and pain . His only object in life is to seek pleasure and avoid pain , even when he imagines himself most free from the empire of these eternal and irresistible sentiments . Utility expresses the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent some pain ; and that which is conformable to the utility or the interest of a community is what tends to augment the total sum of the happiness of the individuals of which it is composed . Virtue is esteemed by the disciple of the principle of utility as a good only because of the pleasure that it produces , and vice is regarded as an *evil only on account of the pains which result from it . If he finds , therefore , in the ordinary lists of virtue an action from which there follows more pain than pleasure , he instantly classifies it among the number of vices ; and so , on the other hand , if there is found in the common lists of offences some indifferent action , some innocent pleasure , he will not hesitate to transport this pretended offence into the class of lawful actions . To arrive at a correct notion of utility , in any given case , it is ne // cessary to have a full and accurate knowledge of the different kinds of pleasures and pains . The variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dividing the simple from the complex , and arranging the whole in catalogues , which will assist the memory , while it renders the judgment more precise . Not only the number but the value or power of pleasures and pains , both as they relate to individuals and as they relate to Communities , must be learned ; and this we shall find to depend upon their intensity , their duration , their certainty , their proximity , their productiveness , their purity , and their extent . But inasmuch as all causes of pleasure do not give the same pleasure to all persons , nor all causes of pain produce the same pain , that difference in human sensibility from which that difference of pleasure and pain proceeds must be investigated This difference of sensibility is either in degree or kind ; in degree , when the impression of a given cause upon any individuals is uniform but unequal ; in kind , when the same cause produces opposite sensations in different individuals ; and in both cases depends primarily upon temperament , health , strength , corporeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perseverance , the bent of inclination , notions of honor , notions of religion , ser*timents of sympathy , antipathies , disorder of mind , and pecuniary circumstances* As , however , these causes of different sensibilities can not be easily appreciated , there ar , e in certain secondary circumstances , viz. : sex , age , rank , race , climate , government , education , and religious profes* sion , palpable and satisfactory indications of interior dispositions . These secondary circumstances are easily seized , few in number* readily combine into general classes , and furnish the grounds , in the contrivance of any law , for extenuation or aggravation . Possessed of a knowledge of the true nature of the various ' kinds of pleasures and pains , we may then take up the analysis of political *good and evil , and of the manner in which they are diffused through society . It is with government as with medicine , that its main busi. ' ness is a choice of evils . Law , being an infraction of liberty , is an evil , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider* first , whether the acts which he undertakes to prevent are really evils ; and secondly , whether , if evils , they are greater evils than the means he employs to suppress them . In ether language , is the evil of the disease or the evil of the remedy the greater ? He is to re . ' member that evil seldom comes alone , but takes different forms , and spreads on every side as from a centre . It first affects the persons immediately concerned in it , and then , by arousing the idea of danger and alarm , affects the whole community For the protection and web fare of society , therefore , certain acts are to be erected into offences , by which is meant that they deserve punishment . But some evil acts are not of this sort , and had better be left to the punishments attached to them by the natural or social sanctions , than included in the number vOL. viii . No* xxxxII. - szpTuitmuEx , 1840 . Q // of those which are touched by the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the domain of politics , and those which belong to morals exclusively , resort must be had to the great doctrine of utility , which accompanies this whole inquiry . Here is the sum of his theory . The first thing that occurs to us to say of it is , that Bentham does not seem to have had a deep pene* tration into the metaphysics of that part of it relating to morals . He appears to have taken his general doctrine for granted , without investigating very profoundly into the grounds of it , and without giving due weight to the elaborate . researches of other philosophers . More of a thinker than a reader , though by no means deficient , as some have alleged , in the latter respect , he fell into a contemptuous mode of treating the subtle inquiries of older metaphysicians . He everywhere regards the results of their speculations ( those , we mean , which res* pect a moral sense , and the grounds of moral obligation ) as the mere expression of their individual prejudices and sentiments . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biases , or adroit contrivances to avoid the appeal to anything like an external standard . He regarded them as quite unintelligible , or intelligible only so far as they inclined toward his own favorite doctrine . In no instance does he make a full and candid statement of what they are , or assign in detail the reasons why they are rejected . ' He simply enumerates them under one name or another , and then , by a fell stroke of the pen , sweeps them all from the board , as unworthy of farther notice . Nor is he any more explicit in establishing the theory which he sets up in their place . He asserts it boldly , frequently , without compromise , but never demonstrates it ; scarcely , indeed , makes an attempt to demonstrate it . His readers must receive it on his dictum , or seek elsewhere for a satisfactory exposition . qwq // 260 benevolence itself , or what is sometimes called a generous sacrifice , is a mere prudential calculation as to the pleasure and pain of one course or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comforts of a civilized home , for the miseries of a savage wilderness , he pursues his pleasure merely ; he is driven by his fear of remorse and of hell on one side , to brave the perils of want and death on the other , and in this way barely selects the more agreeable alternative . There is a higher pleasure in his view in preachiiig to the savages , than in sharing the luxuries of refined society ; and in preferring the former he acts upon the same principle of self-love , as the chimney sweeper would in giving up his sooty rags for the purple linen of a prince . He adds to the number of his agreeable sensations , and on that account , and that account alone , changes his one condition for ' another . iNew , in reply to such reasoners , we say , there is no doubt that a lofty pleasure attends the exercise of any form of benevolence ; but is that pleasure  --  and here is the point-is that pleasure the immediate object of the benevolence ? Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysicians , set this matter at rest when he first urged this distinction . The direct object of any human affection is ' altogether distinct from the pleasure which may accompany its exercise ; and , though virtue is pleasant and vice painful , the object of the mind in pursuing a virtuous or vicious course , is not the pleasure or pain that attends it , but something entirely different , such as the conferring a benefit or inflicting an injury . The motive , therefore may be separated from all considerations of a self-regarding nature . Again , as to Bentham 's second doctrine , that a moral act is obligatory only because of its tendency to produce the greatest amount of happiness , is that true ? Before we can answer this question , it must be understood what is meant here by the word because . ' It means , either a stated antecedence and sequence , that is , that the idea of producing the greatest amount of happiness is invariably followed by the sense moral obligation ; or it means , that the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest amount of happiness . As to the former , we venture to say , that not a man in the world is conscious of the connexion implied in it , and that no parent , teacher , orator , or writer , when he would awaken the moral feelings of the persons to whom he addresses himself , ever commenced his appeal by - descanting upon the greatest amount of happiness . And as to the latter , the two ideas must either be coextensive , in which case it would be difficult to say which was the cause of the other , or they must not be coextensive , in which case there must be some actions producing the greatest amount of happiness that would not be binding* or some actions binding upon the conscience which would not produce the greatest amount of happiness ; and it is incumbent on those who maintain the theory , to detect the element which marks the difference . In neither way can it be proved that there is this relation // of cause and effect existing between the two ideas . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the notion of moral obligation . We find , upon analyzing our consciousness , and tracing the feeling that some things ought to be done and others ought not to be done , impressed indelibly upon it , that certain dispositions and affections are contemplated with a sense of moral complacency , and others with sentiments of aversion . We find , we say , the following circumstances , which seem to us to be facts : * 1st . That all sentient beings stand in various and dissimilar relations to each other , such as the relation of man to man , parent to child , brother to brother , citizen to citizen , subject to magistrate , recipient to giver , &amp;c. 2d . That as soon as these relations are apprehended by the mind , there spontaneously springs up in the consciousness a feeling of moral obligation connected with the very conception of these relations , or that certain dispositions are to be manifested toward the beings to whom we are thus related ; and 3d . That the nature of these dispositions varies with the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same generic feeling of obligation , or ought to do , which on all occasions asserts its supremacy as the guiding and controlling feeling in the healthy mind . According to this statement , the sense of obligation is a part of the human constitution , not to be traced beyond it , and having for ' its authority the simple fact that we are so made . It is evidently not derived from the idea of the greatest amount of happiness , for whoever contemplates actions simply as useful , or as right , is conscious of a very dissimilar feeling in regard to them . No one that has noticed the interior workings of his own mind could fail to have marked the difference , and to have formed as distinct a conception of it as he has of the distinct sensations of hunger and of thirst . This feeling , then , having a real existence , is capable of becoming a motive , and a motive acting independently of all notions of pain or pleasure . Whoever has experienced how often it sets itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the power of its workings . It acts as the great antagonist of the inferior forces of the soul . An intense and dubious *truggle is incessantly waged between it and the swarms of our grosser appetites . If it be allowed to be overcorne , it is turned into an avenging monitor , shooting arrows of keen remorse : but when it conquers , it is the angel of peace , shedding its soft influences over and irradiating by its genial smiles the depths of the inmost soul . There are now , and there have been in all ages of the world , men in whom the sentiments of benevolence , the love of friends , devotion to country , have been never-failing springs of action , invincible by all the motives of self-interest which could be brought to bear against them ; men who in the accomplishment of a lofty purpose would pass days and nights of pain and labor , who would // sacrifice without regret the most cherished gratifications , to bring aid to the needy , or balm to the distressed ; men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much quickness as the instinct of a pure woman shrinks from the approach of contamination ; men who in a contest for principles would spurn the suggestions of self-interest with an instant scorn , and who would relinquish property , comforts , rank , children , and friends , with joyful alacrity , before they would surrender one jot of their faith , or compromise in a single point the integrity of their aims . There are now , and there have been in all ages of the world , and in every nation , men who have kept loyal to duty in the midst of the frightfulest tortures which human ingenuity whetted by malice could inflict : men who , when nailed to the stake , while around them the faggots have crackled in the flames , when the devouring jaws of wild beasts have been opened for their destruction , when their limbs , by a cruel variety of infernal mechar*ism , have been torn piecemeal one from the other , have preferred the serenity of rectitude to an escape from the most terrible sufferings , crowned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted death rather than lose honor , or tarnish their innocent consciousness by the indelible stains of injustice or untruth . Here is the leading and radical defect of Bentham 's moral teachings . He takes no account of this deep-seated sense of right , so wide and irresistible in its influences over the volitions of human will . Utility , as the mere standard and test of morality , in some degree serviceable in general reasonings , is confounded with the feeling of moral approbation , which should be the immediate and direct incentive to all moral action . That all good acts have a beneficent tendency , that temperance , fortitude , generosity , justice , truth , produce the happiest consequences both to the agent . and to society-that whatever we feel to be virtuous would be beneficial if performed by all men under the same conditions-that the disposition to confer happiness is accompanied by a feeling of moral complacency-in short , that the production of the greatest amount of good is an inseparable quality of virtue-we might admit to be among the established facts of moral science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive with which virtuous acts are to be performed , and not for the sake of the virtues in themselves , we can not admit . It strips virtue of its very character as virtue , and sinks it from an end into a means . No man who is bold because it is more dangerous to be cowardly , is a brave man . No man is benevolent who distributes pleasure , not because it is virtuous , but because it is reputable . No man is just , who acts impartially , not because it is right , but because it is safe or commanded by the laws . Virtue is an imperious goddess exacting service for her own sake , and not permitting it when performed for more remote objects . The moment the motive is divided , the worshi*p is no longer acceptable , and , innocent as it may apparently be , is in her // sight impure . She must be loved , reverenced , and pursued with a single aim , or her advantages can not be realized , nor her blessings merited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , is accompanied by the worst effects on the cultivation of moral character . It is to diminish that intrinsic pleasure which always attends the performance of a virtuous act . It weakens the force of those habitual feelings which are the best promoters of rectitude and probity . It supplants a strong present motive by a more distant , and consequently weaker , inducement . It renders moral judgments uncertain , fluctuating , and difficult . It opens the heart to the more easy approaches of seW-delusion . It shifts the attention from the interior impulse to the bare outward act . It enables the selfish and unamiable passions to mingle themselves with less probability of detection among nobler impuises-tendsAto justify wrong actions under the disguise of expediency-allows too broad a discretion in the application of moral rules  --  and admits too readily of the passage from the consideration of general , to that of particular and specific , consequences . No man who makes pleasure his chief aim can give a full developement to his character , or form an adequate notion of the great purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ciety . But these ol*jections do not apply in all their force to the principle of utility as it operates in the province of the legislator . It is true , the legislator , like the moralist , must place himself under the guidance of the immutable principles of justice . lie must obey the instinctive dictates of that moral faculty in which are laid the foundations of all righteous law . Justice , eternal and unchangeable justice , is to be his supreme aim , in establishing the relations of the state . For he legis .. lates , not for himself , but for a community , and a community which presupposes , in the very meaning of the term , a collection of conflicting interests and of equal claims . He adjudicates between a host of widely various rights ; is to neglect none , infringe upon none , and favor none ; yet is to distribute the advantages of law over a wide space , and among a multitude of competitors . How can he discharge his duties impartially ? How is he to ascertain what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is permanently right from that which is for the time only expedient ? Here is the difficulty . Here the necessity for some general rule of legislation begins  --  the necessity for some external invariable standard , some test , some guide to direct him in his perplexities , and to preserve him from shifting , uncertain , and confused decision . Now we know of no better rule , than that which insists upon producing the highest good to the greatest number of people . Government is an instrument for executing the purposes of society . Society is composed of an ag .. gregate of individuals , each having his distinct objects and solicitous about his own welfare . In consenting to any government , each man // wishes it to accomplish the highest good for himself ; if , therefore , it secures the greatest good of the largest number , it comes nearest to the perfection of its design . It legitimates itself when in all its action , in all its arrangements of even the minor details of law , it keep 's true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this notion , Bentham has achieved his noblest triumphs . He has carried it with him into all his inquiries , has resolved by it all his difficulties , and has made , as Macauley remarks , a science out of what was before a jargon . It were difficLilt to describe at length the extent and value of what he has done . Unless we should follow him through all his researches , . and in that way compose a volume instead of penning an article , n* adequate notion could be given of the research , profundity , variety , and usefulness of his labors . To enumerate all the inconsistencies he has detected , all the errors he exposed , all the crudities he destroyed , all the false maxims he rectified , and all the truths he established* would be a herculean task quite equal to his own capacity , and certainly too much either for our ability or our space . We should say , however , that his services might be summed up in general terms under the following heads : 1 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself no small service . He found the English law what blind usage , occasionally altered by hasty legislation , and from time to time corrected by fettered judicial decisions , with such improvements as professional writers added , had made it . It had come to be what it was piecen*eal , irregularly , without order or system . Founded in the first place on the feudal relation , it retained the feudal spirit long after society had outgrown its barbarisms . One stage of civilization succeeded another , but the law had not kept pace with the change . A warlike people had become an industrious and commercial people , but there was no introduction of laws fitted to their new relations and new modes of exister1ce. * Whatever alterations took place , were made by forced applications of old rules , or by new rules brought to square with the-old , though confused . Here a part would fall into disuse , and make a huge hiatus in its theory . There a portion would be knocked off , in the struggles of society to enlarge itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The courts would strain a point one day , to adapt themselves to the growing wants of a more active and refined state of human intercourse* and the legislature would strain another point another day , either to rebuke or justify the courts . Thus , construction was heaped upon construction , evasion followed evasion , one fantastic fiction became the excuse of a fiction still more fantastic , amendment trod upon the heels of amendment , until the whole mass seemed like a vast pile of rubbish , or rather like some // of those ancient structures which are seen in Italy , with here a broA ken column , there a shattered portico , in the third place a crumbling roof , but the whole grotesquely stuck together with plaster and wood , to make a modern habitation . In the entire course of its existence , there had been no attempt to remodel it , or bring its parts into more perfect symmetry and shape . Of the thousands that in every age devoted their lives to the study of it , no one cared to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who read it , read it to learn what it was , and not to inquire what it ought to be . rrhose who wrote about it , wrote as expositors and not as critics . All the publi ' cations put forth concerning it aspired to no higher character than that of digests , abridgments , commentaries , synopses , or didactic es* says . Not that its defects were unperceived , nor that its cumbrous and illogical reasonings had not forced themselves into notice , nor that its injustice had not often been felt ; for there had been solitary and distant complaints uttered from time to time on all these points . Some* times a judge in the course of a decision would diffidently suggest an improvement , and sometimes a general writer would speak in harsh terms of certain of its details . But generally the system was revered in proportion as it was absurd . Elegant dissertations , like those of Blackstone , had persuaded men that it was the perfection of reason ; ' and as few were disposed to question with any earnestness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken acquiescence where there should have been an uncompromising opposition* It was in this state that Bentham found it , when he ventured upon the opinion that it was all wrong . It was in this state he found it , when he began to ridicule its pretensions , and lash its absurdities . It was in this state he found it , when he commenced an investigation , with a view to root up its very foundations , and build the entire structure anew . He was not satisfied with the examinatioft of a single title , nor an isolated branch , but he applied an unsparing analysis to each and every part , picking to pieces , demolishing , tearing down , and building up , until scarcely a particle of the original fabric was left , and a beautiful fair-proportioned edifice rose on its ruins . Even if his efforts had been less successful , the attempt would not have been without its use . It would have broken the charm which had been thrown around the subject , it would have attracted attention from think* ing minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions more pertinent and beneficial than his own . Honor , therefore , to him , who could tear himself from the fetters of a prescriptive servitude , and familiarize the public mind to the contemplation of a formidable and gigantic reform . 2 . A more essential service rendered by Bentham was his mode of setting about his work . He began , not in a hap-hazard way , destroy- * The attempts of Bacon and Hale are no exceptions . // ing wantonly whatever seemed to him unworthy , but in obedience to a regular and consistent design . His method was not novel in itself , although it was original in its application . It was essentially the same method which for more than a century had been the glory of physical science . It was in another form the observation and induction of Bacon , the method which rejected authority , which dismissed sophism , which labored for precision , which investigated facts , which put questions , in Bacon 's own expressive phrase , to nature . He settled in the outset his guiding principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the minutest parts of his subject . One of his profoundest chapters is that in which he expounds the false methods of reasoning used in legislation . He showed that there is but one right reason , and that the authorities on which jurists commonly relied were animproper dependence . He showed that antiquity , though it might create a prejudice in favor of a law , was not a reason for it ; that the sanctions of religion , such as those cited from the Old Testament in the famous work of Algernon Sidney , were not reasons ; that an arbitrary definition , such , for instance , as that with which Montesquieu opened his great treatise , was not a reason ; that metaphors , like that of the English jurists as to a man 's house being his castle-that a fiction , that certain offences , for instance , work a corruption of blood-that a fancy , such as Cocceiji 's as to the right of a father over his children , because they were a part of his body-that antipathies and sympathies arising irt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the thousand-and-one laws of nature that were spoken of-were not reasons , but mere pretences put forth to escape the obligation of deciding upon measures according to their good or evil tendency . In rejecting the pretexts by which the law , as well the good portions of it as the bad , were defended , and enforcing against himself with rigor the strict rules he had prescribed , it becasne necessary for him to take the whole body of'the law in parts , to dissect its vessels , articulations , and muscles ; to penetrate the mysticism which had all along enveloped its logic ; to examine its generalities in detail ; to uncover its secrets ; to inspect the maxims which had grown gray in its service ; to probe the fictions interwoven through its entire texture ; to compare piece with piece ; and to prove the whole by reducing it without mercy to the test of impartial reason . He found it encumbered with useless forms , fettered by arbitrary precedents , abounding in flagrant absurdities , and pervaded by an unwise and pernicious spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silly affectations ; of intricate and conflicting provisions ; of defective and artificial arrangements ; of capricious rules ; of quibbles , subtleties , refinements , and tyrannical technicalities . These he fearlessly exposed , and left them to the taste and judgment of his readers . 3 . But not content with pulling down so conglomerous a mass , he went to work with indomitable energy to the task of putting np something in its stead . In the process he taught mankind several invalu // able truths . He demonstrated that the framing of laws was a matter of practical business , to be conducted with the same good sense , and on the same principles , which plain men use in their most ordinary affairs . He took the law from the number of those objects of human study which have their roots and defences in authority , and gave it a place among real sciences-by the side of mathematics , chemistry , and general physics . He did more ; he brought discredit upon all mere technical systems , by setting before us , in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system founded upon a natural characteristic of those actions which are the subjects of law . He practically exhibited the advantages of that system , showing how it was equally applicable in all nations and at all times ; how it detected bad laws by the mere force of its arrangement , giving them no place in its nomenclature ; how it effectually excluded all barely technical offences ; how it closed the door upon technical reasonings , reasonings which only the lawyer can understand ; and how it simplified and illustrated the institutions and combinations of institutions that compose the matter of legal science . The superiority of the natural system is one which the philosophical jurist must instantly recognise . It has the same advantages over others that the botanical arrangement of Jussieu has over that of Linmeus , substituting the unity , simplicity , and beauty of nature for the inexact and often bungling contrivances of art . A lawyer merely , one educated to the intricacies of his profession , whose knowledge of law has no reference to it as a complete and harmonious code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached and scattered fragments to be found in the complicated decisions of the courts , but minds accustomed to just and philosophical modes of thinking will find their attachments fastened to more consistent and symmetrical airangements . Nor will they esteem the labors of Bentham in this department of trivial importance . 4 . Had he done no more than demonstrate the possibility of LEGAL CODES , he would have accomplished a great good . His views in this respect are peculiarly original and just . He has shown how it was practicable to make a code which should reduce all the laws of a country into a body of written enactments , coming directly from the legislator , and adapted to the immediate guidance of the judge in the decision of all the various cases falling under his cognizance . This , of course , embraced much more than had been included in the codes suggested by the eminent jurists , of either ancient or modern times . The code of Justinian , admirable as it proved as a digest , was nothing more than an attempt to bring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tribonian , and those who were engaged with him , merely undertook to make a more compendious arrangement of what was found in the Rescripta Principium , the Edicta Pra*torum , the Leges et Plebiscita , which they regarded as the established rules of the State . Nor did the code of Frederic , designed for the // Prussian monarchy , nor even that of Napoleon , aspire to a much higher character . The latter , which is the most perfect of all , and a vast improvement upon the old French law , fails , in leaving its meaning in many instances to be determined by the decisions of the judges , which in time accumulate precedents , and make the study of the science a matter of as immense labor as that of the common law of England . It did not contain within itself a definition of its own terms , nor an accurate and appropriate classification of its parts . 3eutham 's idea went farther than this . A code in the true sense , he thought , should be one comprehending whatever was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraneous or adventitio.us aid , the will of the legislator ; which should possess , if we may so term it , the power of self-interpretation ; and which should make provision for its own improvement and correction . In his plans for the codes of Ru*sia and the United States , he endeavored to realize this general theory , by showing of what parts a code should consist ' , and the relation of the parts . But the nearest actual approach to his own notion is effected in the Penal Code , prepared by the Law Commissioners of Great Britian for the government of India , published in 1837 . Whoever will consult it , will discover , if not a thoroughly unexcep .. tionable code , one that proves the practicability of codification , and the beauty of an orderly and systematic arrangement . How it has operated practically we are not informed , but have no doubt of its success from the fact that it combines , as the framers of it state , the advantages of a statute book and of a collection of decided cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something better than the miserable jumble of rules called law , to be found in most nations of the civilized world . 5 . Be the opinion , however , what it may in respect to the practicability of codification  --  and we know that many , even among law reformers , are dubious-it must be conceded that Bentham , by the enthusiasm with which he prosecuted his task , if not by any actual success , kindled a spirit of active inquiry on this subject , which is working in the bosom of society with more and more power to this day . Commencing with the private student and the philosopher , it has gradually stolen its way into houses of legislation . At first Dumont , then Mill , then Romilly , then Brougham , and thea less conspicuous men , caught the genial fire of the great mastei , and by a series of unsurpassed exertions , in the midst of scorn and opposition , directed public attention to the mighty truths which he proclaimed . The progress of opinion , it is true , has been slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the general worship of authority , in the pride and indifference of the legal profession , and in the stubborn habits of society , we are somewhat surprised at that which has been already accomplished . We were struck , in reading a late English work , * at the // number of changes which had been almost imperceptibly effected . Of these may be enumerated the alterations of laws , materially improving the relation of debtor and creditor , diminishing the number of oaths , softening the penalties , and ameliorating the spirit , of criminal law , simplifying the proceedings and forms of pleading at common law , defining more distinctly the rights , duties , and revenues of ecclesiastical persons , consolidating statutes , and harmonizing and modernizing the barbarous provisions of the law of real property . All these we attribute indirectly to Bentham , because his was the seminal mind from which the movement sprang . What may be the result in after ages , the progress of time will reveal . Our confidence is that his genius is destined to still nobler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an enumeration of the services of the same great mind , what ought to have been insisted on before , that he has done much toward establishing the true functions of government . He has stated with more clearness than any preceding writer the real objects of civil law , and the best methods of attaining them . If he has not carried his ideas to the extent to which American statesmen are disposed to push their theories of government , he has made a near approximation to it . Indeed , the most radical of American statesmen can find much instruction in what he has uttered on this head . Law of any kind he regards as a retrenchment of liberty , and is consequently never to be imposed without a sufficient and specific reason . For there is always a reason against every coercive law in the fact that it is an attack upon the liberty of the citizen . Unless , therefore , he who proposes a law can prove that there is not only a specific reason in favor of it , but a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his province and invades the rights of the individual . Again , he says , the single aim of the legislator should be to promote the greatest possible happiness of the community . But happiness is increased as our sufferings are lighter and fewer , and our enjoyments greater and more numerous . As the care of his enjoyments ought , however , to be left entirely to the individual , it becomes the principal duty of government to guard against pains . If it protects the rights of personal security , if it defends property , if it watches over honor , if it succors the needy , it accomplishes its main purposes . Government approaches perfection in proportion as the sacrifice of liberty on the part of the subject is diminished , and his acquisition of rights is increased . Can the most rigid democrat carry his own theory much farther ? Adopt these principles in legislation , and would they not lead to all those results for which he contends ? Would they not simplify government until it became what it ought to be , a mere instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not abolish all partial legislation , root out exclusive privileges , destroy monopolies , prevent the granting of acts of special incorporation , do away with unequal laws , and leave society to its own energies and // resources , in the conduct of its business and the prosecution of its enterprises ? And this is all for which the great democratic party , th' party of progress , is striving . It seeks to direct government to its true ends , to restore its action from the partial direction that has been given it , and urge it on to the accomplishment of those general objects , for which alone it was instituted , and which alone are compatible with the rights , the interests , and the improvement of man . Bentham himself , it must be admitted , has sometimes departed from these objects , but only when he violated unconsciously his own fundamental principles . We dave dwelt longer upon these topics than it was our intention when we begun , and longer we fear than the patience of the reader will excuse . We have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have endeavored , in our own feeble way , to kindle the interest of others . If we have quickened the purposes of any to engage in the great study of law-reform , the time has not been unredeemed . It is a great subject , connected with the best interests of society and men , and worthy of the patient labor of the noblest minds . We know of no way in which the intellect could be more profitably tasked , or the purest sympathies more suitably indulged , or the firmest moral purpose more honorably tried , or greater good conferred on men , or a richer harvest of reputation reaped , than in prosecuting and applying the lofty inquiries which Bentham so auspiciously commenced . The law is yet a fallow field , covered with stubble , thorns , and weeds . There are many briars to be rooted out , many excrescences to be pruned , many decayed branches to be lopped , and many vigorous and wholesome shoots to be ingrafted upon its more ancient and withered trunks . What obscurities perplex its theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its practice ! How numberless the absurdities which disfigure the statute-books ! How aristocratic the spirit of much of its reasonings ! How expensive , wearisome , and disastrous the greater part of its proceedings ! Would any one confer a blessing on the poor , let him shorten its delays , and diminish its costs . Would any one spread peace among men , let him simplify its rules and make certain its decisions . The law is a science of mighty influence and vast extent . It is the prolific source of evil or of good . It is the instrument of the oppressor or the defender of the oppressed . It is the handmaid of virtue or the pander of vice . It mingles with all our business , with our pleasures , with our solitary studies , and with our social intercourse . When righteously administered , it is the great guardian spirit that guides the most important earthly relations of man . It watches over society when it slumbers , and protects it when it wakes . It confirms order , secures peace , encourages virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinies of the human race . How important , therefore , that it should at the same time establish justice ! A // worthier name could not be achieved than by taking part in the effort to correct its abuses , to remedy its defects , to symmetrize and I ) eautify its whole structure , to conform it to the image of immutable justice , and to enshrine it in the centre of the Temple of Truth , where it is now permitted , we fear , to occupy only the outer courts . There may be more dazzling , but there are no more honorable or useful spheres of exertion than in the department of LAW REFORM.
