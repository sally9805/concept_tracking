Main text Scene 1st  --  A Garden . FATHER . FATHER . She comes , my Isadore , how large the claim , The double claim , she lays upon my care For her sweet self , and almost dearer still , As her pure mother 's dying gift of love ! How rich the rose is opening on her cheek ! Not the red rose 's hue , but that soft dye That slowly fades like morning clouds , which melt In mottled softness on the whitening heav'n . Her chestnut locks float in the sunshine free ! Her soft blue eyes , deep in their tenderness , Reflect all beautiful and kindly things . She would seem infantile , but that her brow In lilied majesty uptowers , and tells That lofty thought and chasten 'd pride are there ! And must I break the calm of that young spirit ? Come o'er that peaceful lake with ruffling storms ? Wake up its billowy strife , and wreck perchance The forms of hope that float above its depths ? Isadore enters . My child .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts which only yestermorn I breath 'd With sympathetic sighs and mournful tone Into her startled ear .  --  List , Isadore . ISADORE . ISADORE . I may not listen , father . I have vow 'd On the high altar of a faithful heart To be his bride , and I will keep the vow . FATHER . FATHER . But thou didst vow to purity and truth , At least its semblance , and thou wert deceiv 'd . ISADORE . ISADORE . Deceiv 'd , my father ? Look upon his eyes Where truth lies mirror 'd ; look upon his lips That speak in wreathed smiles ingenuous , And then thou canst not say I am deceiv 'd . Last eve , it was a calm and lovely one , We stood upon this garden-mound , where flowers , Sprang up like blessings ' neath our happy tread ; The moon look 'd down with that still gentle eye With which she greets young love ;  --  courage I drew From the pure beaming of her heavenly gaze , And when my hand poor Julian took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that spake Of injur 'd innocence , lit up his brow . Unjust , ungenerous Isadore ! he said , Think'st thou the nectar-beverage of the gods Could tempt me from thy love ? No , Isadore ; Perchance I might , not knowing thee , have prized A coarser joy  --  but now that thy young heart In love 's pulsation answers true to mine , Now that thy lips , blushing and faltering , Have seal 'd thy vow , I never more can stray . FATHER . FATHER . My Isadore , ' t is hard to break the wreath , That buds and twines around a faithful heart . But , dearest , love has blinded thee , nor canst Thou see the incipient form of woe . His words , Heartless to me , like oracles arrest Thy listening ear ; his eyes with revel glazed , Seem but to thee bright orbs of hope and truth . Arouse thyself , my child , awake , awake ! Thou'rt folding to thy heart a serpent 's coil , And thou wilt feel its sting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying mother 's breast , Her last sad gift , and nurs 'd thy feeble frame ; Who watch 'd thy gentle slumbers , and on whom Thy first smile fell like dawning light from heaven , When with the ray of young intelligence It broke its infant chaos ; I who saw Thy little feet , and heard thy shout of joy , When with a tottering step thou gain'dst my arms ; I , who perceiv 'd thy rich and active mind Ope to high culture ; and to whom indeed No longer child , thou hast become a friend , Shall see thee chain 'd for aye , ( nay , I must speak , ) To one , who , caught by sensual , low desires , Knows not the precious value of the pearl Which melts within his coarse and turbid grasp . ISADORE . ISADORE . Father , ' t is not that any girlish pride , Low principle , or tendency to wrong Enthrals me , that I cling to Julian thus : I gave my heart to virtuous love  --  but if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him aught that virtue shall condemn , I pledge myself to cast him from my heart As lightly as the vessel flings the spray That gathers on its prow .  --  Think'st thou thy child , Whom thou hast train 'd with strong and upward hopes , And clothed with faith as armor , and inspired With trust that that high spark thou call'st her soul Shall rise and mingle with th ' eternal flame , Will stoop to be the victim of unblest Desires ?  --  No , hear me , Heaven ! and father , hear ; If it be true , ( and O my God , if prayers And groans , and tears , issuing in troubled strife From out a bursting heart , are heard above , It will not be , ) if it indeed be true , That Julian seeks the reveller 's haunt , I vow To thee , who , having fram 'd the mind , dost claim Its homage , that these lips shall proudly spurn His cherish 'd name . Spurn , did I say ? Ah no ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me still , but I will loose , Gently and firmly from my fetter 'd soul , Their twining hold ; yes , father  --  though I die . Scene 2d  --  the Garden Mound  --  Sunset . ISADORE . ISADORE . ' T is done , and I am free  --  so is the oak O'er which the storm with lightning wrath hath sped And left a ghastly pile  --  so is the wave , The cold and midnight wave , that tosses on Beneath a stormy sky  --  so is the star When clouds are drifting round its lonely path , And other stars are gone ! O , father , father , Take me to your kind arms  --  they will not sear Nor scorch me with the drunkard 's burning touch , Nor shall I hear thy unpolluted lips Pour forth the babblings of a reeling brain . Throws herself into her father 's arms . FATHER . FATHER . Heroic child ! thine was a high resolve , And followed up in nobleness of soul ! I knew thou wouldst not compromise with sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not  --  my Isadore  --  look up ; Thy father 's arms are round thee , and he knows Thy deep , deep woe . Alas , poor stricken flower , Thou wert not made for this unkindly storm ! Thy cheek is pale , beloved , pale with grief ; Distended on thy marble brow and lids ( Too sad for tears ) arise the struggling veins , And thou dost start as if some fearful task Oppress 'd thee still . Almighty ! thou who know'st The anguish 'd throes with which the youthful hand Cuts its own hopes , look down upon my child , Comfort and bless her in this bitter hour ! My prayer is heard ; she rests , and to her lips A smile , almost serene , has wing 'd its way . ISADORE ISADORE in a low tone . Father , I 've dream 'd ; and as my half-form 'd thoughts Came bruis 'd and bleeding through my riven mind , I seem 'd to grope , where in the far gray depths With waving robes , above a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd me , And eagerly I strove to reach its side , Until I saw ' Temptation ' on its brow Inscribed . Then pray 'd a voice , " Lead me not there ! " From my own heart it came distinct and calm . Again I look 'd , and there in golden hues , While floated off the form in murky clouds , Blazed the word Duty , and once more the voice Stirr 'd in my soften 'd soul , " Those whom he loves He chastens . " Charleston , S. C. 1835.
