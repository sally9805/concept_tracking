txt IT is never to be lamented when men are driven to search into the foundation of the commonwealth ; as it is necessary for the conduct of life that the divine and abstract principles of virtue should have a conscious existence in the intellect , and should be frequently agitated and discussed ; so , if we intend to maintain in their original purity and force , those ideas of authority , of right , and of obedience , upon which all government is founded , we must often reflect , and induce others to reflect upon them , in their simplicity . It is necessary to revive and fortify the spirit of the Constitution by frequent recurrence to the rights and opinions upon which it rests ; tracing these to their principles , and casting an historic glance upon those conditions of society-those exigencies of humanity-from which they took their rise , and through which they became apparent ; rights , in our own case , derived from a recognition of the imperious necessity of freedom to the full development of our nature ; principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all time , and suggested as rules of legislation from an observation of the evils that arose upon their absence . Ours is not an hypothetical government ; it was not erected upon an imaginary basis ; the first fibres of its roots can be traced backward into the darkness of primeval liberty ; its growth has been gradual through many centuries . VOL . IV . NO . III . NEW SERIES . It arrived only at its perfect and full development within the last few ages , and stands immoveable , by the accumulated strength of all its past existence . It came into perfect being , not by revolution , not by a change of principles , but by the native force of an internal life , which impelled it to throw off a foreign incumbrance , and stand free in the vigor of independant youth . It is a government of principles , not of prescription , nor of forms . Its traditional forms are few ; it did not come down to us loaded with the corruptions of former ages , to be maintained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of necessity ; it arose from necessity , and exists by necessity ; it is therefore not subvertible while its moral conditions exist . But the necessity which gave it birth is not that with which the mathematics are conversant , nor the wants and desires of the grosser nature of man . The necessity with which our laws are in accordance is of a moral nature , and can be found only in the operation of moral causes . In the course of history , philosophers observe series of events signifying the existence and operation of certain divine and moral laws , by which the superior destiny of man is distinguished above his physical and sensuous destiny . Governments founded like ours upon a recognition of of justice , of faith , of beneficence , of honor , of liberty and of constancy , are imperishable governments ; and die only with the races which gave birth to them . 15 // All other governments are liable to revolution , and to one or both of the fruits of revolution , the despotism of a multitude or the despotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these extremes , it must be when the great majority of those who study the wants of the people , and act for them in the business of legislation , become so far blinded to the moral necessities of those whose opinions they guide and influence , as to substitute for them scientific theories , the dreams of humanitarianism , or the schemes of their own ambition . Fortunately for us , the number of such citizens is so great , and their equality of will so level to the freedom of all , there is little danger but that all things shall long continue as they are . It is necessary to resort to the original grounds of our government , not only when we propose any alteration in its framework , but whenever the lawfulness of new measures is contested , upon the argument that they are not specifically sanctioned by the language of the Constitution . A measure once contested upon that argument will be always contested , and will remain undecided ; majorities can not decide upon the sense of the Constitution ; since neither principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , therefore , not clearly unconstitutional , and of which the constitutionality or its contrary , remain in perpetual uncertainty and agitation , even in courts of law , must be adopted or rejected by the representatives of the people , by mere majorities ; not by forced construction , since that is met by counter construction ; nor , except for the clear construction of a law , or the showing of the spirit of a law , can such questions be referred to the supreme judiciary of the nation . Judgment is of no party , and makes no laws ; nor does it impose measures or recommend policies . Neither laws , nor forced constructions of laws , establishing principles of national economy or policy , can ever emanate from tribunals appointed by the Executive . Under the weight of such responsibilities the highest court of justice would lose its character , and become an instrument of faction or of executive usurpation . Inspired by a right sense of its own character , and attributes , and duty , the Supreme Court will declare its own incompetency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those legislators who attempt to impose their own duties upon its shoulders , " You alone are competent to this decision ; it is not for us to express the will of the people , or to regulate the public economy . Where there is law , either evident or to be liberally or morally constructed , we can point it out or construct it , but we can not make it . When the law is clear and the application difficult we will aid you ; but when the law does not exist , you must look for its grounds in the genius of the people and the necessity of the times , and not in our precedents . Nor can the authority of the Executive be appealed to for the construction of constitutional law . In cases where neither law nor precedent can serve as guides , the Executive must indeed consult the spirit of the nation ; but should that system be pursued-into which of late we have too much fallen  --  the electing of a president for the declared purpose of enforcing contested constructions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie at the mercy of executive construction ; and th' executive of to-day must become in that event the source of all power , until , after a period of four years , its authority is annihilated by another executive . By allowing the opinion of an executive to have any weight beside that which the character of worth and wisdom may bring with it , we admit the existence of a new legislative power , not recognized by the Constitution ; a legislative power which lessens with its increase the efficacy of regular legislation , and which must , eventually , absorb everything to itself . True it is , the Execu*Ive has been entrusted with a power of forbidding a hasty and clearly unconstitutional legislation ; but this power was given to the Executive , not as a law-making , but only as a regulative function . Legislative bodies may move precipitately , and illegally , since even their existence and conduct is limited by the supreme law of the land ; nor are they free themselves from an ambition which leads them continually to encroach upon the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every member 222 // of a constitutional government should be armed with a power of resistence sufficient for its own preservation ; nor do those powers which have been granted by the Constitution to each member of the government , exceed what is necessary to their independent existence . There could hardly , nevertheless , be observed a more fatal symptom , either in the conduct of a government or of a party , than a disposition manifested by them to allow the encroachment of executive upon judicial or legislative power . As it would be impossible to over-estimate the dangers which might follow upon an absorption of the power of the government by the legislative body , aiming at its own aggrandizement and the diminution of executive and judicial responsibility , so it would be equally impossible to overrate the perils , not only to State liberties , but even to individual rights , from the repeated election of a president , chosen , not for the administration of the laws , but for enforcing new and partial constructions of those laws . When , therefore , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of public economy or of national enterprise , we must withdraw ourselves from the atmosphere of interest ; we must endeavor to place ourselves in sympathy with the genius and spirit of the nation . If the Constitution is silent or obscure upon a point of authority or competency , and we are pressed for a decision , there remains no other course but to go back to our origin , and from that to trace the rise of our polity ; to observe what courses have led to aggrandizement , to peace , and prosperity , regarding always the fundamental laws as barriers and limits within which we are free to act , in all cases , as it may seem best for the nation . The Constitution does not provide for nor establish a system of political economy ; it neither sustains nor forbids a tariff or a free trade , a bank or a sub-treasury , the annexation of a State , or the extension of public aid to national enterprises . It does not forbid the establishment of slavery in new territories , nor does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating parties , whose majorities change from year to year , and whose opinions vary , as passion and enthusiasm and interest compel , must be inevitably referred for a decision to the well-ascertained opinion of the day . For the formation of our own opinions , we must go back to first principles , as we may suppose them to have lain in the minds of our founders ; and deduce , as they deduced , opinions of the propriety or impropriety of what is proposed . Let this be done by each succeeding generation , and there will arise in time , out of the united arguments and experience of many succeeding generations , a system of polity filling out the original design of our founders , extending the power of the Constitution where it is inoperative , interpreting its silence , and , in fine , executing its intention in its own peculiar spirit . Had the fathers inserted in that instrument any clause that might confer upon the general government the power of engaging in works of prospective improvement , it would have exceeded its intention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changeable sphere of opinion . If a class of powers had been given by it , under the general head of progress and improvement , authorizing Congress to appropriate funds for scientific expeditions , for the planting of colonies , for the construction of telegraphs , for the establishment of colleges and schools of science , for architectural outlay , for national roads , for the protection of commerce ; if a clause had been inserted in the Constitution providing for works intended to increase the value of public lands , by railroads opening the western territories , by the construction of harbors for the augmentation of trade , by naval expeditions to extend our commerce in the southern and eastern seas ; had these powers been directly conferred , together with an injunction upon congress to protect our agriculture and our manufactures by tariffs , to collect the dues of government in silver and gold , and to establish some particular form of bank or treasury , it would not have the force , encumbered with such details , that it now has , as a body of fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government ; leaving to the majority of the nation to determine for itself , from time to time , what works it will engage in , and what economy it will use . 1849. 223 // We conceive that the great error of our politics has thus far lain in a continual reference to the Constitution for decisions in cases of mere expediency and policy , not contemplated by that instrument . Fundamental laws can not be established , or rather , will not stand , if they are made to specify what shall , or shall not be done , in the detail of national economy . They do not point out the aims , they do not designate the purposes , the objects , but show only the right and wrong , the rules , and fixed forms of public conduct . I am not assisted by the moral law in resolving whether to engage in commerce or in manufacture ; nor can the laws of the land determine whether the people shall become farmers or artisans . That is a barbarous and unrefined minuteness in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the extent of its territory , or the shape or extent of its taxation . It is , perhaps , the most striking instance of human wisdom upon record , that our founders carefully abstained from even naming what is transient in government , and that they introduced into that instrument such things only as must always be observed while the nation continues to be a republic . Inanother view , and for other reasons , we are to rejoice that we have a Constitution so liberal and so reserved . Had any particular line of policy been recommended as beneficial by the fathers , and the recommendation clothed in the solemn and authoritative language of law , it would have given an unnatural force in that direction ; it would have given one party too great an advantage over its opposite . Had it been a recommendation to engage in enterprises of improvement , our strong overruling tendency toward new and splendid achievements would have swept us like a torrent to our ruin . With the Constitution clearly for us , that tendency would have been irresistible . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a misstep in negotiation ; and , from this single instance , we may judge into what excesses we may yet be plunged by a legislature acting under arbitrary constructions of the Constitution ; and if forced construction , even , have this power , what might we not have to fear from a general precept , advising to extend aid to every species of enterprise that seemed likely to increase the wealth of the nation . We should , therefore , be the last to advise any alteration or amendment of the fundamental law ; we would not , with President Monroe , recommend that a general sanction of the policy of internal improvements be incorporated in the Constitution , since that would be to make law the slave , instead of the guide and master of opinion ; and would be a step toward alteration and decline . It must be reckoned among the dangers to which the State is always liable , engaging too far , or in too great a number of enterprises . We prefer to draw all arguments for expenditure from its evident necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have procured to the Constitution . We do not wish to tamper with that venerable instrument . It would be a precedent full of danger and ill omen . If there be a point of policy upon which Considerate men of all parties will agree , it is on this of the inviolability of the Constitution . Ours is not yet a prescriptive Constitution , " whose sole authority is , that it has existed time out of mind . " At a moment of our history when the equal necessity of an union of all the citizens , and the preservation of State liberties became intensely apparent , it sprang into life ( almost perfect in its form ) from the brain of wisdom  --  a wisdom which , taking into view all the circumstances of the time , and being itself personally , a part of those circumstances , took the middle results of all  --  a method which left everything incomplete in the detail , and gave only the forms*and generalities ; not pretending to recommend particular policies , but providing ag*iinst the influence of any one bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of the whole . This form , impressed upon the government , and upon the nation at its birth , when a vigorous life presided in it , can not , without great danger , be altered or disturbed , as its provisions were the results of a deliberation , not upon any transient circumstances and necessities , but upon those which are fixed and lasting ; it can be altered and amended only by a wisdom , equal to that which constructed 224 L*IeP // it , in a position of equal dignity , and with an equal moderation , calmness , and unanimity . But in discussing the system of our national economy , on the other hand , we have to consider the exigency of the time only  --  the wants , desires and aspirations of the age  --  the particular benefit or injury balanced against the general interest . All this we have to consider in the light of that system of polity which has been established by the experience of our predecessors . It was not possible , in the nature of things , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general government , to the exclusion of all others not named by them , but nevertheless necessary to the existence and prosperity of the nation . It might become proper , in a moment of extreme necessity , for the people , acting through their representatives , to invest the President with a dictatorial power . It might become necessary for the same body , as the immediate agents and defenders of private liberty , to assume for themselves a certain executive authority . It might become necessary for the general government to suffer for a while unlawful encroachments upon its own authority . It might be deemed expedient to allow that clause of the Constitution which " guaranties a republican government " to every State of this Union , or , in other words , to every citizen of this nation ; to rest unapplied , where it seemed proper for the peace of all concerned , that certain men , or bodies of men , should exclude themselves from the privileges of freemen . Many cases will arise where a paramount necessity will supercede that inferior necessity which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor could the fathers have foreseen and provided for that vast increase of territory which has raised the Union to the rank of an imperial power , and has given us a dominion , and may yet farther extend that dominioii over nations incapable of free institutions . Still less could they have foreseen by what courses , in particular ages , the wealth of the nation might be increased . When , therefore , we have examined the powers of the general government , and have not been able to discover among them any clauses authorizing the appro priation of public moneys to the improvement of national harbors , to the removal of snags from rivers , to the construction of telegraphs or national railroads , we are not , therefore , to conclude , that these measures are unconstitutional , nor are we to ask , with President Monroe , for an amendment to the Constitution authorizing such appropriations . We are to inquire only whether the government was established with full powers to do all tbat is required for the common good of all , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves that the measures proposed are enterprises of national benefit , and of a magnitude exceeding the power of any individual , or of a State , to accomplish . Nor will it be a sufficient objection to any such measure , that its benefits will not be immediately felt , in an equal degree , over all parts of the Union . A railroad connecting New Mexico with the Southern States might indeed , be esteemed an enterprise of much greater benefit to the southern than to the northern members of the Union . A series of harbors along the northern frontier might increase the trade of the North and West , while it conferred only a partial and remote advantage upon the South . Appropriations for improvements must be equitably distributed with a proper regard to the commerce , the agriculture , and the defense of every part of the Union . The farmer can not , at once , and by one vast outlay , bring every acre of his farm to that high perfection which it will attain in time , after many years of a divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and feeble manuring of the whole , through successive seasons , produce that desired fertility which he may communicate by confining his outlay and his labor for a time to separate portions . II . The Senate . The house represents the people ; in number , and in aggregate as individuals , and as a nation . Certain persons are permitted by law , under certain restrictions , to select the members of the House . These persons so permitted , and under such restrictions , ( i. e. voters , ) represent the interests of families , individuals , busi 225 // nesses , partnerships , i. e. the aggregate interests of the entire nation , taken by villages , towns , and cities , being thus represented in the House . The Senate , on the other hand , seems to represent organized and established forms of power , and not merely bodies of contending interests . In the House of Lords we see represented the church , the judiciary establishment , and the great families ; promotions to lordships being chiefly for the maintenance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the social lords make up the body of that House . They represent the great powers , established in perpetuity by tradition and usage over the heads of the people . Formerly , we find the separate governments , the dukedoms , earldoms , marches , and counties represented there . In the Senate , as in the House of Lords , powers established in perpetuity , namely , State sovereignties , are represented ; and we see , too , that the Senate is the conservative body , and preserves the ancient liberties of States , as the House of Lords does the ancient feudalities , from popular and executive desecration . The State sovereignties stand in our government in place of lords of families , lords of church , and law lords . An election of Senators by popular choice would break down the whole system , and for a government of State sovereignties give us a mere tug of parties . The Senate would connive with the House ; senators and representatives elected on the same ticket , and answerable to the same constituents , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a useless incumbrance . The ground of aristocracy is privilege , the greatest privilege is the power of legislating for one 's self and for one 's family ; there is , therefore , not the least tincture of aristocracy in the Senate of the Union ; for there is no privilege . The Senate of the Union , though superior in dignity , yet recedes as far as possible from aristocracy in being the defender of State liberties against both representative and executive encroachments . It is the duty of the senator to consider the interests of the government which he represents . The senator of a State legislature is elevated only in his grade and respectability , above a State representative ; but a senator of the Union represents not so much a people , as a system of government , an organization ; his function is strictly conservative ; he is bound to defend at every point the sovereignty which he represents . The interests of the State from which he comes are to be defended by him against the encroaching interests of other States . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State sovereignties , perhaps the existence of the Union . In every State there is a governing body , a class of able and efficient men , who draw to themselves by merit , by property , by ability , and the arts of popularity , all the offices of government . These men , from motives either of interest , of ambition or of patriotism , make state affairs their proper care . They are the guides , the advisers , and defenders for the time of the people , while the people respect them . They ascertain the desires of the people , ascertain or imagine for them , their wants and wrongs , and originate for them all laws and measures of redress . They originated popular constitutions , and they advise or flatter , or persuade the people , that they are good and suitable . These constitutions establish certain offices and functions to be filled by men who make politics and offices their business . These constitutions appoint also certain citizens to a certain inferior function ( from which such persons only are excluded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of voting or electing certain persons to fill the higher offices , or in other words , to exercise more responsible functions , than those of a voter or elector . The system of the higher offices of a State , being a body of functionaries appointed for the welfare of a particular portion or division of the whole people , and having the enflre control over the internal and domestic economy of that portion or State , constitutes a perpetual corporation , with a peculiar interest , a peculiar prejudice , and a peculiar pride . This power , or system of powers in each State , represents interests often adverse , and even hostile to those of other States ; it is , therefore , absolutely necessary , that in the general system of the government these State interests and rights should receive a full and powerful representation , lest in course of time they should *26 *pep1*. // be neglected and forgotten ; and , exasperated by contempt , should draw off the masses from their allegiance to the government of the whole . It need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senators defending with vehemence the institutions of the States of whose politics and customs they are the representatives . While these polities and customs exist in a State , the senator is bound by every law of honor and of duty to defend them against aggression . And , however much he may lament their existence , he must not allow them to be interfered with , by strangers , or even vilified without defense . Nor is the senator less bound by virtue of his office to prevent inequitable appropriations of the public means . Should it appear to him , that an unjust preference had been given to the citizens , or to the government of one State over another , or to one section of country over another , it is his peculiar duty to prevent such unjust appropriations , in as much as he represents a body to whose care the dignity and property of his State had been entrusted . But , while the senator must be continually on the watch for the interests and the dignity of his State , there is no reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the test of unconstitutionality . Many measures may be be unjust , and yet constitutional . It may be unjust to forbid the introduction of slavery into a new territory , and it may be at the same time constitutional . The improvement of the Mississippi river may be a great hardship to the Eastern States , but the Eastern States will never oppose such improvements , on the ground that they are unconstitutional . Southern senators may oppose the appropriation of money for the protection of maritime commerce , by ships of war , and naval expeditions ; they may even oppose the opening of national harbors for a commerce and revenue upon the Northern lakes , but they are not obliged to account for this opposition by a constructive unconstitutionality set up against these measures . III . Political Economy . The occupations of a civilized people , divide very naturally into several kinds , represented in the primeval States of the Old World , by as many political castes or orders . Although the division of a people by castes , is no longer tolerated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations in society , still the occupations themselves remain as they were founded by nature . They have each their peculiar genius and necessities , and it rarely , if ever happens , that the same person excels , or is successful in all . The first and most remarkable occupation is that of instructors and schoolmasters , of every rank and degree , from the good dame who teaches children the A , B , C , to the great savan who developes the mysteries of life , and the harmony of the heavenly spheres . The importance of this order of persons to the State need not be dwelt upon . They are not the least influential body in the present condition of society . They include also , philosophers and metaphysicians . The next who attract our attention are those who cultivate and appeal to the imagination and the feelings , including all that are employed in the offices of worship and religious instruction . These include also , professed poets , and inventors of fiction , and all whose occupation is to affect the moral nature through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the poetical form , and the teachings of religion are oftener conveyed by figures , symbols , and parables , than by direct proof ; so that it becomes necessary to place the occupation of priest , clergyman , and man of letters , under one head ; and in the greatest examples they are united in one ; the literature of some nations , that of the Hebrews for instance , is exclusively religious . Artists are also of this order ; and in the political system of Egypt , we find the priests , artists , poets , and architects , int*luded in one caste , called the Sacred Order . Next in order we notice the artisans , mechanics , and men of business , ( who are also the most numerous , in the present system of society , ) including all who practice any art or handicraft for the physical comforts of man . This order includes manufacturers , seamen , agriculturists , gardeners , inventors , bankers , tradesmen , merchants , negotiators , agents , and those who are devoted wholly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construction // in the arts of peace ; under this division it is also necessary to include statesmen and those who manage affairs of public economy . Statesmen , as affairs now are , seem to be merely the great business men of the country , who assist or who impair manufactures , agriculture , and commerce . The fourth class of occupations is that of military and police , and all that is concerned in the private and public defense , whether of life or property . The courts of law , with all that belongs to them , fall under this head , as well as the army , navy , and all those dangerous services , which require the arts of defense , offense and inquisition . At the head of those stand the greater offices of the land and of the military state . Last in order we have domestic offices of every kind , from the seryice of the kitchen , to the offices of the public health , or command of a royal household . Those whose example governs the manners , customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely social influence , stand first in this rank . Although , in the general idea of human nature , every human being is regarded as containing all the knowledge and capacity for the exercise of every occupation of every order , yet , in practice it happens that individuals are engaged permanently or for the time , in but one occupation , as of science , worship , business , police , or social duty . The castes always exist ; though their members are continually changing . Though it might be justly regarded as an injurious and impossible attempt to class men by their occupations , every man being capable in his nature , unless his mind be abortive or deformed , of exercising all the occupations , yet , it can do no harm to regard these occupations themselves as fixed , and as having each a certain character and value when compared with others . The most intense admirer of equality prefers the occupation of a sage , in whom the philosopher and the poet are combined , or that of a hero who unites the warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman who sees his own in his country 's prosperity ; to that of a sutler or fisherman . The man indeed is neither statesman , sutler , or fisherman ; his occu pation is accidental , and he may leave it to-morrow ; all that we ask of the man , is that he shall not engage in a business for which he is incompetent , or remain in any occupation too great or too heavy for his abilities . The opinion of castes and ranks , by which a person is confounded with his occupation ; and by that treatment degraded into a machine , to the total sacrifice of his liberty , is not to be tolerated , even in idea ; and it is certainly better that men should exercise several trades , as is commonly done in New England , than lose their liberty by an hereditary devotion to one . It is necessary to the free and manly character , that it should have tasted several kinds of life ; enough at least to know their pains and their pleasures , their advantages and disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in agricultural , mechanical , and commercial affairs , we are apt to value him above one who knows only one of these . It is this versatility of intellect that distinguishes a free from a stupid and slavish people ; and in this Americans take the greatest pride . After enumerating all the occupations , and observing in what forms human industry is obliged to develope itself , and after admitting that a complete and perfect m*n , or family of men , would be masters of all occupations and conditions , at least in their principles , our natural pride leads us a step further , and we say , that NATION5 also , should be complete and perfect , and should take care to have all the occupations well and ably exercised by their own citizens . A nation should scorn to become a mere herd of shepherds , or tribe of artisans ; it should not narrow its ability to the exercise of any one art , trade or business , but should fill out the circle of industry and make itself the complete and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal . It should desire that all its energies attain a full development . In all civilized nations , the occupation of a learned man , or teacher , has been held superior in importance and reputation to all others . For , of this order of occupations , the lowest grade is more reputable than the lowest of any other , as the dame schoolmistress is a person of more trust than the ordinary domestic , or than any other in the inferior occupations of 228 *e ; . // life . So , also , the complete savan , such for example as we have in modern times in the person of a Humboldt , or a Cuvier , is*of the first repute ; not excelled in his occupation-which is that recommended by Lord Bacon as the best a wise man can engage ia-by any , however eminent , of the other orders . The contempt that falls upon such teachers as remain in the vulgar routine of schooling and flogging , is itself a proof of the superior importance of the teacher 's office ; the mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tutor by comparison with his business . We run little risk of contradiction in saying , that this caste of occupations are by far the most important and valuable that can employ a reasonable being ; and that a citizen who feels a proper pride and enthusiasm for his nation , will protect and favor , in every way , the office of the teacher and the man of science . The most important office , in the kingdoms and republics of the Old World is that of minister of public instruction , and the most perfect instrument of good government and progress is the system of schools . Our State governments are incomplete , while they remain without a beaurean of education ; the commission to be chosen out of the best men of the State , and commanded by the people to observe such care in erecting a system of education for their children , as if the fate of the Republic depended chiefly upon their wisdom and integrity . The creative , conservative , and beneficent energy of a popular State , discovers itself in nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth of the country are bound together and nationalized . As a part of our polity for the fusing together and organizing of the incongenial elements of our society , schools are evidently the most effectual . But creation is not the sole function of a beneficent power ; protection and conservation to all interests , to life and liberty , to health , and to free opinion , to industry and genius , is equally a fundamental duty of government ; more especially in a government like ours , conducted under the eye and influence of the people themselves , and subject to their approval or condemnation . " A political society is a moral person , " with all the rights and powers of freedom and wisdom . Self-preservation is its first law , and to sustain and protect itself a first necessity . The whole system of a free government is founded on the necessity of protection and self sustentation . It is therefore the obvious duty of the people , not only to favor the education of youth , but to protect them from corrupting influences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and converted into good citizens , it is also necessary to protect them against evil education , and against such influences as will make them bad or discontented citizens . The purpose of education being to render the mind of the nation , ff we may so speak , free and complete within itself , producing all knowledge and inventions within itself , and relying upon itself for direction and guideance in the study of nature , and of the works of human and inspired intelligence . A people to whom the occupations of the scholar and of the savan are a mystery and a wonder , or which does not produce within itself both scholars and men of science , will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are . Such a half-educated people endued with a natural , unfed desire of knowledge , may be so inveigled and robbed of their common sense , by ingenious foreigner*s , that they will surrender up their very purses and business to foreigners , under the persuasion of a mere theory . The people being in the strictest sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Statewhich is a formal expression of universal justice , as they understand it , and which is one in essence with the law of nations and the law of conscience , have rightfully invested their government with a two-fold power , namely that of protection , and that of beneficent aid and creation . They provide in their laws , not only for conservation of the existing order of things , against which it is treasonable to conspire , but for the good of future generations , by the establishment of schools and the construction of harbors , roads , and public works . Setting aside all controversy about the powers of the general government , in regard to works of internal improvement , neither the right or duty of the State governments to provide such works , or that of cities , towns and villages , to erect build- // has ever been contested . Government is really invested with a prospective and creative as well as a protective and conservative power . Could it be shown , for example , that in time of war certain persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time of peace certain persons were engaged in exciting revolt , the protective and conservative power may be employed to stop them . Or could it be shown that the inhabitants of a State were about to establish a hierarchy , and abolish the republican forms , the conservative power of the higher government may forbid them . In all its functions the State represents the moralperson , excluding all that is individual or partial , when it looks toward the citizen , and admitting all that is individual and partial when it looks towards other nations . The first exercise of the beneficent powers of government , which we considered , was in the establishment of schools , for the sake of preserving and continuing the Republic , by the effects of education . The second looks toward religious matters , and toward literature and the arts . In these two particulars , namely , in maintaining the right of opinion , against persecution for conscience sake , and the liberty of person against unjust wars , and private or public violences , under whatever name or authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds of our own Constitution can not be distinguished from those of the law of nations and of conscience , our State as a moral person , extends the same rights to other nations , acknowledged free , that it does to its own citizens acknowledged free . In these instances the protective and conservative powers appear in their perfection . The occupations of the priest , the clergyman , the minister , the missionary , those of critics , authors , and editors ,  --  in a word , of all who engage in works that rest for their value upon the public taste , belief and sentiment , are protected with a sacred care . In these occupations men are ab solutely free . Looking inward upon itself the nation observes a cold and rigid impartiality toward those of its citizens who engage in occupations of this caste . But of other nations it indulges a patriotic jealousy . It desires that its religious teachers , its artists , authors , and editors , should be its own citizens ; that public opinion should be created at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its literature should be of native growth , an offspring of native sense and genius . This is its beneficent desire ; and as far as government may justly extend its protection , that desire will extend it . The occupations of taste and opinion , resting necessarily on prejudice , will be assiduously guarded and protected by any State not sunk in ignorance or selfishness . Passing by for the moment the consideration of that protective and beneficent influence which the State is required to use over the occupations of industry , in the field , the workshop , the office , and the store ; an influence so important that governments receive one half their power and character from the mode in which it is exerted ; let us look at its operation in affairs of military and police . And here the very first feature of a free government , that strikes us , is that it employs the arms , the courage ; and the skill of its own citizens in its own defense . Those who do not understand the moral nature of a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will perhaps assure us that we ought to defend our country as cheaply as possible , and if Hessian mercenaries can be had for less wages than free citizens , we should employ them in preference . But here the protective , which is one with the patriotical sentiment , saves us the labor and evil chances of an antifree trade argu*ment ; we are not reduced to the necessity of an argument ; history and the national prejudice has set us right upon that point ; and the time must come when the protection of native labor and industry , from patriotic motives , will seem as essential to a patriotic policy as the employment of the arms and courage of our own citizens.
