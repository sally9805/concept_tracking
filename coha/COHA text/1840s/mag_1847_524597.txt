txt MANY of our readers are probably aware that the Bostonians , like the Athenians of old , are remarkably fond of hearing and telling some new thing . Cautious , practical , conservative , and therefore thriving in all matters of business and trade , they delight , apparently , in the most wild and radical speculations in morals and religion . It seems ; indeed , as if they were cherishing something which operates as a perpetual tantalization of their religious instincts , and which is likely to end either in extinguishing those instincts , or in sending them to other sources . This vague unrest naturally exposes them to various delusions and impositions ; their restlessness keeps them running , and their running only augments their restlessness . What this something is that so starves their religious nature into paroxysms , and at the same time cultivates the intellect into such an insatiable pruriency , is obviously a question that is easier asked than answered . This question we shall not attempt to answer ; we are only to remark upon the well-known fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in morals and religion no theories can spring up so eccentric and fantastical , but Boston has a crowd ready to welcome and entertain them . That the city is a perfect bee-hive of notions , has become proverbial . The people are abundantly forward ingetting up new churches , but seem quite indifferent what doctrines or opinions are taught in them ; care little , apparently , whom or what a man dissents from , provided he only dissents . Truly , Hooker bath well said , " He who goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well taught as they ought to be , shall never want attentive and favorable listeners ; that which wanteth in the weight of his speech is supplied by the aptness of men 's minds to accept and believe it . " Knowing these things , our readers will not be surprised to learn that Mr. W. H. Channing has succeeded in getting to ether a considerable flock of Seekers in oston . His flock is known as " The Religious Union of Associationists ; " the title , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the name indicates , they have adopted the writings of Charles Fourier as their gospel , and Mr. Channing as the apostle thereof . Having heard but two of Mr. Channing 's lectures , we can not pretend to have mastered his system ; nevertheless we shall presume to give some account of what we have heard , interspersing it occasionally with such reflections or our own as may seem appropriate . The farce of services enacted at this strange establishment , forcibly reminds us of the Theophilanthropists , a sect that sprung up amid the revolutionary convulsions and factions and fanaticisms of France soon after the Reign of Terror , and of which the seeds were sown by the atheistical innovators who ushered in that deluge of bloody ferocity and blubbering philanthropy . The Theophilanthropists , like the Associationists , believed in the existence of God , the immortality of the soul , and the doctrine of universal benevolence . But though substantially the same in principle , the two differ somewhat in their mode of worship ; the former placing amid the congregation a huge basket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to a eulogy on the moral virtues and the beauties of nature ; the latter using music instend of flowers , and substituting for the aforesaid eulogy a virulent denunciation of the existing order and constitution of society . Perhaps this difference is mainly owing to a change of circumstances ; the one marking the dying struggles , the other the early beginnings of irreligion by establishment ; for as atheism , when expiring amidst its own desolations , naturally tries to recall the virtues it has banished , so reviving atheism would naturally begin by exaggerating , and denouncing , and misderiving the evils it proposes to remove . What is not a little remarkable , in their singing these pious Associationists use some of the Latin words and cathedral music which so enrich the service of the oldest and richest of Christian churches . Doubtless both the words and the music are as fine as ever saluted the ear of man ; but , unfortunately , they are in such violent disharmony with everything else in the service ; so stripped of all their // natural accompaniments ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any concurrent appeals tothe other senses ; that the effect is rather ludicrous than otherwise . It is hard to say whether the whole thing evinces less sense of religion or of art . It is equally incongruous in both respects ; like using the architectural symbols of Egyptian superstition to adorn the entrance of a Christian burialground . Strange that people who have grown so very wise as to discard all approved exhibitions of Christianity , should fall into such a ludicrous violation of the most obvious proprieties of art . And is it possible that they are competent to invent a new religion , and yet ignorant that precisely what is most sublime in its place becomes most ridiculous when taken out of its place ? Truly , they must be in advance of the age ! The Associationists are evidently getting satisfied of their mistake in attempting a practical realization of their schemes . They find it much easier to invest absurd theories with plausibility , than to force nature into a co-operation with their plans . Weary , it seems , of getting up phalanxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing that their doctrines tend to make men more contented with themselves and less contented with their situation , and finding that practice is very apt to reverse this statement , they are reverting to their old method of preaching . All attempts to reduce their theories to practice have , thus far , ended in a practical reductio ad absurdam ; and since the obstinate and intractable material of human nature refuses to embody the great soul of their designs , they have no resource but to set forth that soul in its disembodied state . The thing is so very impracticable that it hardly admits of being refuted by experience ; they can not practice it long enough to ascertain whether it be practicable or not . Certainly it is very naughty in practice thus to nullify theories which it is so uncomfortable to have nullified . Fortunately , however , if the laws of nature will not permit these men to work , the aching voids in some men 's minds will permit them to talk ; and if they can not succeed in their plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide their failures . So long as they confine their wisdom to speculation , it is to be hoped that nature will not take the trouble to expose them . Christianity , according to old ideas , proceeds upon the principle , that society is wrong , because men are bad . But this , it seems , is an error which it was reserved for the disciples of Fourier to dispel ; and now we are to learn , despite some lingering prejudices inherited from our fathers , that men are bad because society is wrong . By the way , it is somewhat edifying to observe the proud humility with which Mr. Channing defers to the Scriptures . By apt selection and expurgation , he concocts certain readings from them , which , wrapped up in music sacrilegiously stolen from the Roman Catholic masses , serve to introduce his unique discourses . He evidently thinks there are some pretty good ideas in the Bible , though he has little respect for the alleged facts in which those ideas are communicated . Thus , for example , the scourge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been driven out of the temple , he understands to have been merely a strain of indignant eloquence . Of course he holds that they were treated in this way simply because they were brokers , not because they had set up their shops in the temple . Voltaire , one of the great philanthropists of a former age , said on a certain occasion , with more valor indeed than discretion , that " he was tired of hearing how twelve men had established the Christian religion , and he was resolved to show that one could pull it down . " This certainly deserves the praise of manly frankness and candor ; but we should remember that Voltaire was educated amid the lingering ingenuousness of old chivalry , which made men scorn to achieve by art and stratagem what they could not achieve in an open field and a fair fight . It is not strange , therefore , that some taint of chivalrous honor should have adhered to the conclusions of his more mature wisdom . It must be confessed that the Associationists , with commendable docility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their proceedings . Not daring openly to renounce the Bible , they adopt the more prudent method of stealing and smuggling in their philanthropic inventions under a patronizing show of respect for its principles . Thus , here , as elsewhere , they approve themselves pretty good actors ; they are not altogether unskilled in keeping up appearances ; and their false friendship , though less noble than open enmity , has the advantage of greater prudence . It would be difficult to say whether there be // more of meanness or more of wickedness in this conduct , did we not know that fanaticism , without either of these interesting qualities , sometimes does the work of them both . In Mr. Channing 's case , however , all this probably springs from a laudable desire to beguile and seduce men out of the darkness in which they are hitherto benighted . Undoubtedly his caution is needless ; for doctrines so flattering , as those he inculcates , to the worst propensities of our nature , need not the authority of Revelation to secure them a favorable reception . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience an open contempt for the Scriptures might be quite as popular as an apparent respect for them . Assuredly he who encourages us to envy others the power or the wealth of which we find them in possession , needs no authority save that of the tribunal to which he appeals . In the two lectures referred to above , Mr. Channing was mainly occupied in discovering , describing and denouncing the evils that adhere to the present order and constitution of society . According to his representation , our life is hopelessly involved in a labyrinth of sophistry ; an inextricable mesh or entanglement of fraud , falsehood and perplexity everywhere envelopes us , stifling our energies , obstructing our faculties , perverting and poisoning all the springs of good within us into issues of vice , and misery , and death . By another figure , he represented us as struggling , and wallowing , and floundering about in an impassable morass , while around us are stationed contradictory guides , calling us now this way , and now that , so that we get altogether distracted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us deeper and deeper in the mire . This labyrinth of sophistry , this web of perplexity , this mirage of evil , is generated , he says , hy the prevailing misarrangement of the social relations . Among other evils springing from this cause , he alleged the dying of a fourth or fifth of our race in infancy , and the large portions of the earth made desolate by too much heat or too much cold . In his view it is this misarrangement that generates earthquakes and hurricanes , torrid heats and polar snows , the miasmata of swamps , the venom of reptiles , the ferocity of wild beasts , and the explosiveness of gunpowder . But for this all these evils would cease , the deserts of ice and of sand would brighten up and blossom out into smiling fields for the habitation and happiness of man , swamps would exhale health , venom would become medicine , wolves would be turned into sheep , and gunpowder would burn to enlighten our minds , not to perforate our bodies . And what has human wisdom done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . On the contrary they all originate in what have hitherto been deemed the noblest contrivances of human wisdom . Does the science of medicine prevent death ? or the institution of government prevent crime ? Why no , truly . And is not the fact that it does not prevent them , sufficient proof that it is itself the cause of them ? For to say these things exist by the ordering of Providence , he regards as the height of absurdity and impiety . Mr. Channing then canvassed the claims of what he designated as the four sciences of theology , philosophy , morals and politics . And what have these boasted sciences ever done for our relief ? Alas ! instead of laboring to explode old prejudices and institutions , the human mind has generally busied itself in trying to discover and enforce the wisdom supposed to be contained in them . From our childhood we are taught rather to reverence than to investigate them , until our minds get so perverted with this sentiment as to disqualify us for the investigation . Mr. Channing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is doubtless too obvious to have escaped the reader 's notice . In a similar spirit , he took occasion to say that the distinction between theology and religion was now at length beginning to be understood and admitted . The truth is , this distinction has always been understood and inculcated as long as theology has been in existence . From the days of the apostles till the present time , theology has been viewed as a science , and religion as a life ; and the former has been used and valued as an auxiliary to the latter , on the ground that right-thinking has some connection with right-acting . If Mr. Channing did not know this fact , what becomes of his learning ? If he did , what shall be said of his honesty ? But it is the custom of certain people to take for granted that things began to exist just about the time they learnt them , and that the sun never shone until their eyes were opened . Again : Mr. Channing remarked that it was a well-known and generally-admitted principle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the surest sign of public prosperity ; and yet , said he , in face of this knowledge we everywhere see people trying to engage labor at the lowest possible rates . This is one of the inconsistencies which he charges the present misarrangement of society with forcing upon us . Probably he forgot to add , that high or rising wages are a sign of public prosperity only on condition that the employer is absolutely obliged to pay them ; and that if paid gratuitously or voluntarily , they are a sign of no such thing , but rather of the reverse . Is it in this way that Mr. Chanfling is going to guide us out of the labyrinth of sophistry in which he finds us so deplorably involved ? Thus , Mr. Channing attributes all our moral and physical diseases to infections generated in our vicious social environings . The stream of our life is rendered turbid and offensive only by the impurities which lie along the channel . How those impurities came there , whether they be a deposite which the stream originally brought from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He evidently cares less about the cause than the remedy , and considers all inquiries touching the former irrelevant to the question of the latter . Of course the remedy which he proposes , is a new division of land , and a new regulation of labor . Like his predecessor , Bubomf , sometime leader of a Jacobin conspiracy , he seems persuaded that it is useless to talk of equality in any respect , so long as men are unequal in respect of property . Unlike his predecessor , however , he has learnt prudence from past failures ; the word agrarianism stinks so abominably in history , that he can not bring his mind to pronounce it ; though he deems it his duty to get up a religious association with a view to promulgate the thing . Strange these men do not try to strengthen their cause by the authority of their predecessors . Though their theory has never been generally adopted , they might easily show that , amid the prevailing darkness , a gleam of true light has occasionally shot into the the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course might endanger their claims to originality . However , by adopting the leveling , agrarian principle , though under another name , Mr. Chanfling seems fully convinced that all the occasions and opportunities and temptations to evil , which now so sorely beset us , would be forever removed , and paraYOL. v.-uo. v. 33 dise effectually regained . The eminently Christian idea which lies at the bottom of his system is , that there is really no such thing as sin in the world , and that what is usually termed such is but unavoidable calamity ; it all springs necessarily from the evil occasions growing out of our present social misarrangement : and the idea of an evil principle in man , which , in the absence of existing occasions , would find or make others , he considers an impious reflection on our Maker . Men , he argues , go wrong simply because they are hemmed in with motives and temptations which render it impossible for them to go right : arrange the social relations so as to make it right for them to take or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their passions and anticipate all their desires , and they will go right as a matter of course , because they will have no motives or opportunities to do otherwise . He probably forgot to state , what is , indeed , sufficiently obvious to every man of sense , that , in our present state of being , these very occasions and temptations with which he reproaches the existing social order , are the indispensable conditions of virtue ; and that , though virtue is liable to be overcome by them , this liability enters into the very ground of its existence . Of course men can not do right , unless they be free to do wrong ; and the motives and opportunities so much complained of are inseparable from such freedom . The truth is , the best men , and even those whom Mr. Channing himself would consider the best , are precisely those who are most in harmony with the existing social order ; nay , it is ' the very correspondence between this order and the principles of our moral nature , that has held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement of society , though requiring , like the individuals it embraces , perpetual reformation , galls and chafes men exactly in proport ? on as they go wrong ; it is a constant terror to evil doers , and a constant praise to those that do well ; harmony with it is our surest test of excellence ; discord with it our surest test of the reverse ; as men become better , they grow more and more in harmony with it , until it comes to set easily and naturally upon them , and they dread nothing so much as to have it tampered and trifled with by quacks and demagogues . It is true , temptation everywhere meets , and doubtless ought to meet us , so long as we are temptable ; else how could we // ever cease to be so ? and our prayer should be , not that temptation may be taken away from us , but that we may not be led into it . Indeed , no man who has triumphed over it ever regrets its existence ; awl those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most need it as a trial and discipline of their virtue . Perhaps it were as wise , on the whole , to presume , what heaven and earth have conspired to teach , that the disorder which we see springs from individuals , not from the social system in which they move , and that this system operates unceasingly to readjust and restore our discordant nature into harmony with itself and with the principles of universal order . But the existing state of things constrains men to do wrong in order to get a living ? So does it teach , and successfully teach , men to prefer virtue to life ; and universally , when men have gotten the better of evil , they only blame themselves for ever having allowed it to get the better of them . True , if there were no individual possessions , there would be no temptations to theft ; but then what would become of the occasions for charity and generosity and gratitude between man and man ? If we do away marriage , we shall indeed banish adultery ; but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivise man may indeed regret the existence of sufferings ; but then he will also reflect that they are more than compensated by the sympathies which they awaken . It is true , one man 's sin often becomes the occasion of another man 's greater sin , and so does one man 's virtue of another man 's greater virtue ; nay , one man 's virtue often becomes the occasion of another man 's sin and one mane s sin of another man 's virtue . What does all this prove , but that principles of action , both good and bad , are seldom wanting in apt occasions , and that it is rather the man that determines the motive , than the motive that determines the man ? How then are we to get rid of the motives and occasions of evil , but by binding our nature up in the strong arms of necessity ? Among our greatest evils are undoubtedly to be reckoned these very schemes , to rectify the outward phenomena , without first rectifying the inward principles , of human action-schemes which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time divert attention from sources that would ; and the spasmodic overstrainings of these men to bring about radical changes everywhere save where they are wanted , namely , in the interior life and soul of individuals , probably spring from a secret repugnance to everything involving the necessity of a radical change within , not around , themselves . It is by regarding only the evil , and overlooking all the good , which their radicalisms promise to remove , that shallow innovators get so puffed up with self-importance . This is the very genius of quackery . After all , the world , as it is , is a very comfortable place to those who are willing to stay at home and mind their business , love those whom they ought to love , and engage manfully in the duties that lie nearest at hand . He who neglects these things nd too ambitiously strikes for a higher sphere of action , finds the world all wrong , and deserves to find it so ; lie will never find it otherwise , indeed , till he finds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Channing is , that he is trying to work out a theoretical solution of the great problem of evil . This we may safely say no man ever did or ever can do . Thousands , indeed , are every day solving it practically ; for evil is here to be conquered , not explained ; to be triumphed over , not anatoniized ; to develope and chasten the virtues , not to exercise and sharpen the wits . Perplexities constantly thicken upon him who resolves to do nothing but speculate and syllogize , but rapidly disappear before him who goes bravely and resolutely to work . No man can possibly see through a mill-stone ; any man , if he sets himself earnestly about it , can bore through one . Thus , great as is the problem of evil , a practical solution of it is both safe and comparatively easy ; but as every one has to work out this for himself , and no man can ever do it for another , so of course it can never be made to serve the purpose of restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , perseveringly attempts to solve it theoretically , is sooner or later brought to confusion ; he only works himself into a frenzy of speculation , until his mind loses all its fire and becomes all fury . For unless all the elements of our nature have a common object to converge and harmonize upon , they generally either die out or fall at strife among themselves . Hence it is that those who cut loose from facts and persons-objects addressed to their hearts and senses as well as their brains-  --  and surrender themselves up to abstract ideas , often exhibit such a morbid , restless intellectuality . Full , perhaps , // of logic , but empty of love , they become incapable of peace themselves and fatal to the peace of all about them . What they need is some object or pursuit which will exercise and occupy all their faculties and feelings at once ; upon which all the elements of their nature may meet and work together ; their abstractions , being food for but one of those elements , set them all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their might to get more , and fight the harder , the more they get . Thus the great principles , " which they chase so furiously and devour so greedily , only fill them with manifold unrest ; turn them into walking spasms and organized convulsions ; and the war they wage so fiercely against the world is but a projection , so to speak , of the war that wages within them . Knowing these things , we were not at all surprised , that , though Mr. Channing 's humanity is so exquisitely delicate that he can not bear the idea of a whip of cords being used to drive the money changers out of the temple , one of the lectures alluded to was a constant stream of the intensest gall ; almost every sentence overflowing with wrath and vengeance towards whatever human society offered for his consideration . Certainly no weak man could distil so much bitterness at one effort . Already , indeed , he seems to have speculated himself well-nigh into a frenzy ; all his faculties seem strained to the utmost tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , without some hideous thing , either in fact or in imagi* nation , to hate and denounce , it is to be feared that he would die or go crazy of ennui . Can he be ignorant that too much anxiety to enhance one 's light puts him in danger of blowing it out ? Like others of his class , however , Mr. Chanfling is exceedingly mild and gentle towards the breakers of law , and reserves all his violence and virulence for the makers and upholders of law . One would really think that , with these men , the first and great commandment is , to speak evil of dignities , to rail at the powers that be , and to revile the laws , the religion , and the institutions in which most of us have had the misfortune to be educated . But this is the course uniformly pursued by the " architects of ruin . " By constantly denouncing and vilifying whatever men have learnt to respect and revere , they destroy the sentiments which make them susceptible of being governed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus prepare them for a merciless despotism of force . Such is the terrible farce of hell which men have from time to time been taught to enact , by these reckless unchainers of human passion . But the " Religious Union of Associationists " is altogether an amiable establishment ; it is only sedition and anarchy organized . Mr. Channing 's idea touching the management of children is a very pretty idea . Children , says he , should never be refused anything they ask for ; their wishes ought never to be thwarted , nor their inclinations crossed . The true way to educate them into all virtue is , to let them do exactly as they please . To put restraints on their desires , is the surest way to make them selfish ; and all the perversions we see in them spring from the self-denials enforced upon them . As all their native impulses are good , and there are no bad principles inherent in them , their inclinations will all he right provided they be allowed free course ; and it is only our wicked attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this he obviously goes on the principle , that men are made selfish by whatever contradicts their self . Thus we have a very simple prescript for all juvenile instruction , which is , perpetual , unlimited indulgence ; and if a child craves an improper indulgence , we have but to open a greater indulgence in the opposite direction . Restraint , it is true , enters into the very idea of law , and law into the very idea of government ; but have we not had sufficient proof that all government , whether in the state , the church , or the family , is a nuisance ? Nothing , indeed , is so offensive to the Associationists as the idea that any man or set of men is to exercise any kind of authority ( Jver others ; and they are as fierce against the government of the majority , as majorities have sometimes been against the government of individuals . Government , indeed , of any sort , they have at length found to be an arrant absurdity ; a contrivance invented by the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the evils it professes to remedy . Whatever can not be done by the pure force of influejice , without clashing in the least with the passions and impulses of men , ought not to be done at all . Thus their idea respecting the management of children is part of a general system which is to emancipate men from // the tyranny of law into the freedom of unchecked inclination . People must be at perfect liberty , for example , to marry and to divorce themselves , precisely as their inclinations prompt , because , forsooth , we know , or ought to know , that they will always he inclined to do exactly right , provided their inclinations be freely indulged . In fact , their whole scheme of society seems hased on the profound doctrine , that if men are allowed to do precisely as they are inclined , they will assuredly he inclined to do precisely as they ought ; and that when every man is at perfect liberty to be a law unto himself , there will of course he nothing left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , " by which they probably mean that men's aversion to labor springs purely from the necessities which urge them to it , and that industry must perforce become attractive the moment men find themselves exempt from constraint . Every man , they argue , has a genius , a special aptitude , for something ; and this genius will instinctively seek out and joyfully exercise its appropriate calling , provided all pursuits be made equally honorable , and men be relieved from the pressure of present or impending want . Thus by a new regulation of labor , so as to give free play to the pre-established harmony between the faculties and vocations of men , all temptations to idleness are to be entirely removed . In this way is to be brought about the glorious harmony , known among the initiated as the harmony , not , indeed , of the spheres , but of the passions . In their Babylonish jargon , they have a cant phrase , " the sacredness of the pmsions , " by which they mean , apparently , that our passions really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our highest law , and putting restraint upon them is the height of sacrilege . Thus do we arrive at " a discipline , the law whereof is taken from passion . " So true it is , that when men have cast off authority in religious matters they are but a step from casting it off in civil matters . Law has been well defined as the collective wisdom and experience of ages of xvise and observing men ; and he who begins by appealing from this to his individual reason , will of course end by appealing from his reason to his passion ; and he must he a dull man indeed who can not find arguments to justify his passions . Here again , however , the Associationists are not without a precedent . Godwin , another philanthropic atheist of considerable distinction , informs us , in his celebrated inquiry concerning political justice , that government , strictly speaking , " is not an affair of human competence , " and that " law tends , no less than creeds , catechisms , and tests , to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute a principle of permanence in the room of that unceasing perfectibility which is the only salubrious element of mind . " It is hardly necessary to add that this same principle of permanence , which is thus urged against law and government , so far from being opposed to individual progress , is , in fact , the indispensable condition of such progress . But this is only an example of facility with which innovating theorists , who are generally as shallow as they are confident , make out things to be incompatible , which in nature are perfectly inseparable . We will not insult our readers by attempting to refute Mr. Channing 's doctrine of universal indulgence. * Assuredly no one capable of believing such things is to be reached by any arguments of ours . We will simply add , what everybody knows well enough , that indulgence to children of all ages is undoubtedly a very good thing when duly tempered with other things . In like manner oxygen is , on the whole , rather favorable to life , when combined in a certain proportion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for us , any one is so wise as to argue that pure oxygen would therefore be much better , a straight jacket and a maniac 's cell would obviously be a better prescription for him than any amount of reasoning . A small slice from Mr. Channing 's theology may serve as a dessert to the foregoing dishes . It is worthy of special remark that , in his theology , Mr. Channing does not proceed by the slow , tedious and uncertain method of induction and combi Mr. Channing 's practice , in this matter , is not quite so enlightened as his preaching . He sometimes conducts his services under lock and key ; not , indeed , to prevent the uninitiated from coming in , but to prevent those who are in from going out ; so that whoso yentttres to taste must stay till the banquet is finished . Bitt this is probably done in order to exemplify the evil and injustice of setting any external restraint on men 's inclinations . // nation from external sources ; he prefers the infallible method of educing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ideas , or , to adopt the word of an old writer , of " ideating " it from the full fountain of his own mind . It will readily be seen that this method has great advantages over the other , in that it saves him the trouble and the danger of referring to anything but himself , or of consulting any authority but his own sovereign reason , or his own inclination , which , with him , appears to be the highest reason . All the forms of evil , he says , may be expressed in selfishness . This , the prolific germ of all evil , springs from the perversion of precisely what is most inward , central , and essential in our nature . Love is the proper constituent of our being ; it is in this principle that our true personality consists . But love is essen* tially lovely , so that , as our proper self is made of love , to know ourselves is of course to love ourselves . This proper self , this lovely love , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when most forgetting itself in its object ; and is least perfect , least lovely , least itself , when forgetting the object in itself . Here then we have the proper antithesis and antagonism of self-love and selfishness ; the one the highest perfection , the other the lowest degradation , of our nature ; and the present misarrangement of society is perpetually causing self-love to pass over into selfishness . If this selflove , this love smitten with its own loveliness , were allowed the free possession and enjoyment of the object it craves , there would be nothing to generate selfishness out of it . Thus this mother corruption springs from the vicious order , or rather disorder of society which withholds those objects ; self-love degenerates into selfishness from the self-denial imposed upon it . From the nature of man , that is from himself , Mr. Channing infers and unfolds the nature of God , which is probably the samethingthatacertam German philosopher meant when he spoke of " creating God . " God , says Mr. Channing , like man , is love . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore must necessarily love Himself . Here then we have love loves love ; and this formula expresses the unity of the Divine Being . But God is infinite love , and , if so , then He is infinitely lovely , and must therefore love himself infinitely . As all his creatures are included in himself , they are also included in the love he bears himself . Here then we have Infinite Love loves infinitely an Infinitude of Love ; and this fonnula expresses the Universality of the Divine Being . This , to be sure , is very luminous , but then , as Mr. Channing justly remarked , it is also very profound , so much so , indeed , that it will not bear to be dwelt upon , lest too much light should dazzle the eye ; lest we should see , " And , blasted with excess of light , Should close our eyes in endless night . " In the foregoing remarks we are not aware of having at all exaggerated Mr. Channing 's statements , though in some* cases we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did . The truth is , his statements are so incredibly extravagant as effectually to preclude all motives to exaggerate them . Indeed , a just representation of them would almost seem a caricature , and we hardly dare reproduce them in all their original length and breadth , lest we should incur the suspicion of misrepresenting them . Should we set him forth to our readers as he set himself forth to us , if they have any confidence in us , they would assuredly think him insane ; if they have any confidence in him , they would be sure to think us insane ; unless , perchance , they be a little touched with insanity themselves . Mt . Channing , however , and his associates evince the most absolute confidence in the ultimate success of their schemes ; for who does not know , that with madness and fanaticism and self-conceit conviction is generally in inverse proportion to the weight of reason and experience ? The more difficulty others have in accepting their theories , the more confident they are of their originality , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , indeed , and the rest of us proceed on the old maxim , that truth is mighty and will prevail ; and the difference between us is , that they , relying only on their own reason , and judging altogether for themselves what is truth , argue that a thing must prevail because it is true ; while we , distrusting our own reason somewhat , and allowing time and Providence a voice in our decisions of truth , argue that a thing is true because it has prevailed . Error , it is true , is continually starting up , in one form or another , but it does not prevail ; nay , it keeps starting up for the simple reason that it can not prevail ; if , indeed , it could prevail , // the work which these men are trying to do would have been long since done up to their hands ; for however much they may flatter themselves on the originality of their notions , they may be assured that , in substance if not in form , they are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impracticable , that , to men of large stomachs and short memories , they may from time to time appear to be new . While , therefore , the rest of us are ignobly condemned to walk on the vulgar , but , as it seems to us , safe and solid ground of experience , these men enjoy the more glorious and delightful privilege of swinging aloft , and fluttering hither and thither on a web of theory spun out of their own brains - or bowels . Meanwhile , perhaps it will not be impertinent to remind them , that even so long ago as Burke 's time , there was a class of men whose brains , if we may trust his account , had become addle through vain speculation . Mr. Channing , though apparently insane , is evidently a man of fine talents and of excellent taste . Amid his feverish overflowings are occasional passages of great force and beauty , delivered in a style that would become the best of matter . He would undoubtedly seem a very strong man , did we forget how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just , and how much less of real strength is required to deal in extremes and superlatives than to be judicious , comprehensive , and moderate . Wisdom is so much more a growth than a voluntary acquisition , anddwells so much amid the sweet austere composures of life , that she need not be looked for among such gladiatorial feats of logic and rhetoric , and such glowing redundancies of virtuous indignation . These philanthropic strainings and writhings of the faculties , these rusthetic agonies and ecstacies , and these convulsive strugglings after novelty and effect , may indeed spring from " inspiration , " but they do not spring from wisdom , nor will they ever lead to it . The Furies , if we are not mistaken , were all represented as females . It is generally best to let the apples of thought ripen , and fall of their own accord ; too much haste to pluck them before they are ripe often causes one to kill the tree with too much shaking , and at the same time to breed a frightful dysentery among those for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children round her knees ; Books , leisure , perfect freedom and the talk Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk Of the mind 's business . " At first , indeed , we were inclined to be a little melancholy over the hallucinations into which Mr. Channing has apparently fallen , but we afterwards adopted the more agreeable though more questionable resolution to extract , for ourselves and our readers , what amusement we could from them . The truth is , the best minds often get some inexplicable kink into them for no apparent purpose but that we may have something to laugh and grow fat over , or to lament and grow wise over . And perhaps , amidst our growing idolatry of intellect , it is well for us to be reminded occasionally , by practical demonstration , that the noblest gifts are impotent without docility , and , in attempting to do everything , run a great hazard of undoing themselves ; that no talents however fine , no genius however splendid , can avail to reverse the laws of nature or invert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads choose to run themselves against a post , they may be useful to us as a warning , but hardly as an example . Mr. Whipple , in his lecture on " the Ludicrous side of Life , " remarks that the hideous evils which everywhere beset us would undoubtedly drive us all into insanity but for the faculties of wit and humor which , catching the ludicrous aspect of those evils , turn them into occasions of genial , wholesome mirth . He does not remark , nor does it fall within his purpose to remark , that we have another and a better resource even than this , namely , a settled faith that Providence will assuredly educe from these evils , great as they are , an overbalance of good , though we can not possibly see by what process this is to be done . For those who , distrusting everything but themselves , are resolutely bent on going by sight and not by faith , and who at the same time " hold themselves personally responsible for the obliquity of the earth 's axis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , there is obviously but little ground of hope ; so that , " Oh , what a noble mind is there o'erthrown ! " is all we can do for them . With this faith in Providence we can go to work , and thereby diminish the evils of the world by at least one ; without it we can speculate ourselves into a paroxysm , and thus add another to them . // After all , schemes and efforts to remove all the evils of the world at once oftener spring from ambition than from benevolence ; though here as elsewhere , in the deceitfulness of our own hearts , we may not he fully conscious what principles set us at work . Sometimes such schemes may he easily traced to a flagrant neglect or violation of the most sacred and private duties of life on the part of their authors . The stings of conscience arising from this cause often fill the mind with gnawing discontent , and thus engage men in fierce endeavors to convict society of the sins which themselves have committed . This course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elude the bitings of remorse , and to agitate themselves into notoriety . It was probably on some such ground as this that Dr. Johnson once remarked , that the profession of patriotism was the last refuge of a scoundrel . But especially such a misderiving of evil from external and incidental sources , as the Associationists uniformly proceed upon , argues a total unfitness for the task of alleviating it ; its sure effect , as in their own case , is , to set men upon adjusting the social relations in such a way as to dispense with , what , after all , is our only real hope , the regenerating efficacy of religion-upon getting up some wretched cutaneous appliances , to preclude the curing of our disease by removing its symptoms , and to augment its virulence by forcing it inward upon the vitals . But what , perhaps , is worst of all in the doings and teachings of these men is , their tendency to puff men up with pride of immortality , by administering opiates and anodynes to the humiliating sense of guilt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this doctrine , when disjoined from the ideas of justice and retribution with which it is naturally associated . Hence , perhaps , Mr. Channing 's philanthropic solicitude for the " dignity of human nature , " and his philanthropic apprehensions lest men should unduly compromise this dignity by carrying too much of self-distrust and self- abasement into the presence of their Maker . From some of his remarks , one would be apt to infer , that men should approach their Maker , not so much to ask his favor as to claim his respect ; and that their most becoming sentiment towards him is , respect for themselves . But all this comes of losing the idea of justice , and of course along with it the idea of mercy , which is , indeed , but a relaxation from justice . Truly the modern , 0 Lord , how love I mankind ! is a great improvement on the ancient , 0 Lord , how love I thy law ! We do not suppose this execrable stuff has got into Mr. Channing 's heart , but it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the heads of one generation is apt to be in the hearts of the next . As if on purpose to preclude all grounds of spiritual pride and boasting , Providence has so ordered things that we often do most good where we least intend it , and least good where we intend it most . Thus we are perpetually admonished  --  and all experience proves how much we need the admonition-that it is ours to obey , not to administer , the laws of our Maker . Assuredly , he who neglects his definite , particular duties , and labors that he may be in a better condition to do them , will find the latter so long and hard a labor , that he will never be able to reach the former . It is curious , indeed , to observe what mistakes men make in regard to the matter of influence . In accordance with the prevailing spirit of improvement , the precept , Let your light shine , has been practically reformed into , Make your light shine . Hence , divers people go about making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed creates blows out the little light they have ; and if , in their rapid , restless benevolence , they do not overturn and extinguish such lights as are content to shine quietly in their places , it will probably be because a good Providence is too strong for them . Nevertheless they are our children of light who , measuring their influence by their efforts to exert it , are yet abundantly filled with conceit of influence ; and we all know that influence and conceit of influence are apt to be inversely proportioned . Oh , for a sermon on the text , Work out your own salvation ; yes , your own salvation ; your own salvation ; never doubting in the least , that , as fast and as far as you make yourself salvable , Providence will save others by you , whether you will or no . Assuredly no power on earth can possibly prevent our influence from act . Ing , provided we have any . How to get it , is the question ; and a question too that is poorly met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole , to obey is better , we suspect , than to exert an influence ; for in obedience are involved the results of a deeper foresight // than is vouchsafed to any of us ; but as the truly obedient man does not aim at those results , but simply at the obedience , so of course he has no occasion for pride and conceit of efficiency ; what he does seems done by another through him ; and thus the stronger he becomes the more he feels his weakness . Such is the profound and beautiful wisdom of nature , which is as favorable to our virtue as it is hostile to our pride . Truly he who humbleth himself shall be exalted.
