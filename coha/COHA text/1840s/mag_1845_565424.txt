txt THE name of Leighton is pro . nounced with reverence and love by men of various sects and opinions , wherever the English language is spoken . His works unite sound scriptural views , a spirit of heavenly contemplation , the breathings of divine love , and richness of imagery in a perfection which scarcely any other writer has attained . Refined minds , particularly those of a contemplative sort , will turn to them , if they take any pleasure in religious things , as to a well from which the purest and brightest feelings gush forth . The frame of mind which they favor and tend to produce , is one of peace and love . Although built upon a deep theology , they are any thing hut controversial . In some respects they have a universal character , so that from reading them one could hardly pronounce upon the age when Leighton lived , or the sect to which he belonged . External events , it is obvious , had less than their usual influence upon his mind and heart . Amid this general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , while they can not fail to esteem him highly , yet must feel inclined to fall below the general voice : we mean the Presbyterians of Scotland , and the high church Episcopalians . The former associate with his memory a desertion , without sufficient cause , of his own and his father 's religion , and charge him in part with the evils which attended the establishment of episcopacy in Scotland under Charles II . The latter can neither like his doctrinal system , nor the low ground he took when he went over to their church ; and some of them in his own time accused him , we believe , of doing injury to their cause by his extreme moderation . When in the kirk he was episcopally inclined , when in the Episcopal church he was but a Presbyterian after all : of course , therefore , those who are farthest off from half-and-half opinions in church government do not set him up for an example . This change , which we have just spoken of , was the one event of Leighton 's outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrapped up in it . We read in it his mind , his relation to the practical world , the moving principles of his nature as a man . It can not , therefore , be amiss , if , in making some observations on his life , as we propose to do , we pursue an order of arrangement very much resembling the course which his life pursued ; if we let it flow silently on in its smooth channel , until we reach the era of his change , and then examine , as with a geologist 's eye , the ledges over which it took much of its future course . Robert Leighton , born in 1611 , was the son of Alexander Leighton , some time professor of moral philosophy in Edinburgh , who afterwards lived in London , and suffered so signally for his zeal against episcopacy , as to be of historical notoriety . The son was sent to Edinburgh for his education , and had reached the age of thirty before he entered the ministry in the kirk . In this long preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the young men whose life had the same destination : he became acquainted with men and things in England to some extent , on account of having two sisters married in that country : he traveled on the continent , where he saw some of the Catholic institutions of piety * The Whole Works of Archbishop Leighton , in one vol . New York , J. C. Riker. 1844. // under favorable points of view ; and he had leisure to amass much more learning than was customary in the church to which he belonged . The reading of the Scotch divines at that time seems to have consisted very much in polemical divinity . That of Leighton was spread over a wider field . His quotations from a large number of Greek and Roman authors and from the Fathers , show a great familiarity with ancient learning and the use of a full commonplace book . They are not as copious in his theological lectures , where they chiefly occur , as Jeremy Taylor 's , but they are more pertinent to the subject , and come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the purest Latin that he ever knew , and was master of the Greek and Hebrew , and of the whole compass of theological learning , especially of that relating to the Scriptures . On the whole , we have the impression that his finished education , joined to his natural refinement of mind , polished him too highly for the sphere in which he was to move , where , at that time , refinement was in no great demand , and shrewd sense prevailed over acquisitions far more than it does at present . This learning , however , marked him out for the post which he afterwards filled , of principal of the University of Edinburgh , and thus enabled him to be useful when he felt obliged to leave his parish . The parish where Leighton was settled for eleven years , from 1641 to 1652 , was that of Newbattle , in Mid Lothian , about six miles from Edinburgh . Here , through the stormiest period of British history , he passed his time , as much aloof from politics as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundwork of his character . Accounted a saint from his youth up , he had known little of those upheavings of the soul which begin in some minds when they turn to God . Averse from controversy by nature , he loved not to preach polemical divinity , much less polemical politics , into which every body else entered . Of Leighton as a preacher , we have two contemporary opinions , which do not welt agree with one another . " His preaching , " Burnet says , " had a sublimity both of thought and expression in it . The grace and gravity of his pronunciation was such , that few heard him without a very sensible emotion : I am sure I never did . His style was rttther too fine ; but there was a majesty and beauty in it that left so deep an impression that I can not yet forget the sermons I heard him preach thirty years ago . He had a very low voice , and could not be heard by a great crowd . " Baillie , in his letters , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has the new guise of preaching which Mr. Hugh Binning and Mr. Robert Leighton began , contemning the ordinary way of expounding and dividing a text , of raising doctrines and uses ; but runs out on a discourse on some common head , in a high romancing and unscriptural style , tickling the ear for the present , and moving the affections in some , but leaving little or naught to the memory and understanding . " If we misapprehend them not , the first of these writers blames Leighton for a too refined way of preaching above the reach of ordinary persons ; while the other directs his harsh censures against Leighton 's strain of th*oght , as not formal and doctrin2t enough , and as tending to the introduction of certain favorite topics , like the excellence of heavenly things , and the evil of conformity to the world . Perhaps also his dry mind may not have relished Leighton 's frequent and apt illustrations . If the thirty three sermons yet extant are a sample , the injustice of Baillie is great in the expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present to speak of Leighton 's life in the University of // Edinburgh , we come to the most important action of his life  --  to his desertion of the cause of the Presbyterians , and to the speedy consequences of this step , the high honors and preferments which literally met him on his path as he was passing over from the one camp to the other . An act like this always calls for a narrow scrutiny . It is not strange that the Scotch Presbyterians should be stern judges of Leighton 's conduct . And we are free to say , that if we had not what We feel to be a true portraiture of a saint of God in his works , if we viewed him merely amid the godless crew that for twenty eight years tried to force episcopacy upon the Scotch , and in this endeavor goaded the Cameronians into frenzy and even into dark fanaticism , and then punished with the prison and with death that fanaticism created by themselves-we say if we viewed him thus merely , we should want more than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holy , nay , even of an honest man . But we rejoice that we need not look only at the strange circumstances , the " uncouth neighborhood " where we find him . We rejoice to think that a good Cameronian , if lie had seen into the heart of Leighton , would have recognized a follower of Christ full of love and kindness , to whom persecution was a most unwelcome work , and who would rather suffer than he the instrument of making oth*s suffer . We rejoice too in the heXief which this conviction concerning Leighton 's character allows us to *ntertain that in this world of limited views , of prejudices , of erring juo*ments , good is so mixed up with evil , that the best men are often on the worst side . But a general belief in the integrity of Leighton is not enough . It is necessary to account for his conduct , and in so doing , as we have already said , we shall enter somewhat at large into his opinions , the traits of his character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place ; that this change was not brought about in Leighton by theological sympathies . It will not be doubted that although then , as since , a respectable number of divines in the English church were Calvinists in sentiment , a larger number , and those the most eminent in station and in learning , accorded with the views of the Arminians . When Bishop Morley , himself a Calvinist it is said by Burnet , although no friend to the non-conformists , was asked what the Arminians held , his witty reply was , that " they held all the best bishoprics and deaneries in England . " The party under whose sway the Lambeth articles ceased to be part of the creed of the Irish Episcopal church , can not surely be suspected of having any strong bias in favor of the doctrines of election and reprobation . Nor were the fragments of the same ecclesiastical party in Scotland disinclined to the opinions of their English brethren . The loud reproaches of Arminianism which were cast against themby the covenanters , prove thus much at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kirk than out of it . Leighton 's own theological opinions seem*not to have departed from the type of Calvinism which was then prevalent in Scotland . We have indeed no positive assurance , that he retained these opinions in an unaltered form to the close of his life . But it is certain that he worked upon his commentary on Peter , which is an important document in determining his theology , after he left the kirk ; and here his Calvinism is as manifest as in any other of his writings. * Nor is there the * The expressions in Leighton 's comment 00 1 Pet . iv , 6 , " whole families swept away by the late stroke of God 's hand , " and " though the pestilence doth not now aifright you , " and on chap . iii , // least probability that he subsequently modified his opinions , and yet left his earlier works as representatives of a system which he had abandoned . A few extracts illustrative of Leighton 's way of judging in respect to certain distinctive points , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1st of Peter , ( " elect according to the foreknowledge of God the father , " ) he says : " This foreknowledge is no other than that eternal love of God , or decree of election , by which some are appointed unto life , and being foreknown or elected to that end , they are predestinate to the way to it-It is most vain to imagine a foresight of faith in men , and that God in the view of that faith as the condition of election itself , has chosen them. - God predestinated not becaose he fbresaw men would be conformed to Christ , but that they might be so. - This foreknowledge then is his eternal and unchangeable 22 , " this infectious disease may keep possession of the winter , " are referred by Mr. Pearson to a pestilence in 1665 . In his comment on chap . iv , 17 , Leighton says , " let the vile enemy that bath shed our blood and insulted over us , rejoice in their present impunity and on men 's procuring of it and pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escape of many who had deserved the severest punishments for their part in the grand Irish rebellion , but were screened by the favor of some great men in the reign of King Charles II . But when we read this and what Leighton goes on to say , " though it may be that the judgment begun at us is not yet ended , and that we may yet further and that justly find them our scourge , " we can not help feeling that by us , he means the people and kirk of Scotland , and if so , these words must be understood of Cromwell and " the sectaries , " and of the times just after the defeat of the engagers in 1648 . If the Irish rebellion had been meant , the words could not have been written after the bloody campaigns of Cromwell in Ireland , in 1649-1650 . Bailhie in his one hundred and eightieth letter , under date of August 23 , 1648 , mentions a pestilence in Glasgow , Aberdeen , and Edinburgh . But it is certain that Leighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment was introduced , for on chap . v , 2-4 , he says , " as well a poor stipend and glebe will ruin us if the affection be upon them , as a great deanery or bishopric . " love ; and that thus he chooseth some and rejecteth others is for that great end , to manifest and magnify his mercy and justice ; hut why he appointed this man for the one and that for the other , made Peter a vessel of this mercy and Judas of wrath , this is even so because it seemed good to him . This if it be harsh yet is apostolic doctrine . " And soon afterwards he says : " The connexion of these we are now for our profit to take notice of ; that effectual calling is inseparably tied to this eternal foreknowledge or election on the one side , and to salvation on the otherhence much joy ' ariseth to the believer ; this tie is indissoluble ; as the agents are , the Father , the Son , and the Spirit ; so are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effectual calling and salvation be inseparably linked together , then by any one of them a man may lay hold upon all the rest , and may knuw that his hold is sure. - He that loves may be sure that he was loved first ; and he that chooses God for his delight and portion may conclude confidently , that God bath chosen him to be one of those that shall enjoy him and be happy in him forever . " On the passage in chap . ii , 8 , " being disobedient , whereunto also they were appointed , " he holds this language : " This the Apostle adds for the further satisfaction of believers in this point : how it is that so many reject Christ and stumble at him ; telling them plainly that the secret purpose of God is accomplished in this ; God having determined to glorify his justice on impenitent sinners , as he shows his rich mercy on them that believe . Here it were easier to lead you into a deep than to lead you forth again . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into it . This is certain that the thoughts of God are not less just in themselves than deep and unsoundable by us . His justice appears clear , in that mnan 's destruction is always the fruit of his own sin . But to give causes of God 's decrees without himself s neither agreeable . a with the primitive being of the nature of God nor with the doctrines of the Scriptures . " On the nature of man he says in the ninth sermon , entitled , " the sinner a rebel against God , " - " where are now those who so vilify grace and deify nature ; or shall I rather say , nullify grace and deify nature ? Here is the best eulogy the Apostle 109 // will bestow upon the best of natures , enmity against God . Nay , all the sparkles of virtue and moral goodness in civil men and ancient heathen are no better . " And in the meditation on Psalm cxxx , we have these words : " He who in the first original of the new-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the regene. ration and restoration of mankind to holiness . The Holy Spirit finds nothing but Tohu va Bohu , nothing but what is without form and void . " Such were some of the points of Leighton 's theology-points it is obvious , which must characterize and distinguish his whole system . And here we can not help calling the attention of our readers to his wise moderation , and his unwillingness to push his system beyond the record of Scripture . Truth was cherished in his mind principally as the means of keeping up his Christian graces , and of exalting him into the region of divine contemplation . He seems not to have trusted much to logical deductions , and to have had absolutely none of that disputatious spirit which is apt to be a trait of men of the logical sort . He always chooses to feel rather than to reason , to believe on divine authority , than to prove . in regard to the order of the divine decrees , he says , in his tenth theological lecture , " to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a loss , when I hear learned men and professors in theology talking presumptuously about the order of the divine decrees , and when I read such things in their works. - Nor is there much more sobriety or moderation in the many notions that are entertained , and the disputes that are commonly raised about reconciling these divine decrees with the liberty and the free will of man. ** On the necessity of an atonement , he says , in the meditations on Psalm cxxx , " they who anxiously debate the point whether God could simply and absolutely pardon sin without any price , do but trifle ; for whatever may be supposed concerning that , who is there that will deny that this way of the salvation of men which God has chosen , is so full of stupendous mercy and so illustrious -- that nothing can be thought of more worthy of divine majesty , nothing sweeter , nothing more munificent with respect to unworthy man In the second place , Leighton can not have left the kirk because he had any scruple in regard to the lawfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered highly probable by what we have already found to be his theological system . It is a remarkable fact , that a theology like Leighton 's does not well accord with a superstitious view of the church , its ministers and sacraments . The two may coexist indeed in single cases-for what inconsistent notions can not education seemingly reconcile in some minds  --  but if they are founded on different views of the nature of man and of the chief instruments in his salvation , as they indeed are , their tendency must be to expel one another . Moreover , Leighton as a man of a decidedly contemplative turn , must have attached high importance to spiritual causes and little or none to forms . In such a mind once enlightened by Christianity , essential godliness takes at once its proper place in a sphere far above " ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary , " unless a pernicious mysticism , united with the contemplative turn as we sometimes find it , fills the mind with its hazy atmosphere and gives false colors , shapes and sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But strong as Leighton 's natural bias was towards contemplation and even towards asceticism , we have been able to discover nothing of the mystical in // his character . On the passage in Peter , chap . iii , 2 , " the like figure whereunto baptism doth also now save us , " he remarks that this ordinance " is in the hands of the spirit of God , as other sacraments are , and as the word itself is , to purify the conscience and to convey grace and salvation to the soul by the reference which it hath to and unioa with that which it represents . It saves by the answer of a good conscience towards God , and it affords that by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , " " though they the sacraments do not save all who partake of them , yet they do really and effectually save believers for whose salvation they are the means , as the other external ordinances of God do . " There may have been some conceit in Leighton 's mind of some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in the hands of the Spirit , but surely he does not here remove the sacrament in kind from the class of the other means of grace . But in regard to the particular point , how Leighton viewed ordination as a minister of the kirk , we are not left to deductions and general expressions of opinion . We have his judgment in his own particular case detailed by one who knew him well , his friend , Bishop Burnet . Burnet says , that , " When the time fixed for the consecration of the bishops of Scotland came on , the English bishops finding that Sharp and Leighton had not episcopal ordination as priests and deacons-the other two Fairfoul and Hamilton having been ordained before the wars , that is , episcopally , they stood upon it that they must be ordained first deacons and then priests . Sharp was very uneasy at this , and remembered them of what had happened when King James had set up episcopacy . Bishop Andrews moved at that time the ordaining them as was now proposed , but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to . wards the unchurching of all those who had no bishops among them . But the late war and the disputes during that time had raised these controversies higher , and brought men to stricter notions and to maintain them with more fierceness . The English bishops did also say that by the late act of uniformity , that matter was more positively settled than it had been before ; so that they could not legally consecrate any but those who were according to that constitution made first priests and deacons . They were positive in the point and would not dispense with it . Sharp stuck more at it than could have been expected from a man that had swallowed down greater matters . Leigh . ton did not stand much upon it ; he did not think orders given without bishops were null and void . He thought the forms of government were not settled by such positive laws as were unalterable , but only by apostolic practices , which as he thought authorized episcopacy as the best form ; yet he did not think it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every church might make such rules of ordination as they pleased , and that they might reordain all that came to them from any other church , and that the reordaining a priest ordained in another church imported no more but that they received him into orders according to their rules , and did not infer the annulling the orders he had formerly received . ' According to Mr. Pearson , in his Life of Leighton , this consenting to receive orders from the English bishops , is open to just exception . Had they , he thinks , concurred in Leighton 's explanation , he would have stood on solid ground in submitting to a new ordination . But their avowed meaning was to make him a minister of the gospel ; and as he outwardly acquiesced , " his private construction of the act could not change his public aspect and character . It seemed leveled at the foundations of presbytery , by impeaching the legitimacy of all Presbyterian ministers , who had received holy orders after episcopacy was legally resettled in Scotland by King James , " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there being no bishops in Scotland , the imperfect presbyterian ordination might be allowed according to the view of the English bishops , but not afterwards , because now it lay open to all within the Scotch kingdom to // make their orders valid . ) " Of course , " he adds , as part of the exceptionable conduct of Leighton , " it exasperated the clergy who were in that predicament , and also the laity , who thought the honor and interest of their church were compromised by Leighton 's concession . Leighton did not , in this instance , sufficiently consider the ill impression his compliance would produce on mankind , and how much it might weaken his influence , by bringing him nearer in public estimation than had been supposed possible to the level of mere worldly calculators. ** There is an amusing simplicity about the latter part of this extract , which calls for a word or two of remark . Leighton , it seems , might break his connection with his former brethren of the Scotch church , and join in a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to the submitting to an act which might be explained as a declaration that their orders were invalid and might be explained otherwise ; - here he was to stop short , and not let his good be evil spoken of . As if he could have avoided calling forth bitter feeling from the moment when he broke away from the kirk ; or must not have looked like a worldly calculator , when he entered into a party nearly all of whom except himself were of that description . But we can not see that any blame is imputable to Leighton for what he did at this time . If he had thought that his first ordination conveyed to him the right from the Head of the church to preach and administer the sacraments in any and every church , with or against the rules there prevailing , he might have been reprehensible for allowing himself to be reordained . Or if he had imagined that a virtue had come into him by the original laying on of hands , his conduct , in restoring a virtue by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : though in truth had he believed thus , he could never have been either a Presbyterian or a Leighton . But what he did amounted to nothing more than this . The conscience of others required something of him which his conscience did not object to . They looked on it as of immense importance : he looked on it as a regulation to preserve good order . If now imperative reasons , as he thought , bade him accept of the appointment to a bishopric , what was there wrong , or even unadvisable , in submitting to a necessary step against which he felt no scruple ? And besides , so far were he and the other prelates from following the English precedent , that when six more were soon after appointed , they were consecrated without reordination ; which was no longer a private avowal at a distance , but an open and voluntary one , in Scotland , of what opinions prevailed within the order itself . Again , we can discover no personal ambition , no desire for ecclesiastical dignity , in Leighton , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as an auxiliary to other motives , could have turned the scale in his mind . If any man 's writings can testify to a mortified temper raised by familiarity with eternal things about earthly objects , and penetrated with a sense of their worthlessness , that man is Leighton . And if any man , after taking a step which may be imputed to love of honor , can vindicate himself from such an imputation by the entire absence of the feeling ever afterwards , that defense can be set up for Leighton . Unless then we suppose him to have been seized by a passing fit of ambition , which , as happens in novels , fell upon him just at the time we need it for a theory , and had no connection with the rest of his life and character , we must acquit him of acting under the influence of this motive . Nor can the defense be set up for him , that he left a corrupt and irre // ligious communion , to join one where religion promised to flourish in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have been a very sufficient reason for deserting the ranks in which he had formerly stood . For what can be God 's church , if it be not that where his Spirit dwells , and where multitudes give evidence that they are taught of him ? And what can be the church of Antichrist , but that which , in the lives of a great portion of its members , denies the Father and the Son ? We may have our theories about the original and the proper government of the church ; but if we , for a long course of years , see Christian virtue shining brightly in a communion under some other form of discipline which we do not prefer , low must be our attachment to substantial Christianity , if we can not dwell where God dwells , if we do not behold the wisdom of God rebuking our theories , and bidding us regard forms of church government only as the means of good , not as good in themselves . The Scotch ministers were far from being without serious faults , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were men of blameless lives and faithful in their work ,  --  - men whose supreme object it was to lead their flocks to God . Burnet lived among them , and had good opportunities to know them well ; and though his superior breeding and refinement , and his different way of thinking concerning church government , must have aggravated their faults in his mind , yet his account of them is , on the whole , quite favorable . He is speaking particularly of the ministers in the west of Scotland , who , for th' most part , refused to conform to the new order of things , and were ejected from their parishes . *C Their spirits were eager , " he says " and their tempers sour , but they had an appearance that created respect . They were related to the chief families of the country , either by blood or marriage , and had lived in so decent a manner , that the Vol . III . 15 gentry had great respect to them . They used to visit their parishes much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready at extempore prayer , that from that they grew to practice extempore sermons ; for the custom in Scotland was , after dinner or supper , to read a chapter in the Scripture ; and when they happened to come , if it was acceptable , they on the sudden expounded the chapter-The ministers generally brought them the people about them on the Sunday nights , where the sermons were talked over ; and every one , women as well as men , were desired to speak their sense and their experience ; and by these means they had a comprehension of matters of religion greater than I have seen among people of that sort any where-As they lived in great familiarity with their people , and used to pray and talk oft with them in private , so it can hardly be imagined to what a degree they were loved and reverenced by them . They kept scandalous persons under a severe discipline : for breach of Sabbath , for an oath , or the least disorder in drunkenness , persons were cited before the churcli-session , which consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who with the minister had this care upon them , and were solemnly reproved for it. - These things had a grave appearance . Their faults and defects were not so conspicuous . They had a very scanty measure of learning , and a narrow compass in it . They were little men of a very indifferent size of capacity , tind apt to fly out into great excess of passion and indiscretion . They were servile , and too apt to fawn upon and flatter their admirers . ! They were affected in their deportment , and very apt to censure all who differed from them , and to believe and report whatever they heard to their prejudice , and they were superstitious and haughty . In their serm*is they were apt to enlarge on the staY'eof the present time , and to preach against the sins of princes and courts ; a topic that naturally makes men popular . " Such , according to Burnet , were the men who occupied the extreme left of presbyterianism , and by whom the brunt of the Cameronian persecution was borne . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishes , and that among them there were such men as the excellent Rutherford , noted for his piety , and William Guthrie , author of the " Christian 's Great Interest , " we shall come to the conclusion that it was their political principles and a certain unyielding temper , which made // thorn objects of dislike , rather than any thing more deeply entering into the essentials of character . Having thus seen that none of the reasons which imperatively demand of men to desert the form of religion under which they live , existed in the case of Leighton ; we proceed to inquire what were those reasons of another sort , which carried the point , in his mind ,  --  reasons which one good and conscientious man might have judged sufficient , and another good and conscientious man might have regarded as weak . These reasons must be found in the political relations of the kirk at the restoration of the monarchy , and in the bias which certain traits of Leighton 's own character and his nearest acquaintances gave to his judgments of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back a little in the history of the time , and say , that the covenant-the great engine against Charles I , the glory and boast of Scotland , according even to a writer of the present day ,  --  was the engine also that battered down the kirk and destroyed many of its most faithful members . It was indeed a twoedged sword , to bind their king with chains , and their nobles with fetters of iron ; but it was also a two-edged sword in another sense : it had an edge , which those who wielded it felt to their cost . * It bound all who took it to attempt the securing of two inconsistent things , the destruction of popery and prelacy and the re-establishment of presbytery on the one hand , and allegiance to the sovereign on the other . To effect the first object , it led them into measures which resulted greatly against their will , in the execution of the king . To effect the second , it led them into measures which prostrated their country at the feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities even for their religious liberties , that miserable promise-breakor , whose claim to be a Stuart , if he had had no other , was sufficiently supported by his lying like one , and who carried in his mouth the saying that presbytery was not the religion of a gentleman . And as these two inconsistent objects came into conflict , and men knew not how to act , scruples of conscience arose , and charges of being false to the covenant were hurled about : religion was mixed up with the strife of parties , in the pulpit , in the meeting of the presbytery , and in the intercourse of social life ; and so the covenant , the means of giving a new ascendency to the kirk , and , as many hoped , of increasing the power of true religion , proved the means of overturning the kirk , and of calling forth animosities of temper the most opposite to the spirit of the gospel . Near the close of 1647 , when king Charles was a prisoner in the Isle of Wight , a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his Scotch adherents , and a part of the covenanters on the other , by which they stipulated to raise an army on his behalf , and he to keep up presbytery for three years , until such a model of church government could be framed , as would be most accordant with the Scriptures . This treaty , called the engagement , was known in Scotland early in 1648 , and was acceded to by the parliament , by the great body of the nobility and by many others ; but it met with violent opposition on the part of the more zealous covenanters , who alledged that it involved a breach of the solemn document from which they took their name . The assembly , which met in sum er , passed acts disapproving of tih e engagement , and of the proceedings of the Parliament in its favor . An army , however , was raised and descended into England ; but being deprived of the services of the old covenanting generals , who considered the // engagement unlawful , it was easily defeated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the winds . As soon as the news of this defeat came to Scotland , there was a rising in the southwestern counties , where the zeal for the covenant had ever been the greatest ; and a large body of men from many parishes , with their ministers , aided by the Marquis of Argyle and a party at his command , marched under arms to Edinburgh , changed the administration , and brought the majority in the parliament upon the side of the covenanters . Upon this a stringent law was passed , excluding all " engagers , " from civil employment , until they should give satisfactory proof to the kirk , of their repentance , and make public profession accordingly . " All churches upon that , " says Burnet , " were full of mock penitents ; some making their acknowledgments all in tears , to gain the more credit with the new party . " A number of the ministers favored this engagement , and others , if they did not favor it , were inclined to treat its partisans with leniency . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glasgow . In a letter of March 27 , 1648 , when his own mind was much agitated as to the measures which ought to be taken , he thus speaks of the signs of the times . " Some of our leaders are likely never to be satisfied , and resolve to trust to nothing that their opponents can do or say , so long as this parliament , which they call unsound , is in being . The danger of this rigidity is likely to be fatal to the king , to the whole isle , both churches and states . We mourn for it to God . Though it proceed from two or three men at most , yet it seems remediless . If we be kept from a present civil war , it is God , and not the wisdom of our most wise and best men , which will save us .

" In August he attended the general assembly and says that " it was here pressed that ministers silent , who did not preach against the engagement , should for this , be deposed , " although he himself " wished if men were modest and otherwise offended not , that this fault might carry no more but a rebuke . " One overture at this assembly shows the exasperation which arose from the engagement . " It was , " says Baillie , " that all ministers conversing with malignants , should be censured by presbyteries . This would have snared many , for the notion of malignants now by the engagement is extended to very many . " Among the favorers of the engagement was Leighton , and according to Burnet he might have fallen into trouble on this account , if the Earl of Lothoan , who lived in his parish of Newbattle and had a great regard for him , and who himself it would appear , opposed the engagement , had not befriended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent .

In order to facilitate the raising of an army , the parliament repealed the law passed after the defeat of the engagers , by which they were excluded from employment , having first obtained resolutions in favor of a partial repeal from the commission of the assembly . This instantly kindled the old flame of party strife , founded on the charge of a breach of the covenant . The two parties , known as the resolutioners and protesters , or the politic and the strict covenanters , were at variance , and sometimes engaged in most bitter hostility from this time until the kirk was overturned . One needs only to read the latter part of Baillie 's letters , to be convinced that the disagreement almost amounted to a schism . Synods were divided , ministers of the opposing sides were inducted into the same parish , one general assembly was broken up , and it was fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forcibly prevented from meeting afterwards , by the English military officers at Edinburgh . Leighton 's resignation of his ministerial charge , occurred during the hottest of this controversy , in 1652 . It seems to have been English influence which called him to the university . Probably he was looked upon as a man of peace and a gentle spirit , who would submit quietly to the ruling powers , and not teach rebellion either of the loyal or covenanting sort , to the students . In this station he seems to have gained the reverence of all . One of the duties which he prescribed to himself was to deliver short theological lectures in Latin to the students . While in these the same religious system is inculcated which we gather from the commentary on Peter , there is a manifest disposition to avoid all the abstruse and controverted parts of theology . Leighton approaches the young not so much with arguments and an elaborate system of truths ; as with declarations of the great points necessary for salvation . He continued in this office , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity to which he was to be preferred . From what has been said , it appears that Leighton conceived an early dislike to the covenant ; that his politics , so far as he had any , were opposed to those of the leading covenanters , who were also the strongest presbyterians ; that he by this means was brought into collision with the ruling party in the kirk ; that he was disgusted by their quarrels and led to look around to see if there was not some quieter haven , where he might moor his bark . His resignation of his parish , proceeded from these causes , and during his office of principal of the university  --  the storm in the kirk raging nearly all the whilehis dislikes were strengthened , and his preferences of some other form , where men would be cempelled by a presiding officer to keep the peace with one another , were matured . And can we wonder that he thought that a church so distracted , needed a permanent overseer ? Truly if a state of tranquillity could be attained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other evils , we should be much of his mind . We may add to these considerations , that Leighton 's views of the duty of obedience to rulers , were such that he must have considered the resistance of the covenanters to // Charles I. unlawful , and that this would naturally disaffect him to their way of thinking in other respects . In one place he says , ( on Peter II , 13 , 14 , ) " there is always so much justice in the most depraved government , as to render it a public good , and therefore puts upon inferiors an obligation to obedience . " To the politics of the royalist party he would also naturally be bent by the feelings of some of his friends . His brother , Sir Elisha or Sir Ellis Leightonwe suspect he softened his name to suit courtly ears-bore arms on the royalist side , and was afterwards secretary to the Duke of York . Of this man Burnet says , that " he was very like his brother in face and in the vivacity of his parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be imagined , for though he by . ed to talk of great sublimities in religion , he was a very immoral man . He was a papist of a form of his own , but he had changed his religion to raise himself at court. - He had great power over his brother , for he took care to hide his vices from him , and to make before him a great show of piety . " But such influences could not have swayed Leighton , had there been any decided quality in his character opposed to them . His father , for instance , would have resisted similar ones many times stronger , and have been only the more bent to the other side . What were the traits which worked with outward things to lead him away from the church of Scot-land ? Leighton 's mind seems to have been neither of a logical nor a practical cast , which are reigning features in the Scotch mind , but to have delighted in intuition and contemplation . Such minds , we believe , especially when united with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are averse to disputation , and much more to outward strife . Their perception of moral beauty is apt to be strong , and they have a love of order and harmony : while a soul which is alive to the sublime , like Milton or Dante , can mix in the angry contentions of parties , men of this mould will not endure to run into scenes where they behold an unhinged condition of things , and moral tempests . Leit*hton 's meditative turn also inclined him to withdraw from the practical part of life , and to value the contemplative virtues , such as mortification of the bodily appetites , a spirit of prayer and meditation , a calm , quiet state of the desires , and indifference to outward things-virtues which have no necessary relation to our fellowmen-before the practical ones , which lead us out of ourselves to action for and among mankind . It is not strange , therefore , that Leighton found something in monastic life to admire , and had peyhaps a onesided notion of what deadness to the world consisted in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in visiting whom , he was led to admire the apparent unwordliness of many Catholics . He often quotes from the fathers down to the mystical Bernard . In his meditation on the fourth Psalm , he cites from St. Augustine a story of the power which the life of St. Anthony , the famous monk , had on two pra*torian soldiers , in bringing them to quit the world and give up the rest of their days to religion . He then immediately adds , " holy men in former days did wonders in conquering the world and themselves , " as if the conquest were of such a sort . His own habits of life were almost ascetic , so that Burnet calls him a monastic man . He never married , and " had no regard to his person , unless it was to mortify it by a constant low diet that was like a perpetual fast . " His " rules and instructions for a holy life , " in constantly urging the duty of mortification , and in making prominent the mere feeling of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some // pious inspector of a nunnery , or translations from Madame Guion . He says , amongst other things , " So love and desire God only that if he would create hell in thee here , thou mightest be ready to offer thyself ' , by his grace , for his eternal honor and glory to suffer it , " - " at every word thou wilt speak , at every morsel thou wilt eat , at every stirring or moving of every article or member of thy body , thou must ask leave of him in thy heart . " " The more perfectly thou livest in the abstraction and departure and bare nakedness of thy mind from all creatures , the more nakedly and purely shalt thou have the fruition of the Lord thy God , and shalt live the more heavenly and angelical life . " It is manifest that a tendency is here exhibited which in some ctrcumstances might have led Leighton to serious errors in religion ; and it was perhaps the early influence of the old man who lost his ears for presbytery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we have correctly described Leighton 's character , there was in him a contemplative , intuitive mind , a temper inclined to order , tranquillity and subjection , which differed widely from the logical , free , practical spirit of the Scotch Calvinists . There is no wonder , then , that his sympathies were divorced from his brethren , and that he looked somewhere else for relations more congenial to his disposition . But surely a good man like Leighton would never have changed his denomination as he did , without some probability , in his own view , that the endeavor to introduce episcopacy would be useful and successful . For , as he thought the church of Scotland a true church , only capable of improvement , he could not have sought to bring about those improvements , if he had seen a risk that the church would be split asunder in the attempt . Was then his sagacity at fault , and did his ignorance of men lead him into a path which a more keen-sighted man would have shunned ? Here we have two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the probabilities as they might appear even to an indifferent person . His own feelings are known from a letter written at that time , and given in Mr. Pearson 's biographical sketch . Besides assuring his friend , who must have doubted the propriety of his course , that he was averse to the honors offered him , and that in any station he must have differed from his former brethren in divers practices , he says , " and what will you say , if there be in this thing somewhat of that you mention , and would allow of reconciling the devout on different sides , and of enlarging those good souls you meet with from their little fetters , though possibly with little success ? Yet the design is commendable , pardonable at least . " From this it would appear , that though Leighton , out of compliance with his friend 's views , underrated his own hopes ; lie still must have had a prevailing opinion that a change of church government could be effected without schism or persecution , which would issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , at which we can hardly help smiling , as we look back on the very plain reasons which now appear why it should be disappointed . But even the wise men of the day could not confidently predict the result , and still less could a retired man like Leighton . For the probabilities were such that different tempers and judgments would estimate them differently . There were a number of ministers who felt and thought with Leighton . There were many worthy Episcopalians in Scotland who adhered to the church which James had set up . There was a part of Scotland-in the north and around Aberdeenwhere opinions were declared for some alteration of church policy . It was confidently asserted that two thirds of the ministers would come over . There was a general dislike // 119 to the violence of a party in the kirk , and a reaction against the covenant . And the reflux of loyalty it was thought would carry men high and dry beyond the tossing waves of resistance to any law touching an established religion . All these things might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed change would not endanger the peace of the church and country . And as the change was to be accomplished at any rate , it might seem best for those who honestly favored it , to guard against bad counsels by their own personal co-operation . These considerations will defend Leighton , we believe , from the charge of unhallowed motives and unusual weakness of judgment . And if there were fewer of them , if his commentary on Peter were the only memorial of the man , we should believe him still good and pure in his most questionable actions ; we should cling to him if he had turned Catholic or Quaker . Leighton 's conduct towards his former brethren after his separation from the kirk , is a strong proof of the rectitude of his views . Amid the persecutions and violences of others in his party , he ever pursued a course of mildness and conciliation , patiently trying to bring men to his way of thinking , until he found it hopeless , and feeling little bitterness towards those who thwarted his endeavors . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially ministers , leave a church from base motives , they of course and proverbially hate their former friends , depreciate their talents , and blacken their names . Most men , also , when they leave a church without base motives , unduly dislike their old associates , either because they are aware of being themselves talked against , or because they are conscious of needing excuses for the step they have taken , and can find the best excuses in the failings of others . But when a man leaves one party for another without leaving his Christian love behind him , when he goes over , not to fight or to take pay , but because he feels that it is better for him or for the cause of God that he should do so , then , whatever we may think of the soundness of his judgment , we ought to feel that he gives the best proof of the soundness of his heart , and that he has a right to our esteem as much as ever . But if Leighton hoped to do good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event showed , and as he soon began to be aware , when he got a view of the character of his associates . We may almost say , that no set of men banded together to destroy the Christian religion were ever as bad as these who united to build up the Episcopal church in Scotland . The sight of Leighton among them must have been like the sight of a dove seated on a carcass , amid vultures and carrioncrows . If he disliked the . bitterness of the adherents to the kirk , as an unchristian spirit , what must he have thought of the hypocrisy , the cruelty , the cupidity of these men ; and what wonder was it that he longed for retirement and removal beyond the limits of Scotland ! The bishops ordained at the same time with Leighton , were Sharp , Fairfoul , and Hamilton . Sharp 's unheard of hypocrisy and dissimulation could not then have been known to Leighton ,  --  certainly not in all its extent . It appears from Baillie 's letters that he deceived that sagacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not fully open until he had obtained the reward of his management . This is not the place to follow the course of this wicked man in his schemes of perfidy , cruelty , and ambition , until he became the victim of the dark fanaticism which grew out of his own conduct . Hardly any drama in history ends more horribly // than his life ; and avenging justice seldom hoisted a man so signally " by his own petard . " " The vengeance , " says Mr. 1-Jallam , who is no friend to the Presbyterians , " ultimately taken on this infamous apostate and persecutor , though doubtless in violation of what is justly reckoned a universal rule of morality , ought at least not to weaken our abhorrence of the man himself . " Of Fairfoul , Burnet says , that " He was a pleasant and facetious man , insinuating and crafty ; but he was a better physician than a divine . His life was scarce free from scandal ; and he was eminent in nothing that belonged to his own function . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded others to do it . And when one objected to him that it went against his conscience , lie answered there were some medicines that could not he chewed , hut were to be swallowed down ; and since it was plain that a man could not live in Scotland unless he sware it , therefore it must be swallowed down without any farther examination . " Of Hamilton , he says , that He was a good natured man , but weak . He was always believed episcopal . Yet he had so far complied in the time of the covenant , that he affected a peculiar expression of his counterfeit zeal for their cause , to secure himself from suspicion ; when he gave the sacrament , he excommunicated all that were not true to the covenant , using a form in the Old Testament of shaking out the lap of his gown : saying , so did he cast out of the church and communion all that dealt falsely in the covenant . " Of the other bishops , Burnet says - after speaking in exalted terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all points so different from what became their function , that he had a more than ordinary zeal kindled within him in regard to it . " They were not only furious against all that stood out against them , but were very remiss in all parts of their function . Some did not live within their dioceses ; and those who did seemed to have no care of them . They showed no zeal against vice ; the most eminently wicked in the county were their particular confidents ; they took no pains to keep their clergy strictly to rules and to their duty . On the contrary , there was a levity and a carnal way of living about them that very much scandalized me . There was indeed one Scougal , bishop of Aberdeen , that was a man of rare temper , great piety and prudence ; but I thought he was too much under Sharp 's conduct , and was at least too easy to hini . " Of his namesake , Burnet , archbishop of Glasgow , he speaks more than once as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inclined to moderate counsels . After the defeat of the Cameronians at Pentland Hill , this man " advised the hanging of all those who would not renounce the covenant and promise to conform to the laws for the future ; " and shortly after , with a letter in his pocket from the king in which his majesty thought that blood enough had been shed , he let an executioa go on before producing the document . Another of these dignitaries , Ross , Burnet calls " a poor , ignorant , worthless man , but in whom obedience and fury were so eminent that they supplied all other defects ; " and he says that IRoss and Paterson in the time of James II , procured an address to be signed by several of their bench , offering to concur with the king in all that he desired with relation to those of his own religion , ( for the courtly style now was not to name popery any other way than by calling it the king 's religion , ) provided the laws might still continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of Paterson , after the revolution , he says that great pains were taken by him " to persuade the Jacobites to take the oaths , but on design to break them ; for he thought by that means they could have a majority in parliament . " To some of the ordinary clergy he gives a better character , but even of them he speaks in such terms as the fol-lowing : " The new incumbents who were put in the places of the ejected ministers , // were generally very mean and despicable in all respects . They were the worst preachers I ever heard ; they were ignorant to a reproach ; and many of them were openly vicious . They were a disgrace to their orders and the sacred functions , and were indeed the dreg and refuse of the northern parts . Those of them who rose above contempt or scandal , were men of such violent tempers that they were as much hated as the others were despised . " And with regard to those who filled the vacancies in the west , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Scotland . When he came back , he told me the clergy were such a set of men , so ignorant and so scandalous , that it was not possible to support them , unless the greatest part of them could he turned out , and better men found to put in their places . " Such were the clerical helpers of Leighton , according to one of themselves , and if we deduct one half from Burnet 's testimony , on account of the opposition to the reigning measures in Scotland , into which his moderate and tolerant principles led him , the other half surely is far more than enough to show that they were unfit company for Leighton . Let us now look for a moment at the laymen enlisted in the same cause . First in order comes the Earl of Middleton , the king 's first commissioner , who with his intimates was drunk a considerable part of the time , and whose cruel and rapacious violations of justice , were almost without parallel . He was supplanted by Lauderdale , who was originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was led by his sensuality , resentment , and servility to the court , into the worst of measures . The Earl of Rothes , was another of the princtpal members of the administration . He too degenerated until he stuck at nothing . Sharp said of him to Burnet , " that it was a great happiness to have to deal with sober and serious men ; for Lord Rothes and his crew were perpetually drunk . " We have somewhere seen the anec dote that this nobleman , when upbraided for his vices , replied that the king 's representative ought to represent him in all respects . We might go on to speak of others , as the lawyers Primrose and Fletcher , who kept cruelty as much as possisible within the lines of technical justice ; of the military bloodhounds , such as Gen. Dalziell and Sir James Turner , whose ferocity exceeded belief ; of the administrations subsequent to that of Lauderdale 's , which in some respects surpassed the preceding in severity of laws . But what we have said is enough to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , which is our object rather than to enter into the scenes of misgovernment and persecution . Such men of course wished for Leighton 's concurrence only that his piety might reflect honor upon their party : they had no idea of asking or following the advice of a simple hearted and good man like him . He on his part , soon began to find out that he was in strange company . The feasting and jollity upon the day of his consecration at Westminister , displeased him ; it did not look like the remodeling of a church . He had in his mind a plan of union with the Presbyterians , and another plan to promote a higher degree of piety than had before existed . But when he talked of these subjects to Sharp , he found him unwilling to listen ; when he turned to Fairfoul he heard nothing from him but merry stories . He soon , therefore , lost all hope , and once told Burnet " that how fully soever he was satisfied in his own mind as to Episcopacy itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were not like to be the men that should build up his church , so that the struggling about it seemed to him like fighting against God . " Leighton went with his colleagues to Scotland , but left them before arriving at Edinburgh in order // to avoid the intended pomp of their reception . He had chosen for his own the small see of Dunbiane , and kept himself very much within his province , declining all honors and titles , as far as possible , and studying to imitate the best bishops of the early church . He seldom was in his place at the parliament unless it were to vote against violent measures . Twice he went to London by the persuasion of his friends in order to give the king a fair account of the counsels prevailing in Scotland . He said that they " were so violent that he could not concur in the planting the Christian religion itself in such a manner , much less a form of government . " Although there were no persecutions in his own diocese , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being remotely a partaker in other men 's sins , made him desirous of giving up his bishopric and breaking off all official connexion with such a party . This , however , was not as yet effected . He continued in the diocese of Dunblane from 1662 to 1669 . His addresses to the clergy whom he superintended are still preserved , and breathe the same spirit of piety and peace which is so manifest in his other works . In October , 1665 , he tells them " of the resolution he had taken of retiring from this public charge ; and that all the account he could give of the reasons moving him to it , was briefly this ; the sense he had of his own unworthiness of so high a station in the church , and his weariness of the contentions of this church , which seemed rather to be growing than abating . " Of the first reason it is not wrong to say that he should have let it influence him , if at all , before he entered the office . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchical church has ever adopted , at least in modern times . He speaks in 1667 " of the gross and almost incredible ignorance of the common sort , under so much preaching and catechising , * how great a contrast with what Burnet says concerning the religious knowledge of the Presbyterians in the west . in 1669 , on the deposal of Alexander Burnet , Leighton , much against his will , was appointed archbishop of Glasgow . He continued to hold this dignity until 1674 , when he retired forever from public life . His activity in this new station consisted chiefly in efforts to bring the Presbyterians to terms , and for this purpose he was willing to conform the established church as nearly as possible to the model of the kirk although the order of bishops was still to be retained , yet they were to act only in the capacity of presidents of church judicatories ; and ministers opposed to the order might declare that they submitted only for the sake of peace . Long and wearisome were his efforts to reconcile parties . In concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings to be held , and made advances towards union ; but all persuasions were only idle wind to the Presbyterians . Nor can we blame them for this . For had they felt it right to make a compromise at all , how could they trust such men as they had to deal with , or be sure that Leighton would not be duped by his own partners . They might well say , timeo Danaos et dona ferentes . ' Men whose dealings with them at one time were by means of thumb-screws , and bands of ruffianly soldiers , and at another of the olive branch of peace , could not be sincere . They were sure that ulterior measures were contemplated somewhere or other , if not by Leighton , at Edinburgh , if not there , at London . Episcopacy , though it had come into Scotland with blood , had put but one foot up . on the soil . It was as yet very much without a form of prayer , without surplices , without godparents and the cross in baptism , without holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what it had done in the times of their fathers , how it took an eli when they gave it an inch . They knew the king 's supremacy and faithlessness , they knew the parliament 's compliance and venality . They knew that the English would not be satisfied without a greater conformity than existed , and that policy alone prevented the leaders of the predominant party from carrying their measures farther . Will it seem strange then , above all when we think of their Scotch stiffness and great love for their kirk , that they felt it necessary to make a stand at first , if they would not abandon a cause so dear to their hearts ? There was one answer which the Presbyterians had ready to meet the force of every argument and entreaty . It would be a breach of the covenant if they conformed . To meet this plea Leighton , at some time or other , probably soon after the restoration , wrote a short paper , * which appears among his works . His method of handling the subject , discovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He allows to tender consciences , nearly the very ground they wished , and then at considerable odds , attempts to dislodge them from their position . His first argument is that the English who took the covenant , did not understand it to be opposed to all kinds of episcopacy . This was to a great extent true ; but he owns that most of the Scotch , both ministers and people , did understand it " as against all episcopacy whatever , even the most moderate . " Must they not then keep their promise in the sense attached to it in their own country by imposers and promisers ? " And are there not deans , chapters and commissaries in the new church ? " asks a Scotchman , " which are expressly abjured in the covenant ? " True , * This piece also appears as a letter at the end of Mr. Pear*on 's life , together with a shorter one to the same effect . says Leighton , but the covenanters never considered how different the nature and model of a thing might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names then , " might a Scotchman reply ; " so easy a thing may remove a part of our scruples . Are the names worth fire and sword ? " But says Leighton , " that this difference should arise to a great height , may seem somewhat strange to a man that calmly considers that there is in this church , no change at all , neither in doctrine nor worship , no , nor in the substance of the discipline itself . " " Why then make so much ado about the matter , " rejoins the other party . " Besides who guaranties that we have reached the end of the changes . " In this paper he exclaims " who would not long for the shadows of the evening , and to be at rest from all these poor , childish , trifling contests . " The evening of his fruitless work in Scotland at length came ; and never did a servant more earnestly welcome the shadow , never did a bird escape more gladly from the fowler 's snare , than did this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strife . " My soul hath long dwelt , " he could say , " with him that hateth peace . " Now his enlargement has come , he flies to a retirement among his relatives in England , and there divides his time between studious meditation upon heavenly things , and preaching and praying in the parishes round about . All he had , it is recorded , was distributed in charities by the hands of others . His friend Burnet had come to London to live , and occasionally saw him . He spoke to Burnet of popery , when he perceived an intention of bringing it in , with more zeal than seemed to be in his nature with relation to any points of controversy . " He looked also on the church of England with melancholy reflections , and was very uneasy at an expression then much used , that it was the best constituted church in // the world . lie thought it was truly so in relation to the doctrine , the worship , and the main part of our government . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts , and the pastoral care , he looked as it as one of the most corrupt he had ever seen . He thought we looked like a fair carcass of a body without a spirit ; without that zeal that strictness of life and that laboriousness of the clergy that became us . " After ten years of retirement he received the message " come up hither . " He died , as he had wished to die , at an inn . The pleurisy which caused his death , was taken on a journey of mercy to London . At Burnet 's urgent entreaty he went to the metropolis to try what effect his expostulations might have upon a youngnobleman , who had been a promising pupil under Burnet , " but was now engaged in the foulest and blackest of crimes . " To Lord Perth the journey was unprofitable , and he turned Catholic not long after to please James II . But to Leighton it unlocked the prison doors of the body , and brought the message of everlasting peace . The life of this eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks . And one is that it is a serious thing to change our church , a thing certainly which nothing but plain duty ought to require of us , and against the lawfulness of which there is ever a strong presumption . What did Leighton , acting right as he judged , gain for himself ? To escape from jars and wrangling he fell into hotter disputes , until he deemed his usefulness at an end and withdrew from active life . What did he gain for the cause of religion ? When his conscience did not render continuance in the kirk unlawful , he left it and thereby gave his aid , unwillingly t is true , but actually , to the most lamentable persecution that ever existed of one Protestant com munion by another , in which more than eighteen thousand persons are said to have suffered death , exile or imprisonment . Had he and the truly good men who acted with him stood wholly aloof , it is by no means certain that the bad men would have dared to move a step forwards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denomination . What then ? shall we break old ties and go to some other Christian sect , because taste or a slight offense or we know not what whim calls us to do so ? No more than break away from old friends , and an old home for the same reason ; and he who does so gives reason to fear that he has neither the home feelings nor a capacity for friendship . But the church of Christ is wider than the bounds of a denomination . What then ? If we go where no branch of our denomination exists , and where the means of building us up in the faith , are lodged in the hands of other Christians , must we try to build up our denomination ? Nay , that would he worse than going off ourselves . For in this case we pro . duce a schism where before our arrival all were united . But lastly we see from the history of Leighton 's time , that if men will wrangle , on them falls the guilt of alienating the sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enclosure . It is true there is a weak desire of peace in some minds , and there is a cowardly policy which would smother discord at the expense of truth . But there is also in too many others a zeal for their own way , which they call the love of truth , but which their ill temper shows not to be love in truth . This spirit , all will at once condemn when it leads those to form separate organizations , who would be puzzled to tell how they differ from their brethren . But the evil of it , when it causes others to detach themselves from the body where the strife prevails , is not so much perceived , // and yet perhaps is about as great . The differences between the resolutioners and protesters would seem to have been wonderfully unimportant ; even Hetherington , who appears to think that the covenant is still law in the kirk , regrets and condemns them . But they were wonderfully potent in their results ; they lost to the kirk many who otherwise would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an important link in the chain of causes which led to the temporary destruction , and the fiery trial of the kirk itself.
