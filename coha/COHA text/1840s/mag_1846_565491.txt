txt SOME four years since , the readers of the New York Daily Tribune began , some of them to be puzzled and some amused , by a series of articles which made their appear * A Concise Exposition of the Doc . trine of Association , or Plan for a Reorganization of Society , which will secure to the Human Race , individually and collectively , their happiness and elevation . ( Based on Fourier 's Theory of Domestic and industrial Association . ) By Albert Brisbane . Oir evils are social , not political ; and a social reform only can remove them . Eighth edition . New York . J. S. Redfield , Clinton Hall , corner of Nassau and Beekman streets . ance day by day in a certain column of that paper . It was announced at the outset by the editor , that the said column had been let to somebody , and that the intention of the lessee was in that way to lay before the people at large certain doctrines which it was deemed high . ly important for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor of the Tribune had no part or lot in the matter . Possessed of a free , generous , wholesouled nature , it was known that he favored the largest freedom of speech and of opinion ; and the // general understanding was , that he meant simply to say to his subserihers , " do n't be alarmed at all about this matter ; if any poor fellow has got any thing on his mind which he wishes to say , give him a chance to say it . " It was interesting to notice the effect produced by these articles on different classes of readers . Attracted by the novelty of the headings , almost every one , at first , seemed disposed to dip into ' them . But by the time two or three chapters had made their appearance , much the greater part began to draw off , and go around as carefully as though they were coming into the vicinity of an infected district . ' And yet from the natural distrust of their own knowledge , which most men feel , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the matter , lest perchance there might be a wisdom and a merit in the articles , hidden indeed to them , but discoverable by others . Some old men , of plain common sense and strict habits , who read a newspaper as they do a book , would never admit the idea that this column was not to be read along with the rest ; and they did absolutely day by day toil through it , often turning back to read a sentence over the second and third time , and failing at last to understand , they came to the conclusion , ( good , honest , charitable souls , ) that their early education had been neglected , and that there had been great discoveries in the world since their day . Young ladies of a romantic turn of mind , living in families where the Tribune was taken , and who had already mastered Carlyle and Ralph XValdo Emerson , and were regular admirers of that peculiar kind of poetry which comes from Boston and the region thereabout , were at once attracted by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand them , they supposed them something allied to transcendental VOL . IV . 8 ism , and read on for a long time under this impression , until some intelligent friend corrected the mistake , and told them that this was another matter altogether . The pamphlet whose title heads this essay , seems to be a reproduction of these articles in a more compact form , done up for permanent usefulness . It may be that we are mistaken on this point ; but the picture of the ground plan , ' and the description of the sacred legion , ' made very deep impressions upon us ; and though we have no means at hand for testing the statement , we conclude that this book is only the summing up ' of the old articles . The writer , Mr. Albert Brisbane , has in these pages unfolded to us a , new plan of social organization , invented or discovered by Charles Fourier , a native of France . ( We use two words here somewhat different in their character , so as to give the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say as yet what Fourier did . ) Mr. Brisbane claims simply to be a disciple and an expositor , not an originator . Whether or not he has been true to his master , we have no means of knowing . We have never yet been fortunate enough to see the works of Fourier , though we made inquiry for them at the Tribune Buildings , ' , where we supposed we should be sure to find them . The question arose why it was that the works of so splendid a philosopher ( as is claimed ) were not more known and read , at least among those who have - long been his ardent and devoted followers . We are not aware that the writings of Fourier , as a whole , have ever yet been translated into the English language , though the events of the last few years would seem to have created a pressing demand for them . Fragments of his works from time to time make their appearance in the Phalanx , ' or in other periodicals which advocate social science . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly acquainted with the character of Fourier 's mind , or the wonders of his philosophy . Our knowledge of him and of his doctrines is derived solely from the writings of his admirers and expounders in this country . We make this confession , because we would not seem to have an acquaintance with the subject before us , which we have not in fact .. Yet without any great amount of historical know . ledge , it is not hard to make out the main idea of what Fourier claims for himself , and we feel prepared to look at the subject in the light of certain well known truths . We think we can apply to the system unfolded by him certain tests which will try its validity . Charles Fourier was born at Be . sanc6n in France , in the year 1772 . He was the son of a merchant . After closing a collegiate education in his native city , he was at the age of eighteen engaged as clerk in a commercial house in the city of Lyons . He retained his place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for information led him to connect himself with another mercantile house as traveling agent . By this means he was enabled to visit most of the conspicuous places throughout the continent , and to gather a large fund of facts touching the social life and manners of European society . He did not limit his inquiries to the common objects of interest which meet the passing traveler . His attention was called to the v*ist inequalities in the conditions of men ; to the deception , falsehood and treachery , every where prevalent in social intercourse ; to the cruelty and injustice of the wealthier classes in their treatment of the poor ; to the wide spread corruptions of commerce and trade ; - all indicating , as it seemed , some deep seated disease-something radically out of order in social organization . Still , wide as were his trayels , he could find no country where he could pursue his peculiar course of investigation better than in his own . It must be confessed that a scene was opened in France during the active period of Fourier 's life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies of a thoughtful mind like his . He had but just come of age at the breaking out of the French revolution . During the season of his youth , he had looked upon a state of society so deplorably wretched , that the ablest pens have labored in vain to depict it in all its horrors . Oppression had made men mad . The evil effects of tyranny and misrule had been for centuries accumulating , until they were heaped upon the nation  --  a crushing , intolerable burden . The popular mind was every where wrought into a kind of frenzy . All things were fast getting ready for that stormy outbreak of passion , which came at length with such wild , ungovernable , aimless fury . Carlyle ( we think it is ) has compared the French nation at this period to a wounded monster , groaning and writhing in pain , but with no knowledge whence the pain proceeds , or how relief is to be gained . We regard it as creditable alike to the head and to the heart of Fourier , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes that were then passing . His early acquaintance with the details of commercial business enabled him to glance from this outward wretchedness and calamity into the world of their causes . He was enabled to know what was passing behind the scenes . There he saw selfishness waging a fiendish war with selfishness-a perfect anarchy of interests , where each individual was toiling and struggling to keep the uppermost place . Fourier had no heart to join in such a contest . With a mind naturally elevated and upright , averse to all those petty meannesses which make up so large a // part of some men 's whole lives , he stood apart , a gloomy and indignant spectator . So early even as the year 1790 , a little before the breaking out of the revolution , having just closed his collegiate education , and previous to his entering the mercantile house at Lyons , he visited Paris . This was his first sight of the great metropolis of his nation , and his mind was naturally awake to observe all that was passing around him . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon Paris only as a grand theater of pleasure , where all things had been made ready for the indulgence of passion , or at the best , only as a capital position for sight seeingFourier entered it with the aims of a philosopher . He walked its streets busied with serious and weighty thoughts . The scene which Paris presents to an inquiring stranger is at alt times intensely interesting . The metropolis , not of France alone , but of the world , it opens to the traveler in its various departments more themes of rational investigation , than any other place in Christendom . But the scenes which were passing there in the year 1790 , were of a strange and peculiar interest . Paris was a miniature of France , or we raigh t without impropriety say it was France itself . It must have struck every one acquainted with the details of the revolution , how all things in that long and bloody contest center about this one point . Fourier was permitted to look upon Paris on the very eve of this popular outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriated with passion-driven on madly under a sense of injustice and flagrant wrong . He was as yet but a youth . He had just stepped forth from the quiet retreats of learning , where he had been living in converse with the calm and philosophic minds of other days . Every true youthful scholar is more or less a dreamer . A light goes forth from himself , tinging every object with a beautiful but deceptive coloring . He had been looking at men under the strong illusion of the imagination , as they sat discoursing in the schools of Plato and Aristotle , or walking thoughtfully in the groves of ancient learning , meditating on truth and immortality . From the silence of the study , he passed at once into scenes of savage strife . Instead of meeting his lofty ideals , men thronged before him in the shape of fiends and monsters . His whole nature was shocked at the spectacles which met his eye during his sojourn at Paris . We can not follow out the life of Fourier . It would require more space than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reader , and to explain some of the reasons why his mind should have taken the direction it did . One or two little incidents are related of him , which , though comparatively trifling in themselves , are nevertheless valuable , as illustrating the bent of his mind , and the nature of his work . While at Paris he had occasion to purchase a particular kind of apple , of which he was very fond , and which he had often bought in the country . Lie was surprised at the price demanded , no less than seven pence per apple . He had often purchased the same article in the country at the rate of a dozen for three farthings . The apple was therefore selling at Paris at one hundred and twelve times its usual original cost . Nine years after jhis visit to Paris , Fourier was employed in a commercial house in Marseilles . The storm of war had now rolled off from France itself , hut its thunders were heard in the distance as they broke along the south of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like the surviving company of a shipwrecked crew , who , having toiled all night with the tempest , find themselves at the first // glimmer of morning on a wild and rocky coast ,  --  their bark dashed to pieces-their companions in the waves  --  and they themselves cold , and hungry , and desolate . While connected with this house in Marseilles in the year 1799 , Fourier was appointed to superintend a body of men , who had been hired to cast secretly a large quantity of rice into the sea . This rice had been hoarded up by speculators , and had been kept on hand month after month , while the people were famishing , in hope of still more extrav*gant profits , until it was totally spoiled . This circumstance affected the mind of Fourier deeply . It was about this time that he began to exelude himself from society , and give his mind more entirely to his pecu. liar studies . The task which Fourier set before himself was no less than thisto find out the causes of those great and wide-spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to provide a grand and sovereign remedy . It was no partial and superficial relief which he proposed to bring-it was not to be confined to French society-it was to be leep , radical , universal and perpetual-it was to carry its healing influences to all the hidden sources of disease . The great problem was how to get rid of evil-how to cast out this devil whose name is Legion , ' from human society , and bring man at once into a paradisiacal state . Fourier had in his mind a great thought , all will confess . If he should prove at last to be only a dreamer , we will agree at least , that he dreamed on a magnificent scale . There was a certain loftiness about the mind , that should ever set itself to so sublime an undertaking . it is sufficient for our purpose in this place simply to state , that Fourier claims to have found that for which he sought . Starting with the idea that the great war of interests , which at present prevails in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selfishness of another , is the cause of all that extravagance , and waste , and social wrong which we every where see ; and that the present organization of society leads necessarily and inevitable to this war ; he aims to discover , and claims to have discovered , a plan of organization for society , which leads just as necessarily , just as inevitably , to an opposite result-that is , it groWs oi*tt of the very nature of his new plan , that one man 's inter sts are and must be another man 's interests , so that the two fall at once into harmofly , and can not be discordant . In the workings of this social machine , there shall be no chance for any jar , simply because all disturbing causes are excluded . This result is to be secured by a nice balancing of all things according to the fixed laws of nature , so that what each man is to do , is rendered attractive to him , and not repulsive , as in the present order of things . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner desired , simply because he is encircled by such motives , that he is made continually to feel and know that his happiness depends on his doing it  --  and it is an old truth that all men desire happiness . So soon , then , as the human race shall come into this new social organization you shall no more hear of evil , of selfishness , of strife . All these are cut off , cast out by the very nature of the plan . They vanish into space at the waving of the magic wand , that calls into being this new social order . We believe we have not exaggerated in this statement . Fourier claims that his plan has its foundations laid deep in nature-that it is no chimera launched at once from a poetic brain-that it is a science fixed as Astronomy itself-painfully elaborated by long years of silent study . He claims for it absolute perfection , as he ought to do if it is a science . This // was no half-way work according to his idea . His plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute exemption from evil . All was to be as clear and serene , as " when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy . " We dwell upon this point the more particularly , because our strong prevailing impression is , that the mass of the Fourierites in this country , are falling a great way behind the mark-that they are a set of miserable backsliders-that they no more preach the gospel of good tidings which Fourier taught , than Unitarians and Universalists preach the Gospel of Christ  --  and that if their master were now to rise from the dead and come among them , his first work would be to lash them up to duty . We do not mean by this , that when any writer in this country attempts , as Mr. Brisbane has done in the pamphlet before us , to set forth any thing like a complete view of Fourierism ; he does not recognize this claim to perfection . We mean simply that among the mass of those who have embarked in this new scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a result-that common sense or something else , has so far got hold of them , that they can not quite believe what Fourier taught . Nevertheless this was the original claim , and in our review of the system , we intend to look at it only in this light . If it is a science it will stand this test , and if it is not a science what is it ? In studying the system of Fourier as first set forth hy his expounders on this side the water , there is the best evidence in the world that he claimed for it this entire perfection . That evidence is found , if need be , in the fact that he makes no provisions for any refuse . The " ground plan " of his edifice tells of no prison rooms , where evildoers may be brought to correction . We have examined it carefully . There is a most liberal outlay for granaries , and store-houses-for public squares , and court-yard* , and gardens-for council , reading , library , exchange and banquet rooms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole establishment , which does not whisper of harmony and peace and love . However , we are not to be restricted to this mere negative evidence . We turn to the direct statements . And here we shall no longer venture to use our own words . We have no confidence in ourselves . We have no idea that we could go straight for a single line in this peculiar kind of philosophy . Let Mr. Brisbane speak for himself . " Fourier discovered the laws ofuniversal unity , or the laws which govern creation in its five grand spheres or movements : 1st the material movement , or the laws which govern the movements of the heavenly bodies , or universal matter ; 2d , the aromal , or the laws which regulate the distribution and influences of the imponderable fluids on the kingdoms of creation-animal , vegetable , and mineral ; 3d , the organic , or the laws according to which God distributes forms , properties , colors , flavors , etc. , to all created things ; 4th , the instinctual , or the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lastly , the social , or the laws which govern the succession and mechanisnis of the societies of intelligent beings throughout the universe . " From a knowledge of these laws of universal unity , Fourier deduced the true and natural system of society , disiinct for man , and which when realized in practice , will produce social order and harmony upon the globe  --  a reflex of the harmony which reigns in the universe . ' * We bring forward this passage at the present time only to show what is claimed for the new science . There are some items in this extract for farther consideration . We may perhaps gather Mr. Brisbane 's own untrammeled opinion more clearly from his preface to the reader , ' where he does not of course write like an expositor . " The institutions and tendencies of the associated or combined order are in perfect harmony with the highest conceptions of truth , justice , and love , entertained in theory . by the world , and which // are embodied in the doctrines of Christ . Association will establish Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and the love of the neighbor the greatest desire and the practice of all men . " Having in the preceding remarks introduced Fourier to the reader , and shown with what views and aims he set himself to his great undertaking-having explained in brief the general nature and design of his new system , and what he himself ( as well as the writer of the pamphlet ) claims for it , it is fit that we should now take leave of the man , and confine ourselves to his work . We have endeavored to speak of Fourier himself with becoming respect . We doubt not , that he was a man of a large benevolence-one who wished the best things to his nation and his race . We think we can discern in him , what we can also discern in some of his leading disciples in this country , a magnanimous heart , a full-souled pity for the woes of men , and an intense desire to afford relief . Sooner let our right arm be palsied , our tongue speechless , than we would lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this benevolent feeling . And whether the followers of Fourier will credit it or not , they may rest assured , that this single trait of character discernible in some who stand at the head of this new movement has done more to keep those silent , who would otherwise have been ready to speak , than all things else put together . Many in this matter have acted upon the well known principle to let crime quietly escape , rather than that one innocent man be condemned . They have feared lest , in waging war upon this new movement , they should seem to stand in the same category with James Watson Webb , and other kindred spirits , whose heartless and cowardly attacks , have received , what they merited , the deep contempt of the upright throughout the land . They would not for one moment seem to take sides with men of this class , compared with whom their great opponent in the New York press , in moral aims and purposes , stands like Ilyperion to a Satyr . ' The purity and elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldness in all they say or write about him . They are under a strong temptation to push forward without making proper distinc*ions-to suppose that all must be right , where so much is right . Thus Park Godwin , one of his admirers , after going through with the details of Fourier 's life , breaks out into the following piece of very fine writing : " Now this life we conceive is not the life of a quack , nor indeed of an qrdinary man . Such life-long devotion to an object of inferior magnitude would indicate more than ordinary greatness . What shall we say of it , then , when we consider that it was devotion to the grandest and most sacred interests of man ? Is an intellect which can thus slowly , painfully , patiently , evolve and elaboi-ate its conclusions to be despised ? Is not the whole air and manner of the man , the air and manner of one who looks earnestly into the facts of existence , and who wrestles sincerely to find the key of this mysterious and terrible life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness ? It does seem to us that no one can read the simple details of this life-so quiet yet so intense-so scholar-like , yet so mingled with the sternest realities of every-day-so impassive in its intellectual dignity and strength-so high in its moral aims-so rigid , direct , full of the consciousness of a mighty mission , but all the while so child-like , modest , without pretension or uneasiness-without feeling that it approaches the morally sublime . That lone man , friendless , companionless , poor-sitting there for forty years , in his scant garret , while the splendor and bustle of busy Paris rolled at his feet , working out his dark problem of the destiny of humanity oii earth , forging link by link in the chain of a complete science , as year after year came around , furnishes me with a conception of human grandeur and power , far tnore exalted than atiy I ever derived from contemplating the debates of the senate-house , or the shock of armies . There with his bread and water , while thousands of his fellow-mortals lay sunmening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lamplight that struggled upward through the dense cloud of dust and smoke of the great city , alone with midnight and the stars , with thought and God ! " // Now this passage exhibits a state of feeling , which it is hard to break in upon violently . We can go with Mr. Godwin up to a certain point in his admiration of his master . But we claim an equal right on our part to admire one of the old Alchemists of the middle ages , shut up in his gloomy cell with his fire and bellows , and with the wrecks of old crucibles scattered around himtoiling on through day and night , heat and cold , storm and sunshine , to find the philosopher 's stone . There is something more antique and dusky about the old fellow  --  and he too had great objects in view ; and he stuck to his work till death stopped him . There are manifestly two ques. tions which come within relation to this subject , and as we have disposed of the first we will now turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say under several distinct heads . I. We have in the first place , a kind of presumptive argument against the system under consideration , in the fact that Fourier is only one of a very great number of men , who have in different ages attempted much the same thing , but without success . We do not intend to give this argument any undue prominence , but let it pass for what it is worth . D'Israeli in his Curiosities of Literature , ' speaks of the six follies of Science . ' He says , " nothing is so capable of disordering the intellect as an intense application to any one of these six things : the quadrature of the circle ; the multiplication of the cube ; the perpetual motion ; the philosophical stone ; magic ; and judicial astrology . In youth we may exercise our imagination on these curious , topics , merely to convince us of their impossibility , but it shows a great defect in judgment to be occupied on them in an advanced age . " Might he not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of follies , ' viz. to form out of human materials , a perfect state or commonwealth ? It would seem , that the experience of mankind had made it evident , that the last is as chimerical as either of the others . There have been glorious dreamers in all ages of the world , and not a few of them have dreamed on this particular subject . Almost every scholar of any imagination can call to mind times in his life , when he has been sorely tempted to let his organ of ideality , go a systemmaking . But when the stern man of science has come along , and ruthlessly dashed down his fair and beautiful fabrics , and scattered them to the wind ; he has by degrees learned , that the structures which a true philosophy erects go up slowly , and with patient toil . We have no time now to go into an examination of the various plans , which men in past ages have formed for the reconstruction of society . We shall only instance a few of them . That sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he thought he fixed men theoretically right . But the grand difficulty was to make them stay in their places . It is true , only some very imperfect attempts were made to realize his theory . But it does not appear that so far as his system was novel and peculiar , it had much more of substantial reality in it , than the conception which Pythagoras formed of the music of the spheres . ' It was simply a great creation of a lofty intellect , dreaming of man , as he would have him he , rather than ashe is . Sir Thomas More had his Utopia ' - his beautiful somewhere , ' in which he set a little world a going according to his notions . It is not likely indeed that lie once thought of carrying his theory into practice . It was an ingenious , and at the same time a safe way of hinting at some of the errors and abuses of the English government in the days of the Tudors . Fenelon 's Telemaque ' was not materially different in its design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Constitution for South Carolini . ' St. Simon , of France went into all manner of vice , for the express purpose of gaining all sorts of knowledge , preparatory to the work of reconstructing society . Others too numerous to mention have attempted much the same thing ; and that this particular field of discovery has not yet been thoroughly explored , seems evident from the fact , that in the last world 's convention ' in New York , there was hardly a man , whether learned or ignorant , rich or ragged , who did not stand ready to&lt; come forward with his own individual plan for making over ' the world . Of* course all , this proves nothing . The Fourierites feel that however wrong all the rest of these men may have been , their leader was right . But we who have not their faith , are led to suspect that his theory may not be at all more substantial than the rest . The many attempts which have been made , and which have proved unsuccessful , lead us strongly to doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this kind of invention , and will understand at the time that he is only blowing soap-bubbles and not creating worlds , it will do .. He may find it a very pleasant amusement . But if he sets about it in real earnest , we must be allowed to think from past experience , that he will most signally fail . Still , as we said at the outset , we let this remark pass for what it is worth . IL . We can not but feel the very great improbability , that Fourier 's system is a science , from the very nature of the subject itself-the inherent difficulties to be surmounted . We are astounded at the very outset , at the boundless extent of his pretensions . If what he claims for himself is true , we grant at once , that there never was a rnortal eye that ranged through creation like his-that all which has hitherto been called great in intellectual achievement , is not worthy to be once named or to come into notice . Let us look at this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of universal unity , or the laws which govern creation in its five grand spheres or movements , which are : 1st , the material movement , or the laws which govern the movements of the heavenly bodies , or universal matter . " In this first department of discovery , it has been heretofore thought , that some other distinguished men , such as Kepler and Newton , did that which merited some little praise . What Newton in particular effected in this field of study has placed him ( as was supposed justly ) at the head of his race . It is not once pretended that Fourier availed himself at all of the labors of Newton or any other man . Nay it is his Aboast and the boast of his followers , that he toiled on in the most glorious independence of every body else . It would be interesting for us to know how the labors of Newton and Kepler and such like men , looked to himwhen he had finished UI ) ' this department of study . Mr. Brisbane does not at once condescend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same conclusions about things , that they did , or whether he found their work all wrong  --  and they themselves only mere smatterers in science . We question whether it is not the duty of such men , able as they are , to wing their independent flight through regions , where access is denied to most of us , to compare notes ' on their return for the instruction and amusement of the rest of us who are necessitated to stay and take care of the homestead . " 2d , the aromal , or the laws which regulate the distribution and influences of the imponderable fluids on the kingdoms of creation-mineral , vegetable and universal . " Now it strikes us that this is a very nice piece of work . We can not say how much those scientific men who have labored most successfully in // this general branch of study , profess to know on the subject . Very little , however , we suppose . The imponderable agents must , from their very nature , be exceedingly slow to yield up their most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research-they elude investigation . It is worthy to be mentioned in this connection , that the work of Fourier which relates to these matters , now under consideration , is called the Theory of %he Four Movements ; ' though as the case now stands , there are five movements ' instead of four . The facts are these . When Fourier first published the book in 1808 , he had not then discovered the laws of this aromal movement . ' It does not appear , however , that the system of social organization , based on these movements , was not just as much a fixed science before this last discovery as afterwards . If the flight of a comet through the region of our solar system brings with it certain disturbing influences , it would naturally be supposed that this aromal movement , ' coming into the category of causes , would modify , to some extent , the previous science . " 3d , the organic , or the laws according to which God distributes forms , properties , colors , flavors , etc. to all created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . It reminds one of frost-work pyramids and towers , set up in confectionary shops for show , and labeled , hands offl ' " 4th , the instinctual . This brings us ( as we suppose ) into the regions of mind . And yet we should not suppose that we had got along quite so far under the head ' instinctual , ' were it not for the fact that he has but one head more , and that seems to he almost as unsatisfactory as this . We take it for granted , therefore , that we are in the regions of mind . In this department of investigation it is well known that science has progressed only by little and little . Mental philosophy in the history of our race , seems to have lagged behind the physical sciences . And yet for ages there has been a succession of powerful thinkers engaged in this department of study . However , the entire field seems to have spread out clearly before the mind of Fourier . He took in the whole at one quick and comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws which govern the succession and mechanisms of the societies of intelligent beings throughout the universe . From a knowledge of these laws of universal unity , Fourier deduced the true and natural system of society destined for man . " In view of all this we say again , that there is an inherent improbability , amounting almost to a certainty , that Fourier never formed a true and safe system in the manner claimed ; and we have no doubt that every unprejudiced man , who knows any thing about the labor of discovery , will agree with us in this . His claims are too great by far . His pretensions are just lofty and high sounding enough to captivate a certain class of minds . With all our respect for the feelings , wishes , aims of Fourier , we can not but feel , so soon as we come into the details of his system , that we are in the midst of pompous and magnificent nothings . It reminds us of what we saw and heard a few years ago , when visiting an insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of evening prayers , when all the inmates , who were rational enough to keep quiet , are allowed to be present . After the service was over , the patients all went quietly back to their rooms , with the exception of one odd looking genius , who still kept his seat on the bench where he had been sitting during prayers . His face wore an expression of selfsatisfaction , of conscious greatness , which made it interesting to us as a study . The attending physician who // was present , but who happened to be busy about something for a few moments , did not notice him , until all at once turning round and seeing him there , he said , " Oh ! - yes You want some more paper , of course . How do you get along with that calculation of yours ? " Well , he did'nt like to say , exactly . ' " Oh ! never mind ! " said the physician , " I would'nt wish to press the matter at all if you prefer not to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say much about it just at present . ' He took his sheet of paper , and went to his room . We asked the physician what it meant . He said that the man had a notion in his head , that he was working out a little the greatest mathematical calculation that ever was heard of-one that would astonish all nations when it should at length come out-that he had been employed day by day for months in this great work , laboriously adding and subtracting , multiplying and dividing , but that as a matter of fact , though he had covered many quires of paper with figures , he had never gone a step beyond the ground rules ' of arithmetic . Now , for ourselves we must be allowed to doubt whether Fourier 's great problem was any more fairly and legitimately wrought out thaj* that . We are not well enough acquainted with the mental structure of the man , to discover by what defect of mind he was led to suppose that he had constructed a science when he had not . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretensions are too lofty  --  the claims are too unbounded . His particular system is of such a character , that to have laid its foundations in nature , as is claimed , to have made the whole strictly scientific , must have demanded a knowledge far greater than was ever possessed by any other one of the race . It might have been supposed at the time of Lord Bacon 's death , as the laws and rules of the inductive process were clearly defined , that for the future nothing would be called a science which did not properly bear the name-that the world would no longer be troubled by sham systems , foisted into public notice by any adventurer into the fields of discovery . But the tendency has been directly the opposite . Now that true scientific research has in it a dignity which it had not before , the number of aspirants is increased . There is no end to the sciences of the present age . The phrenologist comes forth from his cocoon , the creature of a day old , the ephemera of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all which has been achieved in mental research and discovery , amounts to but very little . He is the true mental philosopher . He can give you the science of the mind in a very few moments . And though he does now and then mistake a most desperate villain for an honest man , and vice versa , yet it is all so bland and easy you knowexceptions to all rules ' - ' ca n't tell what the man might have been in other circumstances ' - ' nothing to make us lose our confidence in phrenology , as a strict scienceof course not . ' Next comes the animal magnetizer . He is prepared to set before his audience the wonders of his new*system , and to make the proof more full and satisfactory , and perfectly overwhelming , he will connect with it also phrenology , so that the two handmaids may walk on together , mutually comforting , strengthening , and supporting . Such being the state of things at this day , it is not strange at all that Fourierism ' should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not strange , either , that this fact should be no evidence that the system is not the merest sham in the world . We are , it is true , somewhat startled at the idea of forty years of hard study on the part of the author . But we call to mind // that this is not a whit longer time than many an old rusty German spends amid smoke and dirt without effecting any thing for mankind . III . There is yet another kind of evidence against Fourierism . The system is at war with well established truths and facts . It is the glory of truth that it finds confirmation whichever way it turns . It reaches out with a thousand hands , and takes hold of all the great realities of the universe . Buta false system grasps like a drowning man for supports , and does not find them . The start . ing point in Fourier 's theory is all wrong . lie sets out with the idea that evil , as seen in our world , comes only from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it than this . We can not of course be mistaken about this matter since , by a reorganization of society , he proposes to remove all evil out of the way . The question , " Whence came this evil ? " has been a great question in our world . It is an inquiry which has tasked the powers of the most philosophic minds for many ages . More than twenty centuries ago , that question agitated the schools of Persia and Arabia , of Egypt and Greece . Some of the strong old thinkers of early times , who were without our light , seeing how evil had spread itself through all the ramifications of human life , did not think they could account for it without bringing in a separate and independent god of evil , ' to untie the knot . They talked sometimes of two principles-sometimes of two deities , the one evil , the other good , alike existing from eternity . But Fourier has hit upon just the simplest , easiest , prettiest , sliallowest theory that could well have been invented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last century , of all men in the world , would be likely to have blundered upon . Evil has its source and its only source in a bad organization of society . I say only source . Get the new system a going and all will he plain sailing . There will be nothing left to give any alarm , nothing to make any more disturbance . And let it be remembered , too , that Fourier is careful to use no harsher word than evil , ' if we may judge from Mr. Brisbane 's translations and expositions . There is a word in our language which is by no means a new comer . It did not flow in from classic streams . Christianity , when she came into Britain , did not bring it along . It is a native of the north . Every thing about it hetokens its Teutonic lineage . Its roots run deep and strong into the old soil of the Saxon mind . That word is sin . Did ever Mr. Brisbane or Fourier hear of it ? Let them but substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances where the latter occurs in their writings , and see what work it will make with their new system . Let them but once give that stern , square-built , emphatic old Saxon , any thing like a fair chance , and if he does not elbow his way along most unmercifully , we have altogether mistaken his energy . Nay , let the Fourier . ites but once bring him in , even though in sport , and ten chances to one if he do not prove a very Samson himself , to tear down their whole establishment about them . A man may talk about evil as originating in social organizations , and all may sound very proper and smooth ; but when we come to talk about sin as having its source and only source in these organizations , the effect is somewhat different , as all will perceive . Mr. Brisbane 's pamphlet consists of some eighty pages , double columned , and in it he has had occasion to say a good deal about the causes of human wretchedness , but we do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole book . We have stopped and looked for some time in vain to find it , and we do not remember to have met with it in our reading of the pamphlet . Now we object in toto ' to // this cavalier treatment of ' a word so old and venerable . It is an insult to our common sense and our sense of propriety , which no Frenchman or Frenchified American has a right to offer . These men have a certain meek and placid way of talking about the Bible and religion , about Christ and Christianity , as though they were concerned in the same great objects with the Christian world . But how happens it that the Bible takes such a different view of things from them , that it speaks so often of sin , and levels its reproofs so much at the heart of every individual man , and not at social organizations ? If Mr. Brisbane is a believer in the Bible and in Christianity , will he be kind enough to account for two or three facts ? Revelation assures us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our world through the garden of Eden . Into that beau . tiful paradise God led the first human pair , that they might dress it and keep it . They were surrounded with all things which could make life delightful . God himself had fitted up their residence for them , and fitted them for their residence . Their labors and pursuits were in the highest sense ' attractive . ' They found their pleasure and happiness in them . Their interests had not yet grown to be warring and antagonistic . They had no lack of sup . plies . Speculation had not yet hoard . ed up the fruits of the earth . In the midst of the garden grew every tree that was pleasant to the sight , and that was good for food . ' The rich had not yet come to oppress the poor . Fourier himself will not pretend that things here were not in a good condition . Now how unfortunately it happens for this new theory , that sin or evil , whichever we call it , should have got into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nick of time , when Mr. Brisbane would like to have it keep out ! Again . When God led forth the children of Israel from Egypt , he formed them into a theocracy . At Mount Sinai , he gave them their constitution and laws , and he became their King . He led them by the hand of Moses and Aaron ' to the promised land . The old inhabitants were driven out to make way for the new people . Now if association on Fourier 's theory be the form of society which God destined for man on earth , if this social order ' is f&amp;unded deep in nature , and is that alone which God has in his eye for the perfection of humanity , will Mr. Brisbane tell us why it was not set agoing here on a larger scale ? God was with this people from their infancy . LIe was their guide and King . He gave shape to their society . We may be told that the world had not yet got ready for the new system . But science relates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , science contemplates that alone which is fundamental and uniform . If association is based upon the great realities of the universe , they were no less realities then than now . Again . " Association will establish Christianity practically upon earth . It will make the love of God and the love of the neighbor the greatest desire and the practice of all men . " Why did Christ , then , take such a laborious way of establishing Christianity . Why ' did he not at once gather his followers into these little communities , and thus give a practical demonstration of the value of association . Mr. Brisbane tells us that " these great doctrines , for the first time announced to the world , should have led to the establishment of a new social order by the followers of Christ , in which they could have been realized in practice . But the institutions of the old social world of conflict , of war , of isolation and discord , were so strongly and deeply rooted , that they have as yet resisted the renovating doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Fourierism. fessed faith of the Christian world . " All this was said out of courtesy to Christianity . Foolish men ! Why did not Christ himself establish this social order ? Why did he leave the work to his followers ? If there is so easy and sovereign a remedy for moral disease , why did he not put it in practice at once ?  --  or at least leave behind him a plan , so that his followers might have known how to model their new community ? Again , Fourier tells us that association on his principle exists in nature ,  --  that it is made out from the very nature of things . We know that some institutions do exist in nature in just this way-that while they may not be revealed in word , nevertheless they are known to be according to the design of God , as seen in the arrangements of the world . Such are governments , laws , and the marriage relation . One of the first things noticeable in Fourier 's system of association , is that it destroys all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered over the world called families . These are at once merged and lost sight of in this new arrangement . Now there are some pretty strong and obvious reasons for supposing that the existence of men in families is according to God 's design ; while the reasons for supposing that it is God 's design that men should live in these associated communities , ' if any exist , are at best very shadowy and obscure , so that the human mind finds it exceedingly difficult to grasp and apprehend them . Families come into existence by a natural process . When one man and one woman are united together as husband and wife , you have the germ of a new commumty . There is no transcendentalism about it . You do not have to peer and squint through eternal fogs , to understand how it comes to be so . It is an obviously natural arrangement . The Fourierites are aiming to show that this is an Un-69 natural arrangement , and that the only way to live according to nature is to live in these communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably be a very long time before they can convince the world that the wisdom of God is not strikingly manifest in collecting men into families and households . Had we time we might go on to show in many other particulars , how Fourierism is at war with well known truths and facts . But these must suffice . IV . We wish now in this our final remark , to take our readers a little into the details of the system , as set forth by Mr. Brisbane , to see if they can understand a few things , over which we have puzzled our brain to no purpose . We shall be short about this , for a long excursion would be tedious in the extreme . " In a group regularly organized , the ascending wing should be stronger than the descending wing , and the center stronger than either . We will give examples of two groups , one composed of twelve , and the other of sixteen members . Group of twelve members . Ascending wing , 4 Center , 5 Descending wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing , - - 2 3 Center , - - - - 2 3 2 Descending wing , - - 2 2 " The object of these divisions will be explained hereafter . " A series is distributed in the same manner as a group ; the series are composed of a number of&gt;groups , as groups are composed of individuals , and operate upon groups , as groups upon individuals . A series must contain at least three groups  --  a center and two wings : twenty four persons is the least number with which a series can he formed . The central group should be stronger than the two groups of the wings . As there will be a strong emulation between the center and the win s , and asthe wings will unite in their efforts to excel the center , the latter must be more numerous in order to be able to vie with , and equal the influence of the wings . The ascending wing will be occupied with the heaviest branch of a work , if the series be engaged in manufactures ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // grains , fruits , vegetables , or flowers ; the center will be occupied with the most elegant branch or variety ; and the descending , with the lightest and smallest . Suppose in an association three varieties of some species of a peach or pear are cultivated . A group would he occupied with each variety , and the three groups united would form a series of peach or pear growers . A series of 12 groups cultivating pears . Ascending wing , 4 groups cultivating four varieties of the early bergarnot . Center , 5 groups cultivating five varieties of the red bergamot . Descending wing , 3 groups cultivating three varieties ofthe summer hergamot . " Now does Mr. Brisbane mean to tell us that he ever really ciphered that all out , so as to see honestly and fairly how all these things balance mathematically ? We remember in our school-boy days some youngsters who had a wonderful facility at getting out sums , by simply setting down the statements and the answers . And we have no faith to believe that there was any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we first undertook to follow out the details of Fourier 's plan , our interest was excited to know what would become of the little children . We are great lovers of little children , and we were curious to discover what part they would bear in this nine-fold harmony of discords . Coatemplating the great change which was to come over every one so soon as he entered this new system , we supposed that the younger folk would become little seraphs , or something of the kind , to sit upon golden stools , and sing while the old folks were at dinner . But horror of horrors ! What was our surprise to find , that after a certain age , they were to constitute the sacred legion ' so called , to do all the dirty work about the establishment . Now so long as man remains what he is , the dirty work about such a place must be immense , and we absolutely shuddered at their hard lot . But we soon found that their work was to be made attractive to them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they would go into it ' of choice . And besides we are told that their sympathies are consulted in this arrangement , since persons of their years have a natural fondness for dirty things . " Boys have at this age , as we know , no natural antipathy or repugnance to dirty or offensive contacts . To compass a trick , they will sometimes resort to the most filthy expedients , without any regard to personal considerationsindeed it may be said that a majority of them have a taste for dirt ; and this inclination will overcome any dislike for the uncleanly works which they will assume in association , and allow them to take part freely in the series or corporation of the sacred legion , which they will be induced to do , from devotion and social philanthropy , and from the high honor and consideration which will be bestowed upon its functions . " Oh , philosophy , what a beautiful thing thou art to keep a man out of difficulty ! Now all this that we have been attempting will seem to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . It will be exceedingly difficult for us to prove to him , that we have any true pity for the woes of men-any true desire for their relief . It will seem that we have been trifling with what is sacred . His heart has been so warmed up with love to his masterhis thoughts have been so long fixed upon this system , as the only relief for a world living in wickednesshis imagination has been so kindled at the glorious prospect in the future that he can have no patience with those who are looking to other sources for relief . tlear Mr. Brisbane go off into a splendid rhapsody , and then judge if we must not seem to him cold and mean . It is a part of his address to artists . " The palaces of the associations , artists ! the rural pavilions , the kiosks and bowers , with which their rich fields will be besprinkled , the monumental cities and // the capitals of the globe-behold , artists I what is well worth the prosaic constructions and contracted architectural works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold arches uniting massive walls , cupolas , towers , and up-shooting spires ; your genius will be at ease in those grand lines , the forms and movements of which you will have to combine . There will be wanted portals to the palaces of the association , from which seven horses abreast can pass out with ease ; there will be wanted windows broad and open by which the sun can enter into the house of man to distribute liberally life and color ; there will be wanted corridors , balconies and terraces , where the population of Phalanstery may spread out and form around it bright garlands with its thousand heads of women and joyful children . * * * " There do you see , it will be necessary to harmonize water , fire , light , granite and the metals : art will have in its large hands all these elements to combine ; it will be a creation ! Then orchestras of a thousand parts , choirs of a thousand voices ; hymns and poems sung by mass*s ; ballets danced by populations . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , will raise every man to the dignity of artist , and ifevery man is nota poet or composer , every man at least knows how to execute his part in the whole -- each man is a note in the great concert . * * * * Say , artist ! say , poets ! feel you not there the destiny of man ? Say , in all these wonders of social harmony do you not feel the stamp of the beautiful and the true , the type of which exists in your souls ? Say , is all this false , and is the true to be found in the contracted and prosaic life , works and constructions of the present-in the narrow , trading spirit , in the conflicts and discords of civilized society ? Say , does not this suit your unaginations and your hearts better than a pyramid of Egypt built by a people fed on onions , and crushed under the weight of stones , or the palace of a Nero , or even the column of Vendome built of bronze that kills in battles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rich and happy , to embellish its planet , to make it , with the thousand rich and varied creations upon it , a resplendent dress which will not render it ashamed in the celestial ball , where it occupies in the luminous round the place of honor beside the sun ! Yes , where humanity will move in its power and live according to its law , we shall see many other wonders developed under the influence of human power combined with tl , e vivifying power of the globe , and what I have said is but poverty and bitterness . The destiny of man is there onward ! But let us stop . . - . I forget that these words are pronounced in a world of pain and misery , where six thousand years of suffering have blighted the hearts of men and dried up in them all sources of hope . Evil has infiltrated itself into the very marrow of their bones and has consumed even desire . All the dreams-all the hopes of the future are limited at present to the conquest ofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Let us stop . " We are not insensible to the beauty of all this . We used in our boyhood to admire the descriptions of those splendid palaces in the Arabian Nights , which were got up by the aid of Aladdin 's lamp . But let us take our stand upon another post of observation . The eye of the prophet Isaiah was permitted to range over the distant future . He too saw a remedy for a sin-burdened world . That remedy was to come from altogether another source . " And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse , and a branch shall grow out of his roots : " And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord ; " And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord , and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth , and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked . " And righteousness shall he the girdle of his loins , and faithfulness the girdle of his reins . " The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard shall lie down with the kid , the calf , and the young lion , and the fatling together , and a little child shall lead them . " And the cow and the bear shall feed , their young ones shall lie down together ; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox . " And the suckling child shall play upon the hole of the asp , and the // weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice 's den . " They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still remains true that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the sovereign remedy for sin . Nor in saying this would we be thought to undervalue other agencies for the reformation of the world . We are well aware that one social organization is better than another . We regard the society of New England as far superior to the society of the South , or of Old England . But when any man or any set of men , attempts thoroughly to reform the world by hyman means and instrumentalities , without bringing the Christian religion to their aid-leaving it entirely out of mind as the Fourierites have virtually done , they may be sure that it will at last he said of them , " They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace , when there is no peace. * ,
