txt /z/ mercy , I was brought to lick the dust of God 's footstool , and accept of salvation by grace . " His hopeful conversion was soon followed by an open confession of Christ , not only in the act of entering into covenant with the Church , but in his daily conversation and intercourse with the world . He united with the Congregational church in Stamford on the 17th September , 1786 . His conversion and subsequent zeal in the service of God created much sensation among the people . It was a day when revivals were few and when religion , especially among the young , was suffering general neglect . Even many good men , in their remembrance of the extravagances of Davenport and others , and the evils connected with them , and dreading the return to Zion of such calamities , were themselves almost suspicious of any unwonted exhibition of zeal in the promotion of religion . Hence , when the subject of this sketch , in the days of his first love to Christ , began to speak in meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for him , occasion was taken for much remark . Some doubted ; some were anxious as to whereunto these things would grow ; others , like the mother of Jesus , " kept all these sayings in " their hearts . He had no sooner become satisfied of his acceptance with God through Christ , than a desire for the " office of a bishop " sprung up in his soul ; and this desire , under the advice of his pastor and other Christian friends , soon grew into a purpose to prepare himself for that " good work . " His master , to whom he was indented , convinced that he would not pursue his trade beyond the period of his indenture , should he be held to its fulfillment , and knowing his desire to enter upon a course of study , kindly released him from his obligations . His return to New /z/ Canaan with a new character , and a new purpose for life , subjected him to prejudice and embarrassment , which often fall to the lot " of a prophet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for the change ; but others were unbelieving , and marveled that a young dependent mechanic , whose mother and sisters were with them , should conceive the purpose of becoming a minister of the Gospel . His coming among his " own people , " however , made a favorable impression upon the minds of some , both in and out of the Church . His brother , now of Westport , Ct. , says : " When James returned home I was thoughtless and careless , as most young people were at that time . But his warnings and admonitions made an impression upon my mind which I could not shake off . I have ever regarded his pious influence at that time , as the chief instrumentality in bringing me to a knowledge of Christ . " There were those , also , who welcomed him as a helper in sustaining " the things which were ready to die " in the Church of God . Weekly religious meetings , which had long been suspended , were appointed at his earnest solicitation , and aided by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of study preparatory to college was commenced under the direction of the Rev. Justus Mitchel , then pastor in New Canaan . Inspired with a love of study , and a desire for " the office of a bishop " now anticipated with all the freshness and power of his " first love " he gave himself to his books with great zeal and energy . After the lapse of a few months , however , he was interrupted by sickness a form of embarrassment with which he became very familiar in the progress of his studies . This attack was followed by an extreme weakness of his eyes , which deprived him of their use for several months . In this emergency he contrived to make some progress in his course of study , by availing himself of the aid of his /z/ youngest sister , who daily read in his hearing such lessons as he might direct . His preparations for college were completed under the instructions of Dr. Burnett , of Norwalk , to which place he was invited by two female relatives Sarah and Phebe Comstock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him other aid according to their ability . These excellent females continued to show him favor through his course of study , and their great kindness was held in grateful remembrance . In the autumn of 1789 he entered Yale College ; but owing to his failure in availing himself of a foundation by which to meet his current expenses , he was obliged to leave at the close of the freshman year and return to his friends . From this time he abandoned the expectation of a regular and liberal course of study , and determined to make the most of such private advantages as might lie within his reach . He returned to his old friend , Dr. Burnett , of Norwalk , to enjoy again his excellent instructions , together with the kind hospitalities and aid of the female relatives to whom we have alluded . While here , his studies were again interrupted by the invasion of dangerous and protracted sickness . He was carried to New Canaan , where for the space of several weeks his extreme weakness forbade articulation , and he seemed one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this illness as peculiarly profitable to his spiritual interests , and his restoration to health as one of the most striking interpositions of a gracious Providence connected with his whole life . In alluding to his recovery , he often spoke of the affectionate care of a sister next younger than himself , whom he regarded as the chief instrument , under God , of preventing his going down to the grave . This sister watched by his bedside , anticipated his wants , administered medicine , and , like Miriam , the sister of the infant Moses , waited anxiously " to wit what would /z/ be done to " her brother . As his case became more hopeful , and his strength would permit , she bore him in her arms , or placing him in an easy chair drew him both in doors and in the open air , or indulged him in the grateful exercise of the family swing , as though he were but a child , and as if her own life w r ere bound up in his . Faithful sister ! surely thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient toil . After the lapse of several months his health was restored , and he returned to Norwalk and engaged in study . In 1791 he went to Farmington and spent a few months in teaching , and also availed himself of such opportunity to pursue his studies as was consistent with other duties . From this place he went to Greenfield , where he availed himself of the tuition of Dr. D wight , until he applied for license to preach the Gospel . It may be proper to remark in this place , that though the subject of this sketch must have suffered loss in many respects by his interruption in a college course of study , still , to the honor of his teachers , it ought to be said that no advantages , except those of a well-regulated college , could have surpassed those which were furnished under their instruction . Their grateful pupil often spoke with much interest of the great excellence of Dr. Burnett as a teacher ; and it is well known that the school on " Greenfield Hill , " under Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor did young Richards fail to make the most faithful use of the means of knowledge thus furnished . He studied with great diligence , and his attainments are sufficiently shown by the fact that in 1794 , at the instance of Dr. Dwight , he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the corporation of Yale College . /z/ IN 1793 he made application to the Association in the Western District of Fairfield Co. , and was licensed by a Committee of that body to preach the Gospel . The Rev. Dr. Burnett , of Norwalk , with whom he had studied , claimed for his own pulpit the first sermon of his young friend and pupil , and compliance with the claim was yielded " in weakness and in fear , and in much trembling " on the part of Mr. Richards . He supplied , for a few sabbaths , the church in Wilton , a neighboring town , and then went to Ballston , New York , and preached on a short engagement . The following covenant and resolutions are found among his papers , dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do now , in the presence of God and his holy angels , solemnly avouch the Lord Jehovah , Father , Son and Holy Ghost , to be my God , and promise , by the help of his Holy Spirit , without which I can do nothing , to devote myself to him in an everlasting covenant , never to be forgotten . As the chief of sinners , I resolve to look up to God for pardon and acceptance , through the blood of his dear Son , and to rest my soul on the gracious promises of the Gospel ; determining to renounce sin in all its appearances , I resolve to consecrate my time , talents , and all that I have on earth , to the service of God , promising to make his glory the ultimate end of all my actions . It is my resolution to be more watchful and prayerful than I have hitherto been ; to see that my thoughts are employed on proper subjects , and in their proper times ; to guard against all rash and heedless words , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men ; taking heed to the door of my lips , that I offend not with my tongue . /z/ " I resolve that I will not suffer my passions to take the place of my reason , but will subject them to the laws of God and religion . Never to be @#@ angry without a cause , ' nor to indulge that kind of anger which is incompatible with disinterested love to my neighbor . I resolve , moreover , to be faithful in all the relative duties incumbent on me , and particularly in the discharge of the duties a Gospel minister preaching the Word of God in all its purity and extent , and serving the Lord with all humility and patience , that by meekness , gentleness , and love unfeigned , I may win others to the Gospel of Christ . cc Remember , O my Soul , these resolutions and the vows of God which are upon thee . Thou canst not violate them without incurring the displeasure of the best of beings , the best of fathers , and the most faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . Strengthen me , Lord , I beseech thee , and confirm the resolution of thy servant . Keep me by thy mighty power from sinning against thee , and preserve me spotless unto thy heavenly kingdom . Amen . " Soon after the date of the foregoing resolutions , Mr. Richards went to Long Island , and entered into an engagement to preach to two small congregations ; one at Sag Harbor and the other at Shelter Island . The following grateful tribute to his memory as a minister at Sag Harbor , is found in " The History of Long Island , " by the Rev. N. S. Prime : " The late Rev. James Richards , D. D. a name loved and revered throughout the Church made some of his first essays in this place to preach the Gospel . And though he was here but a short time , his labors of love were highly appreciated by a pious few ; the most of whom have already hailed him as the helper of their faith , and are now rejoicing with him in a brighter world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her rest , whom the writer has often heard speak of the satisfaction and benefit which she derived from the labors of that youthful servant of Christ , not only in the pulpit , but at the domestic fireside ; and the name of ' Richards ' was music in her ears to her dying day . " BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH . ig In May , 1794 , he was invited to visit the church and congregation in Morristown , N. J. , as a candidate for the pastoral office ; which invitation he accepted , and agreed to visit that people at the expiration of his existing engagements . This arrangement was made under the advice of Dr. Buel , of East Hampton , and his son-in-law the Rev. Aaron Woolworth , of Bridgehampton . Dr. Buel had long been acquainted with the character of the congregation now vacant , and his own mind and that of his son-in-law were favorably impressed as to the ministerial character and promise of Mr. Richards . In a letter written to Rev. Dr. Johnes , the old friend and pastor of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's settlement was pending , Dr. Buel uses the following language : " The man who , on a thorough acquaintance with James Richards , does not love him , can not himself be deserving the love of any man . " He entered upon his labors in Morristown in the month of June , 1794 ; and in September following received a call to take the pastoral charge of the congregation . In November of this year he was married to Caroline , daughter of James Cowles , of Farmington , Connecticut . His ordination to the work of the Gospel ministry , and the consummation of his pastoral relations took place on the 1st of May , 1797 , " at a stated meeting of what was then called the Presbytery of New York . " The charge now committed to the hands of Mr. Richards , was one of great responsibility . The congregation was large , comprising much intelligence , and withal afflicted with divisions of sentiment and feeling , which had grown out of their relations to a former minister who was a colleague of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new pastor , together with the character and influence of his ministry in Morristown we /z/ may refer the reader to the following extracts . In a letter to Lewis Condit , Esq. , in which he alludes to the state of things when he took the pastoral charge of the people of Morristown , he says : " Nov. 26 , 1840 . They your fathers differed greatly in opinion , and for a time were strongly opposed to each other in feeling , but they judged it best not to divide but to make sacrifices , and endeavor to harmonize . Their endeavors were successful they were harmonized peace and brotherly love became the order of the day ; and , with some slight exceptions , have marked the course of things in the congregation for almost half a century . " The following extract from a letter to his youngest son now in the ministry , shows the extent of the field which he occupied , and the amount and kind of labors demanded and bestowed . " In this great congregation I had the sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering to look after , the captious and uneasy to soothe , besides schools to catechise and lectures to preach and prayer-meetings to attend ; altogether creating a vast amount of labor , independent of regular family visitations and preparing for the pulpit . Not a little time was consumed in occasional calls upon my people and their calls upon me . The result of all this was , I was like a man in harvest always pressed with engagements , and with more than I could fairly meet . It became necessary , therefore , to make a selection among the calls of duty , and attend to those first which were of the most urgent character , leaving others to the dubiousness of an hereafter . ***** I endeavored to derive advantage from the various occurrences of Divine Providence ; from the teachings of God 's Word , and from my constant intercourse with the most spiritual and devoted among my people . This last circumstance was not only a matter of special comfort , but of profit to my soul . I felt myself instructed and invigorated often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of experimental religion . " The following is from the pen of Lewis Condit , Esq. , to whom we have before alluded : /z/ " May , 1845 . The general character of Mr. Richard 's ministry was consistent , uniform , and worthy of imitation . He seemed to live , and at all times to act , as under the impression that his great and leading duty was to preach the Gospel of Christ to instruct his people faithfully in its essential doctrines and truths , and persuade them to obey its precepts and imitate the life of its Divine Author . * * As a teacher and a pastor , he enjoyed the entire confidence , respect , and affection of his whole flock . " While thus living in the hearts of his people he also increased in the confidence and esteem of the Christian public . He was favorably known , both in the halls of Science , and in the judicatories of the Church of God . In the year 1801 he received the degree of Master of Arts from the corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1805 he was duly elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church a position , we believe , rarely occupied by a man of thirty-seven . To these distinctions were also added others others of more worth to the heart of a Christian pastor . Within two years from his installation , God poured out his Spirit , and more than one hundred souls bowed professedly to Jesus , and united with the Church . A second revival in 1803 and 1804 , and a third in 1808 , crowned his labors also with the increase that cometh from God . The character and influence of these seasons of religious interest may be best learned from a letter written by the subject of this sketch to the Rev. Albert Barnes , and dated January 9th , 1828 . " During my ministry at Morristown , there were three seasons of special attention to religion , the first and last of which were the most considerable . The first was remarkable , chiefly , from this circumstance , that it came upon the congregation by surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , were specially stirred up to desire or expect it . Of course , the Church appeared full of unbelief , when it was announced that the /z/ Lord was in the midst of us , of a truth . Even those who , from their exemplary character , might have been expected to be waiting for the consolation of Israel , were manifestly unprepared for this sovereign act of Divine mercy . But , prepared or unprepared , the windows of heaven were opened , and the spiritual rain descended , and about one hundred souls were hopefully brought into the kingdom , as the fruit and effect of this refreshing . They did not all join the church at once , but principally in the course of that and the following year . " The second revival , in 1803 , was much more local in its operations , and by no means characterized with the same power . It excited considerable attention in the congregation , and served to draw forth the prayers and exertions of Christians ; but still it was confined chiefly to one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting seasons , I always regarded as the most precious ; not because it seemed to take a wider sweep , but because , as far as it went , it appeared to be more deep and effective , and exerted a more benign influence on the church . This revival was evidently preceded by a spirit of prayer . To my latest breath , I shall remember how some of the dear people of God appeared to feel and agonize , in their supplications before the Lord , when imploring his gracious presence in the midst of us . Through the whole of the preceding winter , there had been some feeling and some expectancy in the church on this subject , occasioned , perhaps , by the revivals which had occurred , and were then occurring , in some of the neighboring congregations . But the church seemed to calculate that this good work would go from congregation to congregation , as a matter of course . When , however , they saw that the cloud of God 's presence had come to our very borders , on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tremble , to feel their dependence , and to cry mightily unto God , that he would not utterly refuse to bless us . The blessing came , and sealed , not a few , I trust , unto the day of redemption . Between seventy and eighty were added to the church , in that and the subsequent year , who ' dated their conversion from this interesting period . I will only add , that on inquiring of my brethren who succeeded me in this charge , I was uniformly told that the members gathered during this revival , had been peculiarly circumspect , and very few of them subjected to any church censure . " As to means employed , either in the commencement or progress of these revivals , I can say nothing ; except that the Gospel /z/ was preached as plainly and faithfully as I was able , and that publicly , and from house to house . Prayer-meetings , anxiousmeetings , or conferences , were found to be of special service in promoting the good work . " In 1809 , Mr. Richards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newark , to become their pastor . The causes which led to the dissolution of the connection between him and the congregation at Morristown , were briefly these : For several years his salary had been inadequate to the support of his family , and he had been obliged to resort to other means to meet his current expenses . Among other expedients , he had kept several boarders an expedient which , while it answered the end designed , increased the domestic cares of the pastor , whose official responsibilities were well-nigh overwhelming . The evil was perceived , and deeply felt . Both Mr. Richards and his more intimate friends , became satisfied that such a state of things ought not to be continued . Hence it was judged best that the salary should be so increased as to sustain the pastor , independent of profits arising from a boarding establishment . A meeting was accordingly called , at which statements were made to the congregation , setting forth the revenues and expenditures of the pastor , and the urgent necessity of his receiving an increased compensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement . Some were slow to see the necessity of an increase of salary , and opposed the effort ; others were wavering ; the friends of the measure , though many , were at first timid , and " touched the matter with great delicacy ; " and nothing was effectually done . One or two other meetings , called for the purpose of considering the question of augmenting the salary , came substantially to the same result . This state of things in the congregation , deeply affected the deli- /z/ cate sensibilities of Mr. Richards . He thus alludes to it in a letter , written afterwards to his son : " When in the summer and fall of 1808 , ( the year before I went to Newark , ) my people refused to unite in an augmentation of my salary , though many were earnestly for it , I found it grieved me , and many things connected with it mortified me and agitated me . I presently discovered that I was getting into a state of mind by no means favorable to my comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the subject , and especially upon the dark side of the picture , I resolved to give myself anew to the duties of my ministry , to serve God , and his people given ' me in charge , with all the strength I had , and to do whatever seemed proper and meet to be done , as if no untoward event had occurred . " And let me say , I found great comfort in this . Though my resolution was to discharge my duty , and leave the event with God , yet I did not infer that I was not at liberty to watch the movings of Providence , and avail myself of any opportunity which should present , to change my relations , provided such change appeared to be accompanied with the indications of duty . " In the mean time an effectual door of usefulness was opening in Newark . Dr. Griffin , the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in that city , had been invited to a professorship in the Theological Seminary at Andover , and , as was supposed , strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A correspondence commenced , in which the most earnest appeals were made in behalf of the Newark congregation . To the already afflicted pastor , these appeals were occasion of new trials . Though he had supposed it right to watch the movements of Providence , and thought it possible that he might be called to yield his present relations , yet he dreaded the coming of the day when they should be sundered . His present pastoral charge was the object of his " first love . " He knew his flock . The sheep and the lambs he could call by their respective names . They also knew his voice , and had been wont to follow /z/ him . And a people , who had called him as their spiritual watchman in his youth who had laid aside their animosities to sustain him who had taught their children to reverence him as a father , might well urge a strong claim to the services of his riper years . Nor was there any attachment on the part of the people , which was not reciprocated by the pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already alluded to , and written but a short time before his death , he says : " Never was a minister more happy with his people than I with mine , during the fifteen years I spent among you . With you I was willing to live , and with you I expected to die . " To the same , in another letter , he writes : /z/ " I can truly say , that if there be a spot on earth to which my mind turns with more than ordinary affection , it is THAT where I was ordained to the work of the Gospel ministry , and took upon myself the obligation of the Christian pastor . I loved the people that called me to this work , and I trust I loved the work itself . " The reasons for a change , however , seemed more and more urgent . The increase of the salary was postponed ; the health of Mrs. Richards had declined ; his rising family were increasingly expensive ; and he began to entertain the impression that the promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal to raise the salary had created . These considerations inclined him to give some encouragement to the congregation in Newark ; and he intimated that should they extend to him a unanimous call , it would receive a careful consideration , and that he should " acquiesce in what seemed to be the leadings of God 's providence . " Such a call soon came into his hands . In anticipation of it , his congregation had succeeded in voting an increase of salary ; and prior to thei /z/ knowledge of his acceptance , they set forth their views and feelings in two formal memorials addressed to their pastor . One of these was sent from a meeting of seventyone ladies , and presented by the hands of a committee whose names are appended to the address . It is a document which reflects honor both upon the pastor , and upon those who sent it . It reads as follows : /z/ " Having lately been informed that you contemplate a removal from the pastoral charge of this congregation , we , the subscribers , in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ourselves constrained to express to you , in some degree , the deep regret and anxiety we experience on the occasion , in common with all classes and descriptions of persons composing this numerous society . The attachment we feel for you and your amiable family is not founded in the transient acquaintance of a day or a month . A period of fourteen years and upwards , spent in the most friendly interchange of kind offices , has gradually ripened and matured that acquaintance into a permanent and refined friendship . As the faithful shepherd and pastor of our flock , words fail us to express our veneration and esteem for you . Many of us have grown from infancy and youth into active life during your ministry here , and through the instrumentality of your public instructions , friendly admonitions and exemplary life , have been enabled , through Divine aid , to partake of the rich blessings of that Gospel which you have so faithfully preached . * * * Others of us have , at the same time , been declining the steep of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our attachments formed in youth have been rent in sunder . You have personally witnessed , in many instances , the parting scene . You have accompanied us who are widows and mothers to the grave of many a beloved husband and child . You have mingled your tears with ours , and , in the keenest moments of anguish and heart-rending grief , you have administered to us the only consolation promised in the Gospel by the widow 's God . " You settled among us in the work of the ministry while we were a divided people . Happily for us these divisions no longer exist , and our attachment to you is probably much strengthened , considering you as the means of restoring harmony among us . You /z/ yourself were in the morning of life , the season , of all others , the best adapted for forming lasting attachments . Is it to be expected that a change of circumstances , in the afternoon of life , can add much to the share of happiness which is perhaps already as considerable as usually falls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after due consideration of the solemn ties that bind you to this church , a removal may appear to you a duty , and you consider it as a mean of enlarging your own sphere of comfort and enjoyment , perhaps we ought to acquiesce in the separation , however painful it may be . a Whether you leave us or remain with us , you may rest assured of our prayers for a blessing on your labors , and our best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of yourself and family . " But these remonstrances , and the announcement of the vote to increase the salary of the pastor , came too late . The encouragement which had been given to another congregation , had been answered in a unanimous call . The conditions which he had suggested had been met , and painful as was the thought of parting , he was not the man to say and not do . The foregoing is a brief outline of the circumstances under which the question of dissolving the pastoral relation came before the Presbytery of Jersey . The congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to submit the whole question to that body . When the Presbytery met at Elizabethtown , April 26 , 1809 , a member , then residing at Morristown , after an able and full exposition of the causes which had induced the pastor to ask leave to resign his pastoral charge , and an entire justification of the request , concluded in the following words : " As an inhabitant of Morristown , no one has more serious reasons to regret the removal of Mr. Richards , than myself : Yet his removal , I regard rather as the misfortune than the fault of Morristown ; and his removal to Newark as an event brought about rather by the providence of God , than by the destination of man . I shall , therefore , move that the call from the people of Newark be put into his hands . " /z/ His call to Newark was received in April , 1809 , and he removed his family to that place on the 17th of May following . On the 28th of the same month , Dr. Griffin preached his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pastoral charge were left with his successor . A more weighty charge or more delicate position could hardly be assumed . Dr. Griffin was then regarded as one of the most gifted and eloquent ministers in the American Church , and Newark had been favored with nearly eight years of the most vigorous and efficient portion of his pastoral life . His labors , too , had been crowned with signal success , the church having increased from two to five hundred members during his ministry . It is worthy also of notice , that he left at the close of a revival , to which , in a letter written to Mr. Richards , he thus alludes : " I was there in the harvest time , but you came in the fall of the year ; " intimating the disadvantage under which his successor entered upon his pastoral charge . Mr. Richards felt the responsibility of his position , and resolved , under God , to make full proof of his ministry . He said to a friend , " I am resolved to ' give attendance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did study , and he also " gave himself to prayer . " His purpose to magnify his office , appeared in the pulpit and in the walks of pastoral intercourse ; and the attachment of the /z/ people grew with his growth , and strengthened with his strength . In 1811 the congregation under his care judged it expedient to become " two bands ; " and , accordingly , an organization was effected under the name of the " Second Presbyterian Church and Congregation of Newark , " and the Rev. Hooper Cumming was constituted the first pastor . This whole matter received both the approbation and aid of Mr. Richards ; and his kind regard for the spiritual well-being of the new church may be learned from the following introduction of an address delivered by him at the time of its organization : " The circumstances , my brethren , in which you are assembled this afternoon , are in several respects novel and interesting . After having peaceably withdrawn from your former connections , and being set apart as a distinct congregation after erecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his service after calling and settling a minister , who is to go in and out before you and break unto you the bread of life you are come together to complete your religious privileges . Those of you who have heretofore been professors of religion are to organize yourselves as a church of Christ , by giving yourselves to one another and to the Lord . Here you are to recognize each other as the friends of Jesus purchased by his blood and sanctified by his Spirit the joint heirs with him to an eternal inheritance . How tender , how solemn , how important is the relation ! By virtue of it you expect often to commune with each other at the table of the Lord ; and , if you are not deceived in your hopes , to spend an eternity together in his kingdom . Formerly , indeed , you were the constituent members of the same church , but your circle being wider , you were less known to each other than you will hereafter be . You must now take upon you those cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much larger number . From being a part only of a particular church , you will now become a distinct church yourselves , and stand in the number of those golden candlesticks among whom the Divine Redeemer graciously condescends to walk . What occasion will you have to rejoice , if he will condescend to visit you if he will crown with his special presence and blessing /z/ the transactions of this afternoon , and henceforth dwell in your hearts by love . Many important subjects of reflection will naturally present themselves to your minds on this occasion , but I can think of none which more deservedly merits your attention , than these words : " Let brotherly love continue . " Hitherto you have been united in counsel , and united in affection . Let the same spirit continue in you and abound , and you have the promise that the God of love and peace shall be with you . " He farther spoke on this occasion , in a course of extempore remarks , on the subject of brotherly love a subject , the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , that those who had thus gone out from his immediate pastoral care , might become a band " strong in the Lord and by the power of his might . " The subsequent history of this new organization became the occasion of showing , in a strong light , the excellent character and ministerial worth of Mr. Richards . Things which , at first , seemed hazardous to his position and usefulness , operated , in the providence of God , for his advancement . One occurrence , which we may mention , was a call extended to his illustrious predecessor the Rev. Dr. Griffin , to take the pastoral charge of the new congregation , after an absence of only six years . Perhaps in most cases , the return of a former pastor under such circumstances , and especially of the commanding talents and great worth of Dr. Griffin , w r ould be likely to render the position of his successor somewhat unpleasant . The possibility of such an influence was deprecated by some of the people in Newark , and became the subject of frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous to the acceptance of the call . The experiment , however , was made ; and for the space of six years these devoted men labored side by side , with , , perhaps equal honor and usefulness . Each pastor had points in which /z/ he excelled . One , perhaps , in the " gift of tongues " and in " prophecy ; and the other in the " word of wisdom " and " discerning of spirits . " One in the surpassing power of his occasional efforts , and the other in the uniform interest of his ordinary preaching ; the one in success in gathering the lambs into the fold , the other in keeping them when gathered . Both were stars of the first magnitude . One star , it may be , differed from the other star in glory , but so far was the glory of the one from eclipsing or obscuring the glory of the other , that the glory of each was the more glorious by the contiguity of their orbits , and the close comparative estimate to which each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Richards suffers not , where will you look to find " the glory that excelleth . " While at Newark Mr. Richards received new proofs of the confidence of the Christian public . He was early elected Trustee of the College of New Jersey , and held the place until he removed from the State . In 1812 , the year in which the Theological Seminary at Princeton was established , he was appointed a Director of that Institution , and served in that capacity with great acceptance while he remained in Newark . In Sept. 1814 , he preached the annual sermon before the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions . The appointment places his name among the early friends of modern missions ; and the sermon evinces enlarged views and a warm heart in the work of evangelizing the world . In 1815 he received the degree of DOCTOR OF DIVINITY from two Colleges Union and Yale a degree which , at that day , was an index , both of professional and general worth . His name is also found in connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . The American Bible Society , whose leaves , for thirty years , have gone forth for the healing of the nations , owes its existence , in part , to his efforts . For /z/ several years he served as the Secretary of the Presbyterian Education Society , and perhaps no form of pious effort more powerfully excited the sympathies of his heart , or secured his more devoted labors , than the work of training indigent young men for the Gospel ministry . While prosecuting his labors in Newark , Dr. Richards suffered a few of the productions of his pen to be published . An Address delivered at the funeral of Mrs. Sarah Gumming , wife of the Rev. Hooper Gumming , which occurred in 1812 , has been publicly noticed with favor . The occasion was one of deep interest . The death of Mrs C. was occasioned at Patterson , by a fall from the rocks overhanging the Passaic , while she was viewing the scenery of that place . The excitement produced in Newark was unwonted , and the funeral one of the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong sympathies of the preacher 's heart , and his address was worthy of himself and the occasion . In 1816 several of his sermons were given to the press . Among these , the one entitled " The Sinner 's Inability to come to Christ , " may be regarded as a lucid and forcible exhibition of the subject , and , perhaps , this discourse may be considered as a fair specimen of the perspicuity which usually marked his expositions of Gospel truth . As a pastor in Newark , it was the privilege of Dr. Richards to know that his labor was " not in vain in the Lord . " At several distinct periods God was with his people of a truth . About the close of his first pastoral year a few souls were hopefully brought from darkness into light . In the year 1813 , Zion was refreshed and salvation came to the congregation ; and in 1817 the heavens dropped fatness and the skies poured down righteousness upon the people . As the fruits of this revival , 69 were added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , including those who united soon after , 135 within nine months . This was emphatically the year of God 's right hand , in connection with a ministry of fourteen years and a half . During the pastoral services of Dr. Richards , the church received an accession of about five hundred members three hundred and thirty-two were added on the profession of their faith , and six young men , members of the church , were licensed to preach the GospeL It may also be noticed that Dr. Richards , for a considerable time previous to his taking leave of Newark , was regarded as having made extraordinary attainments in Christian theology . Young men looking to the Christian ministry availed themselves of his instructions , and studied under his direction ; and those who knew him best looked to the day when God , in his providence , might point him to the more exclusive work of instructing those who were preparing to preach the Gospel . I conclude this chapter in the words of the present Pastor of the First Presbyterian Congregation in Newark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Richards . " Fifteen years he devoted to the faithful discharge of his duties as a minister of Christ with this people , and probably few men in the ministry ever more punctually , systematically , and successfully performed the duties of the sacred office . * * * " The continued prosperity of this church , the hopeful conversion of hundreds under his ministry , the enlarged benevolence which distinguished the people of his charge , and the harmony that existed through his entire ministry , are the results and evidences of his fidelity among you . " /z/ THE Theological Seminary at Auburn , was established in 1819 , by the Synod of Geneva , and with the sanction of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church . It was incorporated by a law of the State in 1820 . By the Act of Incorporation the Institution was placed under the care of a Board of Trustees and a Board of Commissioners ; the latter to be chosen annually by the Presbyteries recognized in the Act , and by other Presbyteries who might afterward associate with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three professors , and with ten or twelve students . It was a bold effort ; an effort , we doubt not , resulting from that faith which sees " light in the darkness . " Not a professorship was endowed the Library was necessarily indifferent both as to the number and the selection of books ; while the Christian community were but partially awake to the merits or the worth of such an institution . At the end of two years , the number of students had not increased , but rather diminished ; and in no respects , perhaps , were the prospects of the institution materially brightened , except in the advancement of the Seminary edifice . About this time , however , an important impulse was given to this infant school of the prophets . Arthur Tappan , Esq. , of the city of New York , generously devoted the sum of fifteen thousand dollars , as a capital fund , to be used as a permanent endowment of a professorship of /z/ Christian Theology . Never was aid more opportune than this . Hands that hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The name of the author of this relief will long be held in grateful remembrance , as one of the greatest benefactors of the Auburn Seminary . From the first , Dr. Richards was regarded by the friends of the Institution as a suitable and prominent candidate for the Theological Professorship , and accordingly received an appointment in 1820 , which he saw fit to decline . At this time ( 1823 ) he was unanimously re-elected . He accepted the invitation and made immediate preparations to remove to Auburn . The following extracts reveal his feelings on leaving Newark , and going to his new field of labor . From Albany he writes to his daughter : " How good is the Lord ! Mercy , great mercy is mingled with the trial attendant on my removal . Words can not express the tenderness I feel towards you and your dear family , and others left behind . But I dare not allow myself to look back . I trust I have been directed by the ringer of Providence , and I feel encouraged to proceed . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be thankful enough , that through the good hand of the Lord upon us , we have all reached the place of our destination in safety . I need not say , that every effort is making to render our condition as pleasant as the nature of the case will allow . * * The Seminary opens to-day . My inauguration is to take place next Wednesday . May the Lord enable me to meet the occasion with a becoming spirit . " On Wednesday , October 29th , 1823 , just fifty-six years from the day of his birth , he was inaugurated Professor of Christian Theology . His address , delivered on the occasion , was characterized by clear and enlarged views of the importance of a well-trained ministry , and /z/ furnished to a large audience pleasing promise of his usefulness in the responsible place to which he had been called . In entering upon his duties , Dr. Richards aimed , first of all , to meet responsibilities connected with his ow r n particular department ; and , secondly , to labor for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made subordinate mainly to the range of instruction which he was called to impart . He carefully availed himself of everything furnished by the press , which had a particular relation to his official work , or which promised to aid him in the discharge of its duties . We have already intimated that , for two years previous , to his coming , the Seminary had been struggling for life . Much had been done nay , all that could have been expected . The Trustees had put forth vigorous efforts . The citizens of Auburn , especially those whose views led them to sympathize with the religious features of the Seminary , had liberally cherished its infancy . Yet what had been done seemed only to reveal how much needed to be accomplished . No permanent provision had been made to sustain professors , who had hitherto " borne the burden and heat of the day , " and whose unsettled livings required faith in God much like Elijah 's , when he received his food from the ravens . An edifice , containing a main building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exception of one wing , was ready for the reception of students . The Institution was destitute of scholarships or charity foundations ; it could scarcely welcome indigent young men to a shelter , much less to bread or raiment . Such was the state of the Institution at the inauguration of Dr. Richards . Funds were to be raised to complete and furnish the Seminary edifice , to secure an adequate Library , to found Professorships , and to aid such young men as were destitute of means , and yet were /z/ willing to spend and be spent in the office of the Gospel Ministry . To this work the new Professor addressed his welladapted energies . By correspondence , by personal visits , by his influence in conventions and ecclesiastical bodies , he most earnestly commended the Seminary to the attention , the prayers and the charities of the Christian public . The following extract is a specimen of his epistolary efforts in behalf of indigent students , and was written , just after his inauguration , to his eldest daughter : " Five of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have expected from various quarters , I am anxious for the result . I want you to state the fact to our pious and benevolent female friends in N . Fifty dollars would be sufficient to pay the seminary bill of a single student for a year . It would be gratifying to me , and would confer a lasting obligation on the Institution , if a little exertion could be made among you for our relief at the present time . Who would not be willing , in a case so urgent and important , to throw in her mite , and thus bid God speed to a youth who is anxious and trembling lest he should be stopped in his course . " In the course of a few weeks , he alludes to an answer to the foregoing appeal , under the name of " The Newark foundation . " Early in February , he visited Albany and Troy , in behalf of the Institution . From the latter place he writes : " I am trying to do something for the Seminary , and I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get the current into the right channel . My subscription in Troy stands this morning at $312 . I hope to bring it up to four or five hundred . " From Albany he also writes : " I perceive already that I have many prejudices to combat , and the loving-money-principle , the greatest of all obstacles , to over- /z/ come . Nothing but the strongest fortitude , supported by a few of the choicest friends , can avail me now . I believe that I am in a good cause , and that the Lord is on my side . * * * The present efforts , I consider merely in the light of an entering wedge ; but the wedge I shall drive as long as I can perceive that it moves at all . * Time alone , with good management , can induce the Albanians to turn their attention to Auburn . " He returned home , after an absence of about three weeks , having raised in money and subscriptions a little more than twelve hundred dollars , besides receiving a pledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of indigent students in the Seminary . In the following summer he visited Boston in behalf of the child of his adoption . On the 3d of July , he writes to his daughter : " I find nothing can be done here by being in a hurry . The Boston folks are full of notions , and both time and skill are requisite to get the thing by the right handle . " On the 9th , he writes to Mrs. Richards as follows : " Yesterday was the first time I put my hook down , after spending two weeks in baiting and getting ready . Three pretty clever fellows were taken in the course of the day , with one hundred dollars a piece . * * * I know your impatience . * * * But I must do right , and not sacrifice the interests of the Institution to my personal feelings . " During the same visit , he made an appeal in New York City , in behalf of the Seminary . He was encouraged in this effort by a letter written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the following is an extract : " It is a critical moment with your Seminary , and I trust that the good people of New York will feel that it must be supported . I hope your appeal will not be fruitless ; and if my sentiments can be of any avail , you will make just such use of them as you see fit . " /z/ The result of this " appeal " may be learned from the following extract of a letter from Dr. Richards , written a few months after . " The news from New York , in regard to the Seminary , is quite cheering . The $12,000 professorship is made up by seven men of the Brick Church , and the prospects for the Library are flattering . Let God have the glory . " In October , 1825 , he visited Philadelphia as an agent for the Seminary . He writes : " I have thought it probable that I should not receive enough to pay my expenses to and from the place . Last evening I was brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Master 's table : and you may judge of my surprise , when the first two crumbs amounted to twelve hundred dollars . * * * I suppose that my movements here will not be very grateful to some of my brethren , but if my success shall prove considerable , I shall not be greatly moved at the trouble which I occasion . " Again , four days after , he writes : a My subscription stands here at eighteen hundred and ninety dollars . * * * We have here a few tried friends , but the greater part neither know us , or care any more for us , than if we lived in Kamschatka . In time to come , however , some will doubtless remember us ; and pains must be taken to circulate among the good people of this city a knowledge of our Institution . " The Board of Trustees speak of this visit to Philadelphia as follows : a His particular object was the establishment of a fund for the Professorship of Biblical Criticism . During his journey , he procured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $2,850 , and the donation of two hundred and twenty-five acres of land , from which will probably be realized at least four hundred dollars . Early in the following spring he visited Geneva , Canandaigua , Geneseo , and other towns in Western New /z/ York , everywhere making a favorable impression in behalf of the young " school of the prophets/ 5 and urging its claims to the attention and charities of the churches . In September , 1826 , or during the vacation of the Seminary , he traveled east , associating his relaxation from the duties of a Professor with the labors of a Soliciting Agent . He first visited his former congregation in Newark , and , in connection with his friendly calls upon the people , presented the claims of the Seminary , signifying that donations in aid of that infant institution would be received as the most grateful tokens which the donors could render of esteem and love for their former pastor . These kind solicitations , during this visit , resulted in a subscription of nearly a thousand dollars . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both on sea and land ; and on the boat which carried him to New Haven , to attend the commencement of Yale College , he secured from one individual a pledge of five hundred dollars . In allusion to this individual he WTites , " How kindly did the Lord bring him in my way , and how favorably did he dispose his heart ! " The foregoing notices are submitted to the reader , in connection , to serve not only as indications of the general care which Dr. Richards exercised over the Seminary , but also of his readiness to " endure hardness " and toil to give it character , and influence , and permanency . It may be observed that several journeyings of this kind were performed during a recess or vacation , and thus his days of rest were used in the prosecution of the most arduous labors ; while some of them were performed in the depth of winter , or early in the spring , thus subjecting his health to serious exposure and detriment . Besides , an absence from the bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home " seems indispensable to render /z/ one 's condition tolerable , is an item not to be overlooked in estimating the self-sacrificing character of these services . The following extract from a letter written to Mrs. Richards , during the absence last noticed , will show both the self-denial and the object of this kind of labor : " I know your privations occasioned by my absence ; but , believe it , they are not greater on your part than on mine . The longer I live , the more your society and home are necessary to my happiness . * * * It is nothing but a sense of duty that can keep me away from home . But the Seminary must live and prosper , or neither you nor I can be happy . Yet there is a higher motive to direct us the cause of truth and righteousness in the earth . The Auburn institution is destined , I trust , to be an efficient school of the prophets . It will live and be blessed , I have no doubt , generations after we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the momentum which is given to it in its infancy . " The years 1826 , ' 27 were fraught with trials to the church in which Dr. Richards , both from his experience and position , would be expected strongly to sympathize . They were years of much religious excitement . This excitement had an intimate connection with the labors of Rev. Charles G. Finney as principal , and with the labors of subordinates , both ministers and laymen . The subordinates , in many things , were more extravagant than the principal ; and their numbers were considerable throughout Central and Western New York . It was thought by many that some of the measures which were adopted by these evangelists , though they " zealously affected " men , did not affect them " well . " Anxious seats were extensively used ; females , in many instances , were encouraged to speak and pray in promiscuous assemblies ; individuals were often prayed for in the churches , either by name , or in some other way by which they were made known to the congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement , was strikingly conformed to other measures which were used . The truth , though in many instances preached with fidelity , nevertheless was presented with a severity of tone and manner which strongly excited the passions of the hearers , and thus prevented its access to the conscience and the heart . And the praying , in many instances , was scarcely less severe than the preaching . Some , indeed , seemed to regard its efficacy as depending much upon the strong and denunciatory language and epithets under which sinners were commended to the mercy of God . This feature in prayer was particularly developed when men high in official station were made the subjects of its supplications . The reason for this which seemed to obtain was , that the position of such men gave them an influence which , if they did not approve the measures , and encourage them , would prove specially disastrous , and contribute to shut up the kingdom of heaven against men . Thus , when pastors of churches , presidents of colleges and professors in theological seminaries were reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some instances , to abusive and slanderous epithets in the form of prayer . They were presented before the throne of mercy as " dead , " as " unconverted , " as " opposers of revivals of religion , " as " keeping sinners out of heaven , " and " encouraging them in their way to perdition . " The venerable President of Hamilton College is said to have been prayed for as an " old gray - headed sinner , leading souls down to hell ; and the writer distinctly recollects a prayermeeting within sight of that college , in which the plea was urged with great fervor , that God would raze the walls of its buildings , if necessary to bring the President and some of his associates to give countenance to the existing state of things ! The coming of Mr. Finney to Auburn , as an evange- /z/ list , subjected Dr. Richards to the same treatment which men of similar views had received in other places . He and some of his associates in the Faculty of the Seminary were not prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more excellent way " in promoting the work of God . His cautious feet , therefore , avoided the way which his judgment could not approve . Such a position , taken by a prominent professor in a Theological Seminary , excited considerable attention , and exposed him to the animadversion of those who approved of the existing state of things . He was regarded as standing in the way of the work of the Lord . He was subjected to much unkind remark , and his position is said to have been especially recognized in prayer , in some of the pulpits within sight of the Seminary . It was deemed a strange thing that the Professor would not " break down " in such circumstances , and unite his energies and influence with those of the young evangelist . But Dr. Richards was not a man to " break down , " or even bend , in violation of his own moral sense , and in utter disregard of the solemn and abundant teachings of his own experience . He was not a stranger in Jerusalem , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The extravagances of Davenport and his coadjutors had taken place but a quarter of a century before his birth , and he had learned them from the lips of his parents . At the time of his own conversion , the church had not recovered from their disastrous influence , and his own spiritual infancy had been subjected to severe trials from the very prejudice against religion which these excesses had created . His own experience also , as a pastor , was abund. ant , for he had served the church thirty years in this relation . The fields of his labors had enjoyed " refreshings from the presence of the Lord , " and he had learned that discrimination , tenderness and meekness , as well as boldness and zeal , w r ere indispensable in such seasons . /z/ He was therefore jealous of the existing movements . While he did not doubt that some good would be done , he deprecated the evils which his knowledge led him to anticipate . He trembled lest , while some should be converted , others , whose souls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven to " a returnless distance " from the Gospel . He anticipated , also , that these things would engender strife in the church , rather than contribute to the " unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace " nay , that , on the whole , more would be lost to religion and to Zion than would be gained . He was constrained , therefore , as an honest man , to abstain from these measures . And the position seemed , in the circumstances , as hazardous as it was independent . The Seminary was in its infancy , and not prepared for the shock of revolution , and yet here was an honest difference of views in the house of its friends , on important matters and in scenes of great interest and excitement . The congregation in which Mr. Finney was preaching had nobly contributed to give birth to the Seminary , and to cherish its infancy . The pastor of the congregation was " one of the prime and most efficient agents in measures which had led to its establishment , " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just resigned his professorship and retired with the blessing of the Institution upon his head . Also the students of the Seminary , to a considerable extent young men of the first promise as to talents and piety were led to wonder that their venerated Professor should not yield to the voice of his friends , and to , what seemed to them , the voice of duty Rarely is one 's position more trying than was that of Dr. Richards at this time . Had he yielded , he could certainly have urged very plausible , and what , to some minds , would have been regarded as the most satisfactory and important reasons , for so doing . He could have urged the wishes of his friends , who loved /z/ Christ and his cause the danger of seeming to oppose the work of God the importance of union of action between himself and many who endeavored , at least , to bear with objectionable measures , in the hope that much good would be done . Nay , he could have said that he had acted advisedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends that his influence , if given to the work , would strongly operate as a check upon any excesses which might exist . But Dr. Richards was immovable . He could not yield contrary to his convictions of duty . And it is believed , that when the excitement had subsided , the honor awarded to his firmness and judgment was equal to the reproach to which he had been subjected . Many , it is believed , who then honestly differed from him , have since been ready to bless him for Zion 's sake , for the position which he maintained . The Christian community , also , reposed in him augmented confidence from that day , and the impression extensively obtained , that he who could preside so safely over a Theological Seminary " in the palmy days of Evangelism , " might be safely trusted , under God , in any emergency which such an institution might be called to experience . The labors of Dr. Richards as a soliciting agent , though already continued much longer than he had intended , were not entirely laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , 1827 , he visited Rochester , and received several hundred dollars , in aid chiefly of the contingent fund of the Institution . Subsequent to this date , however , he went abroad in person much less than formerly , though his appeals to the benevolent , by letter , continued to the close of his life . In the winter of 1827-28 his health seriously declined . His disease was a species of jaundice , which interrupted his labors as a professor , and , at times , compelled him wholly to suspend them . The writer , then /z/ a member of the Institution , is able to testify that the suspension , however , was much less than the case seemed to demand . Often did he meet this venerable teacher in the lecture-room , when the retirement of his chamber and his bed seemed more fitting the state of his health . Of this illness , he writes to his eldest daughter in the spring of 1828 , as follows : " I have suffered more this winter from indisposition , than from any former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life 's brief journey , with all its changes , its joys and its sorrows , will soon close . Too apt are we to forget how rapidly time hastens ? and what amazing interests hang on it . " About two months after he writes again : " What the Lord intends to do with me he wisely and kindly conceals in his own bosom . Perhaps he intends the restoration of my health and usefulness perhaps he is about to bring all my earthly concerns to a close . I desire to leave the whole matter with him , and to rest contented with his sovereign will . " But while he thus submitted his case to the " sovereign will of God , " he did not omit the use of such means as promised to restore his health . He remitted his ordinary studies journeyed as he was able purchased a horse and carriage as a means of frequent exercise in riding visited mineral springs and even read books to learn both the nature of his disease and its appropriate remedies . The following letter to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lately been attending to chemistry myself , that I might form something of a judgment as to the nature of various chemical preparations which my physicians have prescribed . I perceive that in some cases they have been manifestly counterworking themselves . I have read some of the most celebrated medical works on the nature and treatment of the jaundice , and other biliary affections a poor business , the doctors will say , for a sick man and I do not think it time misspent . Somebody must decide when the /z/ doctors disagree . I greatly respect the profession , and I do not mean to assume to myself any claim to judge for other people , nor even in my own case without the aid of professional advisers . But I do not intend to descend into the ditch blindfold , and without the least inquiry ; but among all the guessing and conjecturing , guess a little myself . One of my conjectures is , that I have taken too much medicine by half , and sometimes that which is injurious . " In the Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which at first seemed to threaten a fatal termination . He was assisting his servant in harnessing the animal , when it suddenly started , and throwing him down , planted both hind feet upon his chest , in the region of the stomach . In allusion to this event he writes as follows : a I was enabled to rise and walk , but with such fainting and trembling as I apprehended would be attended with immediate dissolution . * * How true it is , that in the midst of life we are in death ; and that when our hopes are most buoyant with respect to our usefulness and comfort , we may be on the eve of closing our pilgrimage altogether . " In connection with his other infirmities , he was visited about this time with a cancerous affection in his nose , whose removal somewhat disfigured his noble and manly countenance . He speaks of it as follows : a The cancerous disorder in my nose is entirely healed , but will leave , I think , a depression which , if I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this is a small matter , when weighed against many other evils , to which both body and soul stand exposed . * * It is good to have the sentence of death in ourselves . * * It weans us from the world ; it carries our thoughts to another and better state of being . " The illness of Dr. Richards , extending over a space of nearly two years , proved a serious embarrassment to the Seminary . When it commenced there were 76 students the largest number furnished to the Institution at one /z/ time since its commencement . But from this year a decline began . Some , who were on the ground , left for other Seminaries ; and others , who had intended to pursue their theological course at Auburn , were prevented . The knowledge of Dr. Richard 's illness was propagated , not only through his own State , but through New England furnishing an argument to those who desired to turn the attention of young men to other institutions . To the decline thus begun , several other adverse influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been a liberal feeder to the Seminary , but which , just at this time , was sending from its walls few , if any , candidates for the Gospel ministry . Another , perhaps , was the establishment of a Theological Seminary in New Haven , Ct. , to which many young men were attracted , both by the high literary character of the place , and also by the announcement that " some important discoveries in theology had there been made . " About the beginning of 1830 , Dr. Richards ' health had become essentially improved , and he applied himself to his duties with renewed courage and energy . He writes at this time : " It is difficult for you , or any one not acquainted with the internal concerns of such an institution , readily to perceive the amount of labor demanded of an instructor . The mere correspondence connected with the institution , the chief of which falls on my shoulders , is not a trifling- operation . But , thanks to a gracious Providence , my health has been wonderfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richards was ever ready to shoulder responsibility , in an emergency . This feature of his character made him a most efficient helper of those who had the oversight of the finances of the Institution , and greatly encouraged them in their efforts , especially in seasons of embarrassment and trial . An instance occurred like /z/ this . The heart of one of the Trustees , at a certain time , fainted within him , in view of the difficulties which beset the Seminary . He was freely indulging in his gloomy forebodings , when it w r as announced that , in view of the state of things , Dr. Richards would leave home the next morning , with the design of seeking aid for the Institution . His desponding spirit was immediately relieved , and he exclaimed , THEN THE SEMINARY WILL GO ! /z/ In the year 1830 , the Treasurer of the Board of Trustees reported that the Seminary was in debt ten thousand dollars , and that this debt was increasing from six to eight hundred dollars annually . In this state of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their salaries , annually , until such time as the Trustees should be able to pay the stipulated sums , provided that the Boards of Trustees and Commissioners should , within one year , raise the sum of twelve thousand dollars , to be employed for the use of the Seminary , and to meet its existing engagements . The year closed , and but seven thousand dollars had been secured . The Professors generously extended the probation from August to January . In the mean time , Dr. Richards took his pen . He prepared a brief narrative of the rise and progress of the Institution , setting forth its embarrassments and successes , its prospects and claims , connected with an offer of a liberal personal contribution , and a pungent appeal to all whom it might concern . On the 30th of January 1832 , he alludes to the effort of the Trustees , in a letter as follows : " Our enterprise of raising $12,000 for the Seminary before the 18th of this month has succeeded ; at . which , you may well believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of care and responsibility . " /z/ The anxieties and labors of Dr. Richards , which had looked to the general welfare of the Seminary , and which , for the space of twelve years , had been exceedingly burdensome , were somewhat relieved in 1835 , by the accession of Rev. S. H. Cox , D.D. , to the Professorship of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology . He entered upon his duties in the fullness of his strength . Besides performing the appropriate services of his own department , he instructed , for a time , in Ecclesiastical Literature , and performed much labor for the Seminary in the form of raising funds . His coming was opportune , both on account of the " often infirmities " of Dr. Richards , and the decease of Dr. Perrine , which occurred during the following winter . He " who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb , " being about to remove one public servant to his final rest , graciously introduced another , whose versatility of talent and form of services , seemed particularly adapted to the emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute passed by the Board of Commissioners , on the decease of Dr. Perrine : " But while we mourn our loss , in that he has been called to his reward , we would render unfeigned thanks that he was permitted so long and so ably to employ the powers of his discriminatingmind , and the sympathies of his warm heart , in the service of this beloved institution . " The years of 1837 and ' 38 are never to be forgotten in the Presbyterian Church . The act of the General Assembly , in its summary excision of four Synods , was matter of extreme pain and mortification to thousands of the best men in the church , and to none more than to Dr. Richards . He lived in the heart of one , and in the immediate neighborhood of two more , of the Synods thus cut off . His position furnished him means of knowing their character both as to doctrine and practice . He /z/ was engaged in teaching Theology , in a Seminary specially fostered by these Synods ; and if views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially different from those taught in its own Seminary , he must have known it . Yet he was able to see no adequate cause for the amputation which took place . Though he had taken occasion to resist some " new measures/ ' which at different times , and in different places had received some favor ; and also some innovations in doctrine , which , originating in other fields , had been brought into Western New York ; yet he firmly believed that the church and ministry connected with these Synods , as a whole , deserved a place among the first in the order and faith of the Presbyterian name . And though he regretted to be separated from the ecclesiastical recognition of brethren , to whom his soul had been knit through all his Christian and ministerial history , yet ( to use the language of Dr. Cox , one of his colleagues ) he preferred to be of the EXSCINDED rather than of the EXSCINDING . The proceedings of the General Assembly in this matter turned all eyes to Dr. Richards . Some who had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims , seemed to expect that he would approve their views and proceedings . On the other hand , the severed and bleeding Synods relied with the confidence of children upon his sympathy and counsel in the day of trouble . His brethren at the East who regretted the exscinding act , and deprecated a schism in the Presbyterian Church , wrote to him as to a father , asking his counsel and bespeaking his attendance at Philadelphia in the spring of 1838 , that the Assembly might have the benefit of his counsels . Others wrote to him , anxiously inquiring after the real character of the exscinded Synods for Christian faith and practice . The following letter , written to his daughter , who had /z/ expressed some anxiety in regard to his appointment as a commissioner for the spring of 1838 , reveals the spirit by which his conduct was regulated in this day of rebuke , and his confidence in those whom he was appointed to represent : " You express some anxiety about my being appointed a delegate to the next General Assembly . If life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment ; but I do not feel myself pledged to any course of violence . * * * The brethren in this region feel quite calm on the subject disposed , however , to do that which , after prayer , much counsel and reflection , shall seem meet to be done . The condition of things in the Church , as well as in the State , it must be confessed , is quite ominous at present ; but we pray and look for a brighter day . I know of nothing better for us as individuals than to put everything over into the hands of infinite wisdom and goodness , and cheerfully leave the issue with Him who governs all . " In allusion to the Convention at Auburn , which was held in August following the spring of 1837 , and composed of representatives of the exscinded Synods , and others sympathizing with them , he says : " Much do I regret that there was any occasion for such a measure ; but I hope the Lord will overrule it for good . Great harmony of sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a good spirit , I trust , towards our brethren of the Old School . They have acted , we think , under great misapprehension of the facts in the case . " In November , 1838 , he addressed the following to Rev. Joseph C. Stiles , of Kentucky , in answer to inquiries proposed concerning the religious doctrines and order of the " exscinded " in Central and Western New York : /z/ To the Rev. J. C. Stiles : MY DEAR SIR I regret that my engagements will not allow me to give you a full and detailed account of the eccbsiasiical affairs of Western New York . All I can do is briefly to reply to your several queries . You asV. , first , What is the degree of corruption in doctrine and order around me , in my judgment . I belong to the Synod of Geneva , which embraces two hundred and one churches one hundred and forty organized with a session on strictly Presbyterian principles , and sixty-one which have no session , but which make use of our Book of Discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doings to the supervision of Presbytery as much as if they had a session . They are , in fact , Presbyterian churches with a defective organization . Instead of doing their business by means of a bench of Elders , they do it by assembling the male communicants , after the Congregational method . One of our Presbyteries , which has under its care thirtynine churches , has but two which are not strictly Presbyterian . Another , embracing twenty-five churches , has not a single church without a regular session . Presbyterianism is popular in this part of the country , and with a little kind and prudent management , it might become universal . Nothing but the untimely fears and mistaken policy of some of the good brethren in other parts of the church , has prevented it from becoming far more prevalent than it really is . " As to corruption in doctrine , I know of none which is deep and fundamental among the ministers and churches which stand connected with our Synod . The ministers have all solemnly professed to receive the Confession of Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that system of doctrine which is taught in the Holy Scriptures . At the same time , I do not suppose that they consider this as amounting to a declaration that they receive every proposition included in this extended confession , but such things only as are vital to the system , and which distinguish it from Arminianism , Pelagianism and Semipelagianism . They believe in the doctrine of total depravity by nature Regeneration by the Sovereign and efficacious influence of the Holy Spirit Justifi - cation by the righteousness of Christ , as the only true and meritorious cause the perseverance of the saints , and the interminable punishment of the wicked . They have no scruple about the doctrine of particular and personal election , but maintain it firmly as /z/ a doctrine of the Bible which ought to have a place in the instructions of the pulpit . " As to our churches , their opinions may be learned from the brief confessions they use in admitting members to full communion . It is the custom in this part of the country , when a person is admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to require a public assent to a creed embracing all the great leading doctrines of the Gospel , as well as his solemn and explicit engagement to lead a life of devoted piety . It is common for each Presbytery to supervise the creeds made use of by the churches under its care . Knowing this to be the fact , I addressed a letter to each of the Presbyteries in the bounds of the four exscinded Synods , requesting them to state whether these confessions , employed at the admission of members to their communion , were conformable in their tenor and spirit to the Confession of Faith and Catechisms of our church , desiring them at the same time to send me a sample of them . The answer I received was , that these brief formulas fully accorded with the Confession of Faith of the Presbyterian Church . I have now before me twenty-six of these confessions from as many Presbyteries ; and if I have any judgment as to what belongs to orthodoxy , they are sound as a roach , with the exception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atonement , as John Calvin and the early Reformers did . Some , I suppose , would regard this as deviating from our standards ; but , aside from this , I do not believe that Dr. Green himself would find any fault with these confessions . I say this confidently with respect to them all , one alone excepted . In one of these confessions there was not so full a recognition of the Divine decree extending to all events absolutely as I could desire , and yet the language of Scripture was employed , which asserts that God governs or works all things after the counsel of his own will. * Is it to be supposed that ministers would demand , or the people from time to time would give their public and solemn assent to these confessions , if they were very far gone in heretical opinions ? Can you get people in our Methodist Churches to subscribe to strong and * Some half a dozen lines are here omitted , on account of an injury done to the paper , by which some words are lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessions , instead of being got up by these Presbyteries to defend their orthodoxy , have been adopted to govern the faith of the churches under their care , and to serve as bonds of Christian fellowship . " /z/ pointed Calvinistic formulas , supposing that their ministers were willing- and desirous that they should 1 " But if this be a true state of the case , whence the alarm which has pervaded every part of the Presbyterian Church , with respect to our Aminianism , Pelagianism , Perfectionism , and I know not what . Has there been no ground for the fears and suspicions which have been entertained I can not conscientiously say that I think there has been none . A state of things has existed which excited apprehensions that some were departing from the faith once delivered to the saints . " During the excitements which prevailed under the labors of Messrs . Burchard and Finney , and their associates , things were said and done which had better have been avoided . A new style of preaching was introduced , new measures adopted and advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer of faith , the method of the Spirit 's influence in conversion , and the best method of securing that influence and promoting the conversion of sinners . No direct encroachment , however , was made upon any of the great doctrines of the Gospel . These were cheerfully admitted , and some of them distinctly and powerfully inculcated . But a notion was imbibed that the doctrine of election , and of the sinner 's dependence on Divine influence , and some other doctrines of the Calvinistic system had heretofore been urged out of due proportion , and that more ought to be said of the sinner 's immediate obligation to repent and believe . In pressing this obligation , they urged the sinner 's entire ability to comply with the terms of the Gospel . In a word , they taught that sinners could , but would not , repent without special Divine influence . Many believed then , and do still believe , that their language on this subject was unguarded , and likely to produce an Arminian impression on the hearer . That such was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Some of Mr. Finney 's converts doubted whether he believed in the doctrine of election , and wrote to him , while he was in Boston , to know if he did . He answered that he did believe the doctrine , and that they ought to believe it . " From the manner , however , in which some of our preachers at that time presented the truths of the Gospel , and especially from the fact that they did not very prominently present some of them at all , there was danger that an Arminian leaven would creep in , and corrupt the faith of the churches . This danger was not /z/ lessened by the speculations of the New Haven divines , and by some other dubious writings from New England . " After all , through the good hand of God upon us , I do not believe that any radical error has taken root among us , and is likely to prevail . I speak of the churches in our own connection . There is scattered through our bounds a set of Christians called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other absurd notions . But they are not of us , and receive no countenance from any of our judicatories . Were you to ask me to name the minister or the church in our Synod who did not fully and unqualifiedly believe in the doctrine of the total depr.avity of human nature , in regeneration by the influence of the Holy Spirit , in personal election and justification by faith through the righteousness of Christ only , I could not do it . I have much the same impressions , with respect to the Synods of Utica and Genesee , and the Synod of the Western Reserve ; but I am not as well acquainted with the members of these Synods . Still , it is true we do not all see eye to eye . There are shades of difference in some less important matters . What these are , I have neither time nor room to state to you . But allow me , in conclusion , to say , that in my judgment , there never was a greater mistake , than that under which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevalence of error in the exscinded Synods. " 2d . As to its cause . The state of belief is not as they suppose it . Nor do the errors which have been supposed to exist owe their origin to any such cause as they ascribe them to . They seem to think that Congregationalism has done all the mischief . It has had no more influence in the case than the moons of Jupiter . Our Congregational Churches , as a general fact , are the most stable and thorough orthodox churches we have . But my sheet is full , and I have only room to say , that I left the Constitutional Assembly last Spring , from ill health alone . " With much affection , I am truly yours , /z/ It may be proper to add , that the schism in his beloved church never seemed to diminish his love for either of its parts , though it threw his sympathies on the side of the exscinded . In relation to this whole matter , he entertained the most kind and conciliatory spirit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though /z/ he were an unworthy and gangrened limb . He studiously avoided everything that looked like impatience , in word and deed . Nor did he feel any pride in the appellation by which he and his exscinded brethren were distinguished from others from whom they were separated . His temper of mind , at this point , is happily illustrated by the following incident : An aged woman , who had enjoyed his early ministry , was permitted to hear him preach subsequent to the exscinding acts . As she was walking from the church , in conversation with Mrs. Richards , she inquired , Is Dr. Richards an Old School man or a New School man ? Mrs. R. , not disposed to answer the question , referred it to her husband when he replied , " My dear , I hope that I belong to the SCHOOL OF CHRIST . " As the infirmities of age increased , Dr. Richards received great pleasure , in view of the brightening prospects , and increasing influence and usefulness of the Seminary . He welcomed , most cordially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to its Board of Instruction ; and received , with the sympathy and affection of a father , the young men who came to enjoy the privileges which it furnished . In October , 1839 , he thus writes : " Dr. Dickinson and Dr. Halsey are both on the ground . The Seminary seems to be looking up , so far as officers and students are concerned . The professorships are all filled with their appropriate incumbents , and a large class of new students have entered . " It is proper to add , that he lived to see the Institution recovered from its decline in the number of its pupils , and enjoying a state of prosperity , embarrassed only by want of adequate funds . It will be observed that the compiler has dwelt much upon the care and labor of Dr. Richards in behalf of the general and financial interests of the Seminary . The /z/ reasons for this are the following : 1 . The means in the hands of the compiler , from which any connected history of his residence at Auburn can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of his own family , and in these letters he refers mainly to the general interests of the Seminary , and his labors to promote them . 2 . The character of Dr. Richards simply as a professor or teacher in the Seminary , will be given in another place ; and 3 . His character and influence in all his relations to the Institution could not be made known to the public , only by a course similar to the one we have pursued . Nominally , Dr. Richards held no pre-eminence in the Faculty of the Seminary , yet , virtually , he was the presiding officer . Nor was this all . While his health permitted he was more abundant in his labors as a traveling soliciting agent , than his brethren . He was also , to all intents , both the Corresponding Secretary and Treasurer of the Board of Instruction until the day of his death . This responsibility was not assumed or coveted , but it was referred to him by his associates , not only because their own tastes and habits inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of their conviction , that his great influence abroad , his power of appeal , his accurate knowledge of the history and wants of the institution , his careful business habits and most rigid punctuality , peculiarly fitted him for these various duties . /z/ FOR several months previous to his decease , the health of Dr. Richards declined gradually , though there were intervals when it seemed to improve . He had long entertained the belief that he was laboring under a disease of the heart , and the remedies to which he resorted were chosen with reference to such a belief . But a post-mortem examination showed that his disease had affected mainly the stomach , having materially diminished the natural dimensions of that important organ . Perhaps this may account for a gradual loss of flesh to which he was subject , and to which he often alluded in his correspondence , even during those intervals when his health appeared in some respects to be improving . He was subject , at times , to a determination of blood to the head , and of " subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1842 , while walking in the village of Auburn , he was suddenly seized , and fell upon the pavement , and was taken up in a state of almost entire insensibility . From this shock he never entirely recovered , and he regarded it as a new " sentence of death " passed upon him by the voice of Providence . It became the occasion of manifest sanctification , and there is reason to believe that it contributed essentially to his diligence in setting his house in order , and becoming " meet for the inheritance of the saints in light . " In a letter written at this time he says : " My chief concern is , to have my house in order in relation to /z/ both worlds . Never did the Bible appear so precious to me as during this sickness . O that I 4 had studied its precious pages While thus afflicted with bodily infirmities he became the subject of a most painful bereavement in the death of his eldest child , Mrs. Beach , which occurred at Newark , New Jersey , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only as his first-born , but for the great excellence of her character . When the tidings of her death reached him he rose instantly from his seat , and with burdened heart and moistened eye , and hand raised toward heaven , exclaimed , " My daughter ! my first-born , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power ! THOU ART GONE TO HEAVEN /z/ This affliction , so heavy , so sudden , and coming at a time when his health was feeble , the bereaved father at first seemed hardly able to bear . He entertained apprehensions that his frame would sink under it . He therefore requested that his family would forbear all expressions of grief in his presence , that he might avoid the accumulation of sorrow which the power of sympathy might occasion . After the lapse of a few days , in a letter to his eldest son , he notices the death of this daughter as follows : " I need not say , that in the death of your dear sister we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying dispensation of Divine Providence , and is well calculated to teach us what an empty and uncertain portion the world is. * * Our dear A has been torn from us and her beloved family , suddenly and unexpectedly but not , I trust , without being essentially prepared . She has for thirty years given the most abundant proof that her piety was sincere . Very few were so conscientious , so consistent and uniform , as she . Her meekness and gentleness , her humility and self-denial , told us of whose spirit she had drunk , and in whose steps she was treading . I /z/ have not a particle of doubt that she has gone to be with Christ , which is far better . This greatly consoles us ; but the event has fallen out under God 's government , which is still a higher and stronger reason for our submission . May it please the Lord to sanctify this visitation to us all . " During the winter and spring his health , though precarious , was somewhat improved , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor . He did not , however , intermit that direct preparation for the close of his earthly cares , to which his mind had for several months been particularly turned . In April , when his youngest son was paying him a visit , he ordered his horse and carriage , and invited him to ride with him . The object , as the event proved , was to secure an opportunity for a free and full communication of his views and feelings , and for imparting to his son the counsels of a father 's heart . He remarked , on this occasion , that he had survived nearly all who commenced life with him , and that , in all probability , he was near his journey 's end . He spoke with much emotion of God 's dealings with him of the way in which he had been led and of the " mercy and truth " which God had shown him in the various and responsible relations which he had been called to sustain . He referred , with peculiar feeling , to the infirmities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that , after all he had tried to do for God and his kingdom , his hope of acceptance was founded solely on the " boundless riches " of Divine mercy in the Gospel . " Before the interview closed he turned to me , " says his son , " and fixing his eye intently on me , said , I want you , my son , to be a holier man and a more useful man , than I have ever been . " On the 27th of this month he addressed a letter to his eldest son at Poughkeepsie , who had just lost a beloved child a lad of thirteen years by drowning . The loss /z/ of this son , and the circumstances of his death , had deeply agonized the heart of the father , and spread gloom over the family . The boat , containing the child and his elder brother , had upset in the father 's presence ; and as he stood upon the shore , his two sons were struggling in the water and cleaving to the boat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cried for the help of others , but when he returned the youngest boy had sunk to rise no more . The body remained in the river for several days . The following is the substance of the letter written by Dr. Richards to his afflicted son on this occasion : " A letter from your brother Edward informs us that the body of dear little Henry had not then been found a circumstance which naturally augments your trial , and prolongs its anguish . But this , too , is a part of God 's wise design a thing determined from eternity , and without which his scheme of government would be less perfect . How gladly would I be with you , in this hour of darkness and sorrow , but the state of my health forbids . * * My prayer to God is , that he will be with and sustain you . It is infinitely easy for him to pour such a flood of light and peace into your mind , as not only to soften the anguish of your spirit , and enable you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay upon you , but even to rejoice that he reigns and does all his pleasure , through all places of his dominion , leaving no one circumstance uncontrolled and undirected by him . Try , my dear son , to come near to him , and pour your sorrows into his bosom . He has a father 's heart infinitely more tender than that of any earthly parent . He never mistakes either the means of our correction , the time , or the measure . You may , with great confidence , cast all your care upon him , and roll your burdens on his arm . * * f that these repeated strokes of affliction might have their proper effect , by working in us the peaceable fruits of righteousness , and working out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ! " During the same month he addressed the following letter to his brother Abraham Richards , of the city of New York , who had just been bereaved of his wife : BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH . gg * * " We have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear sister , highly esteemed and beloved by us all . More you could not lose in any earthly friend . She was all , to you and her dear family , that could be expected or desired . There are few such wives and mothers in our imperfect world , with a heart so tender , and a discretion so sound . She was , indeed , everybody 's friend , and has left behind her an imperishable memorial of her universal and disinterested benevolence. * * It is past all doubt , that she has gone to be with her Saviour and them that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him . You will naturally feel that you needed her to accompany you in the few remaining steps of life 's journey ; but God knows what is best for us and those we love . Submission to his will is equally our interest and our duty . You and I must both feel that the morning cloud has veered far to the west , and will soon disappear . It is high time for us to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this world , and fix our destiny for an unceasing hereafter . " * * * In the month of July , and about two weeks before his death , he held another conversation with his youngest son , who was again providentially at home , and who describes the interview as follows : " It was short and uninterrupted ; but the few broken intervals then enjoyed he embraced to impart his paternal counsel , as if conscious that his end was near . Unusual solemnity and fervor characterized his words of benediction , as they fell from his quivering lips on my taking leave of him . " It was a custom with him and his colleagues to pass the Sabbath evening together in the exercises of religious devotion . On the Sabbath evening previous to the last which he spent on earth , he and one of his associates in the faculty , had been engaged in an animated interchange of views and feelings with regard to the privileges and hopes of believers both living and dying , when it was proposed to close the interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and enlargement . The windows of heaven were opened , and the tongue of the suppliant was loosed . He seemed /z/ to recall everything which ought to be remembered in supplication with the greatest facility , and he poured out his soul before God like water . The Seminary the Church of Christ the salvation of souls his own family , including a son absent on the ocean the conversion of the world were all remembered in the comprehensiveness and the fervency of his supplication . " It seemed , " said his colleague , " that it was the last prayer I should hear him utter : " and so it proved . Yet with all these indications of being " quite on the verge oV heaven/ ' there is reason to suppose that he did not himself apprehend that his end was so near . Though on the eve of spreading his pinions to fly away and be at rest with God , he knew it not . His infirmities had brought him to the determination , however , to resign the chair of Christian Theology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place about the middle of the ensuing month . In pursuance of this design , he penned a letter to his youngest son , intimating that important business would come before the Board of Commissioners , at their approaching session , and bespeaking his attendance as a member of the Board . This letter , written but eight days before his death , contained no mention of unusual indisposition , but , on the contrary , expressions of gratitude that he had endured the warm season thus far so well , and had been able to discharge , with so much uniformity , his official duties . But God 's ways are not as man 's . His servant was to be released from his official duties , though not in the manner which he contemplated . He had always regarded it as desirable to die , as he was accustomed to say , " with his armor on , and at the head of his troops . " This honor God had determined to give him . From the date of his last letter to his son , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Saturday he was attacked with a bowel complaint , which materially reduced his strength , and became an oc- /z/ casion of anxiety to his family . But , though feeble , he did not think it needful to keep his room . On the afternoon of that day , at the instance of some of the young men in the Seminary , who proposed to furnish him a conveyance , he prepared himself to go out and meet the Hon. J. Q. Adams , who was to visit Auburn at that time . The effort to secure a conveyance having , however , failed , he quietly submitted to forego the pleasure of seeing Mr. Adams , remarking , at the same time , that he had " used more exertion to behold the face of that honest republican than he would have made to look upon the face of a king . " Near the close of the day , he visited a new dwelling which he had been erecting , and which had just been completed . He surveyed carefully every apartment from the garret to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted his foot impressively upon the floor , and said to the builder : This will do this will do . He had erected this edifice , in anticipation of retiring soon from his office as Professor ; and as a home for his family when he should be " gathered to his fathers . " And that this house should be completed just in time to secure his survey and approbation , as the last business transaction of his life , and should offer a new home to his family , just at the time when the close of his official relations deprived them of another , will be noticed by devout minds as an arrangement of a kind Providence , worthy of admiration . He had been requested to conduct the religious exercises of the chapel in the Seminary , on the next day ( Sabbath ) and retired early , with a view to acquire , by rest , sufficient strength for the anticipated labor ; but when the Sabbath came , he was unable to leave his house . On the following morning , one ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to recitation . He met them at the door and excused himself for the time , but intimated his hope that he should be /z/ able to meet them on the morrow . But the venerable man had given his last lecture had conducted his last recitation . As the day drew near to its close , and while he was engaged in conversation with one of his colleagues , he was seized suddenly with a severe chill , his strength failed , and even a change passed over his countenance , leaving an unwonted aspect , which continued to the last . From this time , his articulation became impaired , and he took little notice of what was passing around him . His reason , however , did not leave him . On Tuesday evening it was intimated to Mrs. Richards by her daughter , that she had better retire for a season , and obtain a little rest . The proposal attracted his notice , and as if sensible that the hour of his release was near , and the watchings of his family almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : My dear , you must not leave me you must not leave me . He said no more . Such of his wants as friends could supply he continued to indicate by appropriate signs ; and when his friends could do no more , he signified that his remaining wants were abundantly supplied from the " river that proceedeth from the throne of God , and the Lamb . " He lingered until daybreak , when he ceased to breathe . Death was not only stingless , but it had no power to create a pang , or extort a groan . The soul left its tabernacle in a manner , as noiseless as the whisper which said , " Sister spirit , come away , " or the motion of the angel 's wing on which it was wafted to Heaven . " How blest the righteous when they die , When holy souls retire to rest ! How mildly beams the closing eye , How gently heaves the expiring breast . So fades a summer cloud away , So sinks the gale when storms are o'er , So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave along the shore . " /z/ In view of the mournful event which had deprived them of a much-loved teacher and friend , the students of the Seminary , at a public meeting held on the 4th of August , passed , among others , the following resolutions /z/ " Resolved , That while our grief at the death of our venerated Professor of Christian Theology is tempered by the recollection of his long and useful life , and the confident hope that he is present with Christ , we can not but feel that , as members of this institution , we have suffered a loss of which it were useless to attempt an adequate expression . But we may be permitted , in common with all who knew him , to express our conviction that in his death the cause of sound Christian Theology has lost one of its ablest vindicators , and the practice of Christian virtue one of its brightest exemplars . " Resolved , That to the afflicted family and near friends of the deceased we tender our heartfelt commiseration , with the assurance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as theirs , is not the grief of strangers , but in kind like their own ; for we can truly say that he was a father to us all . " Resolved , That we attend his funeral as mourners , and wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days . " On the same day his funeral was attended by a large concourse of citizens and friends , in the Second Presbyterian Church , where an appropriate sermon was delivered by Dr. Mills , the oldest surviving Professor in the Seminary , from Acts xiii . 36 : " After he had served his own generation by the will of God , he fell on sleep . " The intelligence of the death of Dr. Richards created a strong and painful sensation . The friends of the Seminary not only , but the Christian public , felt that a great man had fallen in Israel . Both at Morristown and Newark , where he had labored in the ministry , the pastors preached with reference to his death . /z/ At a meeting of the Board of Commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following minute was adopted , and ordered to be published : " Whereas , it hath pleased Almighty God , in his sovereign and holy providence , to remove by death the Rev. James Richards , D.D. , Professor of Christian Theology in this institution " Resolved , That while in the removal , at this peculiar juncture , of so able , faithful and successful an instructor of the pupils of this Seminary in revealed truth , we feel and submit to the chastening hand of God , both upon ourselves and upon the institution , we do , at the same time , believe it to be our duty and privilege to remember with gratitude his great goodness in continuing the valuable services of the deceased for such a number of years , and to such an advanced period of life . " Resolved , That this Board do hereby tender to the bereaved widow and family of the deceased our affectionate sympathy , while we confidently commend them to the care and keeping of that God who has revealed himself as the widow 's God and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following , among other resolutions , were unanimously adopted , at a meeting of the Alumni of the Seminary : " Resolved , That while we would not , if we could , call back our revered friend and instructor from his exalted and triumphant state , we nevertheless greatly mourn his loss , as one endeared to us by recollections of his kind and gentlemanly deportment towards us when his pupils , and the deep interest he ever manifested in our highest qualifications for the sacred office ; also by considerations of his high moral and intellectual worth , of his great ability and unwearied assiduity as a teacher of theology , and of the dignity , prudence and skill with which he presided over this institution , especially in seasons of adversity and trial . " Resolved , That , as an expression of our deep respect for the venerated dead , we take immediate measures to erect a suitable monument to his memory . " /z/ In pursuance of the last resolution , a beautiful monument was erected within the space of a few months , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on The Alumni of the Seminary join with the Family of the Deceased in erecting this Monument to Departed Worth . /z/ THE person of Dr. Richards was well suited to introduce him to the respect of others . His frame was tall and commanding . The features and expression of his countenance constituted no uncertain index either of his strength of intellect or kindness of heart . Many have remarked , that " Dr. Richards was one of nature 's noblemen . " His manly form , his dignified movement , his intelligent and benignant countenance , and his gentle and affectionate address , could not fail to secure the admiration of those who are willing to " give honor to whom honor is due . " " When he went out to the gate through the city , the young men hid themselves , and the aged arose and stood up . * * * When the ear heard him , then it blessed him , and when the eye saw him it gave witness to him . " The social character of Dr. Richards was marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a friend in whom " the heart doth safely trust ; " a husband affectionate and devoted ; a father that " provoked not his children to wrath , but brought them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . " In his business relations , he " owed no man anything ; " in his relations to the State , he claimed his rights as a citizen , and led " a peaceable life in all godliness and honesty ; " as a pastor and teacher , he was " kind , and easy to be entreated . " The uprightness of Dr. Richards was well nigh proverbial . In matters of worldly business , he both avoided /z/ and despised a mean and dishonest transaction . Next to vital godliness , did the exhibition of practical honesty give him pleasure . I may here relate an incident , in connection with his history , the remembrance of which he cherished with much interest , as a happy illustration of sterling integrity . While at Newark , his brother , Silas Richards , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a valuable accession to his library . To secure , however , a selection of books suited to the wants of a clergyman , he placed a sum of money at the disposal of his pastor , Dr. Raffles , a name which has been long and favorably known in this country , and desired him to procure the books . In compliance with the request , Dr. Raffles procured and forwarded a large number of choice literary , as well as standard theological works , of his own country . After the lapse of nearly a quarter of a century , he found , accidentally , that a small balance was still standing to the credit of his friend . He immediately put principal and interest together , and sent the value in books to Dr. Richards , thus accomplishing the liberal intention of the donor , and gratifying the object of the benefactions , both in their reception and in the beautiful exemplification of a rigid integrity on the part of his brother in the ministry . Upon a mind formed like that of the subject of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lamented deeply the prevalence of principles in the commercial world , with which the honesty taught in the Bible has no sympathy ; and no man could forfeit his confidence sooner , than by even a slight deviation from the path of practical uprightness . While a lover and an exemplar of justice , he also loved and practiced the virtues of benignity and kindness . In nothing was this manifest , more than in those relations in which he was regarded as the superior . If /z/ invested with the authority of the teacher , the dignity of his position became the occasion for condescension and kindness never for coldness and reserve . He regarded a high position chiefly for the opportunities it furnished for doing good . Says a former pupil , " He was the humble , tender-hearted , sympathizing friend , rather than the cold , assured , self-sufficient professor . " Says another : " There is one peculiarity in the character of Dr. Richards , which I think deserves special notice . I refer to his tender and affectionate sympathy for the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , whether in the lecture-room , or elsewhere , while he ever maintained the dignity becoming his station , he at the same time made them feel at ease , and allowed them that unembarrassed freedom of discussion and inquiry , which greatly tended to elicit and impress truth , remove ignorance and prejudice , and render his instructions at once acceptable and profitable . " And when the poor and friendless student needed counsel , he found easy and welcome access to the heart of his beloved teacher ; and when any of his pupils were afflicted with spiritual trials , and troubled with doubts and solicitudes , they had no- difficulty in approaching Dr. Richards , and found him ever ready to sympathize with them , and prompt to minister such consolation and advice as the circumstances of the case seemed to require . " Dr. Richards also loved to bend himself to all the familiarities and charities of domestic life ; and while he maintained the dignity of the Christian , and the Christian Minister , yet no man found higher enjoyment in the appropriate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , as well as the husband and the father , in the domestic circle . For nearly half a century he and his wife traveled life 's journey together , in obedience to the vows , and in the enjoyment of the rich and appropriate blessings , of the marriage covenant , as well as " heirs together of the grace of life . " /z/ But we shall take occasion to dwell particularly upon the character of Dr. Richards in the parental relation . The writer is led to this the more , from the peculiar admiration created in his own mind of this character , as developed in his written correspondence with his children . It may be proper to furnish the reader with some extracts from a few of the many letters which Dr. Richards addressed to his children . It may also aid the reader if w r e announce the subject to which each extract particularly relates . /z/ Theatre going . " You correctly judged that I should be pleased to learn that one visit to the theatre was sufficient to satisfy you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that species of amusement , it is an undoubted truth , that it will always adapt itself to the corruptions of mankind , either more covertly or more openly , and ultimately tend to make a depraved world more depraved. " /z/ Entering College . " You have now left your father 's house , perhaps never to return to it as a permanent residence . It is impossible for me to express the solicitude which I feel for your welfare . * * Having mingled but little with men , you are not yet aware of the force of corrupt example , nor into how many snares you may be led by the strength of your own passions , and by the enticements of those who are willing to see others as abandoned as themselves . With all the tenderness of parental affection , let me entreat you to have but few acquaintances ; and let those few be select , such as you are assured will be of no disservice to you , either in the pursuit of your studies or in your moral deportment . Be attentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from recitations or prayers . Much will depend upon your beginning well , and forming habits at the outset which will be creditable to you among the students , and secure the confidence of the Faculty . And having made a good beginning , persevere . Your collegiate course will be likely to stamp your character through life . * * I would earnestly recommend it to you to husband your time . * * As to your moral deportment , let it /z/ be scrupulously correct , and framed upon the principles of the Gospel . * * Two things I most earnestly request that you will never play at cards , nor other games of chance ; they are a waste of time , and most mischievous and dangerous things , and of all recreations most unsuitable for a student and , that you do not frequent any of the public-houses or places of refreshment . * * Above all things , my dear son , fear God . * * To his merciful care I commend you , and earnestly beseech him to keep you from all evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never expressed any direct wish to you on this subject , though I conceive it to be a point of very great moment , and one which requires solemn and mature reflection . Your present and eternal state may be very closely connected with your decision of it . If you had a renovated heart , and knew the grace of God in truth , nothing on earth could give me so much pleasure as to see you a minister of Christ . But let no man intrude himself into this sacred office without a gracious call . " I know that a man may be useful to the cause of religion , while pursuing any lawful calling . * * I know , too , that every profession has its cares and temptations , and the Gospel ministry among the rest ; but , as for myself , I had rather be a minister of the Lord Jesus , than to hold any other station that could be named . But while I say this , I know that every man has his predilections for employment , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned in making up his mind . " /z/ Dissatisfaction with College . " It appears to me that you must contemplate things through a false and deceptive medium , or they could never strike you as they seem to do . Undesirable objects exist everywhere , and things of unpleasant occurrence . This is the unavoidable condition of our fallen world . Go where you will , and you will meet them ; do what you may , and they will pursue you , and nearly with equal success in every calling and in every place . What if the classes are twice as large in one institution as they are in another ; or the students make a handsomer bow , or wear a finer coat , what has this to do with their mental improvement ' ? It is the books they study , and the thoroughness with which they study them , together with clear and /z/ faithful instruction on the part of teachers , that does the business . All the rest is moonshine . It may contribute more or less to our pleasurable feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * Do you not err in supposing that the honor of graduating at one college , will differ materially from that of graduating at another 1 The question will seldom be asked , where did you graduate 7 But what are you ? What your talents and attainments ? What your dispositions and moral habits ' ? After these your contemporaries will look with eagle eye , and from every side , and , without your leave , will graduate you over again , and according to a scale of intellectual and moral excellence which they have formed for themselves . " /z/ The loss of a Father . u To you , it appears to me , this bereavement holds a language of a special character . While it calls you , with the rest of the children , to lift up your eyes to your Father in heaven , and seek an interest in his protection and friendship , it admonishes you of the relation you sustain as the elder son in the family , and the part you are called to act towards your widowed mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfort to me to think that you will rightly estimate your position . * * Love your mother love her much ; she deserves your love . Relieve her as much as possible from the burden of accumulating cares ; anticipate her every want , and leave nothing undone which may tend to soften the pangs of a bereaved and aching heart . * * I think , my dear child , I may trust you for this and for the discharge of those duties which you owe to your afflicted brothers and sisters . " /z/ Integrity and Honesty . u When business is confided to you , attend to it with the most sacred fidelity . Let there be no shuffling , no equivocation , no want of punctuality . Especially in all money matters , be exact to a farthing . One deceitful transaction will do the business for you . Whatever may be the temptation , resolve never to depart from the high road of truth , justice and honor . " /z/ Keeping out of Debt . To you my advice is , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the only way to maintain /z/ one 's independence , and to be in easy circumstances . The borrower is the servant of , , . , e lender , and the debtor of the creditor , the world over . " No man can breathe fre3ly , who owes more than he can pay when it is justly demanded . I have enjoy d life as much as most men , but I have never allowed myself to get into debt beyond the f ower of an early and easy liquidation . I am aware that men of business can not always act upon this principle , but every young man should make it a point to keep within his means , and thousands in society would save themselves from the keenest torture , not to say reproach , if they would hearken to the dictates of prudence on this subject . " /z/ Merchandizing . " Suppose you were thoroughly acquainted with the value of goods , and that you knew what was best adapted to any particular market , and that you could buy and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being the whole matter . There are many surprising turns and changes in mercantile affairs , to be looked out for and provided against . There needs to be a watchful and experienced eye , to guard against losses from various quarters , and to meet the pressure of engagements . I have not a particle of doubt , as to what is the wisest course for you . If possible , you ought to obtain a clerkship for another year . * * * You think you have seen many things , and have had opportunity to make many observations , and do not know but you take as enlightened a view of the transactions of business , and the affairs of life generally , as you will do some five or ten years hence .

You can not know the deep interest I take in your welfare , both temporal and eternal . " /z/ Fidelity and regard to Providence in business . " I rejoice that there is a prospect of your succeeding in business . But recollect , my son , " that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , nor yet honor to men of skill . " There is a Providence /z/ which presides over the affairs of men , and without its favorable concurrence , all their efforts will be in vain . Yet God overrules the world by general laws , and his blessing is more li ely to fall upon those who are diligent in the use of appropriate means . If we squander time , if we are extravagant in our expenditures , or careless and reckless in our course , we diminish the chances of our success . If , from a haste to become rich , we depart from the path of rectitude and honor , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusting those who can not make prompt returns , we shall not only multiply our cares and anxieties , but greatly increase the probability of our ultimate failure . I am desirous that you should do well , and as one means of this , let me earnestly recommend it to you to act upon the nicest principles of honor and justice . " /z/ Course to be pursued in days of pecuniary embarrassment . " There is not as much pressure yet in the country as in the city , though I think it begins to be felt here . * * I hope , my son , that you will feel the importance of acting , in these times , correctly and honorably , whatever events may befall . Keep in view your accountability to God , and never lose sight of the maxim established by the observation of ages , that " honesty is the best policy . " If a man fails honestly , and through sheer misfortune , everybody will sympathize with him . His creditors , if they find him correct and honorable , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist him to get into business again . But if they find him not trustworthy , they will reproach him , and abandon him to his fate . " The writer may be allowed to remark , that he has enjoyed much intercourse with the son , Mr. Edward C. Richards , to whom the foregoing were addressed , and who is now engaged in a successful mercantile course in the city of New York . He has , at several distinct times , intimated to me , that though in his youth he could not appreciate the counsels of his father , in relation to business , yet experience had taught him their justice and value , and that his own success , since leaving the paternal roof , had depended on the observance of principles which his father had suggested . 7g BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH . /z/ Tour to England .

" /z/ Reverencing the Sanctuary . u Have you made your church location yet ? and where is it ? I want to see you settled in your habits in regard to this point . It involves perhaps more than you are aware of , both as to this life and that which is to come . A man 's moral estimate in society is affected by his church-going habits , and no less certainly his views and impressions of the doctrines and duties of religion . I am 710 bigot , yet I should be gratified by your taking a seat in some Presbyterian church , provided your wife should be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should make no objections . * * There are other evangelical churches where the truth is substantially preached . Lose no time , my dear son , in locating yourself somewhere , and when located , let not your place be empty . " /z/ In the intercourse which Dr. Richards maintained with his children , his chief anxieties manifestly related to their spiritual and eternal interests . His correspondence , though involving wholesome counsel in all matters pertaining to this world , is stamped pre-eminently with the impress of religion . Among two hundred letters and extracts of letters submitted to the compiler , which were written to his children previous to their hopeful conversion , rarely is one to be found , where vital piety , in some form , is not distinctly recognized as a duty , while in most instances it is affectionately and solemnly urged upon their immediate attention . The following extracts from so many letters , and which we give in the form of paragraphs , will give the reader a just view of this feature in his correspondence : " What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of the world , if you find no God and Saviour near 1 Our greatest wisdom is to make sure of an interest in Christ , and put ourselves over entirely into his hands . My prayer is , rny dear child , that this may be your great and chief concern . " " Not a day passes without our thinking much of you , nor do we meet around the family altar without bringing your case before the throne of eternal mercy . We wish you every comfort in this world , and above all , we are solicitous that you should choose that good part which shall not be taken from you . " u I long to see you safely housed in the ark , before the gathering tempest shall arise and sweep away all that are without . " " Beg of the Lord to undertake for you , and work in you mightily , to will and to do of his good pleasure . " " You know not the anxiety I have on the subject of your salvation . " to Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a little what is so apparent and whelming to my own mind , you would begin in earnest to sue for mercy , and never rest till your peace was made with God . " g0 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH . a Does this amazing subject take hold of you ? Does it stir the inner man ? Does it induce the solemn purpose to make sure of the good part , the one thing needful ? " Similar appeals characterize his entire correspondence , except that the anxiety of the father 's heart , and the importunity of his pen , seemed to augment as the day of probation advanced . The following passages and extracts contemplate his children in different positions . /z/ Under Conviction . " In God alone your help is found . He is under no obligation to show you mercy , nor can you bring him under any by all your heartless , impenitent and unbelieving prayers ; and yet if you were to say , Then I will restrain prayer , and leave the business unsolicited in his hand , I should consider you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , and made your bed in hell , but for infinite , unmerited mercy . Let that mercy melt you . * * * Depend upon it , the Lord is striving with you , which ought to be a matter of thankfulness on the one hand , and of fear and trembling on the other . * * * You may be assured of a constant remembrance in my prayers . But do not trust in what your father or any other mortal or mortals can do for you . You must go to Christ , and submit yourself and your cause to him . " /z/ Hopeful Conversion . " Had God conferred on you the wealth of the Indies , it had been nothing compared with the rich display of his grace in calling you out of darkness into his marvelous light . How shall I be thankful enough for this amazing instance of Divine mercy ! It is indeed sovereign , boundless and free , and indicates by its boundlessness the ocean from which it flows . Let us give thanks to his eternal name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be consecrated entirely and forever to him . * * " It is well that you should be on your guard . Deception in such a case would be awful beyond expression . To avoid it , we should examine after the grounds of our hope , and examine deep . We should look to the secret springs of action , and see what it is which moves us . Whether love to God on account of his holy /z/ nature , as well as for his kindness to us , really inspires and influences our hearts . I should advise you to read Dr. Witherspoon , On the Fruits and Effects of Regeneration , ' which you will find in the first volume of his works . If you can obtain the volume , read attentively and prayerfully , willing to know the worst as well as the best of your case .

" /z/ u You speak of your distress at the prospect of being in a state of dependence . I fear you do not feel quite right upon this subject . We ought not without great necessity to throw ourselves upon the kindness and sympathies of others ; but when we can no longer help ourselves , it is a favor that others will help us , and we should thank the Lord that he provides such assistance , though it may not always be in a way the most congenial to our feelings . Elijah was fed by the ravens for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bills I know not ; and when he was sent to the house of a widow who was in possession of a barrel of meal and a cruse of oil , we are not informed as to the style of the cookery , or the manner in which his daily meals were served up .

" /z/ The Work of the Ministry . " My prayers have been answered , my dear son , in seeing you a minister of the Lord Jesus , and regularly settled in a pastoral charge . You have taken what seemed clearly the path of duty , and there must be no looking back . Go on , my dear son , in the great work to which , I trust , the Lord has called you .

It is the spirit of the ministry , rather than its acquisitions and talents , that we should look at . Both are important ; but the first pre-eminently so . Here lies the grand failure of the ministry of the present day . " /z/ Preparation of Sermons . t ( Lose no time in your preparations for the pulpit .

" /z/ Trials of the Ministry . a Every Christian minister must have his trials , and God knows best what form they shall assume . Be on your guard lest your feelings should become chafed , and Satan get an advantage against you . Anything which should alienate your heart from the people of your charge , would endanger both your comfort and your usefulness . If they were as liberal and as good as they ought to be , they would have less need of your services . Manage the matter about with kindness and prudence , and it will turn out well , I have no doubt . What is most important to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to give yourself to your work . * * Look to God alone for all needed grace , to make you faithful , and to crown your labors with success . " But there may be those with whom what has been said of the social excellences of Dr. Richards will all go for nought . They have seen , or suppose they have seen , a blot upon his social character , which is more than an offset to all his virtues . It is reported that he was a slaveholder . Not a little has been said in relation to this matter , and much sensation has been produced in private circles , and also in places of public concourse . Of this matter we have Dr. Richard 's own explanation and , though dead , he may speak for himself . In a letter to Rev. Charles Merwin , an alumnus of Auburn Theological Seminary , under date of Feb. 6 , 1841 , he says : " There is a colored woman , in Newark , N. J. , who , according to the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , but who , in fact , has been asfree , for nearly twenty years , as she desired to be , or as I could make her . When I removed into this State , I gave her her choice , to accompany me to Auburn , or to stay among her friends , without any master or superior , to work /z/ when she pleased , and play when she pleased , without any will but her own to control her . She preferred the latter , though she has since expressed her regret that she did not remain in my family . She was too old to be manumitted according to law , without bonds being given that she should not become a town charge ; and when the subject of manumission was proposed to her , she utterly declined it , saying that she knew her interest too well to be made legally free at her time of life . Doubtles s ! e judged wisely ; for while she was able to work and support herself , she was perfectly at her own disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she became too infirm to do this , she had a resort to her master 's funds , which she has found adequate to all her necessities . She lives among her relations , w r ho provide every comfort for her , at my order , and at my expense . " As a friend of the colored race , what could I do more ? If I had manumitted her , with or against her will , she must have gone to the poor-house in her old age , instead of living among her friends , in the most absolute ease and independence , with every want cheerfully met and supplied . " But how came this woman into my possession , and to stand in the relation of a servant to me ? It took place in consequence of her earnest request , and to promote what I then believed was her interest and my own . She was then too old to be manumitted a thing she did not desire but wished to change masters for many reasons , and among others to be nearer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the number of slaves , while it would obviously ameliorate their condition ; nor could it , as I supposed , have any influence in perpetuating a state of bondage . A gradual emancipation had already been determined on , and provision made by the laws of the State for the freedom of every person to whom freedom would be a privilege . The object then sought has since been very nearly consummated . The colored people of that State , with the exception of a few aged persons , are now all free , and their freedom has been accomplished with less suffering to themselves , and with more positive benefit , than if it had been effected in a single day . " In speaking of the mind of Dr. Richards , the first thing to be noticed is its energy . From his childhood he was manifestly the subject of high purpose , or determination to make something of himself . His manly bearing in /z/ early youth , his early and successful efforts in teaching others , his youthful address to his parents " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life " all indicate energy of character . And when he had entered upon a course of study with a view to the Gospel ministry , though often hindered , yet he never faltered in his purpose . Like the majestic river , which either removes obstacles or rises above them , or provides for itself new channels , he fixed his eye upon the goal , and pursued his cherished aim . When disappointed , yet not discouraged when blind , availing himself of the aid of a sister when his wants could not be consistently supplied by his friends , resorting to teaching to aid himself when interrupted in his course of study at college , returning to avail himself of private instructions when visited with long , wasting sickness , yet devoting his restored health to study often " faint , yet pursu g , " until the desired object is reached . To this energy of mind , this fixedness of purpose , this indomitable zeal in carrying an object , or , in other w r ords , to this determination to be something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under God , the eminence which he reached . He stands forth before the world a self-educated man as one of the few who have attained not only professional excellence , but high attainment in general knowledge , in spite of the most serious interruptions and embarassments connected with an early course of study . In the mind of Dr. Richards the reasoning faculty was also well developed . He had imagination , and might have soared and dwelt among the " heights , " but his taste did not lead him to try his pinions . Besides , his duties , especially for the last part of his life , were more concerned with the " depths . " His intellectual pursuits looked to the development and elucidation of substantial truth , and few uninspired men have been more successful in finding this pearl of great price . " A wise man , " says Solomon , gg BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH . " will hear and will increase learning , and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels . " The mind that seeks truth supremely , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dependences , and which weighs objections against it in " even balances , " gives the fairest promise of success in its pursuit . Such , we think , was the mind of Dr. Richards . Its entire construction was such as to render him a close and successful reasoner . The candor , patience , deliberation and common sense which came in to aid the perceptive and reasoning faculties , secured to them a clearness of comprehension , and a strength and majesty of movement , and a correctness of conclusion which will place his name among the greatest lights of his age . Even those who may call in question his philosophical principles and deductions , or his expositions of the Scriptures , will not withhold the acknowledgment that his defence of his own positions is the defence of masterly power . It may also be noticed that while Dr. Richards was no inventor of new and fanciful theories , and while he took no pleasure in differing with good men in opinion , yet his mind pursued its investigations with remarkable independence . He received nothing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . He often inclined to a system as a whole , without endorsing every thing which might be regarded as belonging to it , thus receiving what , to his mind , seemed according to truth , and rejecting the rest , whoever might be the author . Thus he was a Calvinist of the Edwardean School . He was accustomed to say that " he did not like to differ from Edwards . " Yet he was no slave to the opinions of Edwards , and endorsed not a sentiment of that great man , unless , upon examination , he was led to regard it as in accordance with eteraal truth . So he was , on the whole , a New School man , but he was far from defending everything which /z/ might go under the New School name . It will be found that his views on several important topics differ from the extremes of the Old School and New . But the mind of Dr. Richards was distinguished for nothing more than for its strong common sense . To appreciate this , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was young when the Church began to awake to the wants of a dying world ; and his early ministry was connected with the birth of many of the philanthropic and benevolent institutions of the land . His life as a professor , too , was passed in the midst of much agitation and excitement . At such times , men are apt to betake themselves to extremes . They are Old School or New School , without reserve . They either go with the current , or stand still and hold back . They either make doctrine everything , or practice everything . They make the missionary cause a hobby ; or temperance , or the cause of the slave , and regard with comparative indifference , other forms of benevolence and philanthropy . Now , what is wanting , is , that good men , and especially leaders in the " sacramental host/ ' should keep their balance ; that they shall go neither too fast nor too slow ; that they shall give everything not only a place , but its proper place . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good word and work . " Such a " balance of mind " is not only the " better part of valor/ ' but in the Christian pastor , or theological professor , a requisite , second only to humble piety . Of a mind thus balanced , it is believed , that the last half or three-fourths of a century has not presented a happier example than was found in Dr. Richards . He discovered the relations of things almost by intuition , and predicted tendencies and results with the accuracy of a prophet . When he sought an end , he selected means which would secure it , without " subjecting his good to be evil spoken of . " When conducting Zion through the interesting scenes of a re- gg /z/ vival , no drawbacks upon the good accomplished resulted from a " zeal not according to knowledge . " This feature in his intellectual character , contributed to the wisdom and weight of his counsels , in the different relations and emergencies of life . As a father , as a pastor , and as a guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advice , which did not , sooner or later , prove itself " a word fitly spoken . " In the highest judicatories of the church , when matters of great interest were involved in perplexity , and when " much speaking " seemed to " darken counsel , " or furnish no light , a few words from the modest lips of Dr. Richards , have proved like the breaking forth of the setting sun-beams , after a day of clouds and storms . This feature of his mind also proved an effectual preventive of imposition and circumvention . He read the intentions of men from their conduct , with great accuracy . Though he was unsuspicious , yet no man within the range of his observation could pursue a zig-zag course , and escape the notice of his eye . And the man who undertook by stratagem , to circumvent him , or injure his reputation and influence , either abandoned the enterprise in discouragement , or closed it in disgraceful defeat . Efforts of this kind were made at different periods of his public life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , were it wise to expose the snares which were laid for his feet , and the manner in which they were escaped , elucidation would be furnished of a sagacity with which it is not safe to contend . " To steady opposition , " says his colleague Dr. Mills , " he was the most impracticable man I ever knew . At the outset , his opponents might honestly think themselves right , but they soon would find themselves in the wrong by the estimation of others , and what is apt to be more provoking , by their own . They might please themselves with calling him the " old fox ; " but they never caught him . BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH . gg As a Christian , Dr. Richards was humble , prayerful , and full of sympathy with the cause of Christ . Like Brainerd and Edwards , he cherished the most abasing views of his own moral character . He was once asked , " Do you suppose that you have ever , for a moment , loved God as much as you ought ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT A THOUSANDTH PART : " and burst into tears . In his religious character , which , on the whole , was one of great symmetry , there was , perhaps , more of the anxious than the hopeful and joyous . Says Dr. Cox , one of his colleagues in Auburn : " He sometimes evinced anxiety of a peculiar kind . It was not that his hope was shaken or gloomed either objectively or subjectively ; but it arose from a tender apprehension of the great crisis of the dying hour , of the importance of glorifying Christ in his exit from the world , the desirableness of recommending his religion to survivors , his conscious need of special grace in that great solemnity of untried being ! He would say to me , Oh ! that I may have the full and copious help of the Holy Ghost when I come to die a supply of the spirit of Christ ! " Dr. Richards loved and cherished the spirit of prayer . He regarded it as the " Christian 's vital breath . " His attitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , was standing ; and often , with his hands placed upon the mantle-piece of his study , he was found wrestling with the angel of the covenant . An inmate of his family relates an instance in which his countenance so indicated an abstraction of mind from earth and his sweet communion with God , as to remind her of Moses on the holy mount " in audience with the Deity . " He laid great stress upon prayer as giving life and efficacy to all other means of grace . In times of trial and darkness in the Church he went often to his closet , and recommended to others earnest and importunate appeal to the mercy-seat , as furnishing the richest pro-/z/ mise of needed relief . Says one , " Division and strife in the Church were to him as ' a thorn in the flesh ; ' and while others litigated and thundered anathemas , this man of God was on his knees , weeping over the afflictions of Joseph , and praying for the peace of Zion . " The depth and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with revivals of religion and the benevolent movements of the age . " My acquaintance with him , " says the Rev. G. N. Judd , " commenced in the winter of 1817 . It was a time of general religious interest in the town of Newark , especially among the people of his pastoral charge . I shall never forget the intense interest and heavenly unction which characterized his conversation , his preaching and his prayers . * * " It was evident that he felt a deep interest in the salvation of men everywhere . No one could doubt this who enjoyed the privilege of listening to his prayers . They were characterized by a tenderness of spirit , a depth of feeling , a divine emotion , and a power of entreaty , decidedly evidential of intense desire and strong faith in God , as the hearer of prayer . " The writer of the above refers to a meeting of Presbytery in Morristown , at the time of a powerful revival of religion , and speaks of Dr. Richards , who was present , as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently moved . He offered the prayer which preceded the delivery of the Presbyterial sermon , and made an address at a meeting in the evening which was appropriated to exhortation and prayer . Both of these performances were characterized by a sense of the presence , majesty , and holiness of God , and the worth of the soul , such as I have seldom , if ever , witnessed . " A co-presbyter of the writer , Rev. C. Merwin , says : " Soon after leaving the Seminary , I went to him for advice , during an awakening among the people of my charge . I told him of the solemn interest which pervaded my congregation , and of the tokens of God 's presence . THE TEARS STOLE RAPIDLY DOWN HIS /z/ It may be added that Dr. Richards " devised liberal things " for the kingdom of Christ . His agency was concerned not only in the origin of many of the benevolent institutions of the age , but in sustaining them to the last , by his charities , and prayers , and labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the increase of that spirit among his people which looks to the conversion of the world ; and as a Professor , nothing is noted in his correspondence with the friends of the Seminary with greater joy than the spirit evinced among his pupils to go to " the waste places " of our American Zion , or carry the Gospel upon their lips to " the isles of the sea , " and to preach " Christ where he had not been named . " As a theologian Dr. Richards held a high place in the estimation of the Christian public . His profession not only , but taste and habits of instructing young men in their course preparatory to the ministry , led his mind much in the direction of theological study . The general character of his religious opinions is well intimated in the language of Dr. Woods , of Andover : " He thought , and felt , and preached , as the ministers of Connecticut did 40 years ago , and as the ministers of NewEngland generally do now . His religious experience substantially agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bellamy ; and his theological belief corresponded with his experience . And when I say this , I mean to say that his belief and his religious experience were conformed to the Word of God . " His views were clear and comprehensive . He saw the relations and mutual dependences of the Gospel system ; and with much care and skill assigned to each particular truth its own proper place . Primary truths were well distinguished , both in relation to each other , and in relation to those which are only secondary ; and his body of /z/ divinity , like the natural body , was " fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth . " As a polemic , Dr. Richards was skillful , and no less candid than skillful . He read or heard opposing views patiently , stated them fairly , and then discussed them in such a manner as to secure the respect of his opponent , if not to convince him of error . " It was remarkable , " says one , " that his opposition to error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kind and gentle , that he did not lose the esteem and friendship of those from whom he differed . " There are some things which have a degree of importance in the preacher , in which the subject of this sketch was excelled . He never prepared his sermons with any reference to the " enticing words of man 's wisdom . " For polishing , he found neither time nor disposition . Nor was he equal to some of his brethren in gracefulness of manner . It was evident that in relation to these matters , either he had never made himself familiar with highly-finished models , or if so , that he was not particularly careful to copy them . But in strong thought clothed with appropriate diction , in giving to the trumpet a certain sound , in bringing from the Gospel treasure things both new and old , in presenting truth with perspicuity , in giving to each hearer his own portion in due season , and in applying truth pungently and faithfully , Dr. Richards had few equals in the American Church . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms ol expression , and delivered his message with the obvious aim to make his hearers understand , and induce them to receive and obey the truth . Hence there was no mere show of learning in the pulpit , but everything was suited as well to instruct the unlettered , as to interest and edify the most highly-furnished minds . He never discussed a doctrine dryly ; but after a fair statement , and clear elucidation , brought it to bear upon the hearer , as a /z/ matter of deep practical interest , and as furnishing the highest motives for holy confidence and obedience . His presentation of the preceptive and experimental parts of the Gospel , constituted a bright and faithful mirror , in which his hearers could learn what was their own spiritual character . There was also much less inequality in his ordinary exhibitions of truth , than often obtains among those who are regarded as eminent preachers . There are those in the Christian ministry who are capable of great efforts , who , nevertheless , sometimes feed their flocks w r ith mere declamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Richards was more equal in the distribution of his power ; or , at least , he avoided the sinking extreme , which certainly is the least desirable . " As a preacher/ ' says the Hon. T. Frelinghuysen , " he was sound , practical , instructive , always interesting , and often eloquent . The great themes which he discussed , and the deep concern he felt for the salvation of his hearers , were so earnestly and solemnly urged , that no one could mistake his convictions or his purpose . " As a Professor of Theology , Dr. Richards was well furnished , apt to teach , punctual and patient . His studies , as we have already remarked , were mainly subordinate to the range of instruction which he was called to impart . This principle was closely adhered to until the close of his life . any of his lectures were frequently re- written . Every sentiment was carefully and frequently examined , and the phraseology and form in which that sentiment was conveyed , was studied with a view to its conveying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils . About two years before his death , in a letter to his daughter he says : " Could I favor myself as much as I really ought at my time of life , I think I should enjoy comfortable health . But it is difficult to do this . If I have classes I must hear them ; if I hear them / must be prepared . " " As an instructor he was remarkably punctual . Hours /z/ devoted to recitation he regarded as sacredly due to his pupils , and he never withheld or curtailed them for trifling reasons . The following incident illustrates his fidelity at this point . He was in his study , in the midst of a lively conversation with a brother in the ministry , when the Seminary bell rang for recitation . His friend expressed his regret at the interruption , and seemed inclined to protract the interview with the Professor . But it was a question to be " taken without debate . " He immediately rose from his seat , excused himself , took his hat and papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reasonings of his pupils , was marked by great gentleness and kindness . He never aimed to " break down " a student , however tenacious in sustaining a wrong position , but to undermine him and let him fall of himself ; and , for the most part , the fall was so gentle that the shame of being vanquished on the part of the pupil was lost in his admiration of the skill of his teacher . Rev. N. W. Fisher , a classmate of the writer , says : a I never shall forget a circumstance that occurred soon after I joined our class . The question to be answered was , Whether conscience always dictated right ? I took the position that it did , and maintained it with a force of argument probably unusual for a tyro . This brought me in collision with the Doctor , who took opposite ground . For want of time the debate ended before it was finished . About nine o'clock in the evening following a rap was heard at my door , when who should appear but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate had ended in the recitation-room , he sought this opportunity to resume the subject . The discussion continued till near midnight . I listened with profound admiration to his arguments , and was pleased with the evidence he gave of his anxiety , not so much to triumph , as to arrive at the truth and convince me of my error . He foresaw , probably , that it would influence other points in theology , and he seemed intensely anxious that I should be set right . I must confess that my position had to give way , and my views have been different ever since . " With the substantial qualities of a teacher he also /z/ commanded , at will , those which are sprightly and humorous . Few men could invent a pithy form of thought , or draw a happy comparison , or recall an apposite anecdote with greater facility . In the use of such illustrations he judged well as to time and place . If he seemed to descend , it was not at the expense of his own dignity or the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point w r as dressed was homely , and perhaps too homely for the popular ear , yet amid the familiarities of the recitation-room it was not only lawful , but highly agreeable and instructive . What son of Auburn Seminary has forgotten the ability of Dr. Richards to relieve the tedium of a long recitation , or dry discussion . Some of us , after the lapse of nearly twenty years , can well remember the very grateful convulsions which were created by the corruscations of his mighty intellect . Under the sallies of his sprightliness and strong common sense , we forgot our dyspepsy , and even the evil genius of the hypochondriac was sometimes dislodged and compelled to take his departure for a season . It is worthy also to be noticed , that his instructions , especially in the experimental parts of theology , were often characterized by an unction and warmth of feeling , by which he carried the sympathies of his class , and secured to his pupils a deeper and livelier impression of truth than they had ever before felt . An instance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while illustrating the nature of that act of the mind and heart by which a sinner first embraces Christ as his Saviour . In illustrating this point he referred the class to his own experience in conversation , and the manner in which , from step to step , his mind was led . " As the venerable Professor proceeded in the narrative , " says a member of the class , " his heart warmed in the remembrance of the circumstances and feelings connected with his conversion . He leaned forward , then rose from his seat , and with extended arms and flowing tears , ascribed his change to sovereign grace , and declared that his first act of faith was submission to the throne . /z/ Would that I could recall all his language . The power of this living testimony carried conviction to our hearts , and we received impressions which will help us to understand and preach the truth , and which we shall carry with us to our graves . " In the foregoing sketch of the life of Dr. Richards , we believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that he had attained perfection . He ever cherished a deep sense of his deficiency in all things , especially in the Christian virtues . Though he had no sympathy with the doctrine that sinless perfection is attained in this life , yet he believed that others came nearer to ' - the mark for the prize of the high calling of God " than himself . It may be said , and a distinguished light in the Church of God . We heartily endorse the following tribute to his memory , by his colleague , the Rev. Dr. Mills , as given in his funeral discourse : " But had he then no faults ? it may be asked . And if by the questi n be meant whether he had not some unhappy obliquity of temper , some habitual frailty , such as too often , even in men of general excellence , must be remembered with regret by surviving friends , and which they would gladly forget and hide from view if this be meant , we answer , we know of no such faults in him whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry , such consistency , it is seldom our privilege to meet . " But no degree of intellectual or moral worth is security against the power of death . But " he that believeth , though he were dead , yet shall he live . " We cherish this precious hope with regard to our lamented and honored father . He has died but to live . A star of the first magnitude has disappeared , only to shine on a wider and higher orbit . What a constellation of such stars is gathering in heaven ! How bright their glories ! /z/ THERE are few subjects either more important or more difficult than those which pertain to the Will . From time immemorial they have furnished themes of the most ardent controversy , on which men of the profoundest learning and talent have exhausted their powers . It would require a volume only to name the points in debate , without touching upon the arguments alleged for and against the opinions advanced . Among the leading questions which have been disputed are , What is the will , considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are its phenomena ? and in what order developed ? Is it free ? and what does its freedom involve ? What determines the will ? Is it determined by its own efficiency ? or by something external to it ? or both ? How far do virtue and vice depend on the will ? And is moral character predicable of all its acts , or of some only ? Our object is not to take up these inquiries in their order , nor exactly to confine our remarks to what belongs to them ; but to give our views on the more essential points in this controversy , and to show occasionally what Edwards has taught in relation to these topics . We shall advert frequently to him , not because we pin our faith upon his sleeve , great and good as he was , nor because /z/ we wish others to do it , but for the purpose of awakening a desire carefully to investigate his principles , believing he has done more than any other man in exploring the basis of human obligation , and in reconciling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At all events , we consider him both scriptural and safe . Besides , his argument on the freedom of the will is unrivaled for its depth , its ingenuity and power , his opponents themselves being judges ; and it can scarcely fail to be a useful discipline to our minds , thoroughly to study this development of his . /z/ According to this writer , " It is that by which the mind chooses anything . And the faculty of the will is that faculty , power or principle of the mind , by which it is capable of choosing . An act of the will is an act of choice . " Some have thought it a better definition to say , " That the will is that by which the soul chooses or refuses " But Edwards contents himself with saying , it is that by which the soul chooses , because in every act of the will he supposes the mind chooses one thing rather than another something , rather than the want of it its existence , rather than its non-existence . So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . With the positive and negative set before it , it chooses the negative . Call the act of the will , therefore , by what name you please choosing , refusing , approving , disapproving , liking , disliking , embracing , rejecting , determining , directing , commanding , forbidding , inclining or being averse to , being pleased or displeased with all may be reduced to that of choosing . Hence , for the soul to act voluntarily , is always to act electively . Some have made a distinction between willing and preferring . Mr. Locke says , " A man may prefer flying /z/ to walking ; yet he never wills it , because he knows it to be impossible . " The will , he thinks , is never called into exercise but in relation to our operative powers , and when something is to be done , or not done ; of course , that the will always terminates on some act of our own , either bodily or mental , and some act which we take to be in our power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . Preferring , according to these philosophers , sometimes expresses an act of the will , yet not always , and only when it relates to some action of our own which we regard as practicable . Edwards takes a different view of this subject . He supposes willing and preferring are the same thing , being always acts of the same faculty in other words , that every preference is a choice , and every choice an act of the will . As to flying , he holds that a man may be said indirectly and remotely to choose it , though he never chooses to put forth any bodily exertion in order to fly . With respect to walking , it is different . Here the next and immediate object of choice is the alteration of the bodily organs , with the view to an end , and with the expectation of accomplishing that end . If the man be at rest , and prefers walking , he determines to make an immediate use of his bodily organs for that purpose . If already in the act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of these organs , as is most agreeable to him . But his will , in this case , is neither more nor less than his choice , though the choice immediately terminates on an object different from that in the case of flying . He who prefers flying to walking , chooses between two modes of conveyance , considered simply in themselves , and without taking into view the question whether they are alike in his power ; but he makes no effort to fly , and he chooses none , and inclines to none , because he knows it would be unavailing . Of course , his choice in this case is not immediate and direct , but remote and /z/ indirect : still he chooses , and this choice is an act of the will , though not such an act , attended by such circumstances , as when he chooses to walk . The doctrine of Edwards is , that preferring to fly and willing to walk are both acts of choice , both exercises of one and the same faculty , the faculty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the different objects on which the choice terminates , and the circumstances attending it . Still , we hold it right to admit that the customary use of language , which determines its propriety , will not allow us to use the terms willing and preferring as if they were precisely synonymous . To will is a stronger term than to choose or to prefer , and is more commonly applied to those acts of choice which immediately respect our own actions . I can not correctly say , / will meat , I will drink , or I will veal instead of mutton ; but I may say , I prefer the one to the other . It would be bad English for a man to say , I will to be as fleet as the roe , or as strong as the lion ; but he might correctly say , I should like to be , or should prefer to be . Things which are not at my option are not properly in my power ; and though I may indirectly choose or prefer them , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose them . These terms more appropriately relate to some action of mine , and some action for some end . But if either the action or the end be deemed impossible , it would be contrary to the law of my rational nature to will or purpose in the case . So far , then , as the mere use of terms is concerned , it would seem that we always prefer what we will , but do not always will what we prefer custom having limited the terms willing and volition to that class of our feelings or desires which terminate immediately on some action of our own . The examples given by President Edwards do not militate against this . He asks , indeed , " If a man 's /z/ choosing , liking best , or being pleased with a thing , are not the same as willing that thing , according to these general and natural notions which men have upon this subject ? Thus an act of the will is commonly expressed by its pleasing a man to do thus or thus ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pleases , are the same thing in common speech . " But who does not see that in these examples some act of our own is concerned , as that on which the will terminates ? Here is a man doing as he wills , and doing as he pleases and its pleasing him to do thus or thus . Something then , it seems , in all these cases , is to be done . Some action , bodily or mental , is contemplated as that on which the will terminates . Such forms of speech , though they settle nothing ultimately , yet as far as they go , seem to limit the act of willing to something to be done or not done ; to something as the fruit or effect of willing ; or rather they show that the phrase to will is not so wide a term as to prefer , the former being limited by custom to our own personal acts . President Edwards , in his Treatise on the Affections , admits this , though he contends , and may contend justly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are exercises of one and the same faculty the faculty of will . Locke makes a distinction , also , between will and desire , maintaining that they are different states of mind , and may often run counter to each other . To prove this , he gives the following example : " A man , I can not deny , may oblige me to use persuasions with another , which , at the time I am speaking , I may wish may not prevail upon him . " In this case , he thinks it plain that will and desire run counter . " I will the action that tends one way , whilst my desire tends another , and that the direct contrary way . 35 Such instances , Edwards remarks , do not prove the will to be different from desire , or that one can . be opposed to the other . Will , he admits to be a term /z/ of larger signification than desire ; but denies that a man 's will and desire can ever oppose each other , where the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects are different , then will may be opposed to will , and desire to desire . In this we think him right right as to the facts in the case , and right in saying that such examples as given by Mr. Locke do not prove a diversity between will and desire . But we might ask , do they prove the contrary ? The question is still open to debate , and can not be settled , we imagine , by an appeal to the ordinary use of terms . I may admit that , according to the usus loquendi , a certain class of our feelings , or states of mind , may more appropriately be called volitions , or acts of will , than a certain other class , which , nevertheless , I hold to be exercises of the will , and therefore volitions , though not usually so denominated . I may contend that all our desires are but so many developments of the will , showing its inclination or disinclination to the objects in view , and still allow that many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of will . The point at issue between Locke and Edwards was simply this : whether all our desires , of whatever form or character , are exercises of will , or that class of desires only , which immediately relate to our actions , bodily or mental . Mr. Locke maintained that the will is conversant only with our operative powers , and therefore , call its exercise desire or choice , or what you will , it never acts but in the direction of our operative faculties . Consequently he allows nothing to be a volition or act of will , but some desire or choice of the mind , which terminates on some action of our own . While , in opposition to him , President Edwards contends that the will is immediately concerned in all our desires , choices , preferences , likes and dislikes , let them be directed to what object they may ; though he admits they do not so commonly take the name /z/ of volitions , except where they relate to some action for some end . He was well aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suppose that this use could settle the deep and recondite principles of philosophy , whether physical or moral . It might determine what are the commonly-received opinions of men , but could do little in deciding whether those opinions were well or ill founded . He chose , therefore , to examine for himself , and to judge of the powers of the mind by the states of the mind ; and of these states , as they appeared to his own consciousness . Whether he formed a correct judgment , it is the privilege of every one to inquire . Dr. Brown , Mr. Payne , and a multitude of others , coincide with him . Reid , Stewart , Chalmers , and the Scotch Metaphysicians generally , agree with Mr. Locke . They consider our desires and affections only as incentives to volition , not as volitions themselves . Yet we might ask , what is a volition but a desire ? a desire of one thing rather than another with which it is compared ? and what is such a desire but a choice ? which surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elective faculty . When I raise my hand to my head , by a simple act of volition , what more am I conscious of , so far as the mental process is concerned , than that I desire it , rather than the contrary ? Do you say that I desire it for some end , and that I believe it practicable ? We grant that these are circumstances connected with the desire , and may be necessary to call it into being . But the desire itself , apart from these circumstances , appears no otherwise to my consciousness than any other desire ; or if there be a difference , it is no other than what is occasioned by the object on which it terminates . The desire of wealth and the desire of fame both flow from the same power or susceptibility of mind ; yet , to our consciousness , they seem somewhat different , as the objects are different which excite them ; and this , perhaps , is true of that entire class of feelings which we denominate /z/ affections ; though springing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they assume to us different aspects , chiefly from the fact that they are awakened by different objects . Allow me here to remark , that while President Edwards takes the terms witting and choosing in so comprehensive a sense as to include all the desires and inclinations of the mind , he makes no attempt to show the correctness of this doctrine , except what appears in his brief answer to Mr. Locke . Perhaps he thought it enough to rest in the popular and long-received opinion on the subject , until some one was able to set it aside , or at least should make a more promising effort for this purpose than Mr. Locke had apparently done . It has also been noticed as rather a singular fact , that while Edwards takes this broad ground with respect to the nature and operation of the will , he seldom alludes to it in the first three parts of his great work on the subject of the will . His illustrations are almost uniformly taken from what are , by way of distinction , called deliberate acts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate something to be done or not done . This might be the best ground on which to meet his opponents , and perhaps , from the tenor of their sentiments and the nature of their warfare , it was absolutely necessary that this course should be taken . Yet one can hardly help wishing that he had paid more attention to those primary states of mind , from which the deliberate and imperate acts of the will proceed ; enough , at least , to inform us how far he supposed his doctrine concerning one class of volitions would hold true with respect to the other . There is no room to doubt , however , that he considered willing and desiring the same thing , and not different things the mere development of the same faculty . Of course , that no man wills what he does not desire , nor desires what he does not will , when the same and not /z/ different objects are regarded . Hence , all our inclinations and affections are considered by him as exercises of the will . This appears from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded , but is distinctly discussed in his Treatise on the Affections . Thus on page 124 : " The affections/ ' he says , " are no other than the more vigorous and sensible exercises of the will : that God has endowed the soul with two faculties one , that by which it is capable of perception or speculation or by which it discerns , views and judges of things : this is called the understanding . The other is that by which the soul does not merely perceive and view things , but is in some way inclined , with respect to the things it views and considers ; either is inclined to them , or is disinclined , or averse from them : or it is the faculty by which the soul does not behold things as an indifferent and unaffected spectator ; but either as liking or disliking , pleased or displeased , approving or rejecting . " " This faculty , " he adds , " is called by various names . It is sometimes called the inclination , and as it has respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the will ; and the mind , with regard to the exercise of this faculty , is called the heart . The will and the affections of the soul are not two faculties ; the affections are not essentially distinct from the will , nor do they differ from the mere actings of the will and inclination of the soul , but only in the liveliness and sensibleness of the exercise . " He confesses " that language on this subject is somewhat imperfect , and the meaning of words , in a considerable measure , loose and unfixed , and not precisely limited by custom , which governs the use of language . In some sense the affection of the soul differs nothing at all from the will and inclination ; for the will is never , in any exercise , any farther than it is affected. * It is not moved /z/ out of a state of perfect indifference any otherwise than as it is affected one way or other , and acts nothing any farther . But yet , there are many actings of the will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything we do , wherein we act voluntarily , there is an exercise of the will and inclination that governs us in our actions ; * but all the actings of the inclination and will , all our common actions in life , are not ordinarily called affections . Yet what are called affections are not essentially different from them , but only in the degree and manner of exercise . In every act of the will whatsoever , the soul either likes or dislikes , is either inclined or disinclined to what is in view ; and these are not essentially different from the affections of love and hatred . That liking or inclination of the soul to a thing , if it be in a high degree , or vigorous , is the same thing as the affection of love ; and that disliking or disinclining , if ( it be ) in a great degree , is the same with hatred . " All this is exceedingly explicit , so far as the opinions of this great man are concerned . He undoubtedly believed that all the inclinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view , are properly acts or exercises of the will though not all denominated volitions in the common acceptation of the word . " There are many actings of the will , which are not commonly called affections . " What actings are these ? and what are they usually called ? They are such actings as are concerned in the common actions of life actions brought about by a direct act of the will , or purpose ; and these actings , every one knows , are usually called volitions . Yet such volitions are not ordinarily called affections ; nor are the affections ordinarily called volitions but in Edwards ' view , they are all alike acts or exercises of will . He could see no difference in that power or principle of the /z/ mind , which directs and governs our mental and bodily actions , and that power or principle which is pleased or displeased , with any object presented to the mind 's view . In the one case the soul is pleased or displeased with a proposed action , as the next and immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object which is not an action at least not an action of our own , proposed to be done or forborne . In both cases there is liking or disliking , embracing or rejecting , choosing or refusing , and to what power or principle of the mind , he would ask , can any of these things be referred , but to the will ? The objects which occasion them may be different , and the circumstances and results different ; but in themselves what are they ? but the various developments of one and the same faculty , the will ? At the same time it has been common , and we intend to show that it is important , to distinguish one class of volitions from another . Those which terminate on some action of our own , have been called deliberate acts and imperate acts of the will , and not unfrequently determinate acts because they are more the result of deliberation , and determine and govern the action on which they fix ; while those which contemplate no action as their immediate result , are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and do not flow out into action . It is of little importance by what names these two classes of volitions are distinguished , provided the terms agreed on be well understood and carefully remembered ; but in our apprehension it is immensely important to the cause of truth , that the volitions themselves be distinguished . Though admitted to be exercises of the same faculty , and to be phenomena of the same generic character , yet they are clothed with very different circumstances ; and we shall find , upon examination , that what is true of the one /z/ is not always true of the other , and that in several important particulars . First . As we have seen already , it is true of the deliberate or imperate acts of the will , that they always stand connected with our operative faculties , and terminate on some action of our own which we take to be in our power ; whereas , immanent acts of the will never thus terminate . They never fix on something to be done , or not done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except so far as they may become incentives to action , and thus influence the will in its deliberative and determinate acts . Second . Virtue and vice are primarily and properly predicable only of immanent volitions , or acts of will . They are the seat of all culpability and praiseworthiness ; while the deliberate acts of the will do not constitute , but merely indicate , the moral character of the agent . We take it , there is no one common sense notion better established than this . If the moral affections are right , the actions will be right , and the deliberate acts of the will , from which these actions immediately proceed . If the moral affections be wrong , they will give birth to purposes and acts which are wrong . This is so obvious as a general statement , that there seems no room for doubt or disputation . For it is neither more nor less than saying that when the heart is right all will be right , and vice versa . Yet , when we come to inquire into the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external action , disconnected with the volition which produced it , nor to the volition , apart from the motive or feeling which excited it . We ask , indeed , if the action was voluntary ? because , if it were merely accidental , or not intended , it could not indicate a state of moral feeling of any kind , nor be the legitimate expression of any . But when we have ascertained that the action was voluntary ' , /z/ we are not prepared to pronounce on the character of the agent , until we know the motive by which his volition in the case was dictated . If this was virtuous , we pronounce the agent virtuous ; if this was sinful , we pronounce him to be sinful . Thus we always judge of character by the state of the moral affections , or the disposition of the agent ; and could we know these , previous to the deliberate acts of the will , and to the actions which that will occasions , we should form ' precisely the same judgment of men 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the very constitution of our minds , w T e are led to refer the merit and demerit of every action to the state of the heart whence it originated . On this ground it is , that the Scriptures declare , " That he that hateth his brother is a murderer ; and he that looketh on a woman , to lust after her , hath committed adultery with her already in his heart . " The language of God 's law is , " Thou shalt not covet , " and the sacred precept is broken whenever the covetous feeling arises , though the purpose to gratify it should never be formed . To form such a purpose would indicate the reality , and perhaps the strength and permanency of the feeling ; yet the moral obliquity lies not in the purpose , any more than in the hand which executes the purpose . This must be traced up to the heart , or to the corrupt feelings which gave birth to the purpose , and which the purpose presupposes and indicates . Again : Third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will , or he could if he would , or he may if he pleases , " we must understand in all such cases , that a deliberate act of the will is spoken of ; for such phrases can have no application to an immanent act . An immanent act of the will contemplates no action as its fruit and consequent , and is followed by none ; consequently , no action , or power of action , is suspended upon it . This is true only of deliberative and determinate acts of the will . And yet how often will you /z/ hear from the pulpit and elsewhere , such forms of expression as these : " You can love God , if you will and hate sin , if you will and repent , if you will ! " a language improper , on several accounts . First , it supposes , contrary to feet , that love to God , and hatred to sin , and sorrow for it , arise in the mind in consequence of some antecedent act , immediately willing , and purposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a conceded point , that they never arise in this manner , but are always spontaneous rising up in view of the objects on which they terminate , and which are their true causes or antecedents . This language is improper , in the second place , because it makes a voluntary state of mind , or volition itself , the thing immediately willed and which involves the absurdity of willing to will an occurrence which nobody supposes to be practicable . But , thirdly , were it practicable to will an affection , or voluntary state of mind , into being , it must be willed for some end , which is agreeable or pleasing to the agent . What shall that end be ? Say I will to love God : Is it because the love of God is an affection in itself agreeable to me ? then I possess it already , and do not will it into being , since it had gained existence anterior to my willing . Or do I will to love God for some selfish end , believing that it might contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a selfish act would beget true love to God ? or make the least approximation towards it ? No stream can flow higher than its fountain . What begins in selfishness must end in selfishness ; as all experience shows , and all analogy demonstrates . But the point to which we wish to draw your attention , is the difference which exists between the deliberate acts of the will , and the immanent acts ; the one always contemplating some action as its immediate fruit and effect and the other , never . Hence it is proper , with respect to one class of volitions , to say you can /z/ Ill do thus or thus , if you will , or you can do this or that , if you would because in such cases you speak of an action , which would follow as the immediate consequent of volition , and which is suspended upon that volition ; but there is no propriety in such language when applied to the other class of volitions that is , to the immanent acts of the will ; for here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of such acts . They are neither produced by preceding acts of will , nor do they produce acts of any kind ; they spring up , as we have said , spontaneously in view of their several objects , and have no other antecedents than these objects themselves , and the powers and susceptibilities and habits of the mind . Let it not be forgotten then that when such expressions are used as " you can if you will , and you could if you would , " respect is always had , or should be had , to a deliberate act of the will and to some action as its appropriate result and not to an immanent act , which terminates on no such action , but simply on some object in which it rests . This opens the way for a 4th remark , namely , That deliberate acts of the will , as they never arise but in view of some action , so they never arise but in view of some action which we believe to be in our power , and which we expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we attempt to act , if we knew , or believed beforehand , it would be in vain . Such an attempt would be irrational , and without motive . Hence , deliberate acts of the will are always connected with belief and with belief of the possibility of something to be done , and done by us ; and they would not arise but for the prior existence of such belief . Now it is entirely different with the immanent acts of the will ; they arise without believing the practicability of anything , because nothing practicable or impracticable is contemplated as the result of their exercise . They terminate on an object pleasing or displeasing to the mind , not /z/ on an action , bodily or mental , as the expected consequent and fruit of their existence . There is belief , indeed , prior or coincident with their being belief in the objects which excite them belief in their own existence , when to the mind 's apprehension or consciousness they do exist and belief also in the subject mind , whose acts or exercises they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result from their exercise in order to their exercise ; nor is there any belief in their own possibility , or practicability , as feelings or states of mind none , I mean , as the antecedent ground or cause of their existence . They arise , as we have more than once remarked , spontaneously , in view of their appropriate objects ; and men know that they can love or hate , because they do love or hatejust as they know that they can reason and remember , because they do reason and remember . When a mother looks upon the smiling infant in her arms , and her bosom heaves with affection , does she first consider the practicability of her love , and believe her love attainable , before she exercises love ? Everybody knows to the contrary ; and so far as the mere act of volition is concerned , it may well be questioned whether the belief that I can will or can nill has anything at all to do , as the antecedent ground or cause of willing in any case . For how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing in one form or another , but by the mere fact that he does will , and in such forms as this class of phenomena assumes . Still we do not take back the statement , that our deliberate acts of will always arise in connection with a belief of the practicability of the thing willed , or of the action chosen . For this enters into the motive for willing it , and without such belief no rational inducement would exist . But who does not see a difference between believing the action , or thing willed , to be practicable , and believing the volition which antecedes the action to be so ? It is one thing , surely , to believe that /z/ I can raise my hand to my head , and another that I have a capacity for willing or choosing it , when adequate motives are presented . But be this as it may , the immanent acts of the will stand in no connection with the practicability of any results as flowing from them . They contemplate no results , they believe none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . What , then , shall we think of that philosophy or divinity which makes no distinction between immanent and deliberate acts of the will ? and none between the action willed and the act of willing and assumes that neither the one nor the other can exist without a previous or concomitant belief that it will or may exist ? " You can not love God , till you believe that you can ; nor hate sin till you believe that you can . " ' And hence the great importance of persuading men , not only that they have all the ability which is requisite to obligation , but all that is necessary to make sure of its performance ; for until this persuasion exists , they in fact can do nothing , and will do nothing , because there is no adequate motive to action . For as men never will an action till they believe that action practicable ; so they can not will to love , or hate , till they believe these acts or exercises practicable ' taking it for granted that the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoodwinked by ignorance or blinded by prejudice , the two cases compared will appear wide as the poles . In the one , an action is contemplated and sought , as the fruit of volition , and believed to be its legitimate consequent : in the other , there is no such action recognized , sought , or believed at all . In the one case , something is designed or intended : in the other , there is no design , purpose or intention , whatsoever ; but the mind simply loves or hates , is pleased or displeased , with the object it beholds . I close by saying not in the words , but in the spirit of /z/ an ingenious author , who has written an Introduction to Edwards on the Will , that until we mark with care the different classes of feelings called acts of the will , we can never hope to understand the subject of human volition , nor bring to a successful issue the disputes which relate to it . /z/ IN the remarks already submitted in a former lecture , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad line of distinction , between what are denominated immanent , and deliberate acts of the will ; that though exercises of the same faculty , they are very differently circumstanced and that things predicable of the one , are not necessarily predicable of the other . We mentioned four particulars in which they stand distinguished . 1st . The deliberate , or imperate acts of the will are always connected with our operative faculties , and terminate on some action which we believe to be in our power , while the immanent acts never thus terminate . They fix on no action ; they flow out in none , except so far as they become motives , or incentives , to deliberate acts of the will . 2d . That virtue and vice are primarily and properly predicable of immanent acts of the will only the deliberate acts not constituting , but merely indicating , the character of the moral agent . 3d . That in such phrases as these , " A man can if he will , or could if he would , or may if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of the will , because such phrases can have no application to an immanent act . An immanent act contemplates no action as its im- /z/ mediate fruit , or effect , and is followed by none . Neither action therefore , nor the power of action , is immediately suspended upon it , as in the case of a deliberate act of the will , and 4th . That deliberate acts of the will never arise , but in view of some action of our own , and some action which we believe to be in our power , and which we anticipate as the consequent of our volition . But with the immanent acts of the will , it is otherwise . They arise spontaneously , in view of their appropriate objects , without considering whether anything in relation to them is practicable or impracticable . They contemplate no results , as the ground of their exercise , and properly aim at none . They terminate on no action , bodily or mental , as their expected consequent and hence there is no belief in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If these distinctions are well founded , it will be seen , at once , that they are vitally important ; and that no clear views of the subject of human volition can ever be attained , while these distinctions are either overlooked or disregarded . To the second of these distinctions , I propose now to ask your renewed attention : and I do it for two reasons ; first , because it is peculiarly important in itself , and secondly , because it draws after it consequences of the deepest moment to moral and religious truth . The distinction is this : That virtue and vice are primarily and properly predicable of immanent acts of the will only , the deliberate acts merely indicating , not constituting the character of the moral agent . That this was the opinion of Edwards , there can not be the least doubt ; for besides what he said touching this subject in his Treatise on the Will , I present you with a strong quotation from a subsequent work of his , on original sin ( page 171 ) : " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ral notion ( of mankind ) not that principles derive their goodness from actions , but that actions derive their goodness from the principles whence they proceed ; so that the act of choosing that which is good , is no farther virtuous , than it proceeds from a good principle , or virtuous disposition of mind . " By choosing , in this passage he obviously means a deliberate act of choice , which terminates on something to be done or not done ; and by principle , or virtuous disposition of mind , he means something of which the mind is conscious , and which is seen to be virtuous some right affection of the mind , something , which according to him , may be distinguished from ambition , or mere self-love and therefore most certainly some exercise or emotion . In close connection with this passage , he quotes with approbation , from Mr. Hutchison , the following paragraph : " Every action which we apprehend , as either morally good , or morally evil , is always supposed to flow from some affections towards sensitive natures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either some such affection , or some action consequent upon it . All the actions counted religious in any country , are supposed , by those who count them so , to flow from some affections towards the Deity , and whatever we call social virtue , we still suppose to flow from affections towards our fellow-creatures . " Here is a full recognition of the fact , that all virtue and vice have their seat in the affections , and that no act of the will , which is consequent upon them , has moral character any farther than as it is expressive of the state of the affections . So it must be , if " actions derive their goodness from their principles , as Edwards teaches ; and if " the act of choosing that which is good , be no farther virtuous than as it proceeds from a virtuous disposition of mind " Because , if you separate the choice from the affection which gave birth to it , you instantly take away its virtuous character ; and if you attach to it /z/ a vicious affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you render the choice vicious , and not virtuous . And the same may be said of the action or thing chosen . Its moral character , so far as it has any , is wholly derived from the state of moral feeling which induced the agent to act in the case . The conclusion we draw from the foregoing statement is , that strictly speaking , all right and wrong attaching to moral agents , is immediately and directly predicable of their affections , habits or dispositions that is , of the immanent acts of the will , and whatever is included in them ; and not of the emanant or deliberate acts of that faculty . We consider this just as certain as the admitted maxim , that the motive of the action , or the quo animo , determines the character of the action . Hence two obvious corollaries. 1st . If right and wrong can and do exist anterior to the deliberate acts of the will , and independent of them , then moral agency must exist anterior also , and be alike independent of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is either right or wrong in a moral sense , where there is no obligation , no law or that there should be obligation , where there is no moral agent , or subject of law . In the order of nature , at least , moral agency must precede law ; and law must precede conformity , or non-conformity , to its demands . 2d . If moral agency exists anterior to the deliberate acts of the will , then it is not necessary to resort to these , nor to any of the principles or laws by which they are governed , to ascertain what moral agency is , and what is essential to its being . It has gained complete existence , before these acts of the will occur , and their occurrence does nothing more than indicate or proclaim the character of the agent . They afford probable evidence whether his agency has been exercised in conformity to law , or against it and , so far as blame or praise worthiness is concerned , this is all they can do . /z/ To what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determinate volitions , we have power to choose otherwise than we do choose ? whether the strongest motive governs the will in this case , or does not govern it ? whether we believe the object thus chosen to be in our power , or not in our power ? To what purpose are these , and similar questions asked , with a view to settle our accountability , when , if the foregoing statement is true , the whole business of our responsibility is settled before we come to these questions , settled by the voice of conscience , and the common sense of mankind , attesting the indubitable fact , that our blame and praise worthiness , primarily and radically consists in those moral affections which antecede all our deliberate choices , and give character to them , so far as character they have . Most certain it is , that if these antecedent affections have a moral character , he is responsible for them whose affections they are they are properly placed to his account , as his acts , his exercises , for which as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have moral character , and yet the subject of them not responsible , would be manifestly absurd : for nothing can have moral character which is not referable to law ; and what reference can there be to law , where there is no subject of law , and no acts of such subject to be referred ? To admit that these affections are morally good , or morally evil , is , of course , to admit that the subject of them , so far as they are concerned , sustains the same character , and that upon the ground of his being a moral agent , who , in the exercise of these affections , has exercised his moral agency . At this very point it is , that tile law of God reaches us , and our whole character is determined in his sight , not by what we deliberately will or propose , but by those affections , which we exercise anterior to all deliberate volitions or purposes whatsoever . /z/ Do we not find our moral agency complete , then , before we come to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for those anterior and primary choices , which we call affections and desires ? and how else could the entire moral character be measured in God 's sight , and decided by these ? The ground which we take is , that the law of God reaches man in the earliest development of his moral feelings , and requires him , first of all , to love his Maker with all his heart , soul , strength and mind , and his neighbor as himself : of course that it prohibits whatsoever is contrary to this ; be it an immoderate regard to himself , or to any of the creatures , which God has made , when compared with Him , who is the infinite source of being , and the sum of all excellence . We admit , indeed , that a thousand other things are required of man , in filling up the sphere of his activity ; yet all is to be done as the proper fruit and expression of that love which the law immediately and primarily enjoins . And God is no farther obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do what you will purpose what you will there is not a particle more of virtue in it , than there is of that holy , disinterested love , which the law immediately respects , and which ought to be the great incentive to every deliberate act and purpose of the soul . This can not well be denied , and perhaps will be cheerfully conceded : at the same time we may be told , that we overlook an important fact in the case , namely , That man , as a rational and moral being , has the power of introverted action , can turn his eye inward upon himself , and act upon himself . Not only is he able to consider his ways and his doings , but the causes and springs of those ways and those doings . He can bring before his mind facts and considerations , which are fitted to abate the strength of his wrong affections , and /z/ to awaken and invigorate those which are virtuous . In short , that he can modify his motives in the requisite manner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect , which his will has over the objects which excite his affections or desires . Were it not for this power , he could not be bound to have his affections otherwise than they are ; but with it , it is reasonable he should be required to place his affections on the right objects and in the right measure . This is the ground taken by Chalmers and a host of others ; and on this ground , they rest the moral responsibility of man . They contend that without this power , man would not be a moral agent , nor obliged to regulate his affections according to the Divine law . They do not assert that man can directly will his affections into existence , or will them out that is , by the simple bidding of his will can place them on this object , or on that , controlling them as a man controls his limbs , by a direct act of choice . They were too well versed in the laws of mind , to adopt an opinion so utterly inconsistent with the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to will objects into , or out of his mind , by a simple act of volition . They admit that the law of suggestion or association , has something to do in this business , and that often great difficulty is experienced in getting rid of one set of objects , and replacing them with others . Yet , on the whole , they think man has the power of doing this directly or indirectly ; and if not at once , still by degrees , and in such measure , that he may reasonably be held responsible to do it . For if he has the power , he is bound to exercise it , and in so doing , to control his affections by bringing before his mind the right objects , and shutting out from it the wrong ones . By a process of this kind , it is contended that virtuous affections may not only be awakened , but carried to their proper height , and vicious affections be repressed and annihilated . /z/ Agreeably to this system , man 's moral agency does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of his having moral affections , or immanent acts of will , but is primarily concerned , and properly involved in his deliberate acts . As a contemplative and rational being , his duty is placed before him , together with the means of performing it . These means he must consider , and determine to employ ; and in this determination , or in its opposite , his moral agency begins and ends ; and that prior to this , or back of this , there is neither agency nor accountability . This is the spot , the very spot , where many of the mighty have fallen ; and here it becomes us to pause and look about us , and if we have any armor , to put it on . For if this doctrine be true , then is the system of Edwards overthrown then does conscience give a fallacious testimony and the Bible itself become an enigma , which no philosophy can explain , nor the unlettered multitude understand . Only say that there is neither right nor wrong in what are called the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate act of the will , and we shall not only contradict the common sense of mankind , but take a step , which goes far towards shutting both virtue and vice out of the world . For , according to this system , what is virtue , and what is vice ? Not the existence of right and wrong affections , but the mere indulgence or prolongation of these by a deliberate act of the will . Apart from this act , there is no vice , and no virtue . It is this , this act alone , which constitutes the essence of moral action , and the nature and sum of all merit or demerit in any case . Such is the doctrine . But here it is natural to inquire , whether this deliberate act of the will took place without motive ? No one , I suppose , will pretend that it did , and if it were pretended , it would be absurd on two accounts . First , because no reason could then be as- /z/ signed why the volition was thus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no moral character of any kind . Influenced by nothing , it would be a mere determination to act without an end . But suppose the volition occurred through the influence of motive where can you find that motive , but in some previous state or feeling of the mind , which inclined it to cherish the affection in the case ? Are we not , then , carried back to something antecedent to the volition to cherish ? and to something , too , which gives character to the volition , if character , it can have ? Why did I will to cherish the supposed affection , be it virtuous or vicious ? There must be some cause , ground or reason ( if you would not have an effect without a cause ) . The cause was doubtless no other than the motive which determined me . But what was the motive ? Say , in the case of the virtuous affection ? Was it a love for the virtuous affection itself ? Did I contemplate it with delight , and hence desire its continuance ? Then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , before I loved it ; and did not become so in consequence of my love , or of my determination to cherish it . Was it a dutiful regard to God , or his law , which determined me ? Then , according to the unequivocal voice of conscience , the motive was virtuous . It involved a feeling or state of mind which every one must recognize as right in itself , and distinctly required in the Divine law . But if virtuous at all , it was so without being produced by any antecedent volition , whether directly or indirectly ; because no such volition is supposed , or can be supposed , in the case . I make another supposition . I was determined , by neither of the preceding motives , to cherish what I regarded as a virtuous affection , but was influenced wholly by self-love . My own interest , not a regard to God 's honor , or the good of others , was my inducement to act . Was this self-love a virtuous feeling ? It is the spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrenewed man , is doubtless a commanding principle of action . But I ask , is it virtuous ? or can it be supposed that an act of the will , moved and determined by it , will meet the approbation of Heaven , when it must be conceded that those higher motives which the law requires are altogether wanting ? There is , in truth , no cause for doubt here . Yet some one may say it is absurd to suppose that a man should resolve to cherish a virtuous affection , from mere self-love , because the very existence of such affection involves a virtuous state of mind , incompatible with reigning selfishness at the moment . We admit the case to be so . But who does not perceive that this is going upon the supposition that the affection to be cherished is , in itself , virtuous , and virtuous , antecedent to any purpose to cherish or prolong it ? But taking the ground of my opponent , that what is called virtuous affection is not virtuous per se , but becomes so , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or rather , what is more properly intended , that this resolution itself is all the virtue there is in the case . On this ground , I say , I see not why the purpose , or will to cherish the supposed affection , may not as well arise from selfishness as from any other source , because the character of the volition is not admitted to depend on the motive or principle from which it proceeds . Where then is virtue ? and where is vice ? They are both shut from the world , unless we can be made to believe that a deliberate act of the will has moral character , aside from , and independent of , the motive which governs it . But can we be made to believe this , so long as the quo animo shall be regarded as a sine qua non in the decision of moral character ? A deliberate act of the will , without motive , nobody supposes to be possible , or if possible could possess any moral quality . And such an act , with motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , unless our consciousness /z/ deceive us , and the settled notions of mankind on this subject be unfounded . But allow this , and you give moral character to motive and to him whose motive it is and that antecedently to the volition it occasioned or determined . Thus you carry back moral agency to those primary feelings , or immanent acts of the will , which are prior to all deliberative acts . Perhaps , however , it will be said that we have not reconnoitered the whole ground ; that feeling or affection is not the only motive by which the will may be swayed in moral matters ; that judgment and the moral sense often furnish inducement to action , when the heart is altogether indifferent or averse to the thing proposed ; and that , for aught we know , a man may be led to yield to the claims of duty from the dictates of conscience alone . Suppose it were so . Can we make the inference that he has acted virtuously ? virtuously , I mean , in the highest and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having done his duty , in the absence of those motives which he can never fail to require . Let us put a case . A man deliberates whether he shall pay a just debt , having found that no law of man can compel him so to do . He perceives his obligation to yield to the demand of justice ; and conscience suggests the fitness of the thing , and the intrinsic baseness of refusing to another what he would certainly desire and claim for himself . It reminds him that God is looking on , and that the day of recompense will come . Thus prompted , he determines to pay the debt , and perhaps feels a degree of self-approbation in what he has done . But was it truly a virtuous determination ? such as the all-seeing eye of God will approve ? By the supposition , there was no love to his neighbor , no regard to the Divine honor , either felt or expressed on the occasion . How , then , could the act be virtuous in the sight of Him whose law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the creatures he has made ? But this is not all ; we have gone upon the supposition that the heart was not enlisted , because no right feeling prompted to the action . But was it not enlisted ? Was it not moved by supreme self-love ? The man whose determination we are considering , had a deep interest at stake , and one which he could not fail to see and to feel . Nor does it seem possible that he should not have been influenced by it . But conscience , you will say , moved him . Very true ; but what chiefly gave conscience its power ? It created no new principles of action in the mind , but simply addressed those which were already there . It decided , indeed , what ought to be done ; but in urging a compliance with duty , its chief power lay in stimulating the natural feelings or desires . In the selfish bosom it deals principally with hope and fear , and influences to right action , ( in form , at least , ) not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsanctified never truly feel but because of the good , or the iU , which stands connected with heeding or disregarding the call of duty . This good , or this ill , is the great , if not the only impelling power in the mind of an unrenewed man . Where there are higher principles , as in the heart of the truly virtuous , conscience may excite them , and be the occasion of their more vigorous action ; but where they are not , ( though it requires them , ) it would be unreasonable to suppose that it can either address them or produce them . What is conscience , when developed , but our moral judgment , with reference to a supposed action , pronouncing it right or wrong , and the emotion of self-approbation or remorse which usually attends it ? In this operation of the mind there is neither virtue nor vice , nor can it be regarded as the immediate and proper source of any . We do not deny that conscience is one of the constituent principles of a moral agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral character ; but /z/ in itself , we say , it has no such character . Though favorable to virtue , as it shows its obligations and urges their fulfillment , still it neither constitutes virtue nor necessarily leads to it , however clear in its convictions or powerful in its appeals . And the reason is , it can appeal only to such principles , feelings or desires , as actually exist . In looking , therefore , for the essence of moral virtue , we must go beyond the dictates and emotions of conscience ; we must have a motive which the exercise of this faculty can never supply , and which can be found only in the immanent exercises of the will or the moral affections . This we take to be just as certain as that the heart is the seat of vice or virtue , and that the operations of conscience are distinguishable from the affections or the heart . See note A. at the end . I have dwelt longer on this article , because some ascribe to conscience a power which evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of showing what duty is , and of urging a compliance with it , by an appeal to those principles and feelings which the mind possesses , but of generating new and correct feelings , and thus swaying it by motives which it never felt before . We know of no facts in the history of the mind which can sustain this opinion , while there are some at least , which appear strongly adverse to it . Look at the wretch who suffers the keenest remorse , while he exhibits not a particle of contrition but whose moral feelings , so far as they can be judged of , are as wide from what God requires , as when slumbering in a state of most fearless security . Many such cases have been seen in this world , and many more will be seen in the world which is to come , where conscience will display her tremendous power in convincing sinners , not only of their past misdeeds , but of their present obligations and their hourly-increasing guilt , while it urges them to desist from their desperate war- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The selfish heart will remain selfish still , notwithstanding the constant and powerful appeals of conscience against sin , and in favor of the Divine law . I am aware it may be said , that in that world hope never comes , and that this puts a difference between a sinner on earth and a sinner in hell . True , a difference exists , and a great difference , in point of present and prospective good . But what has this to do with the question before us ; the nature and power of conscience as a principle of action ? Conscience is the same principle there as here ; it makes its appeal to reason and to self-interest no less in that world than in this . If it does not address hope , it addresses fear , which is only another form of self-love ; and , as a motive to action , just as valuable as hope , deriving its character and its power from the same generic affection a regard to our own welfare . It addresses this principle , too , under many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with them all doubts of the reality of another and eternal world . God , his law , his government , stand forth before the eye of the soul , in all their matchless grandeur , carrying a deep and everlasting conviction of the justness of their claims . It can not be questioned for a moment , that it is the sinner 's interest , even in hell , to cease his hostility against his Maker ; nor is it possible that he should not see and know this to be the fact . Why , then , does he not heed the voice of conscience , and submit to rightful authority , instead of flying in the face of the Almighty , and tempting him to fiercer vengeance ? It is surely not for want of clearly understanding the subject , nor because self-love or self-interest is not distinctly and powerfully addressed , but because neither understanding nor self-love , however appealed to , will induce to right action , where the mind has lost its rectitude , and is under the reigning power of sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how /z/ can they impart to an action a character which they in no wise possess ? " Either make the tree good and the fruit good , or the tree corrupt and the fruit corrupt . A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things , and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things . " As is the heart or the affections , such will be the volition , the deliberate volition , which proceeds from it ; the motive and the volition always possessing the same character , so far as character is attributable to the latter ; and this not in one world , but in all worlds . Were it possible that I could be induced to act , by a mere thought or intellection , without its ever touching my heart , the action would possess no moral character of any kind ; or if I were moved by self-love to any deliberative act of will , that act could be regarded as no better than the motive which inspired it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be no worse . We come then to the same conclusion as before , that there can be neither virtue nor vice in the world , if it be not found in the moral affections or immanent acts of the will . The mere exercise of conscience , we have seen , has no moral character , and can of itself directly impart none . This , we think , must be evident to all who attend to the constitution of the mind , and consider the relation which the several powers bear to each other . Unless we give up the principle which is natural to every man 's creed , that the nature of the motive decides the nature of the action , we shall be compelled to believe that there is neither vice nor virtue , but in those primary feelings which we denominate affections or immanent acts of the will , or at most in those habits and tendencies which these involve . We might here close the argument , but there are two or three other points which demand a more distinct /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NOTE A. A mistake has often arisen on this subject , from not distinctly apprehending what is involved in acting conscientiously . To act conscientiously , in the highest and best sense of the expression , is not only to do the thing which conscience dictates , but to do it in the manner and form , and with the motives which conscience requires . Thus to do is always to act virtuously , if conscience be properly informed . But in a lower sense , a man is sometimes said to act conscientiously , when he merely does the thing which conscience demands , though not with the high and holy motives which it requires ; as when he keeps the Sabbath , or pays his debts , merely or chiefly because he is afraid of disturbing his own peace , or incurring the Divine displeasure . In this case , we should all admit that there was no true virtue in his conduct , though he has , to a certain extent , acted according to the biddings of his conscience . That conscience prevails with a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done right , and that God accepts him , unless you know on what grounds , or for what reasons , it has prevailed ; and that these were such as the Divine law makes essential to right action . Overlooking this important circumstance has been a fruitful source of mistake , in arguing from conscience as a principle of action . Because to act conscientiously is , in some cases , to act virtuously , some have incautiously inferred that conscience was itself a principle of virtue , and that wherever it prevailed , the motive , of course , must be right , and the action consequently virtuous . But if we carefully consider what is implied in acting conscientiously , and the different senses in which the phrase is often employed , we shall clearly perceive that no such inference can be drawn . Conscience , when truly enlightened , is a rule of action , and to act in conformity to it , is doubtless to act virtuously ; but then we act from motives which conscience recommends , but which conscience , as a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ THE doctrine of our opponents is , that we are made responsible for our affections , when of a moral character , because we have the power , directly or indirectly , to modify them . We can bring before the mind those objects which will awaken and invigorate the right affections , and exclude those which would excite and maintain the wrong ones . This power , say they , is lodged in the will : the will controls the objects , and the objects the affections . And hence we are bound to have such affections , and of such strength , as the law of God requires , and to repress and exclude those which the law of God forbids . In this voluntary effort thus to regulate our affections , and not in any previous state of mind , consists the essence of virtue ; and in the neglect of this , and in efforts opposed to it , lies the essence of vice . Herein man 's moral agency begins , if it does not end . But we have shown already that this voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will , can not arise without a correspondent motive ; and that this motive can not be found but in the affections or irrimanent acts of the will , which lie back of the deliberative acts , and which give them all the character they possess . We now ask , Why should these affections be cherished when right , and discouraged when wrong , if not right /z/ and wrong in themselves at least at the time , and in the . circumstances , in which they are cherished ? It would seem as if they were so regarded by the mind , when it sets itself to the labor of cherishing or repressing them . Nor can we well doubt that this is the unbiased voice of the moral faculty within us . But it may be replied , that anger is not wrong per se , yet may become so if it rises to excess : natural affection is not right or wrong per se , but may become wrong , both by excess and defect . Consequently , though these affections are neither right nor wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and it is a part of virtue to do this . Suppose it were so what follows ? Not that we have no moral affections , nor that these affections are not the source or spring of every moral act . Say , for example , I determine to restrain the passion of anger , which I apprehend is rising to excess , and that I endeavor to call to mind those facts and considerations which I judge suitable to abate the fervor of my spirit . Has this voluntary effort any moral character ? If it has , it must arise from the motive or feeling which dictated and governed it . Suppose I repress anger from cowardice , and not from a sense of its sinfulness . So that in this case also we are carried back to the heart , or the moral affections , as the spring-head of our deliberate action , and the proper source of all the moral character it possesses . But have we in fact any moral affections ? affections which are moral in their own nature , independent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right or wrong in themselves , whether they exist in one degree ( of strength ) or another ? What is love to God , and love to man ? What is love to being in general a love which is disinterested , impartial and universal ? What is love of complacency in virtuous and holy beings ? Does not conscience perceive in these affections something morally excellent , let their amount /z/ or degree be what they may ? And does it not perceive in their contraries something intrinsically base and immoral ? What is envy , malignity , hatred , revenge ? A man praises my rival , and I feel a painful emotion , not because I believe the praise to be unjust , but because I fear it is too sure an indication of my competitor 's success . Is this feeling wrong per se ? No matter how it originates , nor whether it is a simple or compound feeling ; is it morally wrong in every degree of it ? or does its immoral character depend on its strength or modification ? Common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of God is exhibited , and I am displeased with it : to me it is unlovely , not to say hateful . Is this feeling wrong , and in every measure of it , let its source be what it may ? Every unsophisticated mind , we should think , would answer in the affirmative . But it may and must be replied by my opponents : It is wrong because I cherish it , and do nothing to remove it . But what if I do cherish it ? How does this make it w r rong , if not wrong before ? Why should I not cherish it ? Does it break any law ? and does conscience pronounce it wrong on this account ? Then wrong it is , antecedent to my cherishing or opposing it , because , in the very fact of its being wrong , the reason is found why I should not cherish but oppose it . Do you say it is wrong , because it is a state of mind not in conformity with my relations to God and his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character founded upon a reason which is prior to my judgment concerning it , and necessarily prior to any measures I may take to foster or oppose it . The truth is , it is simply seen to be wrong , as contradicting what my moral judgment pronounces to be fit and proper in the case . Nor does it make any difference whether this judgment is founded upon what is supposed to be the tendency of the wrong feeling , as it respects God or his creatures , or whether it is founded upon the intrinsic /z/ baseness of the feeling itself , as standing opposed to what I am constrained to regard as moral rectitude . I may be a utilitarian in my notions of virtue , or I may hold to a radical and essential distinction between virtue and vice considered in themselves , and apart from their tendencies ' y yet I can not escape from the strong and indubitable conviction , that certain moral feelings are so per se , and not because , by a direct or indirect act of my will , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of my consciousness than I approve or condemn them , as conformable or not conformable to the rule of duty : of course I approve or condemn myself , as having fulfilled or violated my obligations . This is the natural and inevitable result of my constitution . I go upon the principle that I am a moral agent , or a being under law . I neither do nor can question this fact . It is made certain to me by my own consciousness ; and I could as soon doubt of my being as of my moral responsibility . This is a truth which I constantly assume , as often as I judge of my feelings or character . I recognize it in every moral distinction which I make . For to perceive that this ought to be , and that that ought not to be , is the very same thing as to perceive a law of duty , and , so far as I am concerned , a law which binds me . Ought , and ought not , carry in them the very notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is perceived also . They are coextensive with and necessarily involve each other . They are , in fact , but one and the same thing , differently expressed . Consequently , I no sooner perceive the Divine character , than I perceive my obligation to love and venerate it . Love and veneration are affections of mind , which I instantly perceive to be duty , in opposition to lukewarmness and indifference , and especially to hatred and contempt ; or , which comes to the same thing , I perceive the moral difference between these two states of mind that the one ought to be , and that the other /z/ ought not to be . But why ? Why ought the one to be , rather than the other ? The utilitarian would answer , Because it tends to happiness , my own or another 's ; and the anti-utilitarian , Because it is in itself morally fit and proper right in its own nature , apart from , and independent of , its consequences . But my opponent can assign no reason why it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own principles . Suppose he should say , I ought to love the Divine character , because I see it to be right ; and I see it to be right , because I have the power of bringing that character before me in its most interesting attitudes . Does he not , in the very assertion that he sees this to be right , presuppose such a knowledge of the Divine character as binds him to love ? How else could he see this to be right ? How does he know but that , upon a more careful consideration of what God is , he might find just cause to hate and oppose him ? The very fact that he sees it to be right to love , supposes that he knows enough of the character of God already to lay him under indispensable obligations to love ; and , of course , that his obligations to this duty are not suspended upon any supposed capabilities of turning his attention to the Divine character , if he shall choose so to do . He sees it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as the subject presents itself to his mind . But his seeing it to be right now , is nothing different from his perceiving it to be a matter of present obligation ; and this obligation is plainly felt , if felt at all , antecedent to the consideration of the supposed power of bringing the character of God before the mind by a deliberate act of the will . Every one intuitively perceives ( every one , I mean , to whom the character of God has been made known ) that he is under strong and immediate obligation to love his Maker , without taking into view his power of calling up the character of God , and making it the subject of his steady /z/ contemplation . This character is no sooner seen , by whatever means , than the obligation to love and adore it is felt . Besides , what is the power here spoken of the power to bring the Divine character , as an object of love , before the mind ? It has not been shown , nor can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibility necessary to the actual exercise of love . But waving this point for the present , let us suppose that love , true love to God , exists . Was it called into existence by a previous act of volition ? This is not pretended , at least by a direct act : nor need it be supposed to be done by an indirect act ; for the character of God may be exhibited to me without any act of my will at all I mean , of course , a determinate act . A man may pronounce in my ears , whether I will or not , what God is , and what his claims upon me are . Now , let us suppose that my affections , in these circumstances , are drawn forth in holy love to the Divine Being . Are these affections virtuous ? Conscience says they are , though no deliberate act of my will was employed in bringing them into being , or in prolonging their existence so long , at least , as the exhibition of the Divine character was made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary effort . Conscience , we have said , approves these affections thus awakened towards the infinitely blessed God . But upon what ground does it approve ? Not because the Divine character was brought into view by a deliberate act of my will , making my affections to depend upon this act , and their virtue radically to consist in it , as my opponents contend ; but simply and solely because , in the exercise of these affections , I did my duty . Give us but this plain position , and the question at issue is decided : you confess to me that I have acted as a moral agent , and have done my duty , in merely exercising my moral affections , independently of any deliberate act of my will . Moral agency , then . /z/ certainly may and does exist anterior to deliberate volition . Nor does it appear that we have overlooked an important fact in the case , as alleged by our opponents , in coming to this conclusion . Take another view of this subject . Say that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resolve to cherish them , and so far only as I do thus resolve . I ask them , as before , why should I cherish them , if they contain nothing in themselves virtuous or praiseworthy ? I ask again , if they contain nothing in themselves praiseworthy antecedently to my cherishing them , how do they become so afterwards ? Does my purpose or resolution concerning them alter their nature or character in any degree ? Does it render them more pure , more disinterested , or more lovely in any respect ? Does it alter their source , their tendency , or results ? They are pleasing emotions in view of the Divine character , at first : what are they different , or can they be made to be , afterwards , by any act or purpose of mine ? It is plain they undergo no change , as to their essential qualities , by any efforts which I make in relation to them . True , it may be said , but I myself undergo a change ; I become virtuous , by my voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this approving and deliberate act of my will which constitutes all the virtue there is in the case . But here , let it not be forgotten , that if I resolve to cherish these affections , I must have some motive for so doing , and what shall that motive be ? Suppose it were selfish ? that I determine to cherish these affections simply as a means of promoting my own happiness , without the least regard to the honor of God , or the welfare of his kingdom , will this render my purpose or determination good and acceptable in the sight of God , who requires me to act for his glory in all things ? Nobody will pretend this . But say I resolve to cherish the supposed affections , because I regard them as right /z/ and fit in themselves , and because of their manifest tendency to reflect honor upon God , and to advance the happiness of his kingdom objects ever dear to my heart ? Then it is plain , there is a feeling back of the purpose , which moves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless you will say that the principle of action , or the quo animo of a deliberate volition , has nothing to do with its character . Thus , in whatever light this subject be viewed , we seem necessarily , and at once , to be thrown back to this common-sense notion , that every man 's character , as a moral being , is to be judged of by the state of his heart . If his feelings or affections be right , his intentions or purposes will be right , his words and actions right . But if his affections are wrong , all will be wrong , and wrong to the same extent that his affections are . This , if we mistake not , is the unbiased voice of mankind at large , who never trouble themselves with the speculations of philosophers , but are governed in all their moral judgments by those radical principles of their constitution which settle the great question of right and wrong anterior to all reasoning or speculation on the subject . They no sooner discover what a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates , than their decision is formed as to his character ; they pronounce him good or bad , just as they perceive his moral feelings to accord with , or to be repugnant to , the rule of duty . To this view of the subject , President Edwards bears the most ample testimony Part IV. , Section 4th . " The idea which the common people , through all ages and nations , have of faultiness , I suppose to be plainly this : a person 's being or doing wrong with his own will and pleasure ; containing these two things : " ( 1 . ) His doing wrong , when he does as he pleases. " ( 2 . ) His pleasures being wrong ; or , in other words , perhaps more intelligibly expressing their notion , a per- /z/ son 's having his heart wrong , and doing wrong from his heart . And this is the sum total of the matter . " The common people do not ascend up , in their reflections and abstractions , to the metaphysical sources , relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of faultiness or blame worthiness . They do not wait till they have decided , by their refinings , what first determines the will ; whether it be determined by something extrinsic or intrinsic ; whether volition determines volition , or whether the understanding determines the will ; whether there be any such thing as metaphysicians mean by contingence ( if they have any meaning ) ; whether there be a sort of a strange , unaccountable sovereignty in* the will , in the exercise of which , by its own sovereign acts , it brings to pass all its own sovereign acts . They do not take any part of their notion of fault or blame from the resolution of such questions . " Were this the case , the author remarks , " that nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand would live and die , without having any such notion as that of fault entering into their heads ; " and the same remarks , substantially , he makes with respect to that which is virtuous or praiseworthy . The whole matter , according to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , is that a man 's moral character is to be estimated by the state of his heart . If his heart be inclined to virtuous deeds , they regard him as virtuous , and the more virtuous , the more strongly and steadily his heart is thus inclined . And so in regard to that which is morally evil ; the more a man 's heart is inclined to it , and bent upon it , the more criminal he is ; which goes upon the principle that his moral feelings give character to his deliberative acts and all the character they have . See Note A , at the end . There is a single point more to which I wish to draw your attention . By those who dissent from the principles of this lecture , it is contended that man would love the /z/ right objects , and in the right measure , did he but distinctly and carefully consider them ; or that such is the constitution of the mind , that the appropriate affection would arise , were the object but clearly seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express themselves , that such are the powers and susceptibilities of every moral agent , that he needs only to have the truth clearly presented , to feel towards it , and its various objects , those affections which the law of God demands . Allow me kindly to ask if this is not a great mistake ? With respect to holy minds , such a statement may be admitted as in a high degree probable . It would not be strange , if every object should strike them in its true light , as they can have no prejudice against it ; nor if the object when seen , should awaken the correspondent and appropriate feeling . But where is the proof , or even the probability that such would be the case with respect to unholy minds ? Is it not manifest , indeed , that the fact is otherwise ? How else could it be affirmed of the wicked , that " they hate the light , and will not come to the light , lest their deeds should be reproved ? " Why did the world hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hate his followers ? " If ye were of the world , the world would love his own ; but because ye are not of the world , even as I am not of the world , therefore the world hateth you . " Will it be said that the world hated Christ and his disciples , because they misapprehended their character , or did not intellectually view them aright ? Then it was a false and imaginary character which they hated something which did not belong to Christ and his disciples ; and was it criminal to hate such a character ? Besides , our Lord lays the ground of opposition in a totally different fact . " If ye were of the world , the world would love his own/ ' that is to say , if ye were like the world , the world would love you ; " but because ye are not of the world/ 3 or like the /z/ world , " therefore the world hateth you . " As if he had said , you possess a character different from , and opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why ? let me ask , unless this different and opposite character was distinctly discerned ? We can not hate what we do not see . But Christ knew they would both see and hate , and that this hatred would spring from an opposition of moral character . The same thing he asserts , when he speaks of the opposition of the Jewish nation to himself . " If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin , but now they have no cloke for their sin . He that hateth me hateth my Father also . If I had not done among them the works , which none other man did , they had not had sin , but now they have both seen and hated , both me and my Father . But this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , they hated me without a cause " Did they not then see Jesus Christ , in his true character , as developed by what he did and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no proof of their hatred of his Father ; for in his true character only , was there any likeness to his Father , and in this character only , did he represent his Father ; and besides , how could he say , " they have both seen and hated both me and my Father " if it was not him which they hated , but a false and mistaken apprehension of him ? speculatively and intellectually false , I mean ; for his transcendent moral excellence they did not see ; nor did any see it , whose eyes were not savingly enlightened from above . But this is wholly a different matter . To see the moral excellence of Christ , is to see his beauty ; and to see his beauty is nothing different from exercising love to him . Beauty is an emotion , as is admitted upon all hands ; and what we call the perception of it , is not the mere exercise of the intellectual faculty , but is the joint operation of the intellect and the heart . It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And surely there can be no difficulty in supposing that what is pleasing to one , is deformed and hateful to another ; not because their intellectual views are different , but because their tastes , their dispositions , their hearts are different . This is seen with respect to a thousand objects in the ordinary occurrences of life ; and it is seen no less in the things of religion . The same truths which awaken the most delightful emotions in one mind , call forth the strongest feelings of disgust in another . The mere intellectual perception may be the same in both cases . To a great extent , it certainly can not be otherwise ; but the feelings which it occasions are as wide from each other as the poles . With this plain fact before us , how can it be doubted , that the opposition of the Jews to the Saviour was the result , not so much of any misunderstanding of his doctrines or his spirit , as of a selfish and wicked heart . They are of the world he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sin he infinitely holy . This contrariety of character laid a foundation for a contrariety of feeling ; and nothing can be plainer , than that he constantly imputes their hostility to this obvious and decisive circumstance . His doctrines and his spirit offended them ; those very doctrines and that very spirit which endeared him to his followers . Hence , said he , " This is the condemnation that light has come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil . Every one that doeth evil , hateth the light . " But what is the light ? what but the truth of God , brought to the world by the preaching of his Son ? It is this which wicked men hate , ( according to the Saviour 's testimony , ) not because they do not see it , for they do see it , or it could not be an object of their hatred ; but because it stands opposed to worldliness , and requires a subjugation of their wicked lusts , on the pains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true ground , of their opposition to the truths of the Gospel ; their hearts are alienated from the life of God ; they love neither his character , nor his law , nor his government ; nor are they any better pleased with the character of his Son , or with the glorious system of truth and duty which he revealed . But , contrary to all analogy , it has been conjectured that the true reason of men 's opposition to the truth is , their views are partial and distorted , or they are transient and unsteady . Would they but take a more comprehensive view of things , and especially , would they dwell upon them with attention , they would soon find in the truth a subduing power , in breaking down the opposition of their hearts and transforming them into love . I call this conjecture , because I know of no facts in the wide range of experience which can justify it ; and fully am I persuaded that there is nothing to authorize it in the Bible . What is the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispositions , passions or affections , which are excited or drawn forth by a perception of their corresponding objects . When these objects are contemplated , we expect , as a matter of course , that the feelings to which they are adapted will arise ; and that these feelings will be strong and permanent , in proportion to the clearness and steadiness with which their several objects are viewed . The more distinctly and exclusively any object is seen , the more intense , other things being equal , will the excited feelings be . This is a matter of universal experience . Take a covetous man , counting over his wealth , or looking out with eagle eye for a chance to increase his fortune . Whoever supposed that a partial view of his darling object would awaken and stimulate his ruling passion , but that an entire and absorbing view would counteract and destroy /z/ it ? Or an ambitious man , whose aspiring soul kindles into ardor with every glance at the object of his pursuit ; who expects that his characteristic feeling will subside , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for comes fully into view , and the prospect of success is augmented ? In all such cases , we never doubt that the characteristic feeling or disposition will be called into exercise whenever its object shall be seen , and to the same degree in which it is seen ; and we should no more think of eradicating the disposition by giving a glowing description of its object , than of pouring oil on the fire to extinguish the flames . Can any reason , then , be given why the same thing should not hold true with respect to all our moral feelings , whether vicious or virtuous , especially where they are known to have a settled and prevalent character ? All admit , indeed , that the fact is so , with respect to our virtuous affections . Whatever object directly awakens them , it is believed , awakens them the more the more distinctly it is seen , and the more attentively it is considered . Why should it be otherwise with our sinful affections which are equally characteristic and permanent principles of action . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience or in the reason and nature of things . It is as true of them as of every other feeling of the mind , that they are called into exercise by the objects which excite them , and that they acquire a force and intensity , usually in the same proportion that the exciting objects are spread out before the mind . There is no exception to this , where the excited feeling is produced by speculatively seeing the object as it is . Where it has been occasioned in whole or in part by a speculative error , a corrected view of the object may either soften the feeling or entirely remove it . In all other circumstances , it will increase with every increased view of its objective /z/ cause . This we take to be certain , if our experience can be relied upon , and all analogies in the case do not utterly fail . But some may suppose that our analogies do fail , and do not represent the case as it is . For though the covetous man is allured by the objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ambition , and even the virtuous man by the objects of his love ; still , in all these cases an object is supposed , which is simply adapted to awaken the correspondent feeling , without anything to counteract it . But not so with respect to the truths of religion , which occasionally and in some aspects awaken the hostility of the sinner . Here many things are addressed to his conscience , his reason and his self-love , which he naturally approves , and which are calculated to abate his enmity and draw forth his friendship ; and even when his hatred is felt , it is not so much towards the truth itself , or because it is truth abstractly considered , as because it crosses his path and threatens him with ruin . What if it be so ? It affords no escape from the fact that there is something in the truths of religion , which awakens the hostility of the sinner and renders him the decided enemy of God . It matters not how much there is of a different character , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinner 's heart , and which he never can behold without the feeling of predominant dislike . This surely can not be denied without denying the voice of inspiration , which declares " that the carnal mind is enmity against God , not subject to his law , neither indeed can be . " If this does not assure us that there is a natural and stated contrariety between the sinner 's heart and the holy character of God , it is difficult to say what could do it . How , then , can this character be seen by the sinner without exciting his aversion ? The just man , we are told , is an abomination to the unjust ; and can it be thought strange that a God of infinite /z/ holiness , with power and disposition to punish the workers of iniquity , should be an object of hatred to the wicked ? We have seen already that the world hated Christ and his disciples not because they were deceived as to their doctrine or spirit , but because they were unlike them in the temper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnal mind at enmity with God and his law . God is holy , and his law holy ; but the carnal mind is sold under sin , and therefore opposed to God and his law . If it be not so , why was it , " That when men knew God , they glorified him not as God , but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish hearts were darkened ? " Why , in every age , have they been disposed " to say unto God , depart from us , for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways 1 " Can this be accounted for on any other supposition than that they have always found that , in the true character of God , which was exceedingly unwelcome to their hearts , and which called forth their decided opposition ? Is it , then , an unwarrantable inference , that the more they see of the Divine character , while under the dominion of sin , the more their hearts will be inflamed against it ? This inimical feeling is with them a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it seems impossible that it should not be excited in the same proportion as the exciting object comes clearly into view . Thousands of individuals in every age , can bear witness that such has been their experience , when under conviction by the law , and antecedent to the renovation of their hearts . Was it not so with Edwards and Brainerd , and most of those the history of whose conversion we know ? But why resort to the testimony of men , since the testimony of God is greater ? Paul , surely , did not find his heart less opposed to the Divine law , the more clearly he saw the nature and extent of its demands . " I was alive , " saith he , " with- /z/ out the law once ; but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died . " That is , as I understand him , while he was comparatively ignorant of the law , he felt self-satisfied full of his own imaginary goodness , and full of the expectation of life from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and Divine power , and he saw its spirituality and extent reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart , " sin revived , and he died . " " The commandment , which was ordained to life , he found to be unto death , " both as it discovered to him the enormity of his guilt , which exposed him to death , and as it stirred up his wicked heart to rebel , and to rebel the more , the more it poured its sacred light into his bosom . " For sin , " says he , " taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence , " it " deceived me , and thereby slew me . " Before the commandment came , sin was dead comparatively dead ; but the commandment , on coming , gave it power . Its latent principles awoke and started into fresh and unwonted vigor . Not that the law was in fault ; for " the law is holy , and the commandment holy , just and good ; but sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become ( not simply appear ) exceeding sinful . " It is plain that the Apostle is here speaking , not merely nor chiefly of the knowledge of sin , which was made manifest by the coming of the commandment , but of the power of sin as a principle of action a principle which was called into vigorous exercise by a clearer perception of the spirituality and extent of the Divine law . And hence he accounts for this effect by stating " that the law is spiritual , but he , carnal , sold under sin . " Let philosophy , then , contend for what she may , those who bow to the authority of the Bible can be at no loss , we should imagine , as to what they are to believe on the point under discussion . This /z/ single statement of the Apostle 's experience is , in our judgment , no equivocal proof that mere light let into the understanding , while the heart is unsanctified , is so far from awakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and provoke it to more decided enmity . We can not yield , therefore , to the opinion of our opponents , that were sinners to turn their attention to the right objects , and seriously meditate upon them , the appropriate and required affections would arise , as a matter of course , and agreeably to a law of their constitution . Such a sentiment appears to us to be alike at war with experience , and with the revealed truth of God . But grant , for a moment , that it were so ; what does it avail towards showing that right and wrong , good and evil , lie not in the moral affections , but in the deliberate acts of the will ? Say that sinners will not turn their attention to God , and Divine things and therefore are not rightly affected towards them where lies their guilt ? Not in the deliberate act of refusing to attend apart from the feelings which led to the refusal but in the state of their moral affections in the obliquity of their hearts . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of his ways . They give a preference to other objects . This is the core of the difficulty , and the essence of their guilt as every man 's conscience instinctively testifies . So it must be , if the motive crown the action , and if actions derive their qualities from principles . We come back , therefore , to the same conclusion as before , that strictly speaking both virtue and vice are found in the heart that is , in those dispositions , choices and feelings which lie at the bottom of every deliberate act of the will . We call the deliberate act virtuous or vicious , as the case may be and so we do the external action which proceeds from it but we al- /z/ ways have reference to the motive or principle which gave birth to the act , and which occasioned it to be as it is , and not otherwise . Show us the motive or feeling which has influenced or governed the mind , in any particular case , and we can show you the character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the actor , for in this very motive or feeling his blame or praise worthiness lies . Nor need this view of the subject create any difficulty on the score of moral agency and accountability . Our affections are as much our exercises , and the exercises of our will , as our deliberate choices or volitions , and altogether as much the immediate and proper subject of command . Nay , a regard to them is had in every command which God gives , while his law is summed up in two great precepts , immediately addressed to our hearts . " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God , with all thy heart , soul , mind and strength , and thy neighbor as thyself . " Such is the frame and constitution of our minds , that we immediately recognize the fitness of this command the moment we perceive its import . We stop not to inquire whether there be any process , and if so , what it is , which is necessary to bring into exercise the required affections . We perceive at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them without delay ; and conscience condemns us for the slightest failure . The operations of our minds upon this subject are exceedingly simple ; we no sooner know what the demand of the law is , than we feel ourselves instantly bound to obey , and guilty if we do not obey . " He that knoweth to do good , and doth it not , to him it is sin , " says the Apostle . But to love God , and our neighbor is , doubtless , one of the forms of doing good , that is , of doing right , as the expression may be understood . And no other facts or circumstances need to be known , than that thus to love is our duty , to bring us under immediate obligation to obey . So we reason and judge on every other subject of obligation . /z/ Were we to see a man who felt no interest in the welfare of his country , but was willing to sacrifice its happiness to the objects of his private ambition , we should instantly condemn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract him in the virtuous deeds and sacrifices of a Washington , we should cry out upon him as a wretch . Because we feel that he ought to love and venerate the father of his country , and with a warmth and sincerity correspondent to his dignity and worth . Not to do this would , in our estimation , be infamy . In all such cases we connect the obligation with the simple fact of knowing what is justly expected and required . But some may be ready to ask , how can I be responsible for my affections , unless I can control them , directly or indirectly , by some previous act of my will ? and I ask in return , how can I be responsible for such previous act of my will , unless I can control that , by some other previous act ? Will it be said that I chose to have that act of my will as it was , and not otherwise , and therefore I am responsible for it ? Then I chose to choose it seems and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody , at this day , will resort to such an absurdity . The truth is , that in every exercise of the will , the agent acts freely ; and his act is to be judged of by its own nature . If it be a deliberate act , we decide upon its character , so far as it has any , by the principle or motive which governed it . If it be an immanent act , it is , nevertheless , a free act , arising spontaneously in view of its object ; and if it be of a moral character , this character is to be determined by comparing it with the law of duty . If it be such as the law requires , it is good and praiseworthy ; and if it be otherwise , it is evil . It is simply the nature of the exercise , which we look at ; and this we judge of , by the exercise being conformed , or not conformed , to the law ; nor does it make any difference , whether the law be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of nature , or whether it be revealed . The moment we perceive a law , which we recognize as a law of duty , we perceive ourselves to be bound by it ( for these perceptions properly involve each other ) : of course we can not fail to approve or condemn ourselves , as we yield , or do not yield , to the demands of the law . This is the natural result of our constitution ; and to use President Edward 's language , " is the sum total of the matter . " We never go about to inquire what is the cause of our moral affections being as they are , or whether they have any cause , aside from our own powers and susceptibilities , and the objects which act upon them . We know that these affections are our exercises , and not another 's the development of our own powers . In other words , we perceive that it is we ourselves , that love or hate , hope or fear , as the case may be , and that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they correspond with , or violate the Divine law . This is all we perceive , or are conscious of , and if we suppose something farther , we do but deceive ourselves , by traveling into the region of imagination or conjecture . But I hear it asked , do not men naturally suppose , when they have had wrong feelings or emotions , that they might have had other , and different feelings , if they had been so disposed , or if they had pleased ? and is it not upon this ground that they condemn themselves for the feelings which they had ? That men sometimes have confused thoughts upon this subject , there is no doubt ; but that they have had such thoughts as the inquirer supposes , we can by no means concede unless they greatly mistake the facts in the case . There is an absurdity on the very face of the supposition , that they might have had different feelings or emotions , if they had been so disposed , for what is it to be so disposed , but to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as to say that they might have had different feelings , if they had had different feelings . Nor does the supposition that they might have had different feelings if they had pleased , afford a sense , less fraught with error or absurdity . It implies that they might have had other feelings and emotions , if they had desired , or chosen them . But feelings or emotions never arise in consequence of being desired or chosen , but spontaneously , in view of their appropriate objects ; and besides , if they were desired or chosen , they were desired or chosen for some end ; and what is that end ? If you say it was their own agreeableness or pleasingness to the mind then they were possessed already , and did not arise in consequence of being chosen . If you say it was for some other end , the choice would be unavailing , as it neither involves them nor produces them . Produce them , it can not , according to any law of mind known or admitted by any respectable writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have wrong feelings , and they are conscious of the wrong , they judge of it by the nature of these feelings as compared with the rule of duty . Come how they will , come whence they will , they intuitively perceive them to be wrong wrong in themselves apart from the circumstances which preceded or attended them . True it is , other things may be perceived at the same time . We may perceive that one wrong feeling has indirectly contributed to another , or that the absence of right feelings has been the occasion of wrong ones ; still it is manifest that both the right and the wrong can be measured and determined only by the acknowledged rule of duty . The feeling must be compared with the rule ; and this done , all is done which is necessary to show its agreement , or disagreement , with the rule , and to fix in the mind an unwavering conviction of its good or ill desert . The perception of the rule /z/ is a perception of obligation ; and the perception of conformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or evil . NOTE A. But some may suppose that this writer makes moral evil to consist in two things , and not in one ; namely , in a man 's doing wrong , when he does as he pleases , and his pleasure 's being wrong ; or , in other words , in having his heart wrong , and doing wrong from his heart : and by the same rule , that virtue must consist in two things in a man 's having his heart right , and doing right from his heart He admits , indeed , that such are the common notions of mankind , who do not always carefully separate their conceptions on this subject . There are certain actions , overt actions , which they esteem right or wrong , but not as separate from the deliberate choice of the mind from which they proceeded . These actions must be voluntary in their judgment , or they would be neither blame nor praiseworthy : of course , their moral character , so far as they have any , must be derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come to inquire into the character of this choice , which they pronounce either good or bad , they take into view the principle or motive from which it originates . It is a good choice , or a bad choice , as it was moved or excited by a good or bad feeling . This alone marks its intent or design ; and on this the mind fixes as that which is essential to its moral character . If the intent be good , the choice was good ; if the intent be evil , the choice was evil . And though the vulgar do not ordinarily separate their conceptions in this manner , yet they show , by their language , in a thousand forms , that they have such conceptions ; and that they trace all moral good or evil up to the heart , or the state of the affections ; and that , in their judgment , there is neither virtue nor vice apart from these . That this was the sentiment of Edwards himself , there can be no doubt , since he repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives character to the man ; and since it is one of his cardinal points , " that principles do not derive their goodness from actions , but actions from principles , " while he expressly declares that a good choice is no farther good than the disposition from which it flows . /z/ IN our examination of the Divine decrees , we have seen that they are necessarily universal , reaching alike to all beings and events , and through all time ; that in the order of nature , they precede whatsoever comes to pass through the agency of God , whether that agency be exerted either more immediately or remotely . The works of God are , of course , the development of his decrees , and may be comprehended under two grand divisions the works of creation , and the works of providence . Nothing which God does , or in any way causes to be done , but may be included under one or the other of these divisions . As to the work of creation , it has been denned , " God 's making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , in the space of six days , and all very good . " No objection can be taken to this definition , if it is intended to comprehend the whole of God 's work , in giving birth to materials , as well as in giving form , for it is manifest that animals and vegetables were created from matter already in existence . The original word K-O to create , as well as its kindred forms , is used with considerable latitude in the Scriptures , as may be seen by referring to Lexicographers . /z/ According to Parkhurst , this word denotes the production of either substance or form the creation , or accretion of substance or matter . ( 1 . ) He gives it the sense of creating , or producing into being , Genesis , i. 1 , where it is said , " In the beginning , God created the heavens and the earth . " This can not relate to form , he remarks , because it follows in the next verse , that the earth was without form , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the twentyseventh verse , where man is said to be made in the image of God , because this had respect to the spiritual and immortal part of man . ( 2 . ) He gives it the sense of forming by an accretion or concretion of matter , Genesis , i. 21 , where God is said to create the monsters of the deep . ( 3 . ) A third sense which he ascribes to it , is to perform somewhat that is wonderful , or extraordinary to make , as it were , a new creation ; Numbers , xvi . 30 : " But if God create a creation " that is , " if he shall work an unprecedented miracle . " * * * See also , Exodus , xxxiv. 10 , and Jeremiah , xxxi. 22. ( 4 . ) He gives this word the sense , also , of renewing , or making anew ; of preparing and adorning , which shows that the sacred writers have used it with considerable variety of meaning . Gesenius gives much the same account as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remarks , is to hew , or hew out ; and that in some of its forms , it is used to signify being born . He allows it the sense of smooth , and to make smooth , but more commonly to form , or to make , though he says nothing as to the mode of forming , whether with , or without , pre-existing materials . Pictet has endeavored to show that there are only two senses in which the word create can be understood strictly and properly ; the one , when it describes that work of God by which he drew something from nothing , /z/ and the other , when it marks that operation by which God makes a thing different from what it was before and where there was no previous disposition to the change . It is a marvelous thing , he remarks , that a small nut should produce a great tree nevertheless , because the nut contains the semen or germ of the tree , we do not call this a creation , but a generation . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a creation . It is a thing which surpasses the powers of nature , and there is none but God , who could , of stones , raise up children to Abraham . In the last sense , he supposes it is said that God created man of the dust of the earth , and that he formed Eve from one of Adam 's ribs . For neither the dust nor the rib was naturally capable of receiving the form which God subsequently gave . There was here no germ , no previous disposition to the change which was produced ; no such preparation as nature demands in her subjects , when she would exhibit them in a new form . Whence it would appear , that no less power is required in this second kind of creation , than in the first ; and that both demand a power which is infinite/ ' Such works we cheerfully concede , are properly denominated a creation , and clearly indicate a power no less than infinite . But we see no reason for limiting the word create , or creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scriptures , nor in the customary forms of speech , is the term thus limited . Not unfrequently is it used by the sacred writers to express God 's works of providence , where no extraordinary change is produced , but only such modification , or disposition of things , as occur in a regular train of his operations . At the same time , it is not ; to be doubted , that it is sometimes used to signify the production of something out of nothing , or giving existence where previously there was none . It has this meaning , most obviously , when Moses says , " In the beginning God /z/ created the heavens and the earth , and the earth was without form , and void . " ( Genesis , i. 1 . ) Here we are directed not only to the cause , but to the beginning of things ; not to that state which they afterwards assumed under the forming hand of their Creator , when the work was complete , but to the bringing into existence the first principles of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several forms of organized being were fashioned by the Almighty . Other passages of Scripture point us to the same fact , no less obviously , though not perhaps with the same clearness and precision . When St. John says , " In the beginning was the word , or the Xoyo ; the word was with God , and the word was God . All things were made by him , and without him was not anything made that was made , " he plainly carries us up to the same high original of created existence , as Moses had done before him . The Xoyos who was in the beginning with God , is spoken of as the immediate and efficient cause of all things that were made , or began to be . Paul , also , in distinctly ascribing to Christ the creation of all things in heaven and earth , whether they be visible , or invisible , clearly indicates a production from nothing . He declares , moreover , " that Christ was before all things , and that by him all things consist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of things , would not only be an unreasonable limitation of the Apostle 's meaning , but would suppose a sense which could have no application to the invisible part of Christ 's workmanship , to wit , his creation of angels , as is commonly understood by thrones , dominions , principalities and powers . Besides , how could Christ be before all things , if some things existed antecedent to his creative act , and existed as the materials upon which his power was exerted ? That the Apostle intended to speak of a creation from /z/ non-entity is the more probable , from the language which he holds upon this subject in the llth of Hebrews . " Through faith/ ' says he , " we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God : so that things which are seen , were not made of things which do appear . " What then were they made of ? ( it might naturally be demanded . ) Not of pre-existent matter : for that belongs to things which do appear . His language naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or material things of things which are material ; but arose into existence at the sovereign command of God , and arose out of nothing . The Word of God is given as the only source of the mighty fabric of the universe . In this , the Apostle evidently opposed himself to the philosophers of that period , who held either that the world was eternal , or was formed out of materials which had no beginning ; and his opposition consists not only in stating the fact to be different from what they had supposed but the way in which we come to the knowledge of that fact . " By faith , " saith he , " we understand that the worlds were made by the word of God . " Reason might trace the operation of the Divine hand in the visible frame of the universe ; but reason alone would never rise to the sublime notion that God spake the universe into existence from nothing . This is too mighty an idea for the human mind to excogitate , by its own unassisted powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing which more astonishes us , or baffles our conceptions , the moment we attempt to meditate upon it . That something should be produced from nothing that the universe of creatures , whether they be visible or invisible , should rise up at the call of the Almighty , and stand forth in all their majesty and glory , is not only the miracle of miracles , but the greatest of all mysteries . Still , this is no reason why we should doubt the fact . The Bible asserts it , and reason legiti- /z/ mately exercised , coincides with the Bible . As to the modus operandi , it plainly lies beyond the reach of our faculties ; but this is true , also , with respect to causation universally : we see the changes that are produced , and the order in which they occur ; but we know not how they are produced . A total darkness here rests upon all the works of God . In the fact of creation , we are apt to stumble at the thought , that it should arise out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , we know not how it could be otherwise . What materials were there , out of which to form the universe , till the Almighty had created them to his hand ? Matter , surely , could not be eternal , unless we allow it a necessary existence , contrary to all just reasoning from its known qualities and attributes . And as to the spirit , though eternal , as it exists in the Deity , yet since it would be absurd to suppose that his all-perfect Being is capable of division , multiplication or change , we are left to conclude thatother spirits , if they exist , must exist by creation , no less than matter , and by creation , as absolutely from nothing . To suppose otherwise , would be to suppose some change in the substance of the Deity , or at least , a division of that substance , since out of it , according to this hypothesis , other spirits were formed . Allowing then , that God has created something out of nothing , still it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of considering it as being or substance , and either matter or mind . But what evidence of this ? May it not be some property or attribute , or merely an assemblage of these ? It is plain it must be something distinct from God , or it could not be anything created , unless creation consists in a mere modification of Deity . Hence philosophers and divines who have admitted a creation at all I mean a creation from nothing have , with one voice , allowed it to be something ad extra in relation to God ; something without or /z/ aside from him ; not in its origin , but in its result ; something which is not God , neither his substance , nor his attributes , nor an exercise of these ; but the fruit or effect of his creative energy . But if that which is created be something distinct from God , it can not be a mere property or attribute , unless we can suppose a property without a subject , or an attribute which is the attribute of nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties ; for the absurdity of a property without a subject , or an attribute without a substance to which it belongs , is in no degree lessened by supposing an assemblage of these , or many instead of one . We are aware , indeed , that a few modern philosophers have adopted a different sentiment , and have defined matter to be nothing but an assemblage of properties or qualities , and mind only a union of perceptions , or a series of exercises , which has neither principle nor foundation , except the immediate agency of God . In short , that neither matter nor mind is anything distinct from its properties ; and that these are nothing but God 's action ; and hence , all the known properties of bodies , if not of mind , are regarded as the steady laws of Divine operation . We can not think that such a doctrine will ever become universal , as it seems to stand opposed to some of the radical principles of our constitution . Men will not soon be reasoned out of a conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an external world . We take it to be a principle as certain as any of the axioms on which our reasonings are grounded , that every property lias a subject to which it belongs ; and that we can no more avoid this reference in our thoughts , however ignorant we may be of the nature of the subject , than we can avoid the conclusion , that every act implies an agent , whose act it is , and every feeling and perception , some being who feels and perceives . This is surely the natural /z/ train of our thoughts , if it be not one of their unchangeable laws ; and under its influence it is , that Christian philosophers and divines , of every age , have , with few exceptions , adopted the opinion , that creation is a work , or something done , and not a mere energy ; and that that which is created is properly a being or substance , and is either matter or mind . This is the view which Paul appeared to take of the subject , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but he that built all things is God . " He speaks of some things being done , not merely as a change or an event which should leave no trace of its existence behind , but as a work which stands forth as the mighty monument of the power which accomplished it . Such , as it appears to us , is the plain , common-sense notion of the case , as the principles of all languages testify , and as the Word of God abundantly confirms . " God spake , and it was done ; he commanded , and it stood fast . " But what stood fast ? unless it were the work of his own hands , something which had a positive and continued existence ? He made heaven , earth , air , sea , and all that is therein , everything after its kind , and every living thing with power to propagate its kind ; and the language employed in this statement , can obviously convey to the common mind no other idea , than that these were so many separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their varied attributes , qualities and powers . But philosophers are not to be taken by the snare which catches the vulgar . They have a much deeper insight into things . The Word of God was not designed to instruct in the principles of a deep and recondite philosophy ; but with higher and more spiritual views , accommodates its statements to the notions and apprehensions of the unlettered multitude . Though it speak , therefore , of God , men , angels , devils , things visible and things invisible , as having a distinct and positive ex-/z/ istence , accompanied with various qualities and attributes , it is no argument that there is in reality any such existence , separate from attributes , properties , qualities and powers . These , after all , may be the sum of created being , if not the sum of uncreated being . Let us resort , then , to principles independent of the Bible , and try the question on the ground of human reason . And here the first inquiry is , whether every man , be he philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has a distinct individual existence ; or that he is a person in the ordinary sense of the term , possessed of certain attributes and powers ? and not that he is a series of acts , or an assemblage of attributes ? I am inclined to think , if he will allow himself to answer , all prejudice and system apart , that he will frankly confess that he can not persuade himself that he is not himself , although this self appears to be a strange indefinable thing . In other w T ords , that he is conscious of a distinct personality , or , if you like the phrase better , that he believes himself to be a person , having the realities and properties of being , altogether as truly , though not as independently , as God who created him . This person he always denotes by the term I a person sufficiently dear to him , and whose opinions and interests he is never backward to cherish . And as he thus firmly believed in his own identity so he has substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly speaks of them , whatever may be his philosophy , as having a real , positive existence , to which he attributes involuntarily certain properties and powers . He can no more divest himself of the idea that they are persons , or beings , in the strict sense of the terms , and not mere qualities , properties , or events than he can divest himself of the belief that they have any existence at all . He may deny their distinct individuality , or profess his doubts concerning it ; but every moment he acts upon /z/ the belief that they are persons , having personal properties , or powers . There is not a man that lives , who does not form all his plans , and shape his whole course of action under the influence of this inwrought and unchangeable belief . The same remarks apply with undiminished force to the belief of an external world in general . Such a belief all men have a belief in things without , as having a positive and continued existence , in distinction from their own ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powers . Nor is this belief like that which is sometimes occasioned by the illusion of our senses , which may be corrected by more careful inquiry . It goes deep into the very constitution of the mind , and can neither be shaken off nor corrected by all the art and ingenuity of philosophical investigation . And well for us is it that it can not ; for the preservation of our being depends upon it , and perhaps , too , all our moral distinctions and our consequent accountability . Certainly , it would seem that we could not discriminate between man and man , nor pass any judgment upon ourselves , without presupposing our belief in personal identity or , which is the same thing , in the personal existence of a being , aside from his character or his qualities . And yet what identity can there be , in mind at least , if the subject and its properties , or mind and its operations , be not distinct ? Bishop Berkeley himself was well aware of this ; and therefore , though he denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , contended for the existence of mind , as a substance distinct from its qualities , powers , or operations . The same is the case with Kirwan , the zealous and able defender of Berkeley . He insists that the mind , though known only by its properties and powers , is nevertheless a being or substance distinct from its phenomena , and introduces Mr. Merian , one of the ablest metaphysicians of his age , /z/ as replying to Mr. Hume in the following manner . The extract is taken from the Memoirs of Berlin for 1793 . " According to Mr. Hume/ ' says this able writer , " we are nothing but an aggregate of phenomena . Now I ask if a phenomenon can exist without being perceived ? If not , I ask who perceives it ? To this question there are but three possible answers : either it is perceived by itself , or by some other phenomenon , or by something that is not a phenomenon . Now , a phenomenon perceiving itself , would be strange indeed : sounds hearing themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could be no comparison of the phenomena , nor consequently any judgment founded on such comparison . Secondly , to say that phenomena can perceive other phenomena is still , if possible , more absurd ; for instance , smells hearing sounds , sounds seeing colors. * * * Therefore , thirdly , there must be a subject or substratum of these perceptions , of which they are modifications . Moreover , sensations of one sort are often compared with sensations of another sort , as those of sight with those of hearing . Now , can vision judge of hearing 1 or colors judge of sounds ? May we not have two simultaneous sensations contrary to each other ? May we not feel extreme heat in one hand , and extreme cold in the other ? Can then two contrary sensations coexist without any subject ? But it were idle to pursue this matter farther . " I own this argument strikes me powerfully ; and if it stood alone , it would convince me that a subject and its properties are distinct things , and that the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand alone . We have a deep-seated belief , I have already remarked , in our own personal existence , and in that of others , aside from our qualities , actions , or powers a belief which prevails with undiminished strength , at all times and places , while reason itself is prolonged . /z/ But whence the origin of this belief ? Can it rationally be ascribed to anything but the forming hand of our Creator , who has deeply engraven it upon the inmost folds of the mind ? Has he laid us under a necessity , then , of believing what is not true ? or shall we admit the correctness of these primary and immovable impressions ? To me it appears dangerous to call in question such original and invariable dictates of the human mind ; for if we may be wrong here , who knows that we are right anywhere ? What security can we have for virtue ? or to what tribunal shall we make our appeal even for its very existence ? How can we be certain that there is a God ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that they are not self-existent , and could not come into being without a cause ; but this sentiment , that nothing can exist without a cause , is neither more original , more uniform , nor more stable , than the belief we have in our own personal existence , as the subject of properties , qualities and powers . Call this belief an illusion , and who shall confirm us in the correctness of the other sentiment ? But there is little danger , after all . Nature is true to her purpose ; and men , though they may profess their scepticism , will continue to believe in their own existence , and in an external world . They will think that mind is something , and matter something ; and though each is known only by its properties , still they can not fail to believe that both exist , as the subject of the properties which they severally display . /z/ GOD , says an eloquent writer , is a sun , whose brightness our eyes can not behold ; whose transcendent light blinds us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being dazzled and confounded . But this sun presents itself to us in a mirror ; this mirror is the universe , where God has exhibited to us an admirable portrait of his perfections . And to this Paul alludes , when he says , " that the invisible things of God , even his eternal power and majesty , are clearly seen by the things that are made . " In our remarks , previously submitted , on the subject of Creation , we endeavored to make it appear that that which was created , was something distinct from God , and was neither his substance nor his attributes , nor an exercise of these ; but something ad extra in relation to him a work or creature of God . That if this something was distinct from God , it could not be a mere property or attribute , nor an assemblage of these , but a being or substance of which properties and attributes could be affirmed . To suppose an attribute without a substance , or a property without a subject , we considered as involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an agent , or a feeling or perception without some being that feels or perceives . /z/ We attempted to confirm our views , not only by a reference to the common principles of all languages , and to the forms of speech employed in the Bible , but by an argument drawn from the belief which every man has in his own personal identity , and in that of his fellowmen a belief which compels him to admit that he is a person , or being , the subject of properties , qualities or powers . And we attempted to show , farther , that this primary and deep-seated belief was a law of our constitution , as original and as stable as any of the first principles upon which our reasonings are grounded , and that if we called this in question , we had no sure footing for any of our principles or reasonings whatsoever ; they having no higher authority than the original and primary feelings of our own minds . We now raise another question , closely connected with the foregoing discussion , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every property implies a subject , and every attribute a substance , is the converse or counterpart of this true , that every subject implies a property , and every substance an attribute of some kind ? or which comes to the same thing , that every created existence is necessarily , and from the mere fact of its creation , possessed of certain properties , qualities or powers ? That every created being has certain relations to its Creator , is just as certain as that it has any existence ; and if there are other beings , that it bears corresponding relations to them . To suppose otherwise , would be to suppose that two lines might be drawn in the universe , and yet be neither parallel nor angular in regard to each other . That every substance has some property involved in its existence , is a proposition we should think no less evident . For it is just as inconceivable that there should be substances without properties , as properties without /z/ substances , or either without relations . Take away every supposable property from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without solidity or extension , without attraction , repulsion , or any other property cognizable by the senses ? What is mind without sensation , perception or reflection without memory , will or desire ? Strip it of its qualities , and you strip it of its being ; because it seems as impossible that it should exist without these , as that it should exist and not exist at the same time . A substance and its properties , at least those which are primary , mutually involve each other , just as a substance and its relations . But relations , it may be said , have no real or positive existence . They are only modes of being , or the abstract notions we form of substances in regard to each other , or in regard to something which we suppose to exist ; out of our minds , they have no existence at all . It is a fact , nevertheless , that we necessarily form these notions as often as the related substances are presented . Two tennis balls are placed upon the table . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or contiguity , of equality or inequality , are perceived . That is to say , these substances excite in my mind such ideas of relation , or , they thus affect me ; and because they thus affect me , I believe and pronounce them to be thus related . And I believe , moreover , that while the substances in all respects remain the same , and their position and other circumstances the same , these relations will be the same . Nor does it make any difference in my belief , whether it be supposed that these ideas of relation were excited in my mind by the immediate agency of God , or by the tennis balls themselves . I firmly believe that these relations exist , and that they will continue to exist , unless some change shall take place in the organization or position of the substances related . The relations are seen /z/ to be inevitable upon the supposition of the substances , nor can I be made to believe that they depend in any measure upon my perceiving them . The fact of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth which nothing can destroy just as it is a truth that the opposite sides of a parallelogram must forever remain equal while the figure is preserved . With the same certainty , if not for the same reason , will the properties of a substance stand connected with the substance . The existence of the substance involves the existence of the properties certainly of those which are essential . A particle of matter , for instance , would be just what it is , and its properties or powers in relation to the material system just what they are , if there were no perceiving eye to observe them . They necessarily coexist and imply each other , though in a different way the one as a subject , and the other as the property belonging to the subject . Whether the properties of any substance are to be regarded simply as its relations , we undertake not now to determine ; we merely assert as a fact , that the one can not exist where the other does not exist . This we think must be true , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the properties inhere , or the system of Brown , which affirms that the properties of substances are but the substances themselves . The latter scheme supposes that there is nothing in the universe but substances , and that what w r e call their properties and powers are mere abstract notions of the relations which the substances bear to each other in the changes which take place among them , and the order in which the changes occur . Fire has the property of melting metals water the property of melting salt that is , these changes occur when the substances concerned come into contact with each other , and in circumstances in which , according to the laws of their being , such changes are known to fol- /z/ low . In these cases , we remark the relation of antecedent and consequent , or of cause and effect , while the changes that take place in consequence of this relation , indicate the properties or powers of the bodies that are thus related . Still , this philosopher maintains that there is here no real positive existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the one case , and the water and the salt in the other . If there is any positive existence besides , what and where is it ? Does it lie in the changes which have occurred ? They are obviously nothing but a modification of what existed before . Does it lie in the mere susceptibility of change ? This is only the relation which one substance bears to another , which in given circumstances effects a change in it , as its antecedent or its cause . Thus , for example , salt has the susceptibility of being melted ; but it is only in relation to the water , which is said to have the power of melting it . It has not this susceptibility absolutely , nor in relation to other bodies , which never produce the specified change . True it is that the salt and the water must be brought together , or the liquefaction will not follow ; but this is only a change in position , and adds nothing to the existence of either body . There is no circumstance connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a relation which the salt has to the water that dissolves it . How then is it , with respect to the power of producing change ? The water in which this power is supposed to be lodged , is said to melt the salt . What is there here , the abettor of this philosophy would ask , but the naked substance ? Do you say the power of melting the salt ? Truly , he would reply but what is power 1 Is it any positive existence in rerum natura ? or is it expressive only of the fact , that there will be a change in the salt , on the application of water ? What more is there in or about the process , except it be our belief in the invaria- /z/ bleness of the sequence ? or the certainty of the result ? Is anything else known , can anything else be conceived ? If this be a fair statement of the case , ( but whether it be so or not , it is not our intention to affirm , ) it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither more nor less than invariabkness of antecedence , in relation to some change which takes place , as its invariable consequence ; and therefore , in this respect , like susceptibility , merely marks a certain relation which one substance has to another , in the changes which occur in the regular order of events . Should this be admitted a correct view of the phenomena of nature , it can not be doubted , for a moment , that the powers , properties and qualities of substances , whether spiritual or material , are inseparable from the substances themselves ; that if the substances exist , their properties and powers will exist ( we speak of those which are essential ) ; and to annihilate the latter , you must annihilate the former . The reason is , according to the present hypothesis , they are not so properly different things , as the same things , under different aspects ; the whole of created existence being only the substances which God has made , and their properties and powers nothing more than the relations which these substances bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them . We do not avow our belief of the entire correctness of this system ; but if it fail , we are fully convinced that it does not fail in the article of showing , that wherever there are substances , there will inevitably be properties or powers , as an inseparable adjunct of their being ; and that the mystery in this case , if mystery there be , lies not in the fact , that substances should have properties or powers , and thus accomplish something , but in the mere fact of their existence . Let this system , then , be sustained , or otherwise it will make no difference in the question before us ; for if any /z/ created substance exist , it is inconceivable that it should not involve powers and susceptibilities of some kind ; for that which affects nothing , and is affected by nothing , most surely is nothing . There is no escape from this conclusion , unless it could be shown that the property of a thing is something different from the power of a thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a power to affect something , or to be affected by something . Let any man settle in his own mind distinctly , what he means by properties , qualities , or powers , and how he comes to know that they are predicable of any particular substance , whether matter or mind , and he will perceive at once that he can form no idea of an inefficacious property or a powerless power ; but that in every case where he admits the existence of a property , he admits it either as the cause or the susceptibility of change . One or the other it must be ; and when considered actively , it is always regarded as a cause . Be it so , says an objector ; but who knows that there is any substance in the case ? Why may not properties be all ? It is these alone we perceive ; and why resort to a substance in which they inhere ? Can we prove the existence of any such substance ? Why not believe that properties or powers compose the whole of created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we neither do , nor can believe , that they compose the whole of uncreated being . We believe that God is a substance , a Being , a Person , and that he is possessed of certain attributes or powers . So he is revealed to us , and such our minds , unsophisticated by the subtleties of reasoning , naturally conceive him to be . Atheistical philosophers have indeed propounded the abstract theory of a God , without any unity of perception , will , or design ; or rather they have denied the existence of God , and substituted in his stead a /z/ mere principle , or efficacy . But I know of no Christian divines who ever went to this length . They have sometimes supposed that the Divine attributes were resolvable into the Divine essence , or that attributes , as they exist in God , and apart from our view , are not distinguishable from his essence . But they have never changed the tables , and denied his essence , as an Uncreated Being . Yet why might not this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound one that we know nothing of essences or substances , aside from qualities or attributes , or in distinction from them , and therefore that the former have no claim to be the object of our belief ? Surely , we know nothing of God 's essence , but from the exhibition of his attributes or powers ; yet from these we infer the reality of his Being . We see everywhere in his works , the marks of design , if nothing else ; and our reason teaches us , that that which contrives and has design , is not a mere principle , but a person . " These capacities/ ' says Dr. Paley , " constitute personality , for they imply consciousness and thought . They require that which can perceive an end , or purpose as well as the power of providing means and directing them to their end . They require a centre , in which perceptions unite , and from which volitions flow , which is mind . The acts of a mind prove the existence of a mind ; and in whatever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a person . " We shall probably not demur to this reasoning when applied to God . Why should we hesitate , when it is applied to the creatures of God ? If the exhibition of his attributes carry us to the belief of his existence , why should not the exhibition of their attributes carry us to the belief of their existence ? the properties of mind convincing us of mind , and the properties of matter convincing us of matter . No reason can be assigned why the conclusion should be admitted in the one case , and not in the other . Nor do I imagine that there is any /z/ doubt as to the reality of the fact ; for whether we will or not , our belief is permanently fixed on this great subject , as every man 's actions plainly demonstrate . It is a law of our constitution , to believe a subject where we find a property , and a property where we find a subject . The only legitimate conclusion , then , to be drawn from the necessary coexistence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that maintained by Brown that substances and their powers are not so properly different things , as the same things under different aspects , namely , the substances and their relations ; or , the more ancient and common doctrine , that though the essence of a thing is to be distinguished from the properties of a thing , or from its modes , yet , in the nature of things , they are inseparable so that one can not exist without the other , nor be destroyed without destroying the other . Give existence , then , and you give relations give existence and you give properties and powers , which will continue as long as the existence itself continues , unmodified and undiminished in their energy , till some change takes place in the substance to which they belong , or in the relations which it bears to other substances . ( See note A. ) This , so far as I have been able to collect , was the current doctrine , both of philosophers and of the vulgar , antecedent to the days of Descartes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been entangled by the dogmas of a subtle philosophy . On this sentiment has been founded the doctrine of second causes , through the medium of which it has been supposed that God governs the world . To me it appears impossible to showjiiat there are any such things as second causes or means in the universe , without admitting that the properties and powers of a being are inseparable from its existence . For it is only /z/ by its properties or powers that it does anything , or makes itself known . If it does nothing , it surely does not affect me ; if it does not affect me , how can I know that it exists ? This simple statement might seem to settle the question forever . But when the mind gets involved with other speculations it finds a resort in words and forms of expression , which seem incapable , to say the least , of any clear definition . Hence , it is sometimes L replied to the foregoing statement , that though a second cause ( the light for instance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is made to do it by the power of the Deity . It is a mean in God 's hands of accomplishing what it seems to accomplish . Certainly we shall admit that it is a mean in God 's hands ; because it derived its being and powers , whatever they are , from God , and both are continued at his pleasure . But has it been well considered what is implied in its being a mean in God 's hands ? If it has no power how can it be a mean ? Can either God or man work by a mean which is absolutely powerless ? Is not the supposition wholly inconceivable ? Try this question in your own minds , and see if you can find a case w T here an instrument absolutely powerless can be employed ? Nay , try another question . See if you can tell what a mean or instrument is stripped of all power . Let it bejire , earth y air , water , no matter what . Strip it of all power , or , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then tell us what it is . Perhaps , however , when it is said that means have no power in themselves , all that is meant is , that they have no power to accomplish the particular end for which they are employed as a mean , and not that they have no power in any respect ; for , in that case , it would seem that their use would be impossible , and it could not be known that they existed . But why , let me ask , should /z/ it be supposed , that they have no power in themselves , in this particular case , more than in any other case , where their properties or powers are displayed ? If they are powerless in this connection , why not in every other ? or if they exert an influence anywhere , why not here ? If , in the supposed case , they have no fitness nor tendency to accomplish the effect , where is the wisdom of employing them , and what is their use ? What do they actually do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made on the subject . The first is , that they really produce the effect which they seem to produce . The second is , that they accomplish nothing , but the effect proceeds wholly from the power of God , immediately exerted ; and the third is , that the effect proceeds partly from the immediate agency of God , and partly from the intrinsic force of the means . If the first or last supposition be true , means in themselves have some power , and do actually accomplish something . But if the second supposition contain the truth , then means are indeed powerless , and as powerless when employed as when unemployed ; for no part of the effect is attributable to them ; and if , in all other connections , they were equally inefficacious , it could not be known that they existed , except by special revelation . Besides , in this supposition , can anybody tell what is meant by the use of means ? If they really accomplish nothing , and in their own nature are fitted to accomplish nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumentality ? Nothing is done through their agency ; for it is plain they have no agency , the whole effect proceeding entirely from the immediate exertion of the Divine Power . On this supposition , too , what becomes of the Divine wisdom , which is generally thought to appear in a wonderful adaptation of means to their ends ? If means , in fact , accomplish nothing , they are fitted to accomplish nothing , and all wisdom ceases in their appli- /z/ cation , there being just as much connection between the breath of a musquetoe and the falling of a tree , or the existence of an oyster and the production of a poem , as between the best-adapted means and their end : that is to say , there is no instrumental or causal connection whatever ; all is done by the immediate and positive efficiency of God . But is this a fair statement of the argument ? It is not admitted , it will be said , that means are absolutely powerless when employed ; they are so only in themselves , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have power ; for God gives them a power . Tell us , then , what is meant by God 's giving them a power . Does he impart to them a quality which they had not before ? so that it is now their quality or power , and not his ? If this be the fact , then in truth they do something , and something in and by themselves . But if God imparts to them this power the moment they are employed , what objection can there be to his having imparted it to them before , and to his having lodged it in the very constitution of their being ? On the other hand , if he does not impart to them any new and distinct quality or power , and cause it to become theirs , not his , then this power is but his after all , and not theirs , and they are equally powerless as before ; then , also , it is his agency which is exerted , and not theirs , and the effect is solely to be attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive agent in the case . Thus we arrive at the same conclusion as in a former part of the argument , and with augmented conviction that it is the legitimate result of well-grounded premises . The whole subject , however , may be set in a still stronger light , by adverting to this general , but obvious alternative that what we call the properties or powers of created beings are , universally , either the properties and powers of such beings , or they are the mere action /z/ or agency of God . There is here no middle ground , because what is not a creature 's power is God 's . Property , quality and power , when considered actively , ( and in this place we so consider them , ) are nothing but Brown 's immediate and invariable antecedents , or the regular producers of change . Property , quality and power , are here used for the substances in which such attributes are supposed to belong ; or , according to an older philosophy , they are simply the causes of change . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creature , or they are the powers and agency of God . If they belong to creatures , then creatures have an agency , and actually accomplish something . If they belong to God , then there is no creature agency that we know of , and consequently no creatures ; for creatures , if they exist , can be known only by their properties or agencies . If these agencies , therefore , are not theirs , but God 's , we have no evidence of the existence of creatures , but must regard creation as a nullity or a dream . Let me illustrate this by a familiar example . I suppose a cubic inch of gold lies before me . What is the proof of its existence ? Certainly nothing but its properties which act upon my senses : it affects my vision , it affects my touch . If I take it in my hand , I perceive not only its solidity and extension , but its gravity . If I throw it on the table , or on the floor , it produces sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain sensations ; whence do I learn the existence of the gold ? Why , according to the dictates of common sense , I refer my sensations to the gold , as their cause . It was that I say , which thus variously affected me . But did it thus affect me ? am I certain ? It was that , or something else , or my sensations have no cause . What am I to believe ? I can believe but one of two things that it was the gold which affected me by its own intrinsic agency , which I denomi- /z/ nate its properties or its powers or it was God . There is room for no other supposition , and no other will probably be made . It might , indeed , be said that the effect was partly owing to one of these causes , and partly to the other . But those who are chiefly concerned in this argument , will doubtless admit that my sensations were produced , either by the gold itself , or by the immediate agency of God . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have not only common sense to support me , but I have evidence of the existence of the gold , as the workmanship of God , and can judge of the nature of its existence by its properties and powers . But if I take the other side of the alternative , I give up all evidence of the gold 's existence , and regard its properties or agencies as the mere agency of God . Thus I dispose of the existence of the gold , and of all material substances universally . For since the supposed properties of matter are nothing but the agency of Deity , what is there left to constitute this substance , but an unknown substratum , whose existence our opponents in this argument stoutly deny ? A material creation is , then , out of the question ; and , by the same rules of philosophizing , an immaterial one no less . For if I allow the properties of a material substance to be nothing but the stated action of the Deity , how can I avoid the conclusion that the properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his stated action ? I know nothing of matter or of mind , but by its powers ; and if these powers are not predicable of a created substance in the one case , why should they be in the other ? or , to change the form of the argument , if the supposed properties of matter ought to be considered as the mere agency of God , what reason can be given , why the same opinion should not be adopted with respect to the properties of mind ? Most certainly this conclusion will follow , if we lay down as a principle the doctrine contended for by some , " That /z/ the immediate agency of God is universally the cause , and the proximate cause , of all the changes that occur in the material or spiritual world . For in assuming this principle , do I not assume the fact that God is the cause , and the immediate cause , of all that is done , whether in heaven or in earth , whether among things visible or invisible ? But if God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then neither matter nor mind is the cause . I mean created mind . Matter can do nothing , because what it seems to do , is done by the efficiency of the Deity , and its apparent agency is but the agency of the Deity . Created mind can do nothing , for the same reason ; because what it seems to do , is done by the immediate agency of God , and all its seeming qualities and agencies are but the exercise of the Divine power . There is no retreat from this conclusion , but by allowing a created efficiency , which is incompatible with the doctrine of God 's universal and immediate agency . What then becomes of matter and of mind ? Their properties , so far as they are efficient , are nothing but God 's agency ; and inefficient properties , we know , are no properties at all . If God 's agency , therefore , is not creature agency , there is no creature agency , nor creature itself in the universe , unless a creature can be found without properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my young brethren , but we have endeavored to reason fairly ; and if we are not mistaken in our results , it w r ill be found that there is no other alternative but to admit , that created substances are possessed of properties and powers , which are inseparable from their very being ; or that , in truth , there are no created substances ; and if no created substances , no creation and consequently that the whole system of things , if things they can be called , is only God in operation , or God in exercise . Was the late President of Yale College , then , wrong , or was he right , when he suggested that a certain /z/ portion of the Theology of this country was verging insensibly , though decidedly , towards Pantheism ? I have no hesitation in saying , that I consider such to be fact , though it is fact of which the divines concerned are by no means aware . The source of the evil seems to be , if an evil it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and not to stop where God and nature have raised an insurmountable barrier . We are possessed of very limited capacities , and must have some ultimate facts . To ascertain these is an article of importance everywhere ; but on no subject is it more imperatively demanded , than when we treat of God , and of his works , whether of creation or of providence . The work of Creation , we have previously remarked , is a great mystery ; and a mystery , I will venture to say , which in this world we shall never be able to solve . Our wisest course is to admit the fact , that there is a creation , both of things visible and invisible , and to consider well what this fact implies . We must take creatures as we find them , and judge of their nature or constitution by the qualities and powers which they exhibit ; and let no abstract reasonings concerning their dependence on God , or their connection with God , drive us from those first principles common to all our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard every creature , be it material or immaterial , as having a distinct and separate existence from the Deity , possessing properties or qualities strictly its own , and acting in its own little sphere with no less certainty from the powers it possesses , or from the constitution of its being , than the great Author of nature from whom its being was derived . There are some objections to the views which we have taken , which I would willingly notice , had I not /z/ already trespassed upon your patience . Let me , however , say one word to an objection which is much relied upon by those who do not coincide with the foregoing statements . It is asked , if creatures act from the intrinsic powers of their own being , or from the constitution of their being , if this does not render them virtually independent of God ? The argument is , if creatures may act without the immediate agency of God in them , and upon them , causing them to act , what control has God over them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from God , or , at least , counteract his will ? Our answer is , that in giving creatures their existence , God gave them such a constitution , and surrounded them with such influences , as necessarily to secure that course of action , or that precise development of their powers in every instance , as his infinite wisdom and goodness had predetermined . His decretive will , therefore , in regard to them will most certainly be executed , and with no more difficulty on this supposition than on any other . But this , perhaps , will not satisfy . It may still be said that they act independently , though they fulfill the pleasure of God . I reply , what if it were so ? What harm is there done ? Is the universe less perfect on this supposition than on any other ? or , are its results less certain or less glorious ? But I inquire , what is meant by a creature 's acting independently ? Words are of little importance , unless they are used with some definite meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting immediately upon it , to make it act ? Then I admit that the fact is so , and call upon my opponents for proof that it is otherwise . But if it is meant that the creature is not every moment in the hands of God , to be disposed of as he pleases , whether by continuing him in being , as he is , or by modifying or destroying that /z/ being , then I deny that the creature is thus independent ; for , in all these respects , he is absolutely subject to the will of his Sovereign . Or , if by the creature 's acting independently be meant that his actions are not subject to the Divine control , so that they shall be directed or modified as God pleases , this also I deny . Because , without interfering at all with the creature 's powers of action , it is perfectly easy for the Divine Being to bring him under such influences from within and without , as shall shape his course in the manner and to the end which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question : we hear a great deal about God 's controlling the actions of his creatures ; now I want to know what sense there is in this language , if creatures have no actions or agencies to control ? Is it the same thing to control an action as to create an action 1 I have not so learned English , although I am still willing to learn . When I control the actions of another , I always suppose that other capable of action , and that the influence which I exert presupposes it , and is employed in modifying the action thus controlled , either in directing to the object , or in some way bounding or limiting its influence . And I see no reason why the language should not have a like import when applied to God . When it is said of him , that the wrath of man shall praise him , and that the remainder of wrath he will restrain , it does not look much like his immediately creating that wrath ; unless to restrain a thing is the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion with the following remarks : First . That we should not be hasty in our decisions on a subject which it must be admitted is very subtle , and attended with many difficulties , and where men of the most powerful intellect have not been agreed . And Second . That we must bear with those who diflfer from /z/ us , and allow each one the full right of examining and judging for himself ; that we should do this not only with all the meekness and tenderness of Christians , but with all the candor and liberality of philosophers whose common aim should be be to encourage investigation and to advance the cause of truth . /z/ BY second causes , in this question , are intended causes which owe their existence , and consequently their powers , to the Great First Cause . Whatever be their nature or their influence , they derive all from God , and can not act but in subordination to his will . In this sense , all created existences are second causes , so far as their agency is concerned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual world . Whether they are ready and truly efficient. , effecting what they seem to effect , is the question . Two opinions on this subject have prevailed . Antecedently to the days of Descartes , Bishop Stillingfleet remarks , there was but one . Till then , all the world believed , whether philosophers or vulgar , what the great mass have done since that second causes were efficient causes , the real producers of the changes found in constant conjunction with them . Nor can it be doubted that this statement is substantially correct , since the same fact is admitted by Professor Stewart and others . We know it was the opinion of Aristotle and of Cicero , among the ancients of Bacon , Locke , Newton , Boyle , among the moderns . Even Descartes himself did not in the main depart from this long- /z/ received doctrine , though in some of his speculations he laid the foundation for a new theory . As he could not conceive how matter could act upon mind , nor created mind upon matter , he asserted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a mode in matter , but not in God . " According to Stillingfleet , he was afraid to speak out , lest he should make God the soul of the world . But not so his followers . Malebranche , and others of the same school , eagerly seizing upon this hint , presently carried their doctrine so far as to affirm that second causes have no efficiency in the production of sensation , and of course none in the changes which occur in the physical objects around us . They contended that God was the efficient cause in both cases , and , in short , the only efficient cause in the universe . This doctrine soon became prevalent throughout Europe , and , with some modification , makes a part of the metaphysical systems of Clarke , Butler and Berkeley . It is a prominent feature in the speculations of Reid , Stewart and Beattie , though the first often seems to contradict himself upon this article a circumstance the more remarkable , as he evidently made this subject a matter of much study and reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beazely has animadverted upon it in terms of unmeasured severity . " The chain of natural causes , " Dr. Reid observes , " has not unfitly been compared to a chain hanging down from heaven : a link that is discovered supports the link below it , but it must itself be supported , and that which supports it must be supported , until we come to the First Link , which is supported by the throne of the Almighty . " And the general doctrine which this comparison illustrates , if it illustrate anything , is expressed in the following sentence : " Every natural cause must have a cause , until we ascend to the First Cause , which is uncaused , and which operates not by necessity , but by /z/ will . " Here the efficiency of natural causes seems to be distinctly recognized , and the writer talks like Lord Verulam , or one of the philosophers of olden time . Were he , indeed , the advocate of the intrinsic power of second causes , I know not how he could have expressed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much to show the inconsistency of the writer , as how ready men are to relapse into plain common sense notions , in spite of their philosophy , whenever their philosophy departs from the unbiased voice of nature . The most wakeful caution is seldom sufficient to protect a man against relapses of this sort . It is not to be doubted , however , that Dr. Reid , notwithstanding these occasional aberrations from his system , was a strenuous advocate for the new theory , namely , That second causes have no power , but are to be regarded as the mere antecedents or signs of change , the efficiency never being in them , but in the immediate agency of God . The only exception which he or Professor Stewart makes to this sweeping universality , is in the case of voluntary action , where they suppose the mind acts as the immediate and direct efficient , both in the production of volition and in those mental and bodily changes which instantly follow it . Here , they say , man is an efficient cause . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God is the sole efficient . Do you ask for the proof of man 's efficiency in voluntary action ? They answer , our own consciousness ; by which they mean that such is our mental constitution , that every man is irresistibly led to refer his voluntary actions to his own inherent powers , and to regard himself as the only true and proper efficient in the case . But here Dr. Reid demurs , not being quite certain of this . We are certain only , he says , o our volition , and the consequent bodily or mental change ; we are not certain that our volition was the efficient cause of that /z/ change : it may have resulted from the immediate agency of God . He would probably limit his doctrine of creature efficiency to the single fact of volition , and contend that here , and here only , have we evidence that man is truly an agent , or an efficient cause . But why this solitary exception ? The theory would certainly be more simple , and perhaps more plausible , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others of that school , and say that " God is the immediate producer of all change , of all absolutely ; and every event in the universe is at once accounted for , and accounted for on one and the same principle ? But neither Reid nor Stewart will for a moment consent to this , because they perceive that such a doctrine would instantly sweep away every vestige of created power that is , active power and with it , according to their principles , all our notions of moral responsibility . They did well , therefore , to pause at a point which , according to them , threatened to overturn the foundations of virtue , and to set men loose from those ties which bind them as moral beings to one another , and to the throne of their Creator . But a question here may well be asked , on the score of consistency , can these writers deny the efficiency of second causes in the physical world , and maintain it in the moral ? What are the facts in the case ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antecedents and consequents , a train alike uniform and invariable , and we directly perceive nothing more . But because we can not persuade ourselves that this uniformity and invariableness take place without any ground or reason , we recognize in every change a cause , and the fact of its operation , though we remain profoundly ignorant of the modus . Nothing is seen by us in either train , but the phenomena , and the order in which they arise and though we always connect with them two things which /z/ we can not see , viz. , a subject of the phenomena and power to produce them , yet these are matters of inference , not of direct observation . But we see just as much , and infer just as much , in relation to one class of phenomena as the other . Let it be farther remarked , that there is in the human mind a sort of constitutional propensity to refer every change to its immediate and invariable antecedent as its cause , and to do this as readily and with as much confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral world , while this reference always carries with it a belief of some fitness or adaptation in the antecedent to be the cause . We may not know what this fitness or adaptation is , but we can never believe the result to be arbitrary ; for why this result rather than another ? and why any result rather than none at all ? From the very constitution of our minds , we are compelled to believe that there was some ground or reason for the change , and for the change being as it is rather than otherwise . On this principle alone is it , that we always expect the same result , where all the previous circumstances are the same . Now , if I regard the antecedent as powerless , in a train of physical changes , what reason can I assign for its not being equally powerless in a train which is moral ? Or , if I allow power or causality in the antecedent to changes which occur in mind , why not allow it in the antecedent to changes which occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental or moral antecedent be an efficient cause , why should not the material or physical antecedent be so likewise , since , to our observation , there is no difference in the facts and circumstances of the two ? In both trains , physical and moral , there is the same uniformity and invariableness of sequence , the same belief of causation attendant on every change , and the same natural or constitutional propensity to refer to the known or sup- /z/ posed antecedent , as the efficient cause of the change . And besides , if the regular antecedent , in both cases , be not that cause , we are entirely ignorant of what is . But it may be said that matter and mind are widely different substances , possessed of entirely different qualities , and therefore , that we can not argue from one to the other touching the question of their efficiency . Why not , we ask , when the question is concerning power , or the real producer of change ? We know nothing either of matter or of mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the changes which they seem to produce or undergo ; and if no change was produced , or suffered by them , we should not know that they had any qualities , or were possessed of being . To know the powers of matter , therefore ( using the term in its active sense ) , is simply to know what changes it produces , or is fitted to produce ; and to know the powers of mind , or whether it has any power , is to know the changes it causes or effects . If it cause no change , it has no power ; and the same is true of matter , and for the same reason , viz. , that to have power , and to be the producer of change , is only one and the same thing . Matter and mind , then , for aught that appears , are justly comparable in this particular ; for if power belong to them at all , it must necessarily be indicated by the changes or effects which they severally produce . This , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , the propriety of L making it , and settles , we should think , the question whether they have an equal claim to power . For what is the language of fact with respect to the actual efficiency of these substances ? Is it true that matter and mind severally produce change ? matter acting upon matter , and mind upon mind , and both mutually affecting each other ? They certainly appear so to do ; and so far as observation is concerned , they furnish precisely the same reason to believe in the efficiency of the one , as in the /z/ efficiency of the other . We believe in the efficiency of mind , because , to our apprehension , one mind often affects another , while it produces changes in itself , and in that corporeal system with which it is mysteriously united . When I convince my friend of an error , or persuade him to a right action , I exert an influence which entitles me to consider myself as a cause , in relation to the change produced in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumentalities I employ . But the same general action developes a process in my own mind , connected with a change in my bodily powers . I did not attempt to convince or persuade my friend , till I had formed the purpose of so doing ; this purpose was a voluntary act , or determination of the mind , and the result of consideration , or some previous state , in which motives . were brought to bear upon my voluntary powers ; and this purpose or volition was more immediately or remotely the cause of some corresponding change in the organs employed in expressing my thoughts . Here , then , is mind producing a change in itself , or more properly , one state of mind producing another state of mind , while the latter causes a change in the organic system , or bodily powers . True , it may be said , but here is a voluntary act , which the mind is conscious of performing by its own inherent powers . Be it so . But was not this act performed in the view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could it have taken place without motive , and independent of motive ? All experience will say , No . At the same time , we cheerfully concede that both mind and motive were essential to volition , and jointly constituted its immediate and invariable antecedent , or its true and proper cause . Motive alone , if we could conceive its existence possible , would have been unavailing without mind to perceive it , and to be susceptible of its influence ; and mind alone would have been /z/ equally unavailing , as to volition , if there had not been a motive perceived , which was adapted to the susceptibility of the mind ; and if the mind also had not possessed the capacity of voluntary exertion . Taken together , these things formed the previous requisites to volition , and so far as we can perceive , the only requisites . Thus it is universally ; wherever these requisites exist , volition is the certain consequence . They are its efficient , and never-failing cause . Still we contend that their efficiency is not more evident than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more certain that the things we have named are the cause of volition , than that fire is the cause of the sensation of heat light the cause of vision , or impulse the cause of motion . We ground this assertion upon the fact that these physical objects are , to our apprehension , as truly the producers of change in the cases specified , as any antecedent or previous requisites can be , in the case of volition ; and hence it is , that until the mind is perverted by the reasonings of a dubious philosophy , no question is ever made as to the efficiency of natural causes in the material world , more than in the spiritual . The unbiased voice of reason , is to allow causality in the regular and proximate antecedent of any change , or in what is supposed to be the antecedent ; * nor does it make any difference , whether the antecedent be found in matter , or in mind . If it be found in matter , I take the testimony of my senses in the case ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of consciousness ; and to both I am compelled by my constitution to yield an implicit faith . I can no more doubt when I thrust my hand into the fire , that it is the fire which burns me , than I can doubt the reality of my suffering , or the con- /z/ sequent will or desire to withdraw my hand ; for why do I will to withdraw it , but because I believe my sufferings to be produced by the fire ? I see a piece of wax placed in the flame of a lighted candle . The wax melts . Can I doubt what melts it ? Is not my conviction as intuitive , and as unalterable , that this change was produced by the flame , as that my sensation of heat was caused by the fire ? You present me with a rose ; I perceive its variegated colors , and am regaled with its fragrance . Here are two perceptions one by the eye , one by the organ of smelling . What do I believe with respect to the rose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects my organs of vision and smelling ; or , which is the same thing , that it is the cause of two sensations , the sensation of color and of fragrance . This is what I believe , and can not help but believe ; and this belief I truly express , when I say / see the rose 1 perceive its fragrance . For in the very fact of perception , I am carried to the belief of something without , and something as the cause of my perception . This fact will be noticed more particularly hereafter , and I advert to it now , not so much to show that matter has efficiency no less truly than mind , but that the testimony of sense is as much to be regarded in this question , as the testimony of consciousness . The truth is , that the voice of both is imperative , and that whatever may be the principles of our philosophy , we can not refuse our assent to either . In the very language we employ , and in the whole conduct of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our belief . It is to no purpose , therefore , to allege , that mind is efficient rather than matter , because I am conscious of its agency ; and from my consciousness am compelled to believe it an efficient cause ; for , with equal truth , it may be said that I perceive the efficiency of matter , and from my perception am c ompelled to believe in its power or causality . Percep /z/ tion and consciousness are different witnesses , but according to an established law of our nature , they are regarded by us in their respective spheres , as equally competent and equally credible . Are we not entitled then to say , that a system of philosophy which maintains the efficiency of second causes in the moral world , and denies it in the physical , is inconsistent with itself since what it affirms has no greater evidence of truth than what it denies ? We are much deceived as to the facts in the case , or an impartial examination will compel us to adopt one of these propositions , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral , or that they have power in neither . The latter proposition was embraced by Malebranche , and great was his labor to free it from objection but , as most men believe , with very little success . The subject , however , is still open to investigation , and we inquire , what is truth in relation to it ? Is God , as this philosopher supposed , the only efficient cause in the universe , producing by his immediate agency all the changes we see ? or have second causes power to produce effects by an efficiency properly their own imparted to them , indeed , by their almighty Creator , but lodged in their very constitution , or in the fact of their existence ? A ball is seen to move at the very instant it receives a stroke from my hand . The inquiry is , what moved the ball ? Was it the stroke which I gave it ? or did its motion come immediately from God ? If I advocate the efficiency of second causes , I must make the former supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , unless , with certain mystical philosophers , I attempt to split the difference , and maintain that the motion of the ball was produced neither by the stroke separately , nor yet by the immediate agency of God , but by an efficiency mysteriously compounded of the two . At some future time , we may perhaps take occasion to examine /z/ this last-mentioned theory , which includes among its advocates men distinguished for their talents and their virtues . At present we confine our remarks to the question : Whether God be the only efficient in the universe ? or whether second causes have power ? This I take to be the true and proper alternative in the case . First . If second causes have no power , that is , if they are not causes per se , producing effects by their own inherent energy , as truly as any cause can be supposed to do , why have they gone so long under the name of causes ? Is it that mankind have supposed them to be the regular but powerless antecedents of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate ? Rather is it not certain that from the beginning of the world they have been regarded as truly efficient in the changes with which they are regularly connected ? This is a matter of historical record , as our opponents will admit . But we need no other proof of it , than the very structure of language . Men give names as the signs , or symbols , of their thoughts ; and hence their mode of thinking can not fail to appear from the language they employ . We pretend not to doubt that men have always believed in the relation of cause and effect , inasmuch as we find in every language under heaven , many words expressive of this relation . Nor do we question for a moment their firm belief in an external world , since this belief is constantly indicated in the words they employ . By the same mode of reasoning we become assured that the early and steady opinion of mankind has been , that second causes are efficient , because this notion is involved in the very first principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causation itself . You can not open a page in any book , ancient or modern , without perceiving this truth written as with a sunbeam . Our opponents must concede to us , that that would be a strange kind of language , in which /z/ should be found no such words as cause , effect , produce , occasion , create , destroy , nor any kindred terms , which , like all active verbs , are expressive of an action , and of course of an agent , whose action it is . They can not but perceive that such a language would be impossible upon the acknowledged principles and laws of human thought . But we ask , if it is not equally inconceivable , and equally impossible , to frame a language which should recognize only one cause or agent in the universe ? The very attempt would run so counter to the usual habits of thinking and speaking , as to subject a man to the most pointed ridicule . He would instantly become a barbarian to others , if others were not barbarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have professed to deny an external world , have been obliged to talk and write like other men . They could not otherwise have made themselves understood , nor avoided the sneer which a language conformable to their avowed opinions would have occasioned . The same is true of those who , like David Hume , deny any such thing as cause and effect , in the common and appropriate sense of these terms . They are obliged to talk and to act like other men that is , just as if they believed what others believe , that cause and effect mark a relation not of priority and subsequence only , but of productive power or efficiency . Let them shape their language to their philosophy , and they could not make out a single page intelligible to themselves or to others . Nor is the case at all different with those who deny the efficiency of second causes ; they are obliged to use a language , and to pursue a course , which is every moment at war with their hypothesis . They must speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as mere events or effects of the changes which occur in the physical and moral world , as produced by their appropriate causes , that is , by their regular antecedents , which by common consent are regarded as the real producers of /z/ change ; and which they themselves must so regard , in their language at least , or become both unintelligible and ridiculous . Does this afford no presumption that second causes have power ? Why the impression , so early , so deep , so universal , so hard to be eradicated , and returning at every moment with all its force , even in those who have professed theoretically to cast it off ? That it is an impression of this character is most evident , from the influence it has had in modifying every language in the known world , and from the difficulty , may I not say from the impossibility , of framing a language upon any other principles . But at this very point we may be told that this deep-rooted and common belief is of no weight in the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific man will admit to be unfounded and yet their influence in the structure of language can not be denied . The vulgar have no correct opinions of the figure and motion of the earth , nor of the magnitude and distance of the sun , nor of many other physical facts , the nature of which they judge of from the report of their senses . If they may be deceived in these cases , why not in others 1 Who knows but their belief of cause and effect , and of the influence of second causes in particular , may not be as illusory as their belief of the figure of the earth , or the size and distance of the sun ? Our answer is this : the light of science has detected an error in the one case , but is not able to do it in the other . You may prove to a man by unanswerable arguments , that the earth is not a plane , as he has supposed , and that the sun is a much greater body , and at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you prove to him that fire does not fuse metals , nor w r ater melt salt ? that light is not the cause of vision to /z/ the healthful eye ? nor wringing a man 's nose the cause of its spouting blood ? Besides , when the vulgar are deceived in the cases above mentioned , what is it that deceives them ? Is it believing the report of their senses ? and are they undeceived at last by rejecting that report ? Nothing can be wider from the fact . Their senses have not reported falsely , nor have they fallen into error by receiving that report , and receiving it with the most unqualified confidence a thing , by the way , which no man can help . Their error originated in an entirely different source in the inferences they drew from the natural appearances of objects . These appearances were correctly reported , so far as the senses simply were concerned ; or rather these appearances are nothing different from the report of sense , and are , in all cases doubtless , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun , for instance , is not different to the eye of the one , from what it is to the eye of the other , but the difference lies in their individual and separate conclusions . And wherefore this difference ? Not because the philosopher questions the testimony of sense , for that he can not do ; but because he compares this testimony in different cases and circumstances , and comes to a conclusion which the comparison , in his judgment , authorizes. * He believes in natural appearances as much as the vulgar , and his sensitive impressions are in no respect different from theirs . Were it not thus , he would have no means of detecting erroneous conclusions concerning outward objects , whether made by himself or by others . This is too obvious to require farther elucidation , and therefore we remark that it is not difficult to distinguish between what are sometimes called illusions of the senses , or more properly , incorrect inferences from the testimony of sense , and those commonsense notions , or primary beliefs , which no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former admit of correction , from new observation , or from careful comparison of various observations , whether in relation to the same or different objects . The latter remain firm and unalterable , whatever pains may be taken to annihilate or modify them . Place their objects in what light you will , raise your doubts , and bring forth your strong reasons , still nature is true to her purpose , and these instinctive principles maintain their ground . Now , what we contend is , that a belief in the efficiency of second causes is one of these principles . It is early , deep , universal , and incapable of being eradicated just as really and truly as the belief of causation , and of an external world . Men can be found , indeed , who deny them all ; but do they not contradict the voice of nature , if that voice can be learned from the sentiments of mankind in all ages and nations ? Nay , do they not contradict the inward convictions of their own minds , if their actions can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire fuses metals , and water melts salt , are facts , we have said , which no man can disprove ; but are we not entitled to say , that they are facts which every man , from the very constitution of his mind , is compelled to believe ? Can he any more doubt , that it is a quality of fire to fuse metals , and of water to melt salt , than he can doubt the existence of the substances of which these qualities are predicated ? But Berkeley , it may be said , doubted both ; he believed in no material substances or qualities , nor in anything which may be denominated an external world . True , such was his theory ; but what was his practice ? Did he act upon his own principles ? His philosophy said there was no external world ; that what we call sensible things are merely our own sensations , produced by no external object , but by the immediate agency of God . But did he believe this when he attempted to argue with his fellow-men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while yet he , had no greater evidence of their existence than of other physical objects around him , and no evidence at all , but upon the testimony of sense . Into a like inconsistency do they fall , who deny the efficiency of second causes ; for , while they profess to regard them as powerless , they act towards them every moment as if they believed them possessed of an inherent and unremitting energy . The whole of the preceding argument goes upon the principle that the efficiency of second causes is a commonsense notion , deeply engraven upon the human mind , and showing itself in the very structure of language , not only in modifying some of its less essential forms , but in giving birth to first principles , and shaping the very groundwork . Nor can we readily be persuaded that a sentiment at once so radical and universal can be accounted for , but by supposing it a dictate of nature , the result of that reason and common understanding which God has bestowed upon mankind . NOTE A. The sentiment advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lecture is , that whatever is regarded as the regular antecedent of any change , is instantly recognized by the mind as the efficient cause of the change ; and that this is the unbiased voice of reason , or the dictate of common sense , from which there lies no appeal . If this statement be correct , it can not fail to be perceived , that the efficiency of second causes is placed on as firm a basis as the doctrine of cause and eifect , or the fact of an external world . To this statement , however , it has been objected that the supposed antecedent is not always the real antecedent ; of course , that the mind is sometimes mistaken in its reference , regarding that as the proximate cause which , in fact , is not that cause . Will not this abate our confidence in the argument for the efficiency of second causes , drawn from the common and prevailing sentiment , that the known or supposed antecedent is truly an efficient cause ? If the mind may mistake in its reference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not intuitively and universally detect the true efficient in the case , how can we be sure that its dictates are not wholly fallacious ? Our reply is , that though the mind may mistake as to the proximate cause of a change , it does not thence follow , that it mistakes as to the efficiency of the cause to which the change is referred . The mistake lies in the proximity of the cause to the effect , not in the productive power of the cause , to which the effect is attributed . The common opinion is , that fire fuses metals , and water melts salt ; but suppose it was ascertained that these substances produce their respective results through /z/ the intervention of a medium or principle not heretofore discovered ? Their powers would not be less real , but their agency would be less immediate than is now generally supposed . Or take another example . Every man believes that his will is concerned as a cause in the free and unconstrained motion of his hand . He considers the muscles of this organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Nor is his belief , as to the efficiency of his will , in any measure altered , when he learns that the affection of the nerves connected with the organ constitutes another link in the chain . According to his first impression , his volition was the immediate antecedent to the contraction of the muscles which give motion to the hand . Now he finds the affection of the nerves as prior to that contraction , and necessary to its occurrence . But though the train is lengthened , the causes concerned are not less efficient , nor does he ascribe less power to his will . /z/ IN the preceding Lecture , we adverted to the different answers which had been given to this question ; and stated that before the time of Descartes , all mankind , both learned and unlearned , believed second causes to be efficient , producing the changes which they seem to produce that since that period , many philosophers have professed to regard them as powerless , and the mere antecedents or signs of change . We examined , at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who maintain the efficiency of second causes in the moral , but deny it in the physical world . We attempted to show that their doctrine was unsupported by facts , and incompatible with itself ; and that , to be consistent on this subject , we must adopt one of two propositions , either that second causes have power in both worlds , or in neither world ; or , which comes to the same thing , either that God is the only efficient cause in the universe producing by his immediate agency all the changes we see or that second causes have power , and as truly in matter as in mind . We adopted the latter proposition , and alleged in favor of it the well-known fact that mankind , from the /z/ earliest records of time , have steadily acted under the full conviction of its truth . The very structure of language , aside from historical testimony , we considered as an unanswerable proof of such conviction . In short , that so deep and radical is this sentiment so completely inwrought in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood without employing terms which fully involve it . From this important fact we deduced the inference , that the efficiency of second causes has a strong claim to be considered a common sense notion , not unlike the general notion of cause and effect , or the belief of an external world . Second . We remark now , that it seems difficult to conceive how men should ever arrive at the notion of cause and effect as an abstract relation , or at the belief of anything without them , or besides them , unless they went upon the principle that second causes have power . For if these notions are not born with them , nor communicated by special revelation , ( neither of which will be pretended , ) they must be acquired in the exercise of the mental faculties , either with or without the aid of the bodily powers . So far as I know , it is an admitted fact that the notion of a cause first arises in the mind on observing some change , and remarking the circumstances in which this change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequent in this way , and of the more general relation of regular antecedence and of regular consequence , seems tojadmit of no doubt . Nor will it be questioned , I suppose , that the idea of particular antecedence is obtained before the idea of general or uniform antecedence . Why should not all this be true , with respect to cause and effect ? Can it be believed that men have the abstract notion of cause , and that no effect can take place without a cause , before they have learned what a cause is , through the medium of some change in a particular case ? or , which /z/ amounts to the same thing , before some change , and the circumstances in which it occurs , have suggested to them the idea of a cause , and of a particular cause ? Do we go from particulars to generals , or from generals to particulars ? We can be at no loss which is the more natural of our thoughts . Let us suppose a newly born infant whose first sensation is some bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There is not the remotest ground to believe that he has the least idea of cause . He knows not , perhaps , that he has a body , or that anything besides himself exists ; and some might even doubt if he had reflection enough to carry him to the knowledge of his own being . Be this as it may ; as his faculties develope and he becomes capable of observing the changes within and without him , and at the same time of remarking the circumstances in which they arise , it is easy to see how he may acquire the notion of a cause . He puts his hand into the flame of a candle , and instantly experiences a painful sensation . If not at first , after a few trials he learns the cause of his sufferings , and can not be induced to repeat the experiment . I say he learns the cause of his sufferings , by learning from the circumstances of the case that they were produced by the flame of the candle . But is not this saying too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he learns . He perceives nothing more , it may be said , and he infers nothing more than the simple conjunction of two events his contact with the candle , and his sensation of pain . Then it is certain he has not yet arrived at the knowledge or conception of a cause , nor is it easy to see how he ever can . He perceives a connection in time and place between two events ; but if he does not perceive nor infer a causal connection , he must regard the one as the mere antecedent or sign of the other , and has no idea of causality in the case . Is it not , however , demonstrably /z/ certain that the little reasoner carries his thoughts much farther ? He verily believes the candle to be the cause of his sufferings , and therefore ascribes to it , in his imagination at least , qualities which correspond to this belief . If it were not so , how could he learn the qualities of the candle ? or why should he ever suspect it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to be unquestionable ; and the amount of it is , that his sufferings were produced by the flame of the candle , and that they will return if he apply his hand as before . Now what is this but bringing him to the knowledge of a cause , and of a particular cause ? from which , in similar circumstances , he is led to expect a similar result . Will you say that he is mistaken in his reference , and that the true cause is not discovered by him ? Whether it be so or not , he has acquired the notion of a cause , and in the present case is fixed in his belief what the cause is , and regulates his conduct accordingly . In a manner correspondent with this , there is reason to believe that all men acquire the notion of a cause . They are led to this conception by observing some change in themselves , or in the objects around them , and by noticing the circumstances in which this change has occurred . That it did not occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the idea of their influence or agency in the case . To these , therefore , the mind refers as the immediate antecedent and cause of the change . But why this reference , it may be said , unless some general notion of a cause had been previously obtained ? I answer , this reference is nothing but an act of induction , or inferential reasoning , from the facts in the case ; it is the judgment which the mind forms in view of all the circumstances , and is neither more nor less than a dictate of common sense . A cause is that which does something . Is it strange that this notion should arise in the mind , when something is seen to be /z/ done ? Far more strange , would it be , if this were not the fact , since even the brute creation acquire the notion of a cause in similar circumstances . We speak not without reflection . It is an admitted fact , that brutes never rise to abstract conceptions , or conclusions at all ; or if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . But that they have the notion of particular causes , and that this notion is acquired by experience and observation , is just as certain , as that the cur trembles before the uplifted lash , which has just been buried in his skin , or that he often turns upon the man who inflicts an injury upon himself or his master . To say that it is only the occasion , and not the cause of their sufferings , that animals learn by their experience , is not only to beg the question in debate , but is utterly irreconcilable with the clear indications which they give , both of their gratitude and their resentment . Shall we allow experience and observation , then , to teach the animal what neither the one nor the other can ever teach man , the notion of a cause . That the one , in the exercise of his humble faculties , acquires a knowledge , which the other , with his superior endowments , can never acquire , unless by a teaching which is prior to experience , and altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such shifts . Assuming , therefore , what we consider in no degree doubtful , that men acquire the notion of a cause through the medium of some observed change , in the manner above stated , and we derive an argument in favor of the fact , that the efficiency of second causes is a commonsense notion , deeply seated in the mind of man . How can it be otherwise , if the very notion of a cause is acquired in view of some change ? and if this notion , when it first arises in the mind , is always connected with some particular cause , to which the mind refers as the immediate antecedent , and the real producer of the /z/ change ? For what is this antecedent , this particular cause , but something which we denominate a secondary cause ? and what the reference which the mind makes to it , but a belief of its efficiency ? To say that this reference is an error , and always an error , ( and the objection would be nothing without this , ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are under the necessity of believing a falsehood , as the only means of coming at the truth that is , we must believe in the efficiency of some particular cause , or we should never get the notion of a cause , nor rise to the abstract conception , that no effect can take place without a cause . We can not pursue this subject , or it might , as we think , easily be made to appear , that as the idea of causation is introduced into the mind by the agency of some secondary cause , so without that agency , and the fact of its belief , the mind would never acquire the idea of any cause , supreme or subordinate , unless imparted by special revelation . To suppose , as some have done , that anterior to all experience and observation , the mind is somehow possessed of the notion of cause and effect , as a general and abstract relation , is , in our judgment , beginning at the wrong end , as it supposes knowledge in a given case general and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties , and independent of that exercise . That is to say , it supposes general and abstract notions , on a subject where the mind has never generalized or exercised its powers of abstraction at all . All analogy , surely , goes against this . But if it did not , and we were compelled to admit that , prior to experience , we possess the abstract notion of cause and effect , and that no effect can take place without a cause ; still it is manifest that our knowledge of particular causes , and our belief of their efficiency in any given circumstances , is exclusively the result of experience and observation . This Dr. Brown has shown in the most unanswerable manner , at the /z/ same time that he has demonstrated , that without the knowledge and belief of particular causes , in the physical changes within and around us , we could never rise to the knowledge of the Great First Cause , on which all other causes depend . That this First Cause is only one among many which may be supposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the knowledge and belief of it is equally certain ; for the deaf and dumb have no such knowledge and belief , even after their faculties have come to maturity . If men come to the knowledge of God , then , it must be in one of two ways either by a process of inductive reasoning , or by special revelation . If by the former , they must go from effect to cause , and that by steps more or less numerous , till they arrive at a primary Cause , the source of all other causes . But how shall this process begin , if among the many antecedents to the many changes they witness , they recognize no particular cause ? Will it be said that the mind naturally passes at once from some change it has observed to the Great First Cause , as the immediate Author and Producer of it ? or , after searching in vain for an adequate cause , ultimately fastens on him ? This would be a surprising leap for the human faculties , and utterly incredible if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf and dumb just alluded to , settles the question , in our apprehension , that no such thing is done , or can be done , by the human mind ; nay , farther , that this is a point never reached by an insulated mind , whatever may be the strength of its faculties , or whatever its belief with respect to the efficiency of second causes . The only probable , and as we think , the only possible method of coming to the knowledge of God , by a process of reasoning , is by allowing second causes to have power , and to be the real producers of changes which they apparently produce . This settles , on a firm /z/ basis , the fact of causation , and enables the mind to proceed , on the principle of induction , from cause to cause , through a series of causes , severally the effect of some antecedent one , till it reaches a cause which is underived , independent and eternal . Or if the argument for the Divine existence turn upon design , manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design to be shown , but by showing that these objects display a fitness or adaptation of means to an end ? But can there be a fitness or adaptation of means , where there is no tendency ? or any tendency where there is no power ? If second causes do nothing they are fitted to do nothing ; a denial of their power is a denial of their fitness ; and where there is no fitness , but all is arbitrary , he must be sharpsighted indeed , who can discern either wisdom or design . Third . Farther , that second causes are truly efficient , we argue from what is involved in the doctrine of perception . We glanced at this topic in the preceding Lecture , but it is a point of too much importance not to be distinctly considered . What is perception ? According to modern and approved writers , it is neither more nor less than the reference we make to something external as their cause . Reid , Stewart and Payne , agree in this general statement . A rose is presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , I have a certain agreeable sensation , which I refer to the rose as its cause . " Observing/ ' says Dr. Reid , " that the agreeable sensation is raised when the rose is near , and ceases when it is removed , I am led by my nature to conclude some quality to be in the rose , which is the cause of this sensation . " And Mr. Payne , speaking of the sensation of fragrance excited by a rose , says : " We refer the agreeable feeling to the rose as its cause ; the reference is different from the feeling itself and different from the object , or the rose and the prin-/z/ ciple of the mind from which this reference results , is the same general principle , whatever that may be , which enables us to draw conclusions in other cases ; " that is , as I understand him , the reference of which he speaks is nothing different from an act of inductive reasoning from the facts in the case . Am I led , then , by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rose , and that this quality is the cause of my agreeable sensation ? then I am compelled , by my very constitution , to assign a quality to the rose , and to regard that quality as the cause of my sensation . In other words , I am compelled to believe that the rose does something , or acts as a cause . Here , then , let me say , is one secondary cause at least , and that in the physical world , which is admitted to be truly efficient , if to do something and to be efficient are not terms of radically different import . What is true of the rose is true of every other object of perception , or of the whole external world . There is no one object of sense which does not affect us . This affection we call a sensation , and this sensation we refer to something without as its cause . And here let it be remarked , that we have precisely the same belief that something without affects us , as we have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather is included in , the former . For how came we to know or to suspect that there is something without , but by supposing or believing that we are affected by it , or that it is the cause of our sensations . If our belief does not go to this , tell us where it stops . Does it stop with the mere fact that we are affected , and that there is a cause of this affection ? Then it does not go to an external world at all . It amounts to nothing more than a sensation , and its cause , without deciding what that cause is , something within or something without . But is this the testimony of sense , and this our belief of that testimony ? /z/ Then , in truth , we have no evidence of an external world , and matter , for aught we know , is a mere figment of the mind . We can not avoid this conclusion , but by admitting that our belief of something without , is inseparably connected with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it all the efficiency we plead for . But what if I am unwilling to allow that something without really affects me ? The answer is at hand it alters not the fact , nor our unchangeable belief in relation to it . Certain it is , that in all our perceptions , we refer the corresponding sensations to something without as their cause . This reference is belief and a belief that the objects perceived are the causes of the sensations concerned .
