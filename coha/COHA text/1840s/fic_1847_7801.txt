Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : HOPE PROPHESIES TO MAN . from Poems ( 1847 ) See Hope her glittering pinions plume , Joy gushing from her eyes ; As though she knew not of man 's gloom , Nor ever heard his cries . Not fresher looks the dewy dawn , Awakening perfumed May , And calm , as though could ne'er be drawn Storm 's curtain o'er his day . Hope has her throne upon the light , That breaks from out the east ; Behind her lowers still the night , Before her night has ceased . Thus riding on the ushering rays , That greet the expectant earth , She shares the glory that displays Each morn at its great birth . With light she comes , and light she brings ; Without her what were Morn ? Dull are the beams Day ' fore him flings , To those with her are born . The Sun his heavenly task might close , And Earth in darkness grope ; For life would sink in torture 's throes , Were man bereft of Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single ear ,  --  Voices that tell , with heavenly will , Humanity 's career . Who ' s blest to hear them , sees arise Such splendors in the van , That , rapt in ecstasy , he cries , Hope prophesies to man . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : ASPIRATION . from Poems ( 1847 ) Were we what we might be , We ' d not look back with sadness ; But the Past as brightly Would shine as present gladness . Were we what we could be , We ' d not look forward fearing ; But the Future would be As sunlight warm and cheering . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : THE MARTYR 'S MOTHER . from Poems ( 1847 ) Footnote 1 : 1Kb " First strip his shoulders bare , Then through the streets of Meaux Scourge the cursed wretch , who ' d dare More than his priest to know . The scourging done , let the hot brand Hiss on his brow from hangman 's hand . " Called priests of Christ were they , The judges who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lord Jesus brake . For Jesus said , " Love one another " ; These loved themselves , and cursed their brother . His hands behind him bound , His back the martyr bent ; His life-drops on the ground , They marked the path he went . Calmly as earth the wild storm 's flashes , Receives his soul the priest-bid lashes . Like bloodhounds on a trail , The yelling multitude , With bitter , mocking hail , His glorious track pursued . The blinded crowd so seldom knows Its benefactors from its foes . But silent was the tear , From bleeding hearts upsent , For the brave teacher dear , Their bondage who had rent . And some , who yet had not the truth , Deep groaned with fructifying ruth . That soul-steeped look ,  --  whence broke it ? To his strong heart a balm ; That valiant word ,  --  who spoke it ? It made his courage calm . So look , so speak , could only one ; A mother worthy of the son . Ceases the blood-wet rod ; The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of mercy 's God , Rome 's priests will slake their ire . The headsman 's arm is up ,  --  and now The iron ' s on the martyr 's brow . Like one fierce lightning streak On the black calm of night , On that hushed crowd a shriek Fell with appalling might . " Glory to Jesus Christ , " it cried , " And all his witnesses ! " and died . The throng and soldiers melt , Subdued , o'erwhelmed with awe ; The priests , e'en they too felt She was above their law . A heart-voice tunes all to its mood , So deep ' s our bond of brotherhood . Thus could a mother sing For Christ and Truth that day ; She , too , had quelled pain 's sting . The awed crowd give her way To her humble hearth , the noble one : In triumph followed her her son . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : THE LOVED DEPARTED . from Poems ( 1847 ) Solemn as their voices dying , Silent as the graves they lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a wife 's heart-burnings , Sweet as tears of the kind-hearted , Are thoughts of the loved departed . Now their aspects greet us cheerful , Now with something sad or tearful ; Still and mystic come their faces , Hallowed by unearthly graces . Welcome aye , whence ever darted , Visions of the dear departed . When least looked for come before us These pure visions , to restore us ,  --  When a sordid passion ' s scheming , When with anger eyes are gleaming . Blessed be whatever started Memories of the loved departed . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : DIDACTIC . from Poems ( 1847 ) Health 's temple is the body fair , High miracle of art , A perfect God-built palace , where Strength , Beauty , each , full part From Life may drink , that floweth there , The fountain of the heart . Keep pure and sweet , is Heaven 's command , This temple , thus divinely planned . Within this temple is a light , And deep a holy well , Kindled and nourished from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , so bright Their splendors none can tell . If free the intellect and soul , Man is a generous , joyous whole . Let in its might the mind awake , It speaks the eternal law ; Like sun-struck mists , Time 's trammels break , Pale falsehoods faint with awe ; While round them , Love , Truth , Beauty , shake The light from God they draw , That lights to boundless liberty . To earn this freedom , what do we ? We blast our bodies with the ills Of vice and ignorance born ; Our minds we dwarf , we lame our wills , Till e'en ourselves we scorn ; Each one his breast with self o'erfills , Making each one forlorn ; And then , when woes thick on us burst , We moan ,  --  " By fate and Heaven we ' re curst . " High intellect is lowly used To glut unrighteous needs , Its keenest edges roughly bruised Upon hard , selfish deeds ; The soul 's warm wants are cold refused , Stinted with meagre creeds ; And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poor man was made to mourn . " Disorder , by brute force strong bound , Order and law we call , And ' bout the reeking earthy mound Religion ' s made a wall ; Thin theologic paps are ground , To sweeten man-mixed gall ; And heavenly earth thus made a hell , We ' d save us by the old church-bell ! Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : WHY ARE POETS SAD ? from Poems ( 1847 ) Saw'st thou e'er the clean proportions , Schemed in fulness of thy soul , Marred to look more like distortions Than the beauty of a whole ? Heard'st thou e'er poetic passion , Music-wrought to thrill the heart , Tamed by some insipid fashion , Or by players with false art ? Hast thou ever , with the feeling That the ill might have been stayed , Watched a loved one , while was stealing Death upon her like a shade ? Who thwartings such as these has had , May know why poets oft are sad . Poets ' lives are daily thwartings ; In their souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartings , What the world calls highest meeds . Music sings in their heart-stirrings , That can find no earthly voice ; Life 's best actual forms are blurrings , To the beauty of their choice . Man 's great sorrows , with heart-feeling , Daily they in secret moan ; From their eyes are often stealing For man 's woes warm tears unknown . No poet ' s he who can be glad , With so much round to make him sad . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : BURNS . from Poems ( 1847 ) Quivering with strength , from earth he springs ; Defiant shouts his strange voice rings . Gazing afar , like some lone tower , His nostrils panting restless power , His big eyes darting eager fire , With rustic hand he strikes his lyre . From the long sleep , so dreamless slept , Scotland , like a roused laggard , leapt . Rolls the clear tide of a new song Through her heart 's channels , void so long , High swelling now , with lively beat , To sounds so earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears , In tones that shift from mirth to tears , And where , too , clarion notes are pealed , Its inmost feeling bright revealed . A nation 's face , thus freshly wrought , Beams with a smile of joyful thought . Few years had passed since first was heard That fiery heart 's awakening word ; Its mighty throb , that warm life sent To million hearts , and with them blent In rapturous unison , is still ; Tranquil so soon in Death 's pale chill . Wasted ; by soul-sprung griefs outworn ; By proud heart-struggles inly torn ; Disconsolate , despairing , crushed ; Before his time in misery hushed ; Great Burns went early ' mongst the dead , His eye still gleaming thoughts unsaid . Could he have had but half his due , Had half was felt and done been true , His generous soul had then been soothed , And timelier his last pillow smoothed . Traduced , banned , poor , he died heart-broken ,  --  The noblest Scot that e'er has spoken . He whose large will , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower , Who did give gifts but by those given Endowed to bless the earth from Heaven ,  --  Thoughts to enrich all time to come ,  --  Earned his poor bread by gauging rum . A noble man , divinely strung For all the virtues he has sung , Finds wrenched by lies into divorce From good , man 's pith , his feelings force ; Is driven to the tavern 's stench , His brotherly yearnings there to quench . Instead of honor , condescension ; Instead of peace , hot , coarse contention ; ' Stead of high work fit for great souls , He had the low , slow toil of moles ; A victim of the falsehoods strong , That make of men a scrambling throng . Passions in him were lashed to madness , That might have been a well of gladness ; Sources of joy turned into sadness , His very goodness into badness : A strong man bound in the world 's lies And multiform hypocrisies . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : IMPROMPTU , ON BEING ASKED FOR A FEW LINES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVER TO HIS MISTRESS . from Poems ( 1847 ) ' T is only song can utter love , Its agonies and blisses ; For song , too , springeth from above , Far , far from sin 's abysses . Alas for me ! I can not sing , And yet love will be spoken : O , for the poet 's golden string ! My heart will else be broken . I 'll send my bird to speak my part , O , hearken to his singing ! And when ' t would seem he ' d burst his heart , Think that with mine ' t is ringing . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : O , DREAM NO MORE ! from Poems ( 1847 ) O , dream no more of heavens to be ! Heaven is , within , around you ; Wake from a selfish lethargy , Where misty visions bound you . Cease resting on a joy , to start When first the grave shall press you ; The throbbing , living , longing heart Is full of joys to bless you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell ' s here , around , within you : What are the groans of imagery , To those from earth that din you ?

O , dream no more ! rouse up and be : Make Love and Beauty bound you ; And so at last humanity Shall grow a heaven around you . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : TO LITTLE MARY GRIFFIN , GRANDDAUGHTER OF CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE . from Poems ( 1847 ) Sole scion of a noble breed ! Thy sparkling , laughing eyes In dearest bosoms throw the seed Of saddest memories . Then quick thy wiles , And roguish smiles , Banish all miseries . Joy-darting life and nimble grace Thy blooming limbs enfold ; More thoughts are struggling through thy face , Than thy young eyes can hold . May body 's health , And spirit 's wealth , Be aye , as now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , While through thy tongue Hope sings ; And from thy playful tresses fair Joy leaps in sunny rings . Beautiful child ! On thee be piled All gifts that goodness brings ! Throughout thy grandsire 's country wide , Welcomed thou aye wilt be , All hearts , for that brave death he died , Thankful his child to see . May thy grandsire 's Soul-lifting fires Shine womanly in thee ! Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : INVOCATION . from Poems ( 1847 ) O Thou , who smilest in the Spring 's glad bloom ! Whose love is dimly seen in good men 's deeds ! Source of all life ! Mysterious , awful Presence ! Power beneficent ! Pour of thy grace Upon my spirit , that would purely mount . O , multiply in me the blessed moods , When Beauty swathes me in her fiery wings , And from all selfish thoughts upwafts me swift , Through realms of growing light , towards the high centre , Where , in eternal fulgence mild , Truth dwells . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most proudly shows His beauties and his grandeurs mild , As by St. Goar 's walls he flows , And ' neath broad Rheinfels ' wreck uppiled ,  --  ' T was there the poet simply dwelt , And simply sang of what he felt . I knew him there , and that sweet spot Lay after in my memory 's folds More fragrantly , that ' t was my lot To meet there what one glad beholds ,  --  A gentle , modest man , God-gifted , In world 's wares low , by worth uplifted . A frugal pension from his king , Enough his bounded wants to sate , Left him all free to roam and sing , Thus duly honored by the state . Thought-breeding spirits , in that land , Are nourished from the public hand . His image lived within my mind , As drew him there his verse and mien ; A man , kind , gentle , and refined , A poet , whom ' t were hard to wean From quiet thought , and the calm moods Mild natures love in fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at home . One day , as o'er some British leaves My eye all listlessly did roam , Suddenly to the page it cleaves , Fixed by the poet 's name , and reads The story of his Muse and deeds . At first the picture was the same That I had laid within my breast ; But soon , strange , startling words there came Of flight , imprisonment , arrest . By dread and wonder overpowered , The tale I tremblingly devoured . With beautiful dilation swelled That stored-up image , as I learned How he his wrath for years had quelled , Had hushed the love wherewith he yearned ; Hoping , with loyal , Christian trust , That Prussia 's king would yet be just . That tranquil mien , that abstinence From smiting words , from song-winged blows , Was a pure soul 's compelled defence . Beneath , a patriot spirit glows , That for one 's country all would dare ; The stronger , that it could forbear . But when at last , by patient trial , That vulgar king 's low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The king from slavish instincts drew , In stormy verse his ire he sped , And from his home and pension fled . In England now his bread he earns , By daily , common , mindless toil ; And sad , and silent , tearful turns His eyes towards his far German soil ; Yet thankful , too , that he is saved From those hard tyrants whom he braved . And faded now ' s that image meek , Dimmed by the splendors stern , that shine Around the martyr 's pallid cheek . The gentle poet of the Rhine His deeds a hero-bard avow ; Whom then I loved , I reverence now . Woe to the country such must fly ! Its core is foul with cankering blight ; Its throne ' s a gilded , brazen lie . The poets are a people 's light ; As were a sunless firmament , Is the cursed land whence they are sent .

But work the grateful Present so , That some of what thou ' st planted To bounteous strength and fruitage grow And thanks , by brothers chanted . ' T is thus thou ' lt find those lost , sad days , Bereft too of their sorrows ; Our past bad debts there ' s naught that pays , But gold of rich to-morrows . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : GIVE ! GIVE ! from Poems ( 1847 ) The sun gives ever ; so the earth , What it can give , so much ' t is worth . The ocean gives in many ways ,  --  Gives paths , gives fishes , rivers , bays . So , too , the air , it gives us breath ; When it stops giving , comes in death .

Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : AGNES . from Poems ( 1847 ) As birthday I will celebrate The day when first I met her ; From that ' t is I my true life date , So much to it I 'm debtor . My heart I felt not till that day , My head , too , I belied it ; For what ' s a head , in best array , Without a heart to guide it .

Protean imp ! though thou canst throw thee Into all guises , now I know thee : Down ! down ! I will be free . And ye , who bring , so open , bold , Your gifts of power , applause , and gold , To bribe my liberty ; Millions you ' ve chained in hellish fires ; Bold as ye be , ye all are liars : Avaunt !

Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : THE SUFFERINGS OF JESUS . from Poems ( 1847 ) So weak our joys , so poor our lives , That towards thy affluence of soul Human conception vainly strives , Seizing but fragments of the whole . And we are glad ; we smile , we laugh ; But thou didst weep , didst never smile ; And so we deem , that thou didst quaff Of naught but sorrows , deep or vile .

What death , to thy ecstatic mind ? A tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity for mankind .

Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : THE BERNESE ALPS AT SUNSET . from Poems ( 1847 ) Ye mighty offspring of the strong young Time ! Gigantic brood of earth 's primeval travail ! Before your silent , beaming majesty , With strange delight , with solemn joy , I gaze , The mind upmounting with your loftiness . Sublimity makes such familiar haunt Among your grandeurs manifold , that Beauty Shrinks modest down , to nestle at your feet . Ye are alone ; changeless , where all things change ; Motionless ' midst the unceasing flow of life . Scarce do ye bear an earthly stamp , but high Ye lift your speechless , spotless heads , snow-blazoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round your cold sides cling , like living arms Around a corpse , insensate to their touch . A mystery ye are ; and from the plane And common of this world sudden ye rear Your giant forms , ' midst time 's recurring spans , Fit emblems of eternity . Since first From Zurich 's humble hills your image loomed , A heaven-suspended vision , on my sight , Day upon day I ' ve journeyed towards ye , wondering ; Till now I stand , awed , baffled , at your base . Darkness fast fills the earth , but your white peaks Glow in the sunshine . Telegraphs ' twixt worlds ! Your sky-ward fronts brighten the sun 's last ray , To me a herald from my far-off home . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : A GORGEOUS SUNSET . from Poems ( 1847 ) As wonderful and fresh to-day Is this magnificent array Of purpled light , as ' t were the first That quenched man 's beauty-craving thirst . Yet day ne'er died , but its last hour Was soothed by like soft solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To sickly , sorrowing Earth , by Heaven , That pure and beautiful as this Is yet to be her daily bliss . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : ECHO FROM ITALY IN 1830. from Poems ( 1847 ) Hark !  --  ' T is past . Whence came that shivering sound ? ' T was the blast of tyrants ; France is bound . Still lower bend the knee , To deeper slavery , Woe-stricken Italy ! Ha !  --  Again . A crash like deafening thunder ! ' T is the chain of bondage rent asunder . Exultant Italy , With clanging symphony , Sends back the maddening cry . Hark !  --  A shout of hosts comes o'er the sea ! ' T is the rout of tyrants ; France is free . The shout of victory , Of joy and liberty , Resounds through Italy . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : REUBEN JAMES . from Poems ( 1847 ) On the deck , blood-soiled , In a death-grip coiled , The captains lay ; Decatur up ,  --  below , the Turk . Fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above the hero 's head A scymitar keen flashes ; An instant more , he ' s sped : Down the sharp weapon dashes .

What can not a brave heart ? That tar , with a quick start , Thrusts his young head between : It takes the steel 's deep seam . ' T was for a hero by a hero done : Both must be great that deed so great be won . Higher among heroic names Stands thenceforth none than Reuben James . Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : SCENE BEFORE TRIPOLI . from Poems ( 1847 ) Footnote 1 : 1Kb A rosier flood of golden light , A livelier gush of melody , Told of a new earth-sent delight For Heaven 's ceaseless jubilee .

He who had sought The hero 's death ; He who had wrought , With gushing breath , To build his fatherland ; He whose faint ear , On battle-fields lying , Freedom 's glad cheer Had blest in his dying ; He whom the might Of duty had lifted , With front upright , By war to be rifted ; The hearty ones , whose deaths have been The births of deathless thoughts ' mongst men . With jocund flight , they sped their way Towards Afric 's northern shore , where lay , On the black level of a sunless sea , Columbia 's fleet , afront of Tripoli .

Calmly and silent takes his station each : Only who stay are moved . With warning speech , Decatur , who for self ne'er danger spied , Greets Somers ; and stout Preble 's bosom sighed , As from his sight quick glided in the gloom The death-fraught vessel , onward to her doom .

Silence and Night , as fraught with general death , Rush back , while Turk and Christian hold their breath . More slowly than when Ocean 's homeward way Is balked with calms , drag on the minutes now . Keener than the fierce famished shark for prey , Watches each silent ship from stern to prow . Save when impetuous fancy cheats the hope With semblances of sound , nor eye nor ear Can seize on aught within their tensest scope . As hours wear sadly on , night grows more drear .
