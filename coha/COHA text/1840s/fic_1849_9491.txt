The curtain falls  --  closed is the Drama 's page : Why lingers Beatrice upon the stage ? Away , illusion !  --  this is not thy sphere  --  The sigh is faithful , and the grief sincere . Should utterance tremble , should the tear-drop start , They will but echo and o'erflow the heart . Three years , my friends  --  how brief they seem !  --  have fled Since on your shore ' t was my good hap to tread ; And if some anxious fears were mine at first , How on my soul your liberal welcome burst ! Ye cheered my efforts  --  took me by the hand : No more was I a stranger in the land . A stranger ! Why ? on every side I heard My native accents in each spoken word ; And every greeting which my toil beguiled Was from the " well of English undefiled . " The mighty poet , whose creations bright The Drama 's spell evoked for you to-night ,  --  Did I not find his memory and his strains Here as familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Saxon stock could claim , And ye with us partake his endless fame . Ah ! as the loiterer by some pleasant way , Though duty bid him haste , would fain delay ,  --  Review the prospect beautiful  --  retrace Each sunbright feature and each shadowy grace ,  --  So would I linger  --  so would I forget , It is , alas ! to part , that we have met . Yet , ere I go , desponding Memory asks , Is this the last of my too happy tasks ? Shall I no more a scene like this behold , Or tread these boards , in your approval bold ? Too strong the chance that it will e'en be so  --  Fate answers , " Ay ! " but ah ! Hope whispers , " No ! " And yet , though mute the voice , and closed the scene ; Though oceans stretch , and tempests roar between ; Whatever hues may mark my future lot , Still let me dream that I 'm not all forgot ; That Shakspeare 's fair abstractions may restore A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talfourd 's pathos , Knowles 's tragic art , Some wavering recollection may impart  --  A look , a tone , that sympathy impressed , That was the touch of nature to your breast . But heedless Time hath brought our parting near : Why do I still , superfluous , linger here ? Ah ! think not ever an unreal part So tasked my powers , and filled my beating heart ! I may not speak the thoughts that in it swell ,  --  I can but say , kind , generous friends , farewell !
