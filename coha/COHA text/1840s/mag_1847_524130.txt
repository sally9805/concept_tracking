txt Tins book has come to us , wafted on a perfect gale of puffery . Did anybody ever see the like ? People of the most opposite sentiments and characters-Calvinists , Unitarians , Evangelicals , Rationalists and Universalists , nurslings and veterans of literature , sage poets and shrewd critics-all agree in representing it as a very eclecticism of poetry , philosophy , morality and orthodoxy . Compared to the rest of contemporary literature , " Festus , " it seems , is an oasis in a desert-an Eden in a wilderness ; and all that is profound , and original , and tender , and touching , and chaste , and voluptuous , is concentrated into it . " A most remarkable and magnificent production ! " says one . " Contains poetry enough to set up fifty poets ! " says another . " The very inmost life of a sincere and energetic mind ! " says a third . " A glory and perfection in the midst of comparative sterility ! " says a fourth . Truly , the grand universal reconciliation has at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have met together under our author 's banner , of course there is to be no further strife between their followers . Had Shakspeare , during his lifetime , received half the praise which has already fallen to this man , he would probably have died-or done worse-of too much glory . Since the publication of " Festus , " the author is reported to have gone crazy . Our only wonder is , that anybody should have been so crazy as to think him sane . The genius of humbug has obviously taken criticism by the nose , and can now give success to anything that comes along in book 's clothing . Nothing can be offered so false , or foul , or flimsy , but some huge bellows stands ready to blow it into notoriety . Surely , at this rate , puffery must crack its cheeks pretty soon . Doubtless , however , this is all as it should be ; and we are by no means disposed to complain . It was but just , that Wordsworth 's mild light should shine quietly in its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the earth , and finally danced into it . So long as men need religious instruction , a theological quack or dandy , like Burchard or Maffit , will , of course , make pew-rents much higher than a modest , unambitious , Christian sage ; were it otherwise , perhaps the pulpit might as well be dispensed with . The world would have no use for books of any kind , if it were already in a condition to distinguish and choose the good . There would be nothing for angels to do for us , could we recognize them when they come . Real worth suffices unto itself , as " virtue gives herself light through darkness for to wade . " No man deserves popularity unless he be content to do without it ; and we show a poor appreciation of merit , when we regret the liabilities which enter into the condition of its growth . He alone is fit to be a stay for others , who is * Festus , a Poem ; by Philip James Bailey , William Pickering , 1845 . Barrister-at-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ; if a man be so stayed , popular censure will not shake him ; if he be not , popular applause will rather blow him down than bolster him up . Assuredly , he who makes popularity the test of truth , knows not , and deserves not to know , what truth is . Human society may be aptly enough compared to a pyramid ; the number of individuals being greatest at the baso , and constantly diminishing as we ascend . The higher the degree , the fewer there be that reach it ; the noblest gifts can not gain the summit without great labor , nor the greatest labor without noble gifts . L*esting its broad base on the earth , the structure tapers up until it pierces the skies ; so that whatever influences come from Heaven diffuse themselves from the apex downwards , ever widening as they descend , and reaching the bottom only by passing through all above . The eye is in the head , and it is only through the eye that the body can be filled with light . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervade the whole ; but this order can not well be reversed . With some such presentiment as this in their minds , authors were once foolish enough to write for the wise and good , that is , the fit and the few ; they aimed to reach mankind by beginning at the apex and gradually working down to the base . But since every man has become just as good as his neighbor , and a great deal better , this foolish method has been abandoned ; authors now begin at the base and work the other way . The reading democracy seem to have a sort of instinct that the natural course of wisdom is from the earth upwards , not from the heavens downwards ; that truth passes through the base to the apex of the pyramid , not through the apex to the base . In the literary priesthood , therefore , as in the political , men must obviously be chosen and ordained from below , rather than from above ; unless we suppose the pyramid inverted and poised on its apex , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be promoted downwards . Of course it is those who need , not those who have had , most instruction , that are best qualified to select and commission instructors ; for we must not so far sin against the wisdom of the age , as to presume there can be any better test and measure of truth than the voice of the majority . But the practical result of this new order is , that the worst and weakest books poll the most votes ; the filthier or emptier a book is , the greater the number that can appreciate it ; the lower it flies , the better its chance of getting whirled or sucked into the current of popular applause . The very ground of an author 's success is , that he does not overshoot the reading democracy , and that , instead of aiming to make them wiser and better , he tries to persuade them they are already wise and good enough ; for quackery always proceeds by appealing to the reason of its audience against the authority that challenges this faith . None are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment to be convinced , and assume to see for themselves before they trust ; that is , whose trust is altogether in themselves . But this is not all . Not only is the lowest book sure to hit the greatest number of readers , but it takes the greatest number of books to satisfy the lowest reader . Thus we have a double incentive to the making of bad books ; reward is in a sort of geometrical ratio to worthlessness . Truth , plain and unattractive at first , always improves on acquaintance ; , the more one sees her , the more one wishes to see her ; ever growing beautiful in proportion as she grows familiar , she of course rather precludes than provokes the desire of novelty and change ; makes us prefer returning where we know she may be found , to venturing into untried regions in quest of her . But folly and falsehood always exhaust their attractions at a single interview , and the more theytickle the sooner they tire ; one never wishes to see them twice in the same form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are evermore presenting themselves . Thus , the worse books a man reads , the more of them he wants ; as it takes many objects to satisfy a man 's lust , but only one to satisfy his love . Accordingly , the present age surpasses all others , both in the demand for new books , and in the supply of printed shams . From occasional showers , literature has become a continual freshet , which is so far from furthering vegetation , that it is even threatening to wash away the soil . But our design is , not so much to censure the existing state of things , as to account for it . That such a book as " Festus " shouldjurnp into a reputation which Paradise Lost has even yet hardly grown into , is truly a most significant phenomenon ; one which we shall be apt to regard as ominous or auspicious , ac // cording to our faith in human progress . Doubtless it results , in part , from the democratic principle of reversing the old order , and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , of submitting the gravest matters to the judgment of those who are least capable of understanding them ; and who , if they were competent to decide who or what is best adapted to instruct them , obviously would not need to be instructed at all . How far publishers are con*emed in originating and maintaining the present order , is not for us to say . One can hardly help seeing that their interest lies most in mediating between such as want nothing but puffs for their labor , and such as want nothing but shams for their money ; and they probably would not be publishers , if they were ambitious of martyrdom in any cause but that of selfinterest . Besides , when readers turn democrats , it is to be expected that writers will turn demagogues ; and publishers are in duty bound to furnish both parties with every practicable facility for the process of mutual gulling . Far be it from us , therefore , to blame publishers for the course they take . Doubtless , they are as worthy a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humbugging those who will consent to patronize them on no other conditions . If , then , acting as mediators between vanity and gullibility , they do give the shadows to both sides , and take the substance to themselves ; if they dispense notoriety to authors and nothing to readers , and pocket the results of the process , surely no one ought to blame them ; t is their vocation . But enough of prologue . " Festus " is certainly a most marvelous book ; nearly as marvelous as General Tom Thumb , or the Kentucky giant ; and perhaps all had better read it , just to see what strange things a great genius can produce , and an enlightened public can appreciate . Like other monsters , the book is altogether original ; nothing else like it ever was , or , we trust , ever will be produced . In this we must be understood to speak of the book as a whole ; for where the whole is so excruciatingly original , of course many of the parts can afford to be borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain theory . We think he has succeeded to admiration . As is the soul of the work , so is the body ; we know not whether to admire it more for the principle or for the details . The whole work , in spirit and in form , is " rickety , disjointed , crazy* ' enough to suit the most fastidious epicure of lawlessness and deformity . To all those who take darkness for depth , and rudeness for strength ; whose brains have got enriched with transcendental fury , and whose minds are big with vagueness and vacuity , it can not be otherwise than a most delectable repast ; in its meaningless jargon they will often find most admirable expressions of their own thoughts . Like most philosophical poems , as they are called , " Festus " is neither good science nor good poetry , but an indescribable medley , which , so far as we know , has never been appropriately named . The book contains neither prose nor verseneither fact nor imagination ; is made up neither of persons nor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a long , tedious masquerade of abstract ideas ; and , generally , the only hint vouchsafed of a change of speakers , is in the names prefixed to the speeches . Lucifer , it is true , preaches some very strange doctrine ; but not stranger than the hero , Festus . They seem , indeed , but duplicates of the same idea-twin apostles , giving a biform development of the same theory ; and , for aught we can see , the discourses of both might as well have come from the same person . On the whole , they are a little the oddest man and devil we have ever encountered ; and it is somewhat doubtful which shows more wit  --  the devil in attacking such a man , or the man in yielding to such a devil . Doubtless , however , both are right and true in their kind ; for they are altogether unlike anything else the human mind ever found or fancied . Lucifer , to be sure , is somewhat given to pouting against both God and man ; nevertheless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and is , indeed , the only true days-man betwixt them . The author is evidently a philanthropist , and belongs to that class of reformers who are going to do anything that ought to be done , and prevent everything that ought to be prevented , by love . Love , with him , has obviously settled into " a fixed idea ; " it is the only idea he has ; and he has not more than half of thatif , in deed , he had the whole , it would not be his only idea . Like others of his class , he seems to regard God as a mere philanthropist ; religions as mere humanity ; and the idea of retribution , divine or human , as too absurd to need refutation . Man , // he would argue , is too noble a being to be punished , and God is too philanthropic a being to punish him , here or hereafter . The viler and wickeder he becomes , the better opportunity he presents for the exhibition of the Divine philanthropy ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seduce and deprave him . Our author would recognize nothing as true , or beautiful , or good , for which love is not the best expression ; power , wisdom , justice , honor , righteousness , holiness-all these he would degrade into empty synonyms of love . Man , whatever he may be or do , is but the object of love ; is to be taught , governed , disciplined , developed , by love ; and the fierce wars which we read of between Michael and Satan , were but lovers ' quarrels after all , destined to end in a most loving match and lasting honeymoon . All just authority on earth and in heaven resolves itself into lovu , and enforces itself through love . Love , indeed , is the only absolute thing in the universe ; whatever does not finally run up into this , and can not be realized in and through this , had better not be , and , on the whole , is not . He knows no law nor gospel but love ; will sanction no feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ; will seek no heaven , and worship no divinity , but love . He finds nothing in nature but symbols of Jove : the wind , the rain , and the sunshine , plague , pestilence , and famine , the lightning , the tempest , and the earthquake-all , all are but expressions of love . He will allow no attribute to God but love , no engine to government but love , no arm to authority but love . All crimes against heaven and humanity are but occasions of love ; all chastisements and corrections are but exhibitions of love ; life , light and divinity are to be loved into us ; death , darkness and deviltry are to be loved out of us . That the book teaches , or rather , does nothing but teach , this shallow , conceited , despicable moralitya morality which could only spring up from the ashes of all manly thought and passion , and which goes to desiccate the soul of every just and noble and generous sentiment ; - that the book teaches this arrogant and impudent morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , enough of itself to account for most of the applause it has received . Now , we profess to have some regard for " the law of love ; " but when love is thus degraded into mere philanthropypushed to the exclusion of the more truly religious sentiments , such as fear , awe , reverence ; in short , when , for the God of love is substituted a mere deification of love , we must be excused from it altogether . True , we are told , " God is bye ; " but then we are also told , " God is a consuming fire ; " that is , to imperfect beings . He is an object of fear as well as loveand , we may add , of fear in proportion as they are imperfect . On this point , therefore , we will venture to suggest there is such a thing as an union of love and fear  --  a thing which our author , in common with many others who have grown wise beyond what is written , probably can not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , is , indeed , comparatively easy ; but then either of these , and especially the former , is considerably worse than nothing . For when one gets to loving without fear , he is apt to presume he has the perfect love which casteth out fear ; forgetting that , according to this , there must be some fear for love to cast out , and that none but a perfect love has a right to cast it out ; so that his love becomes proud , conceited , irreverent-is , indeed , no love at all , but only a sort of appetite . Thus do all such supercelestial aspirations generally end in rather subterranean attainments . Scorning so base a sentiment as fear , and reaching at once to thenobler sentiment of love , we only miss them both . The truth is , we have to begin with the humbler virtues before we can reach , and in order to reach , the higher . Our feelings can not leap from earth to heaven at one bound ; they have to climb up over many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there ; and it is to be feared they will hardly get there at all , if they scorn the degrees by which it is appointed for them to ascend . If . therefore , we can rise to so high a feeling as fear , we may account it a special gift of grace ; and when we find ourselves free from fear , we may be assured we are below it . But is not love the fulfilling of the law ? Yes ; and so is the flower the perfecting of the plant ; but , as nature now is , and will probably continue to be , we have to accept of several things before we can get the flower , and even cultivate them in order to get it ; and what kind of floriculture is that which prizes the flower so much as to dispense with the root , the stalk and the leaves ? In like manner , assuredly , all love that is worth the name , begins with fear , and grows out of it ; is , in some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // into that reverence which evermore walks softly and fearfully , is meek , and modest , and reserved , as feeling unworthy to approach its object , yet hungering and thirsting to be near him . Accordingly , in a book written some centuries ago , we read of a wisdom which begins with fear . This wisdom our author seems to have renounced . Probably he started above it ; started with the perfect love which casteth out fear . He seems , indeed , to entertain a good degree of contempt for those who are so bigoted as to begin with fear ; and expressly tells us , " Nor bates the book one tittle of the truth To smooth its way to favor with the fearful . " Accordingly the book is , without exception , the most irreverent thing we have ever seen . Instead of putting his shoes from off his feet when he comes to holy ground , he rather puts on an additional pair . He wears his loftiest looks when in the awfulest Presence ; and gives us the gratifying information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none who hath A heart of kindness , reverence and love , But dare look God in the face and ask His smile . " Following out this principle , he everywhere practices a familiarity with sacred things which is really the grossest form of irreverence ; a familiarity which is far worse than the most violent antipathy , because it fondles and caresses but to desecrate and degrade . His manner towards such things is , emphatically , hail , fellows , well met ! He evidently belongs to that class of worshipers whose motto is , " let us go boldly to the throne of graci* ; " and who do go boldly , as if their Maker were their equal . Nay , well-bred gentlemen treat their equals with a far more distant and ceremonious respect than these worshipers do their Maker . We may , indeed , say this manner proceeds from love ; but it is only that kind of love which prompts to the violation of its object . Aversion to our Maker is apt to be at least distant and reserved , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the confidence which implies no distrust of ourselves . And yet this author has the coolness to assure us , " All that is said of Deity , is said In love and reverence . " Why , he has n't reverenee enough to feel his want of it ; is so totally empty of it as to think himself brimful of it . He is , in short , so far from having reverence , that he even knows not what it is ! Now , nothing is so petrifying to the religious sensibilities as this moving amongst sacred things without corresponding emotions ; the more we inspect and handle such things without confessing their sacredness , the more do we become hardened against them ; and when we get so fond of them as to hug and kiss all the sanctity off them , our love has obviously fallen into dotage , or something worse . It is often unsafe for us to see , until we are prepared to adore ; many things ought to be hidden from the eye until the heart is made ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gazing at what angels fear to look on . Accordingly certain truths seem to have been veiled from the understanding , on purpose that they might first make a lodgment in the heart . They come as mysteries-truths enveloped in awful obscurity  --  to affect us through finer senses , deeper avenues than the understanding knows of ; to inspire us , in ways past our finding out , with certain sentiments ; so that the mind has to become humble , and reverent , and submissive , in order to know them . They thus begin at the heart  --  the centre of our being-and build outwards ; while , if they began at the surface  --  the understanding  --  to build inwards , they would only obstruct and foreclose the ground they were building on ; block up their very access and passage to the heart . Indeed , the mind is made apprehensive of them only by this moral or religious preparation ; without this , all the knowledge it gets of them only " puffeth up ; " and wo be to the hand that shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the understanding-before we have learnt to revere them ; for after we have learnt to revere them , we shall hardly wish to see them dissected and anatomized . When they have wrought their appropriate effect in subduing , chastening , and humbling us , then the understanding acting subordinately , may also act safely . But until they have done this , the understanding , acting independently , acts but to err ; for Providence , ever wiser and kinder to us than we can be to ourselves , will have us act by faith , not by knowledge , and has so ordered things that we see but to stumble , and the better our sight the more we stumble , unless // our path be strewn with light from heaven . We have sor*ietimes almost doubted whether Milton did not overstep the bounds of strict propriety , in making so free as he did with holy names and persons : in this respect , however , Milton is modesty itself compared to the author of " Festus . " That our author may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is really no excuse for him . We have known men who sincerely thought themselves perfect ; but their sincerity , in our judgment , only made against them ; for nothing but the most overweening conceit of themselves could ever have made them sincere in such a conviction . Men may sincerely think themselves very religious , when they have no religion at all ; but , if they had any right feelings or principles in regard to themselves , they would not , in face of the admonitions and assurances given them , fall into such a piece of presumption . It is by preferring the voice that speaks within them , to the voice that speaks from above , that they get thus deceived and betrayed . It is one of the lies which they are all the guiltier for being duped by . Nevertheless , " Festus " comes to us a sacred poem . Men , it seems , whose honesty we dislike to question , whose judgment we wish to respect , " have been much impressed with its sacred , Christian character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with their statements respecting it , we knew not what to think , and were forced to conclude that either we or they " had eaten of the insane root that takes the reason prisoner . " Again we set about the poem , hoping and trying to correct our impression ; but it was of no use ; all our efforts to correct only went to confirm it . We have spared no pains to make our impression right , and we are satisfied it is right ; at all events , if it be wrong , it is , we fear , incorrigible . Eulogy after eulogy has been written upon the poem , but no voice , so far as we know , has been raised against it . Such being the case , we shall offer no apology for canvassing its claims , somewhat severely and at length , both as a work of art , and as a code of morals . The thing may , it is true , be above , or below , or beside our criticism ; nevertheless , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , indeed , be able to kill it , but , if it be made of penetrable stuff , we shall hope at least to bore some holes into it . Perhaps the only effect of all the wounds we can give will be to sting it into greater activity . Well , be it so ; for we feel assured that the more there be to get drunk on it now , the more there will be to curse it when they get sober again ; and one of nature 's methods for convincing men they are fools , that is , for making them wise , is , by betraying them into follies . Of course nothing so effectually teaches children to keep out of the fire as the getting well burnt . Most poets , when handling sacred themes , scrupulously avoid transcending the written Word . Oppressed , perhaps , with a kind of superstitious awe , they do not venture on any superscriptural announcements . They seem to think that , in writing on such subjects , reverence , modesty and reserve are entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and of good taste require that these elements be not altogether excluded ; that , in short , the Muses do not belong to that class of beings who " rush in where angels fear to tread . " But the author of " Festus " submits to no such slavery of the mind . From the freedom with which he makes original disclosures , one would think he had been specially authorized to oomplete the Revelation begun by the prophets and evangelists of old . Probably he draws from the same source with them ; is their compeer , not their pupil ; and , his authority being co-ordinate with theirs , of course he owes them no particular deference ; if he transcends their statements , it may be their fault , not his . We know not how else to account for such disclosures as the following . The Angel of Earth is represented as remonstrating against the threatened destruction of his world , on the ground of its being the altar on which was made the great sacrifice for sin . Ignorant , it seems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thinks the earth has been especially favored and hallowed in this event . The language in which he is answered will , of itself , sufficiently indicate the source of the answer . " Think not I lived and died for earth alone . My life is ever suffering for love . In judging and redeeming worlds is spent Mine everlasting being . " In another place he informs us , that " Who spurn at this world 's pleasures lie to God ; // And show they are not worthy of the next . The nearest point wherein we come towards God , Is loving-making love  --  and being happy . " Probably the prophets and apostles of old were either ignorant of these facts , or did not see fit to announce them . To be sure , the author works no miracles to accredit his revelations , unless the reception his hook has met with be a miracle ; but it is to be hoped men have now got sufficiently enlightened to recognize the truth without any such endorsement . Of course Heaven would not reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assuredly , such a man needs no miracles , for he will not be caught accepting a revelation on any other than internal evidence ; that is , its conformity to his reason. * , From the specimens we have given , it will be seen at once , that our author is a pretty bold thinker and speaker , especially for one so young . The book abounds in revelations which no one can fail to recognize as " highly important , if true . " Indeed , nothing strikes one oftener or harder , while reading it , than the anthor 's ' surprising familiarity with the Divine counsels . But , how much soever one may marvel at the contents of the book , he is by no means to doubt their truth . Of course such a modest youth would not venture thus to develope Christianity out of the chrysalis into the butterfly on his own responsibility . Accordingly he has taken care to inform us all about the source and occasion of his disclosures . " He spake inspired ; night and day thought came unhelped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with him ; and bade old Time unclasp his heart to the youth , and teach the book of ages . " And yet " the course of study he went through was of the soulrack . " Strange he should have racked his soul so terribly for thoughts which came unhelped and undesired . Perhaps , however , his labor was in prying open his soul to let the divine affiatus blow through . Again , speaking of himself , he tells us , " T is no task for suns To shine ; he knew himself a bard ordained , More than inspired , inspirited of God . " Thus it appears , the book and all its contents came through the author , not from him ; he was but an electrical rod , to draw down the lightnings of heaven VOL. v.-NO. r. 4 upon the sons of men ; and this book is the result of his drawings down . Surely no one has ever pretended to a higher mission , or brought better credentials . Coming with such authority he was doubtless justifiable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth , theref ? re , be urged as entitling him to impunity , or to clemency . The appropriate virtue of youth is modesty , and if he be old enough to abjure this , he is old enough to be treated simply as he deserves . In a passage of which we know not whether the poetry be more beautiful or the egotism more disgusting , the author says that he him-self , " Like other bards , was born of beauty , And with a natural fitness to draw down All tones and shades of beauty to his soul , Even as the rainbow-tinted shell , which lies Miles deep at bottom of the sea , hath all Colors of skies , an*flowers , and gems , and plumes , And all by nature which doth reproduce Like loveliness in seeming opposites . " And in another place he says , " He wrote the book , not in contempt of rule , And not in hate , but in the self-made rule That there was none to him , but to himself He was his sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this looks as if the author knew what he had done , and why he had done it ; and , at all events , did not mean to plead youth or ignorance in extenuation of faults ; and if , as he assures us , " Everything urged against it proves its truth And faithfulness to nature , " surely he and his admirers will rather thank than blame us for censuring it . His effrontery , in thus avowing what we had supposed everthing calling itself manhood would be ashamed to confess , is certainly deserving of wonder , if not of applause . But'tis part of his creed , that " hell is more bearable than nothingness : " and he seems to think that scorn of everything the past has looked upon as wise and good , is the surest way to win the favor of the present . Perhaps he is right in this , though we confess ourselves forced to regard it as rather an equivocal compliment to the present . The poem , we are informed in the outset , is a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the author 's own words , " a sketch of world-life ; " especially // " the life of youth , its powers , aims , deeds , failings ; the manifold and manifest foibles , follies , trials , sufferings of a young , hot , unschooled heart that has had its own way in life . " Of course , if the heart had not " had its own way in life , " the delineation would not be " a sketch of world-life , " as it is , since the hearts of the young are always left to their own instincts and impulses , without external gui ( lance or restraint . Again the author says , " All along it is the heart of man Emblemed , created and creative mind . " Nevertheless , our author does not , like other bards , draw man dressed " In manners , customs , forms , appear-ances , Laws , places , times , and countless acci-dents Of peace and polity ; " * * " It is a statued mind *nd naked heart Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the human mind stripped of everything adventitious , and presented without , concealment or disfigurement , in all its native , essential , universal elements and attributes . We may he assured , then , that here is " the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ; " that the author has pierced through the accidents of local and individual nature , to what is central and universal . If , therefore , we find anything here which seems to contradict our ob*ervation , it is because we have not gone far enough into things ; because we have stopped at or about the surface , while our author has gone to the centre and core . Nay , that he differs from all who have written before him , and even contradicts them , is itself a kind of proof that he is right ; for is it not a fact that others have given us merely some of the clothes and skin of humanity ? and must he not perforce contradict them , who grasps and nnfolds the heart ? Thus we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all others that we have seen . The more our author contradicts common experience , the more evidence we have of his superior insight . Festus himself is , it seems , the representative of all mankind ; an impersonation of the whole human race , concentrating and embodying all that belongs to man as man , and excluding all he has as a member of any particular nation , society , or family , " The mortal is the model of all men . " " The hero is the world-man in whose heart One passion stands for all , the most indulged . " Of course , therefore , the hero is as peculiar , as sni-generis , as the book itself ; we have never found anything at all resembling him . Hitherto it has been our fortune , or misfortune , to see iione but men of particular times and places ; the man of all times and places , or of no time nor place , we have never been so lucky as to meet with save in bad books : in short , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the model , the prototype of all men , . the one who was all without being any of them , we have not seen , or had not until we read " Festus . " So , also , of Lucifer ; he has nothing in common with any of the devils hitherto discovered ; he is a touch , or rather , several touches above all that heathenism has imagined , or Christianity revealed . We , in our simplicity , had always supposed Satan the enemy of God and man , ever laboring to defeat the one and destroy the othdr ; proud , rebellious , unteachable , and ungovernable ; a liar and deceiver , seducing men away from truth and right to their own destruction . But this is all a mistake . The devil , it seems , is but God 's shadow : " There is but one great right and good , and ill And wrong are shades thereof , not sub-stances , so that " God is all that the devil seems . " In other words , Satan turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguise ; the most obedient servant of God and the most untiring friend of man ; incurring God 's wrath that he may the better work out his will , and enticing men into sin that he may the better effect their salvation ; ever breaking the word of promise to the ear , but keeping it to the hope ; always uttering the profoundest truths , which seem lies , indeed , but only because they are so very profound that we can not see their truth . To be sure , he seems the enemy of God and man , striving to defeat the one and destroy the other ; but this is because he ksiows the shortest road to perfect holiness and happiness lies through the opposite extremes of wickedness and misery : so that , if men would reach heaven , they must not turn about , but drive faster ahead ; and , instead of forsaking the // devil , try to outstrip him in the way he is going . Our author and the devil have ascertained that , " When creatures stray Farthest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as the sun beams hotliest on The earth when distant most ; " and that " death is but the meeting together of destruction and salvation , " so that when death is threatened to the guilty , the meaning is , they shall he destroyed into salvation . Now , we would not pretend to doubt the truth of this representation ; but we wonder our author should thus let out the secret of the devil 's good intentions toward us , lest by so doing he might defeat them . The devil obviously can succeed in his benevolent purposes , only on condition that we be kept ignorant of them . He is , indeed , a sort of holy , beneficent traitor , who does evil only that good may come ; who has to seem our enemy , in order to be our friend ; whose business it is to smuggle good into us under the disguise of evil : to seduce us into righteousness , and betray us into heaven . To acquaint us , therefore , with his designs , is certainly the surest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall hardly consent to go along with him , after we have learnt to what a meeting of extremes he is leading us . Assuredly , if men choose darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil , they will be apt to back out of the darkness , when told what a flood of light they are approaching . Strange our author did not think of this , and conclude it best to leave the revelation of such things where the Scriptures have left it . But perhaps he thinks the time has now come for the mysteries to be opened . For the present , however , we are chiefly concerned with the book as a work of art . The beginning of the poem seems to have been suggested by a passage in the book of Job : " Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them . " The scene opens in heaven , with a hymn from the Seraphim and Cherubim to the Creator , which is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ending in a prayer for liberty to tempt " a certain youth among the sons of men . " Of course his request , urged with so much zeal and devotion , is immediately granted ; whereupon proclamation is made , that the destined victim of his benevolent enmity , as one of the elect , is " Hallowed to the ends of Heaven , That though he plunged his soul in sin like a sword In water , it shall nowise cling to him . " Next comes an announcement to the heavenly host , that the world is to end with the hero 's life ; at which announcement the angel of earth , who , it seems , has not pried so deeply into the Divine counsels as our author , is greatly distressed ; but Lucifer , aware that the end of the present world is to be but the beginning of a better , is as greatly delighted . " The world shall perish as a worm Upon destruction 's path ; the universe Evanish like a ghost before the sun , Yea , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than death shall perish . " And is the whole universe , then , nothing but death ? But this , we presume , is one of the profound inconsistencies which the author boasts of , probably as evincing his competency to make new revelations . Perhaps , however , while opening the old mysteries , he thought best to supply their place with new ones ; and this is one of the substitutes . The preliminaries to the temptation being all adjusted in the first scene , the second brings us pat upon the hero himself . Festus , who , though hitherto untempted , we should think had just emerged from a debauch , where he has reveled himself into satiety and disgust , comes before us musing upon the vanity of earthly pleasures , and the meanness of human life . Though blest through child-hood " With all the sweet and sacred ties of life , The prayerful love of parents , pride of friends , Prosperity , and health , and ease , the aids Of learning , social converse with the good And gifted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high spirits , loving truth And wisdom for their own divinest selves ; " still , even in youth , he finds he can enjoy " Nought which has not the honied sting of sin ; That wanton whetting of the soul , which , while It gives a finer , keener edge for pleasure , Wastes more and dulls the sooner : " // and since his heart has got " dizzy with its drunken dance , " he is resolved , that " the voluptuous vanities of life " shall " Enchain , enchant , and cheat his soul no more . " * * * " What of **ll things here is worth a thought ? How mean , how miserable every care ! And then , the ceaseless , changeless , hopeless round Of weariness , and heartlessness and wo , And vice and vanity Such are his melancholy reflections on this occasion . Presently , however , he glides into a very pious , philanthropic mood ; ( who knows not that a life of debauchery is the shortest road to true philanthropy ? ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind ; he waxes vastly ambitious of moral and intellectual power ; longs to he the " sun-mind " of creation , that he may " warm the world to love , and worship , and bright life . " Rather an inauspicious state of mind , one would think , for the tempter to find him in ; nevertheless , Lucifer is a brave fellow and resolves to attack him . How Festus Lshould have got so sick of the pleasures of sin without being tempted before , the author does not inform us ; in this case he seems the tempter rather than the tempted . The devil , however , has kept an eye upon him , waiting till he should become temptable before venturing upon him . Lucifer had " heard his prayer , " and seen " The secret longings , unsaid thoughts , Which prey upon his heart , like night fires on A heath ; " and , " knowing his high , proud heart , " " To test its worth , and show he held it brave , " he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but as the soul of hell and evil , " " To proffer him the earth ; to set Him on a throne  --  the throne of will un-boundTo crown his life with liberty and joy , And make him free and mighty even as himself . " * * * * * " Pleasure , and love , and unimagined beautyAll , all that is delicious , brilliant , great , Of worldly things , " Lucifer offers him ; and , knowing " the worm of sin has eaten out his heart " so that he can not enjoy them , vows to " renew it in him ; " to make it " The bosom favorite of every beauty , Even as a rosebud ; " so that he shall " Render happy By naming who may love him . " But this is not half that Lucifer will do for him ; " All secrets he shall ken , all mysteries construe At nothing marvel ; all the veins which stretch Unsearchable by human eyes , of lore Most precious , most profound , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still the bait , big as it is , does not take ; perhaps it is rather too big for Festus to swallow . He has entire faith , to be sure , in all Lucifer says ; but appears somewhat coy or sullen , and denies his suit , though , perhaps , only to make him sue the harder . There is , it seems , but one thing for which Festus will sell himself to Lucifer ; and that is the assurance of immortality : " To know he has a deathless soul , he would lose it . " This assurance Lucifer for some time declines giving him , but , after much wrangling and some white-lying , finally gives it by calling up the spirit of his deceased lady-love ; whereupon Festus strikes a bargain with him . Festus , it is true , has a pretty strong faith in immortality all the while , but he wants some reasons for his faith , and gets quite desperate in quest of them . Why Lucifer so obstinately withholds those reasons from him , and tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed . Perhaps this is one of the cases where , as the author tells us , " the lines have undermeanings ; " something esoteric and accessible only to the initiated . However , Lucifer yields at last , when he sees there is no other way to catch him ; so that it is not so much a triumph of Lucifer over Festus , as of Festus over Lucifer . Possibly Lucifer keeps back this assurance from policy , " lest too light winning might make the prize light ; " for its only effect on Festus , so far as we can see , is , to puff him up with pride of immortality , and renew his appetite for worldly pleasures . No sooner is Festus assured of a future life , than he ascertains by the light of his // own reason , and in spite of Lucifer 's arguments to the contrary , that it is to be a happy one . Here follows a pretty fierce encounter of wit and logic in regard to future retribution . Whether Lucifer advocates the doctrine of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , or to confirm him in an opposite opinion , is left in doubt . At all ovents , Festus finds philosophy and philanthropy so much against the doctrine , that not even the devil himself can persuade him to accept it . He has ascertained , it seems , that " sin is not of the spirit , but of the flesh which blindeth spirit ; " and that , being of the flesh , it must necessarily perish with the flesh . Besides , to admit that men are to be punished hereafter , is to admit that they deserve to be punished ; and he loves them too well to admit that . With philosophy and philauthropy thus on his side , he of course floors the devil . Though he nowhere catches Lucifer in a lie , he appears to take for granted that he is rather given to fibbing , and that , in his arguing for a future punishment , " the wish is father to the thought . " This doctrine seems to be one of the stated means whereby Lucifer seduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them into sin as deeply as possible , on the ground that , the greater the sin , the greater the salvation ; a thing which , as we have already seen , it is Lucifer 's vocation to promote to the utmost of his ability . In all this , the author so totally re : verses all the ordinary grounds and motives of human action , that we are not quite sure we have caught his true meaning . We are so used to seeing things by day-light , that we can not see them so well in the dark . However , next follows a pretty fine love-scrape , wherein our hero revels in the most voluptuous images and anticipations , protesting to the fair object , that in vain he " Strives to love aught of earth or heaven but her ; She is his first , last , only love nor shall Another ever tempt his heart . " In this state of mind he is visited with a most supernatural insight , with " the ken of Angels , " so that neither sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite " through the forms of things into their essence , " and even through the mysteries of life , death and immortality ; all of which , by the way , is the work of love and Lucifer . " This wild and whirlwind touch of pas-sion Which , though it hardly lit upon the lip , With breathless swiftness sucked his soul out of sight So that he lost it , and all thought of it , " seems to have detached his affections somewhat from his " foe-friend . " Their next meeting , which takes place in Anywhere , begins with a downright blowup : however , after some pretty fierce scolding , and threatening , and fire-spitting , they get reconciled and start off on their enterprise , the one to fulfill his promises , the other to reap the harvest of their fulfillment . Passing by the market-place of a country town , where men are busy at their callings , the two get deeply engaged about the greatness and littleness of human life , when Lucifer takes occasion to urge upon his pupil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindless of the past and future , on the ground " that nothing but what is , is ; " until they fall in with a funeral procession following the remains of one who , it seems , has died of a broken heart , because Festus had deserted her . Festus joins in mourningfor her , and , finding her much lovelier in death than she was alive , he very sagely concludes , that , after all , " living is but a foolish habit , " and means to break himself of it soon . At thc close of the obsequies , the two have a deal of " exquisite fine fun , " in practicing religious quackeries upon the crowd . Putting on the style of a " mad ranter , " Lucifer harangues the people in a kind of sanctified buffoonery which reminds us powerfully of what we have sometimes heard at camp-meetings and revivals . This is followed by an extempore prayer from Festus , as long and dull as ever came from the lips of a puritan preacher ; at the close of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the two pass on highly delighted with the trick they have been playing . As Lucifer 's first business is to minister to his pupil 's passion for knowledge , the two set out on a voyage of discovery , and take a very rapid aerial trip round the world , studying Geography as they pass . Returning from this tour they go to a village feast , for the purpose , apparently , of studying human nature . Here they meet all sorts of people , if not more , and , what with joking , singing , dancing , card-playing , and much profound talk on various subjects , scientific , religious , and political , have as mer // ry a time as need be . After avisit to the centre of the earth , " in the fire-crypts of the world , " - where they do.not stay long , because such deep researches awaken high aspirations , and make them long for light ,  --  they encounter in their travels , a ruined temple , once sacred to the stin ; when Festus , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that " the truly holy soul , which bath received the unattainable , can hallow hell , " turns aside to indulge in religious exercises . He elects himself priest and makes " a sacred offering to God , " well assured , that one whom " God has hallowed by choosing him , lacks not consecration at best hands . " In these proceedings Lucifer takes no part , except to furnish fire , wherewith to kindle the sacrifice . For their next lesson they resort to a huge metropolis , and cultivate an acquaintance with city life . This is followed by a short trip to the Planet Venus , where , among other spirits , Festus finds " the holy Muse , " with whorh he waxes amazingly poetical , and the deceased Angela , his first and only love , whose presence throws him into the ecstacy of passion . Thus Festus circulates about the universe , rolling and rioting , and carousing in all the luxuries of love , knowled , , , e , worship , and dominion . Not a promise has Lucifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fulfilled " He is an universal favorite ; Old men admire him deeply for his beauty , Young women for his genius and strict virtue , And young men for his modesty and wis-dom ; All turn to him , whene'er he speaks , full-faced , Like planets to the sun , or owls to a rushlight . " He is , as we should say , death among ladies ; perfectly irresistible ; all whom he approaches fall before him , and he before them . As susceptible as he is captivating , he finds every lady he meets the purest , sweetest , loveliest creature he has ever seen , and makes as many broken hearts as he finds beautiful faces . His love is always of that deep , divine sort which lasts only while the object is present , and which waxes deeper and diviner the closer he gets to her ; so redundant is his generosity of heart , that he can not choose but embrace every beauty he meets ; and no sooner does he embrace one than she melts in his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole book is stuffed with the very epicurism of love . On the whole , Festus is rather the most versatile , tumultuous , and ravishing lover we shall anywhere find . After solving all the mysteries , pocketing all the secrets , and sipping all the delights of creation ; after visiting heaven and stealing thence some fine jewelry for his lady-love ; after vanous short excursions , one through space , one to Everywhere , one to Hell , one to Nowhere , one to a lady 's drawing-room , besides sundry other pk ces too nuinerous to mention , extracting and concentrating the essence of them all ; and finally , after a series of most ecstatic gallantries with one of Lucifer 's best , divinest ladies ; - after all this , and a great deal more , our hero mounts the throne of the world , and gives his law to the nations , which law is , that they shall all do just precisely as they have a mind to . No sooner has he grasped the reins of universal empire , than death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they all migrate forthwith to the skies . Here follows a general mixing up of all things , heaven , earth , and hell , angels , men and devils ; but the love of heaven proves too much for the sin of both the other places , and the absorption of the latter , with all its contents , into the former , constitutes the catastrophe of the drama . Such is a brief outline of this stupendous poem . As the book gives a birdseye view of all things and more too , so we have aimed to give a birds-eye view of the book . If this abstract does not astonish the reader , we know of nothing short of the book itself that will . But is there not some occult meaning in all this ? Do the persons and events of the drama stand simply for themselves , or are they meant to body forth some general truth ? Doubtless the meaning is occult ,  --  so very occult , we fear , that no one , not even the author himself , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to inform us that the book is very deep , " the meaning always dwellin* in the word in secret sanctity . " We have brought to the work all the patience and perseverance we are master of , and yet are by no means sure we have even caught a glimpse of its interior significance . Though the author has devoted a whole scene to the special interl ) retation of his book , the utmost we can arrive at are conjectures respecting its meaning . Probably this results , in part , // from the fact , that the religion of the book , if it have any , is pretty much the reverse of all that the world has been used to regard as such . As nearly , however , as we can guess , Festus represents the human mind , and Lucifer the principle of evil , guiding and impelling the human mind to the acquisition of knowledge . here the doctrine obviously is , that man comes at truth only by the mediation and ministration of evil ; and hence , as all truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though seemingly the enemy of man , is really his best friend , and , though seemingly the antagonist of God , is really his prime minister . The human mind gets inspired ( whether of heaven or hell is uncertain ) with a raging thirst for knowledge and , goaded on by this thirst , sells itself to evil-like Goethe 's Faust to Mephistophiles-for the means and sources of gratification . The trips which Festus takes to various parts of the universe , at the leading and instigation of Lucifer , are the excursions of the human mind , under temptation in quest of truth . Thus , the devil conducts the soul to the knowledge of God : evil to the knowledge of good . The women , whom Festus falls so desperately in love with from time to time , represent Beauty , ever changing her form , yet ever the same in essence ; and the hero 's passion for them , represents the mind 's instinctive love of the beautiful , in whatever form it appears . Our author 's doctrine is , that " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And by that love they are redeemable ; For , in love and beauty they acknowledge good , And good is God . " Accordingly it is to this principle-love of the beautiful-that Lucifer directs his main exertions . Perhaps we ought to remark , by the way , that , in our author 's view , truth and beauty are the same thing seen through the different media of reason and affection ; now the object of thought , uoxv of love . Hence when Festus , instigated by a presentiment of immortality , waxes clamorous for assurance of a future life , and demands that a spirit be raised for him , Lucifer denies his request , and even disclaims the power to grant it . When , however , he finds that the hero 's anxiety comes from his intense passion for the beautiful , projecting itself beyond the present life , and burning for the perpetual enjoyment of its object , he immediately owns his deceptions and meets the hero 's demand by calling up the departed Angela , who , it seems , is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen his heart . Thus Lucifer cunningly waits till he has engaged the hero 's heart in the work , before opening to him the sources of knowledge , aware , no doubt , that the head will not continue to work unless the heart work with it ; that the mind will not keep up its interest in truth as truth , unless interested in it as beauty at the same time ; that , in short , whatever would permanently engage the thoughts , must first engage the passions . The universal favor which Festus enjoys , especially among the women , probably signifies the popularity naturally consequent upon mental and moral power ; that is , the tendency of human nature to hero-worship . In the hero 's roving about miscellaneously through Anywhere , Everywhere , Elsewhere and Nowhere , stopping on his way at all the intermediate places-now exploring the centre of the earth , that is , descending into himselfnow exploring the heights of heaventhat is , ascending up to God-we have the twofold influence of truth and beauty , acting at once as antagonists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love te knowledge-through which the devil is enabled to keep the soul busy , in working out its own salvation . The crowning of Festus king of all nations and people , of course prefigures the passage of knowledge into power  --  the future subjection of all things to the law of mental and moral might ; when the human mind , having conquered and subdued the world , has no further use for it , and , tossing into the jaws of destruction , starts off in quest of other worlds to conquer . Thus , the mind 's innate , indestructible love of truth , beauty , and power , is the means by which Satan gets it under his control . But , though the human mind pursues these objects as evil , they necessarily become good in its possession ; for evil is but the shadow of good , and of course the mind has to grasp the substance in order to retain the shadow . I-however , as the mind is selfish and sinful by nature , truth and beauty are at first acceptable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for its own sake , but keeps them for theirs ; using them only as means of selfgratification , it comes to love them as ends , and to forget self in view of them ; nay , it // even braves , or ratherembraces hell to compass them ; and thus the extreme of selfassertion passes naturally into the opposite extreme of self-renunciation . This selfish , sinful passion of the mind for truth and beauty ; this loving them only for the pleasure it may have of them , until the passion is finally driven to a complete annulling of self , is probably shadowed forth in the hero 's ecstatic gallantries with his last lady-love , when he appears willing to commit all sin and incur all suffering , provided that , by doing so , he may become one with the object of his passion . This willingness to do and suffer all evil , for the sake of an union with truth and beauty , is , of course , the height of disinterestedness ; and thus do the extremes of sinfulness and holiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nearly as we can gather , is the deep significance of this deeply significant production . The one idea , however , ( if it be proper to call it an idea , ) which rides paramount over the whole book , and imparts to it whatever of unity it possesses , is that of love triumphing in , through , and over every other principle . It is this principle which suffers evil to run riot through creation ; which kindled the fires of hell and plunged the devil into them ; which now lets , or rather sends him out on errands of salvation to man ; and which acts alike within *and upon the soul , at once prompting and punishing , preventing and forgiving , sin . The angels rebelled from love ; the devil tempts from love ; and men sin from love . Love , in short , s a kind of spiritual gravitation acting towards and from the Centre and Soul of the imiverse over all created intelligence ; so that the faster and farther they run from that Centre , the sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be drawn back into it . As this principle attains its highest development in the highest persons , so God 's love towards his creature reaches its culmination when the creature , preferring suffering to submission , braves and defies his Maker on the ground that " it is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven . " In this way is the creature brought " To know God 's love is more than all his sin , And prove unto himself that nought but God Can satisfy the soul He maketh great . " Surely , after this , no one will accuse the book of unoriginality . It has originality enough to have damned Shakspeare fifty times . Such being the plan of the work , our next concern is with the execution . The reader will please observe , that we have no quarrel with the author 's plan ; we do not pretend to criticise it , but only to give a statement of it . As an artist ( and it is in this character that we have now to deal with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw fit ; his execution , however , is subject to the judgment of others . The book , be it remembered , comes to us as a poem ; and not only so , but as a sacred poem . By a poem we of course mean a work of art ; that is , a consistent , harmonious , organic whole . Now , we shall maintain that the book does not fulfill the conditions of such a work ; that it has nothing of the nature of a poem except the form ; that it is not entitled to any place whatever , not even the lowest , among works of art . The rank of artist , we are aware , is one which many very wise and good men have striven to reach , but have not been able ; the falling short of it , therefore , ought not of itself to deprive the aspirant of a kind and even commendatory criticism . The truth is , works of art , in poetry , that is , poems , are not nearly so plenty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different order of production ; and many things have been produced , which , though not good enough to be admitted into this order , are , nevertheless , very good ; and their authors have deserved , and have received , well of mankind for producing them . Assuredly , therefore , our author ought not to be blamed merely for failing to give us a work of art ; he might have given us much wholesome instruction or harmless pleasure in a far humbler form . An author is not to be censured , or denied a place in the Temple of Fame , because he has not the genius of Homer or Shakspeare . But what we do blame our author for is , that , without the ability to produce a work of art , he should have undertaken to originate a new religionthat , without the genius of a Homer or a Shakspeare , he should have presumed to accomplish what Homer and Shakspeare had too much modesty to attempt . With little or none of the modesty of genius , he has ventured on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as a work of art , to say nothing of its pretensions as a reli , , ious work . In a sacred poem , one would // really think a recognition of sacredness were the last element to be omitted . The sentiment of awe is the most essential constituent of such a poem , simply as a poem ; it enters into the very idea of treating a sacred subject , we do not say morally , hut poetically . But our author , as we have already seen , has such a perfect love of holy things , that he carries no more awe amongst them than a child amongst his playthings . To treat divine and human persons , as he does , with equal freedom and familiarity , is , obviously , to mistreat them both ; it supposes an equality between them which does not exist ; in a word , it is at strife with the harmony , and therefore at strife with the poetry , of things . Perhaps our author 's reverence is so transcendental an emotion that it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he somewhere tell us , " True faith nor biddeth nor abideth form . " His religion may , it is true , have risen above form ; if so , then all we have to say is , it is too high to be poetical ; it may , indeed , be something better than poetry , but it is not poetry , and never will be until it stoops to a formal expression . But the book is not only without the moral elements of a poem on a sacred subject , but is without the literary elements of a poem on any subject . To this latter point we shall now address ourselves . We will try the work , not by any external standard , not by the examples or the authority of others , but by itself . The author claims to be , and claims the right to be , a law unto himself . By this he probably means , that his work is organic ; that , as such , its laws are innate ( for this enters into the very idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work does not conform , and ought not to conform , to any external rules , but contains within itself the reason why it is so , and not otherwise . We will not dispute the author 's right , as an artist , to be a law unto himself ; nor will we prescribe his tribunal , but meet him at the tribunal of his own choosing . Doubtless all true works of art are organic , and as such do contain their laws within themselves . The question , then , is , not whether " Festus " conforms to the examples of other artists , but whether it conforms to the principles of organic life . Caliban , for example , though altogether unlike any other character ever known or conceived , is , nevertheless , a character ; andthat is enough to establish the author 's claim as an artist . Assuredly " Festus " has a right to be tried by its own innate laws , provided it have any . If , however , the law of the work be innate , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , be found to pervade and inform the whole structure , bringing all the parts into harmony and consistency , making them true to themselves , and to each other ; in a word , making them all homogeneous and interdependent . By the dramatic form of his work , the author of course promised a development of character , an embodiment of life . In the preface , moreover , he promised that the hero should represent mankindshould be an impersonation of humanity itself , especially of youth . Here we expected to find what is most permanent and universal in human nature , gathered up into a form of individual life , and thus brought home to our sympathies and perceptions as men ;  --  a concentration of humanity in whom we could all see more or less of ourselves , and of what is most inward and essential in ourselves . Again , the first scene led us to expect , in Lucifer , the evil spirit of the universe impersonated , as the source of bad impulses and bad influences to men  --  a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have so often met and struggled against , seldom with much success , often with none at all . In the intercourse between these two persons we hoped to get some further knowledge , or at least an instructive reflection of what we already knew , respecting the origin , progress , consequence and remedy of moral evil : innocence eTlsnared by cunning , conscience overborne by temptation , sin entering the soul in the disguise of happiness , but leading on , under Providence , to suffering , and suffering , through grace , to repentance , and repentance , to the peaceable fruits of righteousness . Such , we said , were our expectations ; rather , such would have been our expectations , had we not known that great promises are apt to end in small performances . But , had we cherished all the hopes our author seemed anxious to inspire , not one of them would have been realized , or would have begun to be realized . The hero , it seems to us , is in no wise an impersonation of youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To our mind , there is n* more of character in him than in a triangle , or an octagon . We can not think , // we will almost defy any body to think , of him as a personal existence . Instead of embodying the elements of humanity , the author simply generalizes from himself , and that too , not from what is central and permanent , but from what is most superficial and transient , in himself . He shows no grasp or perception of universal truth , but only mistakes and substitutes his individual impressions for it . Festus does not represent humanity ; he does not represent even the author ; he does not , properly speakin' , represent anything ; he is merely the author 's mouthpiece , venting divers whims , and notions , and crotchets , which have usurped the surface of the author 's mind ; things not growing up from his nature , or involving his individuality , but superinduced upon him by particular circumstances ; and of which all we can say is , he believes them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no he at all , but only it ; a mere name under which the author gives out various crude and inconsistent theories which he does not himself understand , hut utters by rote , and will probably cast off as soon as he comes to understand them . The whole delineation of Festus appears the work of one trying to fancy situations which he can not enter into , and passions which he can not reproduce , and of which he knows not the laws . Youth is the period when the mind is peculiarly open to impressions and influences from without , and when the character is peculiarly apt to be moulded , modified , developed by circumstances . The same is the case , indeed , though in a less degree , at all the subsequent periods of life . Such is the nature and condition of humanity itself . But there is no growth , no progress , no development , in Festus . As he goes in , so he comes out ; ends no better or worse than he begins . Though under temptation throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the most powerful of influences , still he is uninfluenced . Nothing , indeed , but a walking bundle of notions could possibly go through what he does without experiencing an entire revolution of mind and character . To be sure , he utters different things from time to time , but we can easily see he utters them all from the same mind-as a vessel varies its contents , not its capacity ; is sad , merry , severe and silly by turns , without any assignable cause or consequence . Though constantly thrown amidst scenes and objects that are adapted , had he any character , to give him the deepest impressions , and impart an entire new cast and coloring to his thoughts and feelings ; still he takes no impression , but keeps recurring to the same old topics ; thinks , feels , speaks , and acts precisely as at first ; undergoes , indeed , no perceptible change whatever , except a change of place and of time . Or rather , he changes just about as much as the author may be supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed or influenced by the scenes and objects he encounters , than the author was by fancying them . Even when most interested in the things he has seen , he talks about them , not as if he were thinking of them , but as if he were thinking of himself , and trying what fine things he could say , and how finely he could say them . He is always expressing a longing for death which no man could feel , and expressing it in situations where no man could affect it . He is represented all along as a desperate lover , and yet , whendeepest in love , with the object before him , he speaks , not in the passion-prompted style of a lover to his mistress , but in the vanity-prompted style of an author to his audience . Though set forth as an impassioned genius , still , in his most impassioned moments , he falls into those very incoherencies of thought , and , what is worse , into that contemptible admiration and ostentation of his feelings , which it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most deeply moved , instead of expressing his emotions , he goes to analyzing them , and talking about them ; and this is just what a man would not do in such a state of mind . Everywhere , indeed , he presents the singular inconsistency of a mind most incontroversive when most receptive ; that is , of a mind most occupied with itself when most absorbed in outward things . For example , when he stops at the ruined temple to worship his Maker , he goes straight to talking about his soul 's being holy since it has received the unattainable , and about his not lacking consecration at best hands since God has hallowed by choosing him . Thus , under an impulse to praise his Maker , he falls to praising himself ; glorifies , so to speak , his ability and inclination to glorify God ; is most conscious of his own holiness when most impressed with the holiness of the Being he is about to worship . Assuredly no person , when religiously prompted , would or could think and speak thus ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such a // state of mind , would not and could not speak or think of . That a man should thus be deeply impressed with beautiful objects and with the beauty of his emotions at the same time , is of course a perfect contradiction ; it is as if one should be thinking most of himself when most forgottin , , , himself in external things . The truth is , the author is here giving out certain notions of his own touching the state , fate , and rights of every individual man simply as man ; notions which , if carried out , would preclude the very actions they are represented as prompting , but which the author is so bent on inculcating , that he thrusts them in precisely where they are most out of place . He has a certain transcendental theory , according to which , God has made all things holy , by making them ; and all men are full of the unattainable who have fallen in love with a beautiful woman , or had certain sensations so very exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man may be a priest and a church unto himself , and may consider himself divinely called and consecrated to the priestly office as often and as long as he feels inclined to exercise it . Thus , had we time and space we could easily show that the delineation of Festus violates all the laws of character and passion , and exemplifies all the vices of a conceited and opinionated author ; that , in short , the whole thing is false-false to truth , false to nature , false to itself , false to everything it purports to be . The representation of Lucifer is , if possible , still worse than that of Festus . The former is as untrue to the laws of action , as the latter is to the laws of passion . In the first place , Lucifer goes to heaven for a license , and then visits earth for an opportunity , to tempt one whom he knows to be " sick of the joys of sense ; " whose heart has been " eaten out by the worm of sin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " God 's love seems lost upon him . " Though coming to Festus to blight his innocence and crush his hopes , he finds and expects to find him already stained with guilt , and bereft of hope , and abusing the world because he has sinned away the capacity to enjoy it . But , though he comes to Festus as a tempter , he throws off all disguise , and presents himself as the naked soul of bell and evil . Now , we can not put these two ideas together ; the mind will not recognize them as compatible . To say temptation comes in such a shape , is to say it is no temptation at all . A , , ain , while professedly laboring to deprave Festus , Lucifer keeps introducing him to objects and persons whose influence he knows will be to elevate and purify him ; indeed , the tendency of his whole proceedings is , to make Festus wiser and better . Such , we say , is their tendency , not their result , though such would be their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , there is no result in the case . All along , indeed , Lucifer presents the strange absurdity of a devil pretending to act against God and for himself , yet doing what he knows will be for God and against himself . It is as if Satan had tempted Eve by telling her she should surely die ; as if we should set examples of virtue before people to make them vicious , or put them under good instruction to keep them ignorant , or threaten them with punishment to involve them in crime . The representation thus violates all the principles of action knoxvn to us ; we can not conceive of a being 's acting thus on such grounds and with such aims ; the thing not only contradicts reason , experience and Revelation , but con* tradicts and nullifies itself . Here , too , the anther has manifestly adopted and repeated certain theories , without understanding them ; theories that are mutually exclusive , irreconcilable ; or , if they be reconcilable , he has not developed , nor , we will venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps he goes on the principle of freely saying whatever he thinks to be true , believing , of course , that all truth must be consistent with itself . Lucifer , indeed , is just as much the author 's mouth-piece as Festus ; and the author is so wrapped up in his own impressions , that he keeps substituting them for objective realities . The result is , that Lucifer , though the master of Festus , proves but a sort of occasion to him , and speaks and acts but to call him up and draw him out . For example , Lucifer denies to Festus a future life , that he may give Festus an opportunity to prove it ; that is , the author denies a future life to himself , that he may give himself an opportunity to prove it . Again , Lucifer , that is , the author , advocates the doctrine of future punishment , that he may present an occasion for Festus , that is , for himself , to refute it ; like a man playing chess with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to move on the other . It is part of our author 's // creed , that every man makes his own hell ; in other words , that there is no hell for a man , except the one within him . As Lucifer comes from hell , the author probably intends him merely as a projection , so to speak , of the hero 's own mind ; that is , an outward presentation to him of the evil passions and propensities within him . Of course , therefore , Lucifer is not the source of bad impulses to Festus , but the substance of those impulses themselves , realized to him objectively . Viewed dramatically , Lucifer appears as an agent without any will ; a sort of conscious , self-determining instrument ; moving , or , rather , moved , and knowing he is moved , by necessity and volition at the same time ; doing things at once because he wills to do them , and because he can not help doing them ; using means which he knows will defeat , and means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a deceiver and betrayer , yet scrupulous to keep all his promises , and realize all the hopes he awakens ; a " good enemy , " a " foe-friend . " We speak of him in contradictions , because we know no other forms of speech at all applicable to him , or descriptive of him . This may , indeed , be a true account of the devil ; but , if ever so true , it is one which the human mind is not constituted to understand . Of course we know not what spheres of existence a transcendentalist may have access to , but Lucifer reverses all the laws of existence known to us ; he is not merely supernatural , but strictly anti-natural , according to all the ideas we have of nature ; our thoughts will no more flow in such a channel , than water will burn , or fire freeze . All the details of the representation are so extremely and so equally absurd , that the reader scarcely thinks of any particular absurdity among them ; he is so completely transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its absence ; there is not enough of the true scattered in with the false , to remind him of the distinction between them . Similar remarks might be made of other delineations in the book . They have no dramatic , no poetic , no objective reality to our minds . The three females , for example , whom Festus successively makes love to , do not affect us as character at all ; they have no distinctive traits , no individuality , but are mere repetitions of the same thing under different names . Though represented as deeply in love with Festus , they do not speak or act as if they were in love with anything but the passion of love . Instead of being occupied with the object of their sentiments , as they would be if they had them , they are occupied with the sentiments themselves ; are always trying how many and what fine things they can say , not of the man that moves them , but of the emotions he has awakened in them . The object that interests them provokes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glorjfy , the interest they take in him . The result is , they everywhere display just that Vanity of sentiment which proves their hollowness ; are always talking about their feelings precisely as no one would or could talk about them , who had them . Thus , in the passions attributed to them , they keep violating the first instincts and laws of passions . Besides , though represented as speaking from the occasion , their speeches seem all arranged beforehand for any or every occasion that may arise , and rehearsed from memory . There are no personalities in their talk ; when under the deepest personal impressions , they converse in just that style of generalities which it is the sure effect of personal impressions to prevent ; that is , there is no you and I in their conversation ; it is all a human mind , and a human mind . In short , everything they say appears to come , not from them , but from the author , and from the author trying to represent passions which he can not feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies . Hence the disgusting transcendental rhapsodies they are perpetually falling intQ in praise of love ; rhapsodies that are enough to sicken the heart of any one whose heart is not either buried up beneath the sensuous irritabilities , or just gone with a sort of sentimental consumption . Perhaps the author meant them as an example , not of what woman is , but of what he thought she should be . Heaven defend us from all imitators of the example ! Too many , it must be confessed , have followed it , before it was given them ; if , now that they have it , it do not shame them out of the imitation , they may as well be given up sure enough . The truth is , this book is no embodiment of life and character at all , but merely a set of personified notions and theories . The author obviously has no dramatic , no representative power whatever ; he can not make the elements of life stand together , can not make them coalesce into objective reality ; nay , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own impressions ; so that , instead of producing or representing things , setting them out for the mind to contemplate like a fact or work of nature , he aces nothing but throw off , or let off , his impressions . Accordingly , the so-called persons of his so-called drama are in no wise characters , creations , but mere utterances , mere voices which have , and can have , no reality to our minds save while they are sounding . Festus and Lucifer , for example , do not affect us as persons , as objects ; on the contrary they seem , nay , they are hut two series of floating and , perhaps , self-generated impressions thrown off from the author 's mind pretty much at random , ( for he was " inspired " to throw them off , ) like so many incoherent , inconsistent dreams . Of course , therefore , the two do not impress each other at all ; for it requires an object to make or take an impression ; and it is not to be expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reason they make no impression upon us ; for the human mind is made to be impressed by things , not by impressions ; a string or stream of impressions may flow through it till doomsday , and leave no result whatever , save a diseased craving for their continuance . Hence , though many pcople are loud in their praises of " Festus , " no one , so far as we know , ever speaks or thinks of any such thing as character in connection with it . They come from the reading vastly pleased , indeed , but can not for the life of them tell what it is that has pleased them ; there is nothing in the book that abides in their minds , and cleaves to their thoughts ; nothing they can recur to , or give an account of ; all they remember about it is , the delightful impressions they had while reading it ; and when they cast about to produce some of these delightful impressions , they can not find them , simply because they were not and could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been fed , or rather , starved with such delightful impressions too long already . Authors , or people calling themselves authors , have thrown off their impressions , until we have a perfect glut of them ; we consider them good for nothing ; nay , worse than nothing ; a nuisance : instead of paying for them , we would rather pay something to get rid of them ; for their only effect is to fill the mind with unrest ; to starve it into spasms and convulsions , which some people are foolish enough to miscall a hungering and thirsting after knowledge . Assuredly , the only way for an author to impress us is , not by blowing his impressions in our faces , but by setting before us the things that impress him . Such , indeed , is the very idea , the nature , the essence of art . In other words , art is essentially objectixe ; the mind is objectively employed in producing it ; objectively employed in studying it ; and this intense subjectiveness , this constant employing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times , and of which " Festus " is the crowning example , is the very reverse , the perfect negation of art , and is alike vitiating to the mind , the morals , and the manners of the people . To be continued in our next . No.
