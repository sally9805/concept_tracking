txt As the difficulties which have sprung up between England and China , are both interesting and important , we shall devote a portion of the present number of this Review to a consideration of the subject . Our design is not to engage in a discussion of the merits of the controversy , but to furnish , as well as our limited means of information will permit , a succinct history of the dispute , from its origin in the illegal introduction of opium into the ports of Canton , by British merchants , down to the recent transmission of despatches by Lord Palmerston , in preparation for active war . The subject is full of interest to the American reader . Whatever may be the course of events in respect to the actual terniination of the contest , it is quite certain that the belligerent attitude of the two nations must cause an important interruption of the American trade , and lead either to its total suppression hereafter , or to its very great enlargement in consequence of the withdrawal of British competition . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plans , the effect in either case will be equally momentous upon American interests . Our merchants , therefore , will watch the issue with that care and sagacity which enables them to cope with the more wealthy traders of the world . In another aspect the dispute is calculated to attract the deepest attention . For many centuries , the greater part of the Chinese territory has been closed from the view of mankind . Of its interior arrangements , of its actual extent , of the number of its population , of the condition of its trade , of the nature of its institutions , of its mechanical improvements , of its social and domestic economy , of its police , its moral codes , its religion , very little is known beyond what has been casually gleaned by incompetent persons , permitted for short seasons to approach its coasts . A profound darkness has rested for ages over all that portion of its history , which it would be curious and desirable to investigate . Wrapped in their own notions of peculiar superiority , bigoted , intolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from the people of the world , have resisted the power of civilization spreading itself so effectually through all other nations , and proved impenetrable even to Christianity , that has pierced all the abodes of man , and shed its light in every nook and corner of human habitation . It is probable , therefore , that if , in the course of Providence , this solemn seclusion is destined to be broken , it must be by the force of foreign arms . The time has probably come to rend asunder by violence the veil which neither the influence of commerce nor religion could prevail in drawing aside ; in which event a country supposed to number about three // hundred millions of souls will be thrown open to the world , and incorporated for the first time into the community of nations . - The existing disturbances have had their rise in the traffic in opium carried on by the foreign merchants , chiefly British , residing at Canton and Macao . It is not a century since this trade began , in the proposal of Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the taste for the drug rapidly spreading in China , should be turned into a source of commercial revenue . Previously to the year 1767 , the whole annual import of opium into China , a1l*wed entry as a medicine subject to the small duty of five mace per catty , did not exceed two hundred chests . During that year , the number of chests increased to one thousand , at which number the importation remained stationary , for several succeeding years . As the East India Company were in the exclusive possession of the whole trade with the eastern nations , they did not at that time find it worth their while to divert their capital from the other more lucrative employments which the monopoly had provided . But about the beginning of the present century , serious inroads were made upon the business of the Company through the competition of individual traders invited thither by the large profits of eastern commerce . rro supply the deficiency which this falling off of their trade occasioned , they resorted to the traffic which they had so long neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now beginning to be apprised . A more extended cultivation of the poppy within the British dominions in India was immediately undertaken , large tracts of land were devoted to its production , and means and facilities for shipping it to the Chinese markets were industriously established . Some idea of the rapid increase of its production may be obtained from the following tables , which are compiled from " Martin 's Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire , " quoted in the Chinese Repository . It is a statement of the sales of opium made at Calcutta by the East India Company , from 1800 to the year 1837 . Chests . Sicca Rupees . In 1800 theysold 4,054 , valued at 3,142,591 1810 " 4,561 " 8,070,955 1820 " 4,006 " 8,255,603 1830 " 8,778 " 11,255,767 1835 " 12,977 " 13,215,464 1837 " 16,916 " 25,395,300 Taking the Sicca Rupee at forty-five cents of our currency , which is its lowest value , the opium sold in 1837 would amount to nearly twelve millions of dollars . This growing consumption of the drug began to manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It soon came into use among the people as an article of daily necessity . Thousands were becoming victims to the fatal intoxication which it produces , and a host of frightful diseases , before unknown , were spreading desolation // and death throughout the empire . So rapid had been its conqnests that the Emperor , as early as 1797 , issued a solemn edict against the further importation of it , threatening those who should be discovered smoking it with the pillory and bamboo , and the sellers and smugglers of it with the penalties of perpetual imprisonment and death . This edict was transmitted to all parts of his dominions , and the inferior officers strictly enjoined to put it in instant execution upon whoever should be found to offend . But the authorities , under the influence of bribes thrust into their hands by the merchants , were lax in the discharge of their duties , and the importation continued in as great and even greater quantities than before . This was folldwed by other imperial edicts , couched in language still more severe , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first order . Not a few of the Chinese , taken in the act either of smuggling or of vending the interdicted commodity , were publicly executed with all the horrible accompaniments of punishment in which the criminal laws of China are fruitful , but without in the least restricting the illicit trade . Edict followed edict , in rapid succession , each breathing fiercer threatenings than the last , but so far from diminishing they only stimulated the ingenuity and industry with which the contraband drug was forced into more extensive circulation . That these various edicts were sufficiently earnest and direct , that issued in 1833 may answer as a specimen . It proceeds to say : " Let the buyers and smokers of opium be punished with one hundred blows , and condemned to wear the wooden collar for two months . Then let them declare the seller 's name , that he may be seized and punished with death , and in default of his discovering the vender , let the smoker be again punished with one hundred blows , and three years banishment , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who buy and smoke opium , be punished one degree more severely than others ; and let governors of provinces be required to give security that there are no opium smokers under their jurisdiction , and let a joint memorial be sent in representing the conduct of those officers who have connived at the practice . " This was the condition of affairs , when the East India Company 's monopoly having terminated , the place of their supercargoes , who had hitherto conducted the business , was supplied by the appointment of superintendents of the British trade . A commission was issued to Lord Napier , with Messrs . Plowden and Davis , in December of 1833 , authorizing them to carry on the usual negotiations with the Chinese authorities , accompanied by the following instructions : " And wz do further command and require you , in the general discharge of your duties as such superintendents , to abstain from and avoid all such conduct , language , and demeanor as might needlessly excite jealousy or distrust among the inhabitants of China or the officers of the Chinese government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions or prejudices of the Chinese people or govemnment ; and that you do study , by all practical methods , to maintain a good and friendly understanding , both with the officer* civil and military , and with the inhabitants of China , with whom you may be brought into intercourse or communication . " With the spirit of these instructions , Lord Napier manifested no inclination to comply , and it was not long before he received further // instructions from Lord Palmerston , which soon brought him in conflict with the Chinese authorities . These " further instructions , " supplementary to those of the royal commission* directed the superintendent to " announce his arrival in Canton by a letter to the Viceroy , " which was an open violation of the rules established in respect to the trade to Canton . No foreigner is allowed to proceed up the river until he has received an authentic passport , or chop , from the constituted authorities , and no official paper can be sent to the Viceroy except through the hands of the Hong merchants , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the external commerce of the nation is conducted . On the 15th of July , 1834 , Lord Napier arrived in Macao Roads , from whence he set sail for Canton on the 23d . A letter announcing his arrival was carried to the city gates by Mr. Astell , who was ordered " to deliver it to a mandarin , and avoid any communication through the I*1ong merchants . " This irregular mode of proceeding was of course resisted by the Chinese authorities . On the 27th of July , an edict from the Governor of Canton to the Hong merchants , commanded them to require Lord Napier to go back to Macao , and conform to the established forms of the Canton trade by transmitting his communication through the usual channel . Lord Napier obstinately refused to do this , and the Governor of Canton threatened , should he persist in his refusal , to stop the British trade altogether . On the 26th of August Lord Napier , in retaliation , posted a placard at the corner of the streets , charging the mandarins with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viceroy . The Governor was greatly incensed by so daring a piece of insolence , and on the 2d of September , sent forth an edict , confirming the stoppage of the trade from the 16th of August . All negotiations , relating to the opening of the trade , unaccompanied by the condition that Lord Napier should leave Canton , having failed , his lordship and suite embarked for Macao , on the 24th of September . This was the first serious dispute that had arisen between the two parties , and we refer to it now , although not intimately connected with the present difficulties , because it is supposed to have had great influence in exasperating the Chinese authorities against the British nation generally . Under the superintendents succeeding Lord Napier , through the adoption of a conciliating course , the trade was shortly after restored . On the 14th of September , 1836 , Captain Elliott , the present supenintendent , was commissioned to discharge the duties of the office . About the time of his apointment , a controversy which had arisen , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly interesting several of the higher Chinese authorities . The Emperor himself , urged by a view of the terrible consequences inseparable from its use , had determined to put an end to the traffic . It was recommended , however , by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of // Canton that on account of the immense revenues brought into the treasury , the trade should be legalized . In a report made upon the subject , they set forth that the traffic had increased in spite of all prohibitions , that it had drained the empire of the Sycee silver , and that it would be advisable to impose a duty on the drug , with the conditions that it should be exchanged in barter , and not paid for in money . ILsays : " If this plan be faithfully and vigorously carried into effect , the tens of millions of precious money which now annually go out of the empire will be saved , the source of the stream will be purified , and the stream itself may be eventually stayed . The amount of duties being less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenue laws will cease of themselves ; the present evil practices of transporting contraband goods by deceit and violence will be suppressed without effort ; the numberless quarrels and litigations now arising therefrom at Canton , together with the crimes of worthless vagrants , will be diminished . Moreover , if the Governmental officers , the literati , and the military , be still restrained by regulations , and not suffered to inhale the drug ; and if offenders among these classes be immediately dismissed from the public service , while those of the people who purchase the drug and smoke it , are not at all interfered with , all will plainly see that those who indulge their depraved appetites are the victims of their own self-sacrificing folly , persons incapable of ranking among the capped and belted men of distinction and learning ; and if in this way shame be once roused , strenuous exertion and self-improvement will be the result-for the principles of reform are founded on shame and remorse . Nor , as it is truly said in the original memorial , will the dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should your Majesty sanction the repeal , it will in truth be attended with advantage both to the arrangements of the Government and the well-being of the people . " It recommended also the cultivation of the poppy in China . The memorial of Heu-Naetse , an experienced functionary , to the Emperor is to the same effect , and the chief consideration in it is the effect of opium smuggling on the currency : * Always in times past , a tael of pure silver exchanged for nearly about 1,000 coined each , but of late years the same sum has borne the value of 1,200 or 1,300 cash ; thus the price of silver rises but does not fall . In the salt agency , the price of salt is paid in cash , while the duties are paid in silver ; now the salt merchants have all become involved , and the existing state of the salt trade in every province is abject in the extreme . How is this occasioned but by the unnoticed oozing out of silver ? If the easily exhaustible stores of the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer seas , gradually pouring themselves out from day to day , and from month to month , we shall shortly be reduced to a state of which I can not bear to speak . " Councilior Choo-Tsun took opposite views , and after commenting upon the effects of the trade in exhausting the nation of its silver , dwelt at large upon the misery and degradation which was spreading through China by means of the increasing consumption of the drug . Hew-Ren , subcensor over the military department , sustained the views of Choo-Tsun , in a long and well-reasoned memorial , which set forth with peculiar vividness and power the necessity of an imperative prohibition . All the while , the traffic , countenanced by the local *. utliorities , whose connivance was purchased by the payment of // seventy-five dollars for any chest smuggled into the empire , was daily becoming more extensive , so that it is estimated that in the summei ' of 1838 , it had grown so great , that there were at Canton no less than fifty thousand chests of opium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Some attempts to suppress it , by the execution of . one or two of the offenders , were made at several times during the year , but none of them seemed to be effectual . The arrival of High Commissioner Liii at the port of Canton , with plenipotentiary powers from the Emperor to root out the trade at all hazards , was the first step in an efficient reform . On the 10th of March , 1839 , Lin commenced his operations , by a thorough investigation into the actual state of the traffic . At the end of eight days , two imperial edicts were issued , the one addressed to the Hong merchants , and the other to the foreigners of all nations . In the former , after reminding the Hong merchants , that by the law of 1836 , they were held responsible " for the ascertainment of the question , whether or not any foreign vessel imports opium , " he severely censured them for having , in numberless instances , given bonds to vessels known to be engaged in the nefarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' all the opium in the hands of the merchants , and that the Hong merchants should procure bonds for carrying the order into effect within three days . In the edict to the foreigners , a promise was given that the trade should be continued to all who should instantly comply with the requisitions , while on the other hand punishment was menaced against those who should in any way attempt to conceal their opium , or defeat the operation of the decree . Hard upon these , came another decree ordering that all foreigners should be detained in Canton , until the delivery of the opium should be completed . The factories of the foreign merchants were surrounded by troops , and all intercOurse between Whampoa and Canton prohibited . By these vigorous proceedings the greatest consternation and excitement were produced among the resident merchants ; on the evening of the 21st of March , an extraordinary meeting of the Chamber of Commerce assembled , in which it was determined that some portion of the opium which they held should be delivered up as a propitiation to the wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were offered to the Commissioner for that purpose . But with this quantity , he declared himself by no means satisfied , and orders were returned to the merchants , peremptorily commanding them to surrender all the opium in their possession . Captain Elliott , who was at that time at Macao , heating of these determined proceedings , addressed a circular to the British subjects , stating that the forcible detention of Her Majesty 's subjects in Canton , and other urgent reasons had induced him to withdraw all confidence from the Chinese authorities , and he should , therefore , require all the British ships in the outer anchorages , to proceed forthwith to Hong VOL . Vii . NO. xxx. *-*unn , 1840 . I r // Kong , and place them selves in a posture for defence . On the 23d of the same month , another notice was issued , informing the British subjects , that passports would be demanded for all such as desired to proceed outside , and enjoining them to make preparations for sending all their property on board of the British vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Canton , which place he reached on the evening of the 24th . No sooner had he arrived than measures were taken by the Chinese , to make sure of his detention . All the natives were compelled to retire from the factories , the avenues to the public square were closed and guarded , lines of boats filled with armed men were drawn up in front of the factories , and soldiers were stationed at every convenient position , to prevent the ingress or egress of all such as were not authorized by the authorities . On the 26th another proclamation for the delivery of the opium was published by the Imperial Commissioner . In this he assigns " four reasons** why the foreigners should comply with the expressed will of the Emperor , or the established regulations of the government . As these are curious in themselves , and show the spirit in which the Commissioner proceeded , we shall extract a portion of his argument . Under the first head , he says- " You ought to make haste to deliver it up , by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I find that during the last several tens of years , the money out of which you have duped our people , by means of your destructive drug , amounts to , I know not how many tens of thousands of myriads ! Thus while you have been scheming for private advantage , with minds solely bent on profit , our people have been wasting their substance and losing their lives , and if the reason of heaven be just , think you that there will be no retribution ? If ye will now repent , and deliver up your opium , by a well timed repentance , ye may avert judgment and calamities . If not , your wickedness being greater , its consequences will fall more fearfully upon you . Ye are distant from your homes many thousands of miles , your ships cross a vast and trackless ocean ; they are exposed to the visitations of thunder , and lightning , and raging storms  --  to the danger of being swallowed up by monsters of the deep  --  and amid such perils , fear ye not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actuated by the exalted virtue of heaven itself , wishes to cut off this deluge of opium , which is the plainest proof that such is the intention of heaven . It is , therefore , a traffic on which heaven looks with disgust , and who is he that will oppose his will ? " Under the second head he argued that the opium should be delivered in compliance with the laws of the land , " for , " he adds , " our Emperor looks upon the opium trade with the most intense loathing , and burns to have it cut off for ever , so that not only he who sells it is adjudged to death , but he who does no more than smoke it must also undergo the same penalty of the law . Now , try and reflect one moment . If ye did not bring this opium to China , how // should the people of our inner land be able either to sell or to smoke it ? The lives of our own people , which are forfeited to the laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what reason is there that the lives of our people should be thus sacrificed , and that ye alone should escape the awful penalty ? Now I , the High Commissioner , looking up the great Emperor , and feeling in my own person his sacred desire to love and cherish the men from afar , do mercifully spare your lives . I wish nothing more than that ye deliver up all the opium you have got , and forthwith write out a duly prepared bond , to the effect that you will never henceforth bring more opium to China , and should you bring it , agreeing that the cargo be confiscated , and the people who bring it but to death . This is pardoning what is past , and taking preventive measures against the future . " " Upon former occasions , " he continues in another place , " we have condemned foreigners to death , in case of having killed our people . Now think for a little . Depriving an individual of his life is a crime committed in a moment , and still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he who sells opium , has laid a plot to swindle a man out of his money , as well as to deprive him of his life ; and how can any one say that it is only a single individual , or a single family , that the opium seller thus dupes , and entangles in destruction ! And for a crime of this magnitude , ought one to die , or not to die ? And still will ye refuse to de*ver up your opium ? Which is the way to preserve your lives ? 0 , ye foreigners , do ye deeply ponder upon this . " As a third reason , he says- " You ought to make immediate delivery of this opium , by reason of your interest and your feelings as men . You come to this market of Canton to trade . You profit thereby full threefold . Every article of commerce that you bring with you , no matter whether it be coarse or fine , in whole pieces or in small , there is not one iota of it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce of our country , whether it be for feeding you , for clothing you , for any kind of use , or merely for sale , there is nothing that we do not permit you to take away with you , so that you not only reap the profit of the inner land , by the goods which you bring , but by means of what you carry away you gather gold from every country to which you transport it . " And fourthly , he concludes , " that the opium should be delivered up by reason of the necessity of the case , " under which he takes occasion to make an eamest and strong appeal to the honor of the foreigners , and the obligations which they must feel to be incumbent on them in the peculiar relations which they had long sustained . The effect of this reasonable argument was to soften the wrath of the British Superintendent , for on the 27th he issued another notice to the British subjects , in which he exhorted them to yield the opium remaining in their possession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superintendent , thus constrained by paramount motives affecting the // safety of the lives and liberty of all the foreigners here present in Canton , and by other very weighty causes , do hereby , in the name and on the behalf of her majesty 's government , enjoin and require all her majesty 's subjects now present in Canton , forthwith to make a surrender to me , for the service of her said majesty 's government , to be delivered over to the government of China , of all the opium under their respective control , and to hold the British ships and vessels engaged in the trade of opium , subject to my immediate direction , and to forward me without delay a sealed list of all the British owned opium in their respective possession . And I , the said Chief Superintendent , do now , *in the most full and unreserved manner , hold myself responsible for and on behalf of her Britannic majesty 's government . to all and each of her majesty 's subjects surrendering the British owned opium into my hands to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promptly complied with , by the merchants agreeing to the surrender of about twenty thousand chests of opium , worth , at cost prices , nearly twelve millions of dollars . L was sometime , however , in consequence of delays incident to negotiations of this sort , before the agreement was fully carried into effect . Meanwhile the merchants detained at the factories were permitted to depart for Macno , with the exception of sixteen , who had been most deeply engaged in the traffic , and who were held as hostages until the surrender of opium should be completed , which was done on the 21st of May . On the 17th of June , it was publicly burned ; and the Emperor was pleased to signify his approbation of the course which had been pursued by Commissioner Lin , in appointing him to the second dignity in the empire , the government of the Three Keang . But before the trade could be resumed it became necessary to execute a bond that any ship trading with Canton , after a prescribed time , if found carrying opium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offenders given up to suffer the severest penalties . Several English merchants having expressed a willingness to take the bond , Elliott instantly issued a notice , requiring that they should not do so , because it - would confer too great a power on the Chinese authorities in the search of English vessels . He enjoined at the same time that British ships should not enter within the Bogue or Bocca Tigris , until the condition of affairs should render further navigation more secure . At the same time he undertook to negotiate for the re-opening of the trade , on a fairer footing , or on terms with which he should feel at liberty to comply . But while the correspondence was pending , a party of British sailors , having landed at Hong Kong , on the 7th of July , and in a drunken frolic maitreated several of the natives , leaving one person , Lin Weihee , so severely bruised that in the course of a few hours he died , the negotiations were peremptorily broken off . A demand followed immediately for the delivery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insti // tuted by Elliott on board of one of the British men-of-war , with a view to the discovery of the criminal , but without success , and information was sent to the Commissioner to that effect , that after the most diligent search the murderer of Lin Weihee could not be found . With this reply he was not satisfied , and again urged upon Elliott that the offender must be delivered up to be dealt with after the Chinese fashion . Elliott replied as before , and the Commissioner thereupon , on the 15th of August , issued a decree that no food should be supplied to the English at Macao or any other station , and that , all the native compradores and persons assisting them should forthwith leave their houses and ships . An edict of the same tenor was posted at Macao 25th of August . It proclaimed , " I. That any foreign vessel , wherein , through error , opium shall be brought to this place , within the period of eighteen months , from the date of this edict , shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Whampos , and dispose of her other cargo . " 2 . That every foreigner ( no especial mention made of the English ) who shall endeavor to introduce opium into the empire , on discovery being made , shall , if he be the principal , be immediately decapitated ; if only an abettor , shall be instantly sentenced to strangulation . " 3 . That every vessel is allowed to proceed immediately up to Whampos , in order to discharge her cargo . " 4 . That such vessels as are not proceeding to Whampoa must return forthwith to their country , lest ulterior measures be adopted against them . ( In this also no especial mention is made of the English. ) " 5 . That if the murderer of the Chinese , Lin Weihee , be immediately delivered up , well and good ; but if not , all the foreigners shall be involved in the offence . " Of these events the British merchants , in their memorial to Lord Palmerston , dated at Hong Kong Bay , Sept. 7th , say : - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorialists have been compelled suddenly to abandon that settlement and seek refuge on board their ships , in consequence of menacing preparations of the Imperial Commissioner , and edicts ordering the departure of British subjects , on pain of severe punishment ; at the same time holding us responsible with our lives for the surrender of an individual to suffer death , in satisfaction of the alleged murder of a native in an accidental affray with some British and American seamen a few weeks since , at the anchorage of Hong Kong . " Her Majesty 's Superintendent has been unable , after a careful investigation to the forms of British law , to fix such charge of murder on any British subject . " Without any charge whatever against your memorialists , individually or collectively , from the High Commissioner , in connexion with the ostensible cause of our actual expulsion from Macao , we were first deprived of our servants and supplies of food , and then compelled to abandon our dwellings , without previous preparation , and in the possession of means barely adequate for the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and necessity , under circumstances involving much cruel privation to families and invalids . " Elliott not deeming it safe to remain at Macao , embarked on the 21st with all the British residents on board of small vessels in convoy of one of her majesty 's ships , and proceeded to the bay of Hong Kong . Unable to procure a mitigation of the severe regulations of the Chinese , on the 11th of September , he declared , through Captain Smith of H. B. M. 's ship Volage , the port of Canton in a state of blockade . In the de*patch to Lord Palmerston , dated September 25th , Elliott excuses this measure on the ground that the sudden disappearance of an English armed schooner had led him to believe that a number of Englishmen had fallen into the hands of the Chinese . Wl*atever might have been the immediate occasion of this extraordinary resort to blockade , it was withdrawn on the sixteenth , and at the urgent request of the British merchants , who had grown jealous of the Americans monopolizing the whole trade with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties might be satisfactorily adjusted . The Chinese continued to insist that the required bond should be agreed to , and the murderer of Lin Weihee be surrendered , with as much persistency as ever , up to the 20th of October , when Elliott succeeded in exacting an agreement which contained stipulations to the following effect : " It has been agreed between their excellencies the High Commmissioner and Governor on the one side , and the Chief Superintendent of the trade of British sub . jects on the other , that , under existing circumstances : " 1 . The British trade may be carried on outside the Bocca Tigris , without any necessity of signing the bond of consent to Chinese legislation , ( to be handed to Chinese officers , ) upon the condition that the ships be subjected to examination . " 2 . That the place of resort shall be the anchorage between Amughoy and Chumpee. " 3 . It is fully understood , that the vessels , while discharging their cargoes outside the Bogue , shall pay the measurement charge in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' charges shall also be paid as usual . The linguist shall be paid in like manner . " 4 . The vessels proceeding to Amughoy will transport their cargoes by means of chop boats , and will undergo search by the officers . " This agreement had scarcely been entered into , when an English vessel , the " Thomas Coutts , " signed the bond against which Elliott had all along objected , entered the river , and sailed up as far as Whampoa , which is some distance within the Bocca Tigris . Of this incident Elliott , in the home despatch of November 5th , says , " Since I closed my despatch of October 21st , a different and unhappy turn of affairs has been brought about , and I am grieved to report that this serious public mischief is attributable to the conduct of a British subject , Mr. Warner , master of the ship Thomas Coutts . Upon his arrival from Signapore , Mr. Warner did not repair to Hong Kong , but demanded his pilot permission , and proceeded to the Bocca Tigris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , involving the infliction of capital punishment by Chinese forms of trial ; and the ship was immediately carried up to Whampoa . It is an aggravation of Mr. Warner 's heavy // responsibility , that he was perfectly aware of the advanced state , of my own negotiations with the Chinese Government , when he took this step . " A different interpretation was , however , put upon the affair by the Imperial Commissioner , who , supposing himself to have been deceived by the Superintendent , instantly broke off all further treaty , reiterated his demand for the slayer of Lin Weihee , insisted again upon the required bond , and , in case of refusal , ordered them to depart within three days from the coast , on pain of provoking the most signal vengeance of China . Captain Elliott repaired on board of the Volage , and directed all the British vessels to remove as soon as possible , to Chumpee Bay . On the morning of the 2d of November , the two ships of war , the Volage and Hyacinth , made anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese war-junks and fire-ships had been collected previously at that station . After an interchange of notes between the British Superintendent and the Chinese admiral , in relation to the adjustment of existing difficulties , without result , the Chinese fleet weighed anchor and drew near the English vessels . Captain Smith , of the Volage , despatched an order , requesting them to retire to their former position , which was the anchoring ground to the north of Shakock . The reply was that Captain Smith 's request would be acceded to , as soon as the murderer of Lin Weihee should be given up to the punishment of Chinese laws . Assuring them that he had no knowledge of the person whom they sought , Captain Smith made preparations for forcing the squadron back to the place they had left . In the attempt to do this , both parties were brought into direct conflict , and an action ensued , which in one of the despatches of Elliott is thus portrayed : " At about noon , therefore , the signal was made to engage , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the Chinese force , bore away in a line ahead and close order , having the wind on the starboard beam . In this way , and under easy sail , they ran down the Chinese line , pouring in a destructive fire . The later* al direction of the wind enabled the ships to perform the same evolution from the opposite extreme of the line , running up it again with their larboard broadsides bearing . The Chinese answered with their accustomed spirit , but the terrible effect of our own fire was soon manifest . One war-junk blew up at about pistol-shot distance from this ship , a shot probably having passed through the magazine ; three were sunk , and several others were obviously water-logged . It is an act of justice to a brave man to say , that the admiral 's conduct was worthy of his station . His junk was evidently better armed and manned than the other vessels ; and , after he had wei*hed , or , more probably , cut , or slipped , he bore up and engaged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behavior honorably enhanced by the hopelessness of his efforts . In less than three quarters of an hour , however , he , and the remainder of the squadron , were retiring in great distress to their former anchorage ; and as it was not Capt . Smith 's disposition to protract destructive hostilities , or , indeed , do more than repel onward movements , he offered no obstruction to their retreat ; but discontinued the fire , and made sail for Macso , with the purpose to cover the embarkation of such of her Majesty 's subjects as might see fit to retire from that place , and also to provide for the safety of this merchant-ships. " // In this engagement one of the war-junks was blown up , five were sunk , and about five hundred , or as other accounts have it , nine hundred of the Chinese were killed . After the battle Elliott withdrew to Hong Kong , where he remained at the last advices , anxiously awaiting the action of the British government in the premises . A naval force has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we see , the probability is that England and China will involve themselves in an expensive and bloody war . Thus far , we have given a narrative of this dispute as impartial as it could be made from the conflicting accounts of the English writers , and the official despatches of the British agents . Various minute incidents , calculated to exasperate the respective parties , such as conflicts and fist fights between the private subjects of the two nations have been purposely omitted , because not materially connected with the merits of the controversy , and not entitled to the dignity of being considered the actions of responsible persons . Enough we think is presented to enable our readers to understand the causes of existing difficulties , and the actual position of the dispute . It will be seen that there have been high-handed and violent proceedings on both sides , justified perhaps in the case of the Chinese , by the fact that they were an offended nation , but in respect to the English1 too atrocious and insolent to admit of any palliation or excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be summoned to the cause of justice , peace , and humanity . What the power of England is , we know , and we know too , that in the Empire of China she will meet no puny or despicable foe . rhe habitual tone of contempt indulged in by many of the British orators and journalists is not well put on ; nor does it become them to undervalue the energies of the oldest as well as the most populoiii*s and wealthiest nation of the world . A people that could have maintained their integrity so long unbroken must possess an internal strength which it would be unwise to trifle with , and dangerous to arouse . There was force in the remarks of Sir James Graham , made during the debate on Chinese affairs in the House of Commons , when he described the Chinese Empire as one inhabited by three hundred and fifty millions of human beings-all directed by the will of one man-all speaking one language-all governed by one code of laws-all professing one religionall actuated by the same feelings of national pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by tens of centuries1 transmitted to them in regular succession , under a patriarchial govern-* ment , without interruption ; and boast of education , of printing , of civilization , of arts , and the conveniences and many of the luxuries of life as enjoyed by them when Europe was still sunk in barbarism , and when the light of knowledge was obscured in the western hemisphere . " But , " he added , " not only to their number-not only with regard // to that unity which is strength , but I call attention to their immense wealth . They possess an annual revenue of $50,000,000 , regularly collected-they have no debt-they inhabit the largest and fairest portion of Asia , in nearly one-third of that which is in the tropical climate -- they cultivate a most fruitful soil , which is watered by the largest river , and intersected by a canal twelve hundred miles in length , which is one of the standing wonders of the world , and in every portion of this immense empire there is one uniformity of system-one jealous suspicion of strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , and all the confines of India , and the boundaries of Ava , Tebet , and Nepaul.
