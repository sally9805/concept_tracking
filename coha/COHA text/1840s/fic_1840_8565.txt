Note . The dramatist of " West Point " claims but little originality in this composition . His chief merit consists in adapting a well written tale to dramatic representation . This note is only added to counteract the personal malevolence of one or two contemptible individuals , whose insignificance is hardly worthy of even this attention . CHARACTERS . AMERICANS . Gen.

Main text ACT I. Scene 1st . ( Curtain rises to slow music . ) In the back ground a street with a low barrier thrown across it . A guard house , and a group of English soldiers a few yards on the left . Sentinel pacing before the barrier . Enter Smithson . Smithson . John Smithson So , there is New York at last . The broad banner of England still floats over the quarters of General Clinton . I have had a hard day 's ride , but a good supper and a bottle of porter awaits my arrival at the inn . Now for the outposts . ( Smithson advances to the barrier . ) Sentinel . Sentinel Who goes there ? ( Smithson continues to advance without answering . ) Sentinel . Sentinel Answer , or I fire instantly . ( Smithson advances directly to the barrier without answering . The sentinel takes aim with his musket , Smithson rushes upon him and grasps it ; in the scuffle it is discharged without injury . ) Smithson . John Smithson Well aimed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha !

John Smithson Softly , good sir Corporal ! you 've wasted powder enough already . I did but try to see how well you kept the barrier , and what mettle your men are made of . The story goes that a pretty wench or a jug of whiskey can cross your post in broad noon and the Sentinel is never the wiser . It 's " who goes there ? " " Man with a ying of whiskey . " You answer , " Stand man , advance jug o ' whiskey and give us a taste ; " or , " who goes there ? " " Husband and wife . " " Stand husband , advance wife and give us a kiss ! " ha ! ha ! ha ! .

John Smithson So , ho , man , you 'd better take a shovel and fill your knapsack at once . Here , corporal , is my passport . ( Smithson thrusts his fingers beneath the snuff in his box , draws out a crampled and dirty paper , hands it , to the corporal , who reads it and , as he returns it , answers )  --  Corporal .

Mrs. Arnold . Mrs. Arnold Now , my dear Adelaide , I do assure you , you are too sensitive .

Adelaide Now , no more of the Major , and I 'll not again ask you not to appear so often in public . Though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at least I have been so informed  --  a very critical period for the American arms , and the dictates of prudence and patriotism seem eminently to require that the utmost reserve should be observed by the General 's family . Pardon my boldness , madam , in thus speaking ; but , as an American maiden , I can not refrain from an expression of my apprehensions , till I see the liberty of my country firmly established . Mrs. Arnold . Mrs. Arnold Ah ! my dear Adelaide , did I dare to give utterance to the misgivings of my heart as respects this contest  --  a contest in which undisciplined soldiers are arrayed against the well trained troops of the mother country . But , enough . I will not pursue the subject . Be with me , my dear , at four o'clock as usual , when I will communicate to you something of importance . Till then adieu . Exit Mrs. Arnold . Adelaide . Adelaide ' T is ever thus when I mention the gloomines of the American cause . Some deep seated distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have observed a sorrowful change in the conduct of my aunt . The habits and manners of General Arnold are also singular . I know not  --  I dare not think . Be the cause what it may , my humble prayer is , and over shall be , that the good Washington may triumph over all those who wish to enslave the free born of America . May that good man guide their destinies to greatness and glory . Scene 3d . A large and elegant apartment brilliantly lighted . Table in the centre , on which is placed the wine desert . Sir Henry Clinton , Sir George Rodney , General Knyphausen , and other officers of the English army at the table and promenading the apartment . Soldiers and servants in attendance . Scene opens to lively music , when Sir Henry , Sir George , Knyphausen and one or two other officers advance to the front . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Now , gentlemen , I have shown you the importance of the secret correspondence I have so long been engaged in through Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the confidence of Washington is certain . His information has never , in a single instance , proved incorrect . In his last communication , he said the time had at length arrived when it had become expedient to bring the affair to a crisis ; saying further , that if I complied with his terms , action should at once take the place of writing . These terms , and the means of obtaining an interview with him , he did not mention , but promises to send us by a special messenger a full exposition of his views , and his real name , for which , hitherto , he has adopted " Gustavus " as Andre has that of " John Anderson . " Sir George . Sir George Rodney Have you any idea , Sir Henry , who your mysterious correspondent may be ? Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton I have my suspicions , Rodney ; but until the arrival of the letters to destroy or confirm them , I will not injure the fair fame even of a foe by whispering them . Noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the disturbance without there ? Enter Sambo , a servant in livery . Sambo . Sambo Ony de press gang , Massa ! Dey cotch big rebel at black Sam 's  --  he no want to go board ship , Mas Rodney  --  so um yell little bit  --  dat 's all , Massa Knyphorsum . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton I was afraid , General Knyphausen , your thick-skulled Germans and my English guards were at loggerheads again . Noise increases outside . Hark ! what is that ? Voice outside . Voice To the main-guard with him ! Drag him to the sugar-house ! Give him a birth in the old Jersey ! Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton ' T is time for me to interfere . Enter Smithson , sword drawn , and British soldiers in hot pursuit . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Hold , men ! Put up your pistol , Captain . And you , fellow , give up your weapon to the Captain of the guard . Smithson . John Smithson If he will have it , let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was quietly on my way from the inn where I put up to these quarters , when these skulking chaps followed and set upon me here ; and if they hav'nt had a taste of my quality by this time , perhaps they 'd like to trouble me again . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Advance , Corporal of the guard , and secure him . Soldiers advance . Corporal . Corporal Surrender ! Smithson . John Smithson I am an American citizen  --  the bearer of a message to General Clinton , and am protected by his passport . Lay a finger on me at your peril . He draws a postol , cocks it , and levels it at the head of the corporal . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Ha ! Says he so ? Our man , by haliden . Stand back , Corporal . Fellow , I am General Clinton . If you are the bearer of papers to me , come forward and deliver them . Smithson advances and gives Sir Henry his passport , who glances at it . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Retire , Corporal , with your men . Exeunt Soldiers . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton After satisfying himself that they are secure from interruption . Now deliver the letters . Smithson . John Smithson Here they are , General .  --  Draws them from the scabbard of his sword , and delivers them . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton You may leave the room , Smithson . Ho , without there  --  Markham , take Mr. Smithson under your care till I want him again , and see that he neither leaves the house , nor has communication with any one . Exit Smithson . Sir Henry reads the papers . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton It is as I thought . General Arnold is my correspondent . Rodney and Knyphausen . Sir George Rodney , General Knyphausen Arnold ! Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Arnold and none other . This affair has got to assume an importance I had not anticipated . This morning General Arnold took the command of West Point . Sir George . Sir George Rodney At West Point ! General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Now , gentlemen , are we in a way to pluck the fruit so long ripening . Sir George . Sir George Rodney There is , indeed , an opening for a successful operation , that claims our most assiduous care . Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton West Point must be ours . Hear , gentlemen :  --  Reads the letter.  --  " I wish you to send some one in your confidence ( I should prefer Major Andre , and indeed do not desire to negotiate with any one else , as I deem him the most fitting person , ) fully authorised by your house , to confer with me , that the risks and profits of the copartnership may be fully and clearly understood . A speculation might at this time be made to some advantage with ready money . " Sir George . Sir George Rodney So , Arnold has a mercenary as well as a revengeful motive in this treason ? Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Being confident , from the accuracy and importance of his information , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington 's councils of war , I begun to make myself acquainted with the characters of the American generals , and investigate their histories , to discover what sufficient causes of dissatisfaction existed , to induce any one of them to turn traitor to his country . My suspicions , from obvious reasons , rested on General Arnold , and we now see that they are confirmed . It is gold the gentleman wants , and it is not to be withheld , for it is plain he will not stir a step without being paid for it . Sir George . Sir George Rodney But how shall we be able to take advantage of this treason ? Sir Henry . Sir Henry Clinton Every body knows , Sir George , that we have long contemplated , with the aid of your fleet , an expedition to the Chesaperake . This will be a good mask to cover our real designs . Under this feint we must prepare for a sudden movement up the Hudson . Sir George . Sir George Rodney Admirable . I second it with all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst you and the General are preparing the expedition , I must send Andre to close the " bargain " with this traitor-General forthwith . Exeunt opposite . Scene 4th . Guard house . Corporal and two or three sentinels in attendance . Smithson sitting apart from the rest in apparent meditation . 1st Soldier 1st Soldier ( slapping Smithson 's shoulders . ) Wake up , Yankes ! Smithson . John Smithson Wake up it is now . What have you to say to the Yankes ? 1st Soldier . 1st Soldier Plenty to say . How do you like your confinement , my boy ! Smithson . John Smithson About as well as the devil likes holy water . You have heard tell the devil 's kind to his own pups . Say yes or no to that . 1st Soldier . 1st Soldier I tell you what ' t is , Yankee rebel , you 'd best keep a civil tongue in that head of yours , or you may have more distance between your head and shoulders than you 'd like . Smithson . John Smithson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it longer . Now hear me . I came here an American citizen , and I am fairly protected . But why I am sent here among a parcel of British guards I know not nor care not . Your general must answer it . But as for you , you damned skulking scoundrel , know that neither bars , bolts nor red coats can detain a true American soldier against his will , even at the head quarters of General Clinton himself . During this harrangue the corporal and soldiers gather round Smithson , who rushes unexpectedly on the nearest , wrests his musket from him , and , after knocking down two or three , a passage is cleared , and he escapes unhurt . During the confusion of Smithson 's escape the curtain drops . ACT II . Scene 1st . View of West Point . The Hudson river . Vulture sloop of war at anchor . Barge pulls to the shore , and Major Andre and Sambo land . Stage in darkness . Major Andre . Major John Andre We must be near the spot now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you . Sambo . Sambo ' T is so goramity dark , massa Jack , nigger no see one debbil bit . Dis look werry like de place , nebberdeless . Chou ! hear dat bullfrog close here , massa Jack ! I heard him here when we lef . Ki ' ' t is jis de place place , for sartain sure . Arnold enters , muffled in a military cloak , with a dark lantern . He springs the lantern , and the stage is illuminated . Gen. Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold You are welcome , sir . Andre greets him with haughtiness . Arnold immediately , without noticing his manner , approaches and passes his arm through Andre 's , and they walk to the front of the stage . General Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold I have ordered horses to be at hand . You will mount one , if you please , sir . Points to horses off the stage . Major Andre . Major John Andre How mean you , General Arnold ? I thought our interview was to take place here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , it might , sir . But I have a portion of a correspondence , several important documents , plans of correspondence and other papers necessary to our purpose to exhibit to you . For these we must have lights and the privacy of a room . Major Andre . Major John Andre Well . General Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold A short distance from this place is a retired house , tenanted by Smithson . He is away , and there we shall be private . I have brought these horses that we may ride together . Major Andre Major John Andre ( after a moment 's hesitation . ) Proceed , sir . I attend you . Exeunt . Scene 2d . Interior of cottage , with a plain table , light , &c.; Sentinel Sentinel ( outside . ) Who comes there ? General Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold Friends . Sentinel . Sentinel Advance and give the countersign . General Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold " Congress . " Sentinel . Sentinel Pass friends . Andre Major John Andre ( in surprise . ) How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to waver . Remain with me . There is no danger to a cool head and resolute spirit . Andre . Major John Andre You did not tell me , sir , that you were about to conduct me within the American lines , else I should have insisted on coming to terms with you where we landed , and not so imprudently risked my liberty and perhaps my life . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold I presumed you placed that confidence in my honor , Major Andre , which would have rendered such an intimation gratuitous . With a passport signed by me , you are aware that you can return whenever you please . Andre . Major John Andre ( aside . ) Honor ! Heavy cannonading heard without . Arnold Gen. Benedict Arnold ( alarmed . ) We are detected , that firing is at the Vulture . Both Andre and Arnold rush to the door to observe . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold All is discovered , all is lost . To horse . To horse . Andre . Major John Andre Hold . You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the shore for their good , and are firing to compel her to change her position . See , she is already making sail . Arnold fastens the door , satisfies himself that there is no one within hearing , motions Andre to take a seat by the table , and seats himself . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold ( arranging his papers on the table . ) I am now ready , Major Andre , to listen to Sir Henry Clinton 's proposition . Andre . Major John Andre These shall be laid before you when you have detailed the mode by which you can favor his majesty 's arms . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold I can read the meaning of your glance , Major Andre . I am an injured man . I have repeatedly fought for , and five times shed my blood in defence of my country , and she has rewarded me not only with contumely and neglect , but with open insult . It occurred to me that I could accomplish my object through West Point . So soon as this idea occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of this important post . It is now in my hands , and shall be transferred to those of General Clinton , provided that  --  ( hesitating )  --  provided that the price I name for my services shall be agreed to . Andre . Major John Andre Name it , sir . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold One hundred thousand pounds sterling , in five quarterly payments , one quarter in hand , and the rank of major general in the British army . Andre . Major John Andre Your services should be great to merit this , sir . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold Let us weigh one against the other , and see which will kick the beam . Here ( displays a map ) is a plan of the works at West Point . You will perceive , on inspecting it , that besides the principal fort , there are three lines of fortifications between the river and the summit of the innermost range of highlands , composed of upwards of forty redoubts . But this map will serve only to give a general outline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the number of men stationed at each , with the amount of military stores and provisions . Here is a third , showing the easiest paths and means of access . On examining it , it will sufficiently explain itself . Here is a fourth , containing the artillery orders which have just been published at West Point , showing how each corps shall dispose of itself in case of alarm . This you will find of vast importance , as it will enable you to know the precise condition of every part of the garrison when you attack . Here is a fifth document , in which you will find an estimate of the forces at the different posts . This marked F. No. 6 will show you how many men it will take to man the works . In this numbered G 7 , you will find a return of the ordnance in the different forts , redoubts and batteries ; also , remarks on the works , describing the construction of each , and its strong and weak points . Lastly , here is a report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it contains hints written with pencil in the margin , respecting the probable operations of the campaign , by General Washington himself . Arnold lays the last paper on the table , and looks at Andre with an air of triumph . Andre . Major John Andre  --  with energy . Place those papers in my possession , and carry out in your person the spirit of them to the letter , and the reward you have named shall be yours . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold Think you , Major Andre , is it well planned ? Andre . Major John Andre  --  in animation . It is most skillfully planned , sir . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold It is , sir . But it remains to be ably seconded on the part of Sir Henry Clinton . The only obstacle to its success will be the difficulty of openly embarking troops on the Hudson without its object being suspected . In a low tone , looking fearfully about . The vigilance of Washington never sleeps . Andre . Major John Andre This difficulty is easily settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chesapeake , of which , doubtless , you have heard some rumors , troops are now embarking in Rodney 's fleet . By to-morrow morning there will be eight thousand on ship-board , ready to ascend the river at a moment 's warning . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold Then is success certain . Andre . Major John Andre I can not refrain from complimenting you , sir , on the masterly manner in which you have laid your plans . It is the perfection of  --  of  --  Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold Of treason . So he it , sir . If I bring about my ends , I care not what name were given it . Andre . Major John Andre I accept your terms . I have General Clinton 's carte blanche which I will fill out instantly , whilst you prepare my passport to enable me to reach New York in security . Both Arnold and Andre write the necessary documents . Andre takes the papers handed by Arnold , and Arnold receives the cheque , &c.; from Andre . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our enterprise . Our time draws short  --  come with me to my quarters , and I will arrange for your immediate departure . Andre . Major John Andre Proceed : I attend you , sir . Exeunt . Scene 3d . Banks of the Hudson . Boats , &c.; Cottage on the upper part of the stage . Smithson placing oars against the Cottage . Enter Andre . Smithson . John Smithson So the General 's off without never a thankee ? Andre . Major John Andre Ah ! Smithson , you are in good time . Lose not a moment in conveying me on board the Vulture . Smithson . John Smithson There are two parties to that bargain . Andre . Major John Andre What , fellow . Smithson . John Smithson Fellow not me . I am at no man 's beck and bidding . I have my reasons for serving the Gen'ral , but am not every man 's servant , you may depend . If you want to get back to your ship , you have arms and can pull an oar I reckon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after a moment 's reflection offers gold . Andre . Major John Andre Smithson , my good fellow , take this gold and conduct me to your boat . Smithson . John Smithson Mr. John Anderson , what Jack Smithson wo n't do for favor he wo n't do for gold . Besides , I have been up all night and I want sleep . The Vulture lays full two leagues below , and it would be broad day before I could reach her . No , no , nothing less than the Gen'ral 's orders will make me put oar in row-lock this night . Andre . Major John Andre Fatal negligence on the part of Arnold not to leave instructions to this effect . ( Aside . ) Andre turns suddenly on Smithson , draws a pistol and levels it at his breast , saying , in a stern tone :  --  Swear to row me to the Vulture , or you are a dead man . Smithson . John Smithson Is this your game ? ha ! Laughing , and suddenly grasping the pistol by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , you 'd best put up that plaything , for I am not to be frightened at such things as them . Good night . Goes into the cottage . Andre hurriedly examines his passports given him by Gen. Arnold . Andre . Major John Andre Fatal negligence ! To his surprise he discovers that he has two passports . Two passports ! All 's safe . Approaches the house and calls . Smithson ! Smithson ! Re-enter Smithson from the cottage . He places a passport in Smithson 's hands , who reads it , and then views the sky for a moment . Smithson . John Smithson It will be day-break in twenty minutes . It 's no use trying to get back to the Vulture , for it 's flood tide , and blowing a dead head wind . The best oarsman on the Hudson could n't pull to her before ten o'clock , and during that time there is no knowing what might happen to us . I would n't like to trust myself in a boat , for there are boat-rowers along shore that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger by land less ? Smithson . John Smithson It is . You must take that course . Andre . Major John Andre ( taking Smithson familiarly by the arm . ) If you have an old coat I should like to exchange mine for it , as I fear the one I wear may subject me to suspicions . As Andre speaks he opens his great coat and discloses his British uniform . Smithson . John Smithson ( with apparent surprise . ) By the twelve apostles ! this is a discovery . A British officer in the  --  Andre .

They go in the cottage . Scene 4th . Lively music . Near a public road in the country . Village in the back ground . Paulding , Williams and Van Wert seated on the ground beneath a tree , playing at cards . Each of them with a shot pouch and powder horn slung over his shoulder . One with a rifle across his knees , and two muskets standing against a tree . David Williams . David Williams Trumps ! Isaac Van Wert . Isaac Van Wert It 's your trick , John , by the livin ' Jerusalem ! Williams . David Williams Luck 's agin me this morning , boys . I 'll into the road and see if I ca n't find some better luck with game of another sort . John Paulding . John Paulding If you can light on one of them ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out for , driving our Yankee cattle to make beef for John Bull 's carcass down in York , I 'll give up every copper I 've won of ye . Van Wert . Isaac Van Wert Then fork out , John , for here comes a prize as good , or may I never take aim again at the sun with the but-end of a quart pot . Paulding . John Paulding Whose cut and deal is this ? Pointing off the stage , as they all jump to their feet and seize their arms . Van Wert . Isaac Van Wert He 's a gentleman-like looking chap , broadcloth and boots , and a heavy purse I 'll warrant me . Williams , David Williams You 're always thinking of purses , Ike . I would n't wonder if natur ' had n't gen ye a spice o ' the foot-pad in your liver . Come , John , suppose you step out and speak to him ; if Ike does it , it will be like your regular banditty , one o ' your touch and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country at all odds . Paulding advances to the entrance as Andre enters abruptly , enveloped in a great coat buttoned to the neck , and an ordinary black hat . Andre endeavors to push Paulding out of his way , with a view to pass him in haste , but Paulding places himself immediately in his front and levels his musket . Paulding . John Paulding It was well done , sir . No doubt you are in a hurry , but then we want to become a little acquainted with you before you travel farther . The times lead to suspicion , and we know not true men from bad . Whilst Paulding is speaking , Williams and Van Wert draw near . Andre . Major John Andre Gentlemen , I hope you belong to our party . Paulding . John Paulding Which party ? Andre . Major John Andre The lower party . Paulding . John Paulding Aye , aye , that we do , do n't we Davy ? Williams . David Williams To be sure we do . What else does the gentleman think ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to learn it . Gentlemen , I am gratified to know that you are friends , for I am a British officer absent from New York on particular business , and I beg you will not detain me , suspecting me to be other than I say I am . Draws a gold watch from his pocket and consults it . Williams . David Williams Aye , aye , Paulding , he 's a Britisher by his yeller gim-cranks . We Yankees are too pesky poor to have such gear . General Washington himself only fobs a silver turnip . Paulding . John Paulding You must remain , sir . Andre . Major John Andre Good heavens ! I must do any thing to get along , my good fellows . Here is General Arnold 's pass , that perhaps you may respect if you do not a British officer . Paulding . John Paulding We will read it . We have no idea of letting you escape till we know your business . Williams . David Williams Hold on like grim death to a dead nigger , John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch . Andre . Major John Andre Gentlemen , you had best let me go , or you will get yourselves into trouble . Examine the pass . Be brief , for I have been too long detained already . Paulding . John Paulding I hope you 'll not be offended , sir , but there are spies and other dangerous people abroad , and I only want to know if you are a true man . If you are proved to be , then there is no harm done ; if you ai nt , why  --  Williams . David Williams Then we 'll have his watch on shares , and pull straws for the chain . Paulding . John Paulding The name in the pass is Anderson , sir . Is it yours ? Andre . Major John Andre It is . Let me go , and I will give you my watch and a horse , saddle and bridle . Paulding . John Paulding Your anxiety to get off leads me to suspect you . Here is General Arnold 's signature  --  that is all right enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just now called yourself a British officer . Van Wert . Isaac Van Wert Considerably suspicious ! Williams . David Williams He 's a regular circumstance , and no mistake . Let 's search him . Van Wert . Isaac Van Wert Aye , that 'll show what 's trumps ! Paulding . John Paulding There is no alternative , you must excuse us , but it must be done , sir . Paulding commences searching . Andre takes off his overcoat , hat , &c.; &c.; whilst doing this Williams opens the watch and examines it . Paulding . John Paulding You may resume your apparel , sir . Andre puts on his coat , &c.; &c.]; Paulding . John Paulding Mr. Anderson , you will oblige me by drawing your boots . Andre . Major John Andre I had thought this foolish search was ended . Paulding . John Paulding Your boots must come off , sir . Andre Major John Andre ( seating himself , placing his hand to his brow , and turning away his face with an expression of the deepest anguish. )  --  Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal papers given Andre by General Arnold . Paulding , Williams and Van Wert hastily examine the papers and confer apart . Williams . David Williams ( approaching Andre . ) Now what 'll you give us to let you go free . Andre . Major John Andre ( eagerly . ) Any amount of money you may ask . Williams . David Williams Will you give me your watch and chain , and these gentlemen your horse , saddle , bridle and a hundred guineas told ? Andre . Major John Andre Cheerfully . And the money shall be directed to this very spot if you say so , so that you shall be sure to get it . Paulding . John Paulding Is that all you have to give ? Andre . Major John Andre I will give you all that you demand , goods or money , to the amount of a thousand pounds . Williams . David Williams Now , mister , if you 'd give us ten thousand guineas , and your watch to boot , yes , your gold watch and chain to boot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys ? Van Wert . Isaac Van Wert If he 's an enemy , poor as we be , I 'd rather be without the money than he should escape to do mischief . Paulding . John Paulding Would you escape if you could ? Andre . Major John Andre Most assuredly . Paulding . John Paulding I do n't intend you shall . You must go with us , sir , to the nearest military post . Van Wert you proceed in advance , Williams and myself will follow in the rear . They arrange themselves after this order .

My preparations are so well planned , that I defy his ingenuity to thwart my adventure . Wilson . Wilson Broaders Just as you say . If the horses are ready , we will have her secure . But take my advice , and carry her directly down to York , for if these Yankee chaps suspect you of the slightest foul play with that gal , why then there 's not water enough in the Hudson for the Vulture . Do you understand that . Langtree . Lieutenant Langtree Ha ! ha ! ha ! I think you believe me a sort of rustic lover . But now listen to me ; I have but a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It will be easy for some of our band to surprise her on her return , and convey her to the place you have named . She will doubtless be attended by Arnold 's serving man , Smithson . We can easily overpower him and then the prize is yours . Langtree . Lieutenant Langtree Enough . Carry out your scheme , and your reward shall be doubled . Exeunt , opposite . Scene 6th .

He had a passport signed in your name , which doubtless is forged , and a parcel of papers taken from his boots , which are of a very dangerous tendency . I send him to you as commanding officer , feeling that it is a case presenting too many difficulties , and involving too much for me to decide upon . Jamieson , Colonel , &c."; Heavens ! My plans are all frustrated ! Arnold instantly returns to the company , and with a cool and extraordinary self command , addresses his guests as follows : Arnold . Gen.

I have been , unknown to you , engaged in a treasonable correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton . The note I have just received tells me of the arrest of his messenger to me , with papers on his person , either of which would produce my death warrant . Nothing remains for me but instant flight to the enemy . My barge is at the landing . I can reach the Vulture by noon . Escape now will be easy . No one here is yet aware of my criminality . An hour hence it will be too late . Though Jamieson is too dull to suspect me , others may ere this have seen the papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn all my papers . Now , farewell , dearest .

ACT III . Scene 1st . A country road . Enter Gen. Arnold hurriedly . He looks about a moment suspiciously , as if fearful of pursuit and discovery . Arnold . Gen. Benedict Arnold What am I ? What have I done ? How will I be received on board that vessel ? These are matters of conjecture . But no more vain regrets , or useless forebodings . The past is irretrievable . Let me then turn my energies to the future . Lie still , conscience . But Washington ! ( looking fearfully around ) what will be his surprise ! This is the day Washington and La Fayette were to have dined with me at the Beverly house . Such is the confidence the commander-in-chief reposes in me  --  alas ! how repaid ! The friendship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he diffuses around him should have saved me from so great a fall . Ah ! who comes here ? I will conceal myself , as recognition might be fatal . Arnold retires so as to conceal himself , but remains within hearing . Enter Adelaide and Smithson from opposite sides , meeting . Adelaide . Adelaide How opportune this meeting is , Mr. Smithson . Such extraordinary events have transpired within the last few hours as to nearly deprive me of my senses . Smithson . John Smithson Why , Miss , is your head getting turned at the thoughts of the young officers who are going to dine here to-day with General Arnold ? Adelaide . Adelaide Forbear  --  forbear your levity , for mercy 's sake , Mr. Smithson . Your remark convinces me that you are unacquainted with the discovery of this morning . Smithson .

Adelaide He has abandoned the American arms , and deserted to the British . Smithson . John Smithson What ? surrendered West Point , and proved treacherous to General Washington ! By all the apostles , but there 'll be a hurricane when Washington finds it out . Adelaide . Adelaide Alas ! Alas ! Smithson . John Smithson Aye , I see it all , now . Fool that I was . I smelt brimstone when that British officer was in the camp . I always knew General Arnold to be a disaffected man ; but , by Heaven , I did not expect the devil to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and raise the country . No time must be lost , or  --  During this speech , General Arnold advances on Smithson , who does not observe him . Arnold . Gen.

He grasps Smithson by the back of the coat collar with one hand , and with the other plunges a dugger to his heart . Die ! miscreant. die ! Smithson John Smithson  --  struggles , and loosens Arnold 's grasp ; places his hand on the wound , and as he falls  --  Ah !  --  I die  --  I die  --  but I die no TRAITOR 'S death .

Having avowed myself a British officer , I have nothing to reveal but what relates to myself , which is true on the honor of an officer and a gentleman . Talmadge . Major Talmadge Any request you have to make will meet with every attention . Andre .

Major Talmadge Yes , yes , my Adelaide , you are right . But a soldier 's life is so very precarious as to give rise to unfounded suspicions . Adelaide . Adelaide A soldier 's life is indeed uncertain . Look at the fate of that unfortunate young officer who was yesterday condemned to death . Talmadge . Major Talmadge You allude to Major Andre .

At this moment Major Andre observes the gallows , which he regards with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation . Andre . Major John Andre Why is this ? Talmadge . Major Talmadge Are you ill , sir ? Andre . Major John Andre ' T is nothing , sir . I hoped to have met my death at least at the hands of soldiers , not at those of the common hangman . Move forward .
