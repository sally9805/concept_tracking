txt Nc inhabitant of Boston or its immediate vicinity needs to be informed of the causes and nature of the unhappy contro // versy to which these pamphlets relate . For our readers at a distance , it may be well to say , that it has grown out of the generous and highly successful efforts of Mr. Mann and a small band of active coadjutors to improve the condition of the common schools throughout the State . For nearly eight years , he has devoted himself to the task with remarkable ability , industry , and zeal ; and his exertions have been signally rewarded by results which , if not commensurate with his ardent hopes , have far surpassed all the expectations that any judicious observer could have formed at the outset , after a full view of the difficulties of the case . There is not a town nor a school district in Massachusetts , where his influence has not been felt ; there is not one which has not largely profited by the spirit which he has excited , and by the improvements which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old ones much improved ; appropriations of money to the purposes of education have greatly increased ; seminaries for teachers have been established ; improved systems of instruction and discipline have been introduced ; the number of scholars is multiplied , and they are far more regular in their attendance at school ; and finally , an interest in the subject has been awakened , which promises still more brilliant and useful results . Mr. Mann has not done all this ; but he has had so large a share in it , that his name is identified with the work . Others have seconded his efforts , but he has borne the burden and the heat of the day . The liberality of a few persons - we may almost say , the munificence of one man - has supplied the pecuniary means for the enterprise . The members of the Board of Education have labored diligently for the cause , and others have zealously cooperated with them , giving what portion of their time and toil could be spared from other employments . But the Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the talents with which God has gifted him . By travelling about and lecturing in the towns and villages , by tendering advice wherever it was needed , by constantly pressing the- subject on the attention of the legislature and the other authorities of the State , and by writing letters , essays , circulars , and reports , he has stimulated the slothful , encouraged the timid , strengthened the weak , instructed the ignorant , and infused a // portion of his own kindling enthusiasm into the mind of every man whom he could reach by his writings or his voice . Through him the profession of the teacher has risen in dignity and importance , and the interests of the common district schools have become attractive enough to draw off the attention of men for a while from the prospect of a change in the tariff or the election of a president . We state these things strongly , perhaps , but snot more strongly than is warranted by the facts , and proved by a cloud of witnesses . We state them as they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all communicated at once , and for the first time . What would such a stranger think , if he was further informed , that the instructers of the public grammar-schools in the capital of the State - persons who had witnessed all the efforts of Mr. Mann and their results , who had profited by his suggestions , whose profession he had exalted , and whose hands had been strengthened in their work by the zeal which he had kindled-had recently published a long and elaborately written pamphlet , in which they not only questioned his opinions and argumnents , but assailed his character and motives , denied the good which he had accomplished , and depreciated the utility of the enterprise in which he was engaged ? We need not answer this question ; the feelings as well as the judgment of every reader will furnish a sufficient reply . But the publication of the pamphlet in question is such a strange phenomenon , that it is worth while to look a little closer into its history and the causes which produced it . In May , 1843 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by travelling , his broken health , and to study the systems of public instruction in foreign countries . He remained abroad about six months , and , as might be expected from the ardor of his temperament and his devotion to the cause of education , he gave nearly the whole of this time to the examination of the school systems , and of the institutions of instruction and beneficence , in the countries that he visited . On his return , he published the results of his observations in his " Seventh Annual Report , " to which we have already twice invited the attention of our readers . It was a striking and valuable production , written with great freshness and energy of style , abounding with curious facts and lively descriptions , and , above all , animated throughout // by the life-giving earnestness and enthusiasm of the writer . It had faults , certainly . Many of the inductions were hasty ; some descriptions were overwrought ; strong feeling was sometimes more visible than sound judgment ; and novelties were too frequently caught up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a spirited account of some striking feature in a European establishment , which Mr. Mann intended merely to describe , without either approving or condemning it , was not unfrequently construed into an earnest expression of judgment in its favor . We have already expressed our dissent from some of the opinions avowed in the Report and one of them , in particular , respecting the proper mode of teaching the deaf and dumb , we recently combated most strenuously , believing it to be unsound in theory , and likely to be very injurious if reduced to practice . But this was done , we trust , with no lack of courtesy and deference towards him , * and with what appeared to be an abundant array of facts and arguments in support of our position . Yet we shall hardly be counted in the ranks among Mr. Mann 's uncompromising and vehement admirers . The teachers of the Boston grammar-schools bad never r*garded with much favor the proceedings of the Board of Education and its Secretary . Their schools , supported by the liberal and intelligent population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic measures of reform , which it was necessary to carry into the small and indolent districts in the country . We speak now of their condition in 1838 , when the Board commenced its labors . They were , in the main , excellent institutions . The people of Boston were proud of them , - not as being all that was desirable , but as far superior to those which existed in the other great cities of the Union . Improvements in them were possible , and were made from time to time , though slowly , and with the caution that is always proper in conducting experiments upon large establishments , where great interests are at stake , and the harm done by unsuccessful trials is considerable . The system pursued in them thus naturally tended to become mechanical , and the instructers inclined to conservatism , and * Mr. Mann , we are surprised and sorry to perceive , from a note to the seventy-first page of his " Reply , " thinks differently ; hut we are quite willing to leave the point to the judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding their comparatively prosperous condition , the Board properly directed their chief attention to the waste places in the smaller towns and country villages . Mr. Mann did something for the Boston grammar-schools , and , as we have already said , the indirect influence of his labors , so far as these schools were concerned , was extensive and beneficial . But the great scene of his exertions and triumphs was along the highways and by-paths of the country , - in the towns of secondary ruagnitude , and the smallest villages , - in the interior , and the remote corners of the State at large . In his annual reports , he alluded but seldom to the Boston schools , and was cautious about pressing his advice upon their boards of supervision . His course in this respect was at once wise and delicate . But the spirit excited by his indefatigable labors arid eloquent voice was ardent , generous , and uncompromising . He created a thirst for reform , which was sometimes undiscriminating , and which began , to extend into the city . In view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to ask , if the teachers and guardians of the Boston schools were not asleep . These institutions had not degenerated ; they had even improved , though very slowly ; but they had lost much of their relative preeminence . Roxbury , and Salem , and Newburyport were beginning to shame the capital of the State . The people of Boston are proud and impatient , and they began to call aloud for reform , without counting the cost , or knowing very well in what the improvement was to consist , or how it was possible . Contradictory plans of change and amelioration were pressed upon the attention of the instructers from all quarters , sometimes by persons whose zeal far outran their discretion . Confused and uneasy under this state of things , the Boston teachers began to look with a very jealous eye upon the proceedings of the Board of Education , and the terrible activity of its S*ecretary . They felt uncomfortable under this pressure from without , - under the diminished comparative reputation of their schools , - under the consciousness that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ascribed the disagreeableness of their position to the officious zeal of Mr. Mann , and began to question the wisdom of his measures , and to doubt whether he had accom // pushed any great good after all . As yet , they offered no active opposition , but manifested great coldness towards the Board of Education and its all-efficient officer . The flame was pent up in their bosoms , hut it was gathering strength there , and was ready to burst forth when the hour should come . The occasion for its outbreak was furnished by the publication of the " Seventh Annual Report . " The lively pictures contained in that Report of excellent public schools in other countries ; the portraits , somewhat idealized , of able and indefatigable teachers ; the startling accounts of wonderful results effected by small means ; the vivid description of plans of instruction and discipline , wholly unlike our own , and often no better ; the spirit-stirring appeals to Americans , if they valued their political institutions , or prized the dearest interests of the human race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fine , all the striking facts and glowing rhetoric of the Secretary bewildered and provoked the teachers of the Boston schools . They were rudely waked from their self-complacent dreams , and made to know , to their great astonishment , that their schools were not exactly the best in the world . They had no direct cause of offence . The Secretary did not even allude to them in his Report , for he knew that comparisons are odious , and he was cautious not to excite ill-feeling . But his readers made the application fast enough . The Boston teachers saw , that they were likely to lose a large share of the reputation they had inherited , and to be beset by still stronger importunities for reform . Thus urged , they resolved to quit their neutral position , and to act vigorously in the offensive . They would appear as the champions of conservatism , and do battle stoutly against the radical and innovating tendencies of the times . Their plan of operations was curious enough . They wished to act in solid column , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack in individual skill and prowess . Only one person could hold the pen at a time ; but his assertions and arguments might be hacked by the authority and signature of all the others , all differences of opinion among themselves being sacrificed for the laudable purpose of crushing a single opponent by the force of many . The weaker portions of the Report- measures recommended // to be tried , perhaps , as proper experiments , and not with a positive conviction of their utility - were to be picked out , and their inexpediency shown , not by way of serving the cause of education through the prevention of ill-judged innovations , but in order to discredit the judgment of the Secretary . Accounts of some striking but objectionable peculiarities of a few European schools , - the rabid activity and volubility of teachers and pupils in Scotland , for instance , - peculiarities which Mr. Mann declares he neVer recommended for adoption here , but described " their fervid life only as a phenomenon , or spectacle , " - were to be held up and denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the writer . These points were to be considered separately , the teachers selecting from among themselves the individual who was thought to be most conversant with each subject , and appointing him to write upon it ; and the piebald Remarks , " thus prepared in partnership by four different hands , were to be attested by the signatures of the whole body . Certainly , if any individual differed in opinion from Mr. Mann on a particular subject , he had a perfect right to express that difference in print , - to unfold his objections , and to scrutinize as sharply as he pleased the positions and the arguments which he deemed unsound . The publications of the Board of Education neither enjoy nor claim any immunity from criticism . He might publish his remarks either anonymously , or under his own name ; in either case , the reflecting and judicious portion of the public would attribute to then only the intrinsic weight which was their due , without any regard to the character or profession of the writer . A bad argument is not converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why unite the remarks of many into one publication , and attest the quality of the compound by the signatures of the whole party ? Who constituted the " Association of Masters of the Boston Public Schools " a board of supervision and criticism upon the official reports of a public functionary , or upon all works on education that issue from the press ? They never assumed this office before ; why take it up now ? They were not summoned into court in a body . They were not called to give their united testimony upon any question of fact . The " Report " was not addressed to them ; the question // was not formally proposed to them , whether they would adopt the suggestions contained in it . In most instances , they had not even the power to adopt them , if they would . It is the province , generally , of the school-committee , and not of the masters , to decide whether certain changes are requisite in the organization and management of the schools . In fact , Mr. Mann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the common district schools in the country , - the objects of all his former efforts , - for which his office was created , - the scene of his toils and the source of his reward . He did not attack the BostonAeachers , either as a body , or as individuals ; he did not write for them , except in that general sense in which he may be said to write for all persons in the State , who feel an interest in the instruction of the young . He made no allusion to the Boston schools ; he does not mention the name of the city in his Report , except incidentally , and where the name of any other place of equal population would have served as well . Why , then , we ask again , do the Boston teachers appear in a body to censure his Report ? The homely adage is applicable here . Mind your own business . On the grave questions respecting modes of instruction and discipline in schools , which are at issue between Mr. Mann and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teachers should be found to harmonize so perfectly in opinion as to be able to sign the same declaration of faith . On two of these vexed questions - the proper mode of teaching children to read , and of inculcating the duty of obedience - it would be quite remarkable to find two persons who hold precisely the same views . Unanimity of opinion among thirty-one must be either forced or deceptive . We are not left in doubt upon this point in the present case . The masters intimate , in their prefatory note , that there were " shades of difference in opinion on some points . " What an admission is this ! they were ready to sacrifice their honest belief on some points , for the sake of uniting in an attack upon the Secretary . They have affixed their signatures to a creed , portions of which were repugnant to their reason or their conscience , for the purpose of bearing down one dissentient by the force of numbers . A recent event has placed in a striking light the injustice - the wickedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose reputation for // integrity and ability stood so deservedly high , that his friends could hardly trust the evidence of their senses when they saw his name appended to the Remarks , ** has since more than atoned for his fault by publicly retracting his signature , - avowing that he disliked the tone and object of the pamphlet from the outset , but was in a measure compelled to sign , contrary to the dictates of his better judgment , by the urgency of his associates . We need not hesitate , then , to declare our conviction , that , for the purposes of this publication , the teachers were handed together in a manner which partakes of the guilt of a conspiracy . It was one of those illegal and unjustifiable " combinations , " which , as every pupil in a large seminary understands , ought to be punished as such , without regard to the nature or propriety of the object which is sought to be obtained by them . It is not necessary to examine very minutely the several parts of this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the plaintiff must come into court with clean hands , that is , with an honest ostensible purpose , and in a fair manner , - or the tribunal will not listen to his complaint . Now , by associating themselves in this strange way , and for such an object , the teachers have in fact deprived themselves of any right to be heard on the subjects in controversy . We may say to the writers of the sections on the Prussian school systems , on the modes of teaching children to read , and on school discipline , that , as their remarks are published together , and at this particular time , not for the purpose of enlightening the public on these topics , but in order to injure the reputation of Mr. Mann , and to lessen the confidence of people in the usefulness of the Board of Education , they do not deserve examination and criticism . They are all vitiated by the ulterior and wrongful purpose with which they were prepared ; they are all parts of an attack upon an individual ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , the utterer of them being rightfully silenced and compelled to sit down . No matter if portions of them are written with decency and good taste and judgment ; no matter if some of the questions are argued with ability ; - by affixing their names to the whole document , they have made themselves responsible for every part of it ; and it contains enough coarse insinuation , unfair argument , and unfounded abuse , to cause // the whole paper to be ruled out of court . The admission is of little moment , then , to the teachers , but sincerity compels us to say , that on several of the topics discussed we think they are in the right , and have the best of the argument . The first portion of the " Remarks , " which extends over thirty-eight pages of the pamphlet , is captious , vulgar , and abusive . It abounds with glaring misrepresentations of Mr. Mann 's opinions , and with remarks calculated to throw odium upon him and the Board of Education , and to excite the prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professed object in view , except this illiberal and odious purpose . He discusses no question about plans of discipline and instruction ; he brings forward no theory in opposition to the views of Mr. Mann ; he seems hardly aware that there are an ) ' topics connected with the management of schools , which require close examination and sober argument . But he multiplies authorities to prove the high character , of the Boston schools , which Mr. Mann never denied , and he manifests a foolish jealousy of the Normal schools , lest some of the pupils educated in them should hereafter obtain situations as instructers by displacing himself and his associates . He may well be left , therefore , to the severe castigation inflicted upon him by Mr. Mann in the " Reply . " Of the other three portions of the " Remarks , " if it were not for the consideration already mentioned , we should speak with mildness , and even with respect . They contain some forced constructions of Mr. Mann 's language , a few inaccuracies of statement , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary evils of controversy . Generally , each writer attaches himself to his particular theme , and reasons upon it with at least an ordinary share of candor and ability . The examination of the Prussian modes of instruction is the feeblest portion of the three , and contains the most objectionable matter . It is very imperfect , but few of the peculiarities of the Prussian system being considered at all , and these without any clear conception of their character and tendency . But much that is said in defence of the proper use of text-books in school , in opposition to the Prussian fashion of lecturing at great length without book , appears to be sound , and ought to be duly weighed by instructers and committees who have charge of the subject . 20* // We have great confidence in the power of a voluble lecturer to amuse his class , but not so much faith in the accuracy of the ideas thus obtained , or in their hold upon the memory of the pupils . The next part , on the proper mode of teaching children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old method of teaching first the letters of the alphabet , and then their combination into words ; Mr. 1'Iann advocates the comparatively novel plan of making the child familiar at first with the appearance of a number of words in writing or print , and then teaching him to resolve these compounds into their elements , and thus to acquire a knowledge of the alphabet . We agree with the writer of the " Remarks , " on the general principle that it is best to teach elementary things first , or to know the parts of which a thing is composed , before we study the whole . Belier , mon ami , commencez par le commencement . In learning to read , there seems to be the same reason for acquiring first a knowledge of the alphabet , that there is , in the study of mathematics , for placing the multiplication table before instruction in algebra , or , in building a house , for beginning with the foundation rather than the ridgepole . Doubtless , the child is more amused at first by learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , than by studying that abstruse problem , the alphabet ; but sooner or later , this task , also , must be accomplished , and it is not very apparent how the prefatory work or amusement will materially lessen the difficulties of the unbreeched philosopher . At any rate , as children may unquestionably be taught to read on either plan , the only question between them seems to relate to the saving of time ; and in all the instances that have fallen under our notice , the child has been enabled to take this first great step in knowledge quite as soon as was at all desirable . The matter , then , may properly be left to the judgment or the fancy of each iiistructer . Respecting the last portion of the " Remarks , " on school discipline , we gladly borrow the language ol ' Mr. G. B. Emerson , the powerful and hearty friend and coadjutor of Mr. Mann , by saying , that it is " a very able , well considered , temperate , and thorough examination of that subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be any discussion on this point between the teachers and the Secretary , // for their general views certainly coincide . Mr. Mann has " always defended the resort to physical coercion , after moral means had been tried and failed " ; and he emphatically rejects the doctrine , that , " in the present state of society , punishment , and even corporal punishment , can be dispensed with , by all teachers , in all schools , and with regard to all scholars . " The opinion of the Teacher is , that , when " the spirit of opposition is too strong to be overruled by those higher and more refined motives , upon which we should always rely when they are active , we are left without resource unless we appeal to fear . " When both parties admit so much , it is difficult to see any ground which remains to be contested between them . The " disputed territory " is evidently of quite small size and very trifling value . But the mischief and Lhe sin of controversy , when personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molehil s . Agreeing substantially in opinion , Mr. 1'Iann and the Teacher still look at the subject from different sides , and are marching in opposite directions . The latter , harassed and fatigued , probably , by the necessity of preserving order and submission among four or five hundred rude boys , collected from the streets and alleys of a great city , over whom he has no control except during six or seven hours of the day , looks with uneasiness and alarm upon any effort to discredit that ancient symbol of his office , the rod , and thus to deprive him of his last resort - the ultima ratio of the schoolmaster . He says with some pathos , " We complain of this disposition to render necessary but irksome measures more irksome , and even odious , by thus dwelling upon and exaggerating their abuses . " On the other hand , the fine humanity and enthusiasm of the Secretary , regarding affection , the sense of duty , the love of knowledge , and the love of truth , as the only proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of compelling submission by stripes , though , with a generous inconsequence , he thereby falsifies his own admissions . Whatever error there may be in either of these courses , we can not find it in our hearts to censure it with great severity . It is a case for mutual explanation and concession ; for the exercise of that charity , which seeks to enter into the feelings of an ol ) ponent , and to understand the difficulties of his situation , and especially to refrain from the use of language which will embitter the one or increase the other . // We have already alluded to Mr. Emerson 's pamphlet , and would here express our deep regret , that all the parts of this lamentable controversy have not been conducted with the admirable temper and discretion which dictated his excellent " Observations . " No person has a better right to be heard with attention and respect upon all the questions here at issue . He has long enjoyed well merited fame as the head of one of the best institutions for education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office have not absorbed his time , or exhausted his zeal for the cause of learning and sound morals . From the outset , he has been a most active and efficient adviser and assistant of the Board of Education and its Secretary , and has spared neither time nor toil , neither his pen nor his person , for the advancement of the great purpose which they have in view . Whenever the work or the agents in it have been attacked from motives of self-interest , fanaticism , or prejudice , he has stood forward as a strong champion in their defence . In the pamphlet now before us , he has rebuked , even with warmth and sternness , the unjustifiable joint attack of the Boston teachers upon Mr. Mann . But he has also spoken the truth in love , with candor , prudence , and good taste . Though some of the coarse insinuations of the teachers were directed against himself , there is no bitterness in the " Observations , " no unwise aggravation of the matters in dispute . Yet no person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not be disposed to cast strong censure upon the conduct of the schoolmasters , and to do whatever in him lies for the support and encouragement of Mr. Mann in his noble enterprise . Mr. Emerson 's eloquent vindication of the measures of the Secretary , and his noble appeal to all parties to forget their differences and unite with each other in helping forward the great cause , we trust , will be heard and answered by every true-hearted man in the State . If Mr. Mann has not written his " Reply " with equal prudence , the fault must be attributed to the ardor of his attachment to the cause , and to the magnitude of the provocation he had received . He has not only amply vindicated himself , but has retorted upon his assailants with terrible severity . Though he dislikes the use of the rod for cThldren , be evidently has no objection to whipping schoolmasters , and in this case , he has certainly plied the birch with remarkable // dexterity and strength of arm . If the reader does not constantly keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the interests which it was meant to injure , he is tempted to pity the unhappy persons exposed to such a merciless punishment . The " Reply " is nervous and eloquent ; hut it is written , perhaps , with too much vehemence , and with rhetoric that is rather flowing and hrilliant , than tasteful or corre&amp;t . As a justification of the writer 's own course , and of the measures of the Board of Education , it is unanswerable ; no person , we think , will he hardy enough again to assail either . Here Mr. Mann stands on firm ground , the purity of his intentions being unquestionahle , and the works which he has accomplished hearing witness both to the wisdom and the energy of his conduct . His opponents are silenced , at any rate , if they are not convinced . With respect to the discussion into which he has entered , of the several plans of instruction and discipline in the schools , it is necessary to speak more doubtfully . He had a perfect right , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the present occasion ; on the ground , that his opinions had been assailed , not in order to elicit or defend the truth , but to excite odium against him as a public officer , and to prejudice the cause in which he was engaged . This , we think , would have been the wisest course . But having consented to waive this privilege , and to meet his opponents on their own ground , he was hound to reason with candor , good temper , and good faith , - not to blend argument with invective , nor to attempt to damage the reasoning of his adversaries by charging upon it the impropriety of their conduct , or the baseness of their motives . Argument is always to be answered as such , or else not answered at all . Having once stepped into the ring with his opponents , Mr. Mann was hound to forego all the advantages of the position he occupied while out of it , - to reason , not as an injured and provoked person , hut as an ingenuous and dispassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound logic . We would not intimate , by any means , that he intended to transgress this obvious rule . His honesty of purpose shines out through the whole " Reply , " with a light that can not be mistaken . But he was troubled and excited , not more by the aggravated assault upon his character and // motives , than by his own earnest conviction of the truth and importance of the doctrines he was defending . An ardent and generous mind can not reason dispassionately under these circumstances . Logic runs into rhetoric ; refutation gives place to invective ; declamation is substituted for plain statements of fact ; and the whole argumentation becomes vicious and unsound . It is painful to charge even these involuntary mistakes upon the Secretary ; but having censured so explicitly and severely the conduct of the teachers , it is due to them that the whole truth should be told . We have already quoted the opinion of Mr. Emerson respecting the fourth portion of the " Remarks , " on the subject of school discipline . The following is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this portion of the schoolmasters ' pamphlet : " I have read most of what has been written in the English and French languages on the subject of education , besides many of the multitudinous works issued from the German press ; and I say , deliberately and advisedly , that if all the unfeeling and cold-hearted doctrines contained in so much of the school literature of these several languages as I have seen were collected together , it would not equal a tithe of what is to be found in the last forty pages of the Remarks . ' " - Reply , p. 142 . This is strong language to be used " deliberately and advisedly " ; it is in striking contrast with the opinion of Mr. Emerson , and we must avow our own conviction , that it is wholly unjust . We will add another citation from the same part of the " Reply , " as it contains Mr. Mann 's comments on a sentence which we have once before quoted . " The Remarks ' say , - where the spirit of opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more refined motives upon which we should always rely when they are active , we are left without resource unless we appeal to fear . ' I deny that any Christian man , or any enlightened heathen man , is left without resource , under such circumstances , unless he appeals to fear . ' lie has the resource of conscience , which is no more extinguished in the child 's soul by the clamorous passions that , for a time , may have silenced its voice , than the stars of heaven are annihilated by the cloud which for a moment obscures them from our vision . He has the resource of social and filial affections . He has the love of knowledge and of truth , which never , in all its // forms , is , or can be , eradicated from a sane mind . If the teacher is what he ought to be , he has the resource of a pure and lofty example in his own character ; and he moves before the eyes of his pupils as a personification of dignity and learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon himself , when he affirms that he has no resources in his own attainments , his own deportment , his own skill , his own character ; but only in the cowhide and birch , and in the strong arm that wields them ! " - Reply , p. 135 . This is very strange . What are appeals to " conscience , " to the " social and filial affections , " to the " love of knowledge and of truth , " to " pure and lofty example , " but attempts to influence conduct by " those higher and more refined motives upon uhich we should always rely when they are active " ? It is difficult to see how a teacher pronounces a " damning sentence " on himself , who never attempts to excite fear till he has vainly tried all these gentler and purer means The Teacher makes some comments on a fact stated in the " Seventh Annual Report , " that , in the course of the writer 's visits to the Prussian schools , he " never saw one child undergoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should the Prussian Minister of Public Instruction see fit to honor the schools of this country with a visit , we presume he would not be shocked with a single exhibition of cruelty or anger . The teachers , we doubt not , would find other means of entertaining him . And even if some thoughtless pupil should need a word of caution , it might effectually be given , without appearing to a stranger , and especially to a foreigner , as an angry word . The mildest terms may portend dire consequences to the disobedient . " - Remarks , p. 110 . On this brief , and , as it seemed to us , quite inoffensive , remark , Mr. Mann makes the following comment : " The case supposes the presence of a visiter , to whom a fair outside is to be exhibited . It supposes also that , under such circumstances , some thoughtless pupil ' may need a word of caution ; and it avers that this might be effectually ' given , without appearing to be an angry word . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences to the disobedient . ' In common acceptation , as well as by lexicographical definition , // dire ' means dreadful , ' horrible , ' evil in a great degree . ' Hydras , and gorgons , and chimeras dire , ' says Milton ; and the Dirce ' of the ancients were the Furies of hell . By what conventional rules , by what settled laws of custom and usage , in the thirty-one Grammar and Writing Schools of Boston , or in any of them , has it come to pass , that the mildest ' accents of gentleness and love - and those intended to appear ' such to a stranger - should shake the heart of a pupil with consternation , for the dire consequences ' they portend ' ? Whence this profanation of the words and tones of affection ; whence this execrable hypocrisy , and this open , unblushing avowal of it ? Was the utterer of this sentiment unconscious of its baseness , or did he so far mistake the moral sense of this community as to suppose it could pass without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a teacher passes round among his pupils , in the presence of visiters and strangers , and , to all outward appearance , says cheeringly , and in the mildest ' tones , to a young master , Well , my fine fellow , ' or My dear , " to a young miss , they should know that , as soon as those visiters are in the street , their limbs will be girdled with stripes ? If this sentence , about the mildest terms ' being portentous of dire consequences , ' were read to the Thirty-one , without rousing a dissenting voice , then I believe they are the only thirty-one men to be found in the city of Boston who could hear it unmoved . Let me say , that it is doctrines on the subject of School Discipline ' like those contained in the Remarks , ' and practices conformable to them , which , in so many places , have degraded the sacred name of school teacher ; and made that most intrinsically honorable of all appellations a hissing and a by-word among men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely , this is a very harsh construction of the Teacher 's language . If a distinguished stranger - a foreign minister , for instance - should visit one of our Boston schools , we should think it was a proof , not of " execrable hypocrisy , ** but of decency and good taste in the master , not to annoy his visiter by any painful exhibition of the details of discipline , but to postpone the infliction of any punishment that might be necessary to a more convenient season . On occasion of a public visitation of a seminary , it is quite common to have the apartment swept and garnished with particular care , and the walls ornamented with some simple arrangement of flowers and green branches . Would it not be harsh to charge the instructer , on this account , with prac // tising hypocrisy and deceit , and laboring to give his visiters a false idea of the neatness and order commonly preserved in the establishment ? To dwell upon and exaggerate the meaning of the word " dire , " by connecting it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furies , is as ludicrous as it is unjust . Every reader gifted with common sense must perceive , that the phrase " dire consequences " is here used by the teacher in a half playful sense , implying a state of mind which is the very opposite of bitterness and severity . In the notice which introduces the " Remarks " occurs the following sentence . " The teacher , who has stood for many years , himself against a host ' of five or six hundred children from all ranks and conditions of society , thinks he may once ask a hearing before the public . " The morsel of a quotation in this sentence is not in very good taste , but it seems inoffensive enough . Fatigued and harassed by his unremitting duties , the teacher might well claim some sympathy , on the ground that he has so long stood alone " against a host " of children , though each one of his pupils , individally , was to him an object of strong affection . Few would think of finding in this casual expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who were intrusted to his charge . Yet Mr. Mann comments upon it as follows " Before the vestibule , in the outer court of this temple which the Thirty.one have reared and consecrated to education , is the following inscription : The teacher who has stood for many years , " himself against a host " of five or six hundred children . ' Yes ; against a host ' ! - not for , not with , hut adversely to ; - not as a guide and counsellor , but , for many years , ' as a combatant and antagonist ! - the whole presenting the image of belligerent forces and a hostile array , of whose fierce encounters the school.room is the battle-ground ! " - p. 126 . This is the ingenuity of fault-finding run mad . Coming from any other person , we should at once pronounce it to be captious and unreasonable . In considering the cases adduced by Mr. Mann , of large institutions successfully managed by " moral suasion , " or very mild means , the teacher properly takes a distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as almshouses , insane asylums , " redemption institutes , " pris // ons , and the like - and the common schools of a great city . He argues very rightly , that the situation of the unfortunate inmates of such asylums necessarily creates in their minds a sense of entire dependence and indebtedness , which renders them far more susceptible of control . He might have added , - the consideration being of still greater weight , - that these unhappy persons remain constantly within the walls , under the eye of their guardians , the system of management thus operating upon them without break , and without the admission of foreign and injurious influences ; while the boys of the Boston public schools are under the charge of their teachers for not more than a fourth part of the twenty-four hours , and , during the rest of the time , many of them are at home with vicious , foolish , or negligent parents , or are exposed to all the corrupting and hardening influences of the streets of a large city . Whether the distinction here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical coercion in common schools , after it is shown that " sanative establishments " can be managed without it , or without the use of equivalent means equally objectionable , we do not undertake to say ; probably it is not . But the distinction is evidently good as far as it goes ; it is a fair and inoffensive argument , which deserves to be candidly considered . Will it be believed , that Mr. Mann so far perverts this argument as to charge the Teacher with maintaining the monstrous doctrine , that kindness is the appropriate means of influence " for thieves and vagabonds , " but not " for honest , noble-souled boys " ? But we will do the Secretary the justice , severe though it be , of quoting his own words . " A way , then , is open , - one condition is still left , - by which you may save your children from the degradation of stripes , and the dastard crouchings of fear ; and by which you may secure for them a government and training , whose means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - Christian instruction and Christian benevolence . ' Abandon them . Strip off the lineaments of love from your countenance , and put on those of a fiend . Let your words scorch instead of counselling . For embraces , give blows . When night comes on , send them abroad for theft , instead of teaching them to bend their knees , and lift up their voices , in thanksgiving for the past blessings of the light , and the coming blessings of the darkness ; // and at last , when the officers of ' the law shall have seized them for thefi , or burglary , or incendiarism , console yourselves with the reflection , that , for such children , kindness is the appropriate , and should be the almost exclusive means of influence ' ; that they can now be blessed by Christian instruction and Christian love , ' because their present condition has only a very partial bearing upon the question of discipline in our common schools . ' " - pp. 152 , 153 . It is an old rule for the logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be charged with any odious consequences that may , fairly enough , be deducible from his doctrine , unless he expressly avows and defends them . The reasonableness of this rule is evident . He may not have foreseen that his opinion would lead to such results , and would have shrunk with horror from them , if he had ; or he may not have carefully limited his statement , supposing that the necessary and obvious qualifications and exceptions would be taken for granted . Now , the writer of the last portion of the " Remarks " has but one object in view he endeavours to show , that " school discipline must be based upon authority , as a starting-point " ; he holds , that the duty of submission and obedience , as such , explicit and unreserved , must be inculcated on the mind of a child , even , if it be necessary , by a resort to extreme means , - to corporal punishment . Of course , it is sufficiently implied , if , indeed , it be not expressly stated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means must first be tried , and physical pain be made the last resort . Mr. Mann takes no notice of this limitation , and argues , or rather declaims , throughout , on the supposition , that the whole philosophy of school discipline , according to the Teacher , is contained in the four words , " Authority , Force , Fear , Pain " ; these are Mr. Mann 's words , or rather the selection and collocation are his ; he afterwards alters them to " Power , Violence , Terror , Suffering . " He says , " It is here , that the Remarks ' introduce us to a frozen midnight , where the light of love is extinguished , and all moral sentiment and humanity are congealed . " Very strong language , certainly , and strikingly opposed to that of Mr. Emerson , who gives his entire assent to the doctrine of the Teacher as above stated , saying , " This most important principle is sustained with power and success ; it is placed , so far as reasoning can // place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits the necessity of using the authority of brute force " in extreme cases , " though he grieves that this idea " should have occupied so large a place in so pure a mind as that from which this portion of the Remarks came . ' ' Will Mr. Mann include in his anathema all who have expressly sanctioned this doctrine of the Teacher ? But the most striking instance of the transgression of the logical rule above stated still remains . Mr. Mann insists , that the Teacher has stated his principle " without making any exception as to age , sex , or disposirion . " No express exception , it is true ; but would not charity imply one ? At any rate , does not the rule already given forbid his taking any advantage of this omission in arguing against the main principle ? And yet he proceeds to hold the Teacher responsible for defending the abominable practice of " flogging girls , " though there is not one word upon this topic in any part of the " Remarks . " Why not also make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , for whipping infants less than a year old ? There would be quite as much charity and justice in the latter case as in the former . We can hardly believe , that , in the Boston public schools , females are actually exposed to this degradation and cruelty . If they are , in the name of decency and humanity , earnestly do we entreat the guardians of those institutions to put an immediate stop to the disgraceful practice . But whether the practice exists or not , Mr. Mann , when his only ostensible purpose is to reply to the remarks of the Teacher , has no right to make him responsible for an inference from his doctrine , which he neither avows nor defends . To heap up indignant denunciations on this point , under the circumstances of the present discussion , is to cast unreasonable and undeserved odium upon his opponent , without advancing a step in the refutation of that opponent 's principles . The following extract affords a fair specimen of his language upon this theme . " In the clear vista of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a celestial light , I see , by the eye of faith , the heralds of Universal Peace . The great prophecy of Christianity is at last fulfilled . Emblems have become realities , and hope is lost in fruition . There is peace on earth and good-will among men . But ho ! what hideous spectacle profanes this hallowed // vision ? It is a spectacle of ' men , and the likeness there . of is as the likeness of the Thirty-one Boston Schoolmasters still flogging boys and - FLOGGING GIRLS ! " - p. 164 . But enough of fault-finding . If our remarks have given pain , we are sorry for it ; but a regard for judicial fairness leaves no alternative but to expose mistakes and errors , wherever they may be found . The attack of the Boston Teachers upon the Board of Education and its Secretary has failed , - signally and disgracefully failed . Mr. Mann has not only amply vindicated his character and motives , but has gained a large accession of respect and influence by the proofs that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untiring devotion to the cause . If he has shown any undue sensitiveness under the criticism of his favorite plans of improvement , or any improper warmth in defending them , be may still boast , that these very failings manifest the strength and heartiness of his attachment to the cause . He should consider , that his especial office is to propose for consideration all schemes of reform in discipline and instruction , which may come under his notice ; while that of others is to weigh them , and decide upon the propriety of their introduction into the schools . Strenuous objections to any of these plans do not necessarily convey any imputation upon him , or upon the propriety of his course in bringing them before the public . He can now afford to be generous , and to welcome his late opponents to a full participation in his labors for extending and perfecting the system of common schools throughout the State . The great business of educating the children of this commonwealth imperatively demands the undivided attention and active cooperation of both parties ; and great will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this call in order to keep up a discussion , which now promises , if continued further , to degenerate into a miserable personal controversy . We can hardly conceive it possible , that the great enterpris&amp; of the Board of Education of Massachusetts should excite jealousy , distrust , or active opposition in any quarter . The evident disinterestedness of all the persons engaged in it ; the impossibility of converting it into a means for the furtherance of political or sectarian ends ; the union of all parties , sects , interests , and districts in its favor ; the sacred character of the objects it proposes to accomplish ; the good 21 * // it has already effected ; and the wide sphere of usefulness which yet remains for it ; - these are its titles to confidence and respect . The history of the few and insignificant attempts to check its progress is full of instruction . It has triumphed over every one of them , gaining fresh vigor and popularity hy the effort , while its assailants have been silenced and disgraced . It has overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable obstacles to it at the beginning , and it is now so firmly supported by the respect and gratitude of the community at large , that any direct opposition to it is not only futile , but pitiable . The Boston Teachers might as well attempt to dam up the Mississippi , as to stay its progress . They do not need to make the attempt ; for if they are faithful to themselves and to the interests intrusted to their charge , it will redound to their own reputation and advantage . It will exalt the dignity of their office ; it will surround them with the sympathies of the public ; it will put into their hands new aids and appliances for the performance of their duties ; it will advance the reputation of their schools ; it will secure to them a richer harvest of esteem and gratitude from their pupils , who will be indebted to them for a more comprehensive , liberal , and profitable education than they now receive . Let them cheer it onward , then , instead of throwing themselves before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible momentum.
