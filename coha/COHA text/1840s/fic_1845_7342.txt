" 178 PREFACE . A new vein of literature , as original as it is inexhaustible in its source , has been opened in this country within a very few years , with the most marked success . Up to the period when the publication of the first American " Sporting Magazine " was commenced  --  at Baltimore , in 1829  --  and which was immediately followed by the publication , in New York , of the " Spirit of the Times , " there existed no such class of writers as have , since that recent day , conferred signal honour on the rising literature of America . The New York " Constellation , " then edited by that favoured disciple of Momus , the late Dr. Green , was the only journal in the country which preferred any claim to popular favour on the ground of being expressly devoted to wit and humor  --  to the fun and frolic , the flash and fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Spirit of the Times " soon fixed attention ; and ere long it became the nucleus of a new order of literary talent . In addition to correspondents who described with equal felicity and power the stirring incidents of the chase and the turf , it enlisted another and still more numerous class , who furnished most valuable and interesting reminiscences of the pioneers of the far West  --  sketches of thrilling scenes and adventures in that then comparatively unknown region , and the extraordinary characters occasionally met with  --  their strange language and habitudes , and the peculiar and sometimes fearful characteristics of the " squatters " and early settlers . Many of these descriptions were wrought up in a masterly style ; and in the course of a few years a generous feeling of emulation sprung up in the south and south-west , prompted by the same impulses , until at length the correspondents of the " Spirit of the Times " comprised a large majority of those who have subsequently distinguished themselves in this novel and original walk of literature . Cooper and Paulding were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inimitable delineations of the back-woodsmen , trappers , and boatmen of the West . But the characters and scenes which they depicted with such marvellous fidelity and effect , belonged to an earlier period  --  before the genius of Fulton had covered the mighty rivers of the new world in the West with a substitute for the " broad horns " and flat boats , which took the place of the frail canoes of the aboriginal inhabitants of those " happy hunting-grounds . " The back-woodsmen and the boatmen of the era of " The Prarie , " and " Westward Ho ! " having given way to a new generation , perhaps quite as interesting and novel in their characteristics , have been , in turn , succeeded by that hardy and indomitable race , whose sons and daughters are now enjoying a green old age , surrounded by the evidences of the highest civilization , and in the enjoyment of all those social , moral , and intellectual blessings engendered by an enlightened public mind , a populous region , and generally diffused wealth and prosperity . Gradually retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new states and territories of the West , the " pioneers " of a later day have finally established themselves in regions so distant as rather to overlook the Pacific than the acknowledged boundaries of the Federal Union . But they have left behind them , on all hands , scores of original characters to be encountered nowhere else under the sun . Indeed , several of the south-western states have been so recently reclaimed from the wilderness  --  Mississippi and Arkansas particularly  --  that no one acquainted with the country can be surprised at the fact . In these two states  --  destined each , we trust , to confer additional lustre on the galaxy originally composed of the old thirteen  --  yet reside some of the most extraordinary men who ever lived " to point a moral , or adorn a tale . " With exteriors " like the rugged Russian bear , " some of them are gifted with a great degree of good sense and knowledge of the world ; it is not to be denied that many are as fond of whiskey as of hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them ; but a large majority of those to whom we refer , are characterized by no more striking features than their courtesy to the stranger , and their passion for hunting , except it be their fondness for story-telling . Of adventures and scenes in which these characters stand out in bold relief , this volume is mainly composed , relieved occasionally by sketches of men and things in some of the older southern states . Among those who have attracted , of late years , the most attention abroad by their sketches of life and manners in the backwoods of America , are Col. C. F. M. Noland , of Arkansas , and T. B. Thorpe , the artist , of Louisiana . We may be permitted to state , that Col. N. is a son of the old Dominion , was educated at West Point , was an officer in the U. S. dragoons , and since his resignation has been a resident of Arkansas , where his time is about equally divided between courts of law , the land offices , and the legislature . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his family still resides , ) is no less distinguished as a writer than a painter . Some seven years since  --  about the period when the " American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine " fell into our hands  --  Mr. Thorpe enlisted in the corps of gifted correspondents who made the " Spirit of the Times " their medium of communication with the world of letters . His sketches of the men and manners of the great valley of the Mississippi , over the signature of " The Author of Tom Owen , the Bee Hunter , " have been read and admired wherever our language is spoken . Col. Mason , " Captain Martin Scott , " ( of " coon " remembrance , ) Gen. Gibson , Maj. Moore , Gen. Brooke , and a troop of other gallant officers of the U. S. army , whom we are not permitted to name , have contributed in an infinite degree to the popularity of the " curiosities of literature " so recently discovered . Audubon , the late Timothy Flint , Albert Pike , and more recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fanciful " Mary Clavers " ( Mrs. Kirkland . ) Captains Carleton , Henry , and Johnston of the U. S. A. , exGov Butler and Mr. Sibley , the Indian agents , the late M. C. Field , Mr. Kendall , of the " Picayune , " and several others whose identity we are not at liberty to disclose , have all vastly magnified , by their writings , the eager curiosity to know more of the distinguishing traits of character of the denizens of the many comparatively unpeopled regions of the West and South-west . We should premise here , that several of the eminent writers just enumerated , are not represented in this volume , its limits not allowing " scope and verge enough . " Moreover , of those not named , many of them would " find themselves equally famous " if we dared " take the responsibility " of giving their names to the world ; and accordingly , in collating the materials of this volume , we have selected from the files of the " Spirit of the Times " those articles deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all , of the different sketches in this volume appeared , originally , in the columns of that journal . Many of equal , if not superior , merit have been here omitted , on the ground that , like dressing a salad , a small but proper proportion of salt and pepper is quite as requisite as the more material ingredients of oil and mustard . This will , we trust , be appreciated by every one who is unwilling , incontinently , to swear " on his honour , the mustard is naught . " But should there arise those of a different opinion , we shall take the earliest opportunity of renewing to them Grumio 's offer to the supperless Katherine , of " the mustard without the beef . " It is proper to add , that the tales and sketches included in this volume refer to characters and scenes of recent date  --  to men who have not only succeeded " Mike Fink , the Last of the Boatmen , " but " Col. Nimrod Wildfire , " and originals of his stamp . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lawyers , &c.; " who live at home at ease . " We are utterly precluded , by repeated injunctions of secresy , from giving the " name " or " local habitation " of any one of those not designated in the introduction to the respective sketches . Their modesty should be esteemed , indeed , " a flambeau to their merit . " Most of them are gentlemen not only highly educated , but endowed with a keen sense of whatever is ludicrous or pathetic , with a quick perception of character , and a knowledge of men and the world : more than all , they possess in an eminent degree the power of transferring to paper the most faithful and striking pictures with equal originality and effect . In this respect they have no superiors on either side of the Atlantic . In the compilation of this little volume , the editor has been animated by a wish to make it worthy of those correspondents who have extended to him , in the conduct of two publications requiring the exercise of daily application and unceasing toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the world he delivers it " with the spirit of a man that has endeavoured well . " W. T. P. - Office of theSpirit of the Times New York , Feb. 1845 . Preliminaries Main text THE BIG BEAR OF ARKANSAS . BY T. B. THORPE , ESQ . OF LOUISIANA . As the author of " Tom Owen the Bee Hunter , " and other tales and sketches , Mr. Thorpe has acquired a distinguished reputation on both sides of the Atlantic . Though by profession a painter , his time for several years past has been about equally divided between the brush and the pen . He is now engaged in the publication of the " Concordia Intelligencer , " a journal of unusual ability , issued weekly in the pleasant little village situated directly opposite the city of Natchez . The New York " Spirit of the Times " was the medium through which Mr. T. first appeared before the world of letters ; and his inimitable delineations of South-western characters , incidents , and scenery , soon attracted attention . Now , wherever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mouths of wisest censure . " It is understood to be his intention to publish , at an early day , a collection of his writings , original and selected , to be illustrated by himself . As he is alike felicitous in the use of crayon , brush , or pen , we anticipate a brace or two of volumes of the highest pictorial and literary interest . The story annexed will give the reader an idea of his peculiar style in hitting off the original " characters " frequently met with in the great valley of the Mississippi . A steamboat on the Mississippi frequently , in making her regular trips , carries between places varying from one to two thousand miles apart ; and as these boats advertise to land passengers and freight at " all intermediate landings , " the heterogeneous character of the passengers of one of these up-country boats can scarcely be imagined by one who has never seen it with his own eyes . Starting from New Orleans in one of these boats , you will find yourself associated with men from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe ; and a man of observation need not lack for amusement or instruction in such a crowd , if he will take the trouble to read the great book of character so favourably opened before him . Here may be seen jostling together the wealthy Southern planter , and the pedler of tin-ware from New England  --  the Northern merchant , and the Southern jockey  --  a venerable bishop , and a desperate gambler  --  the land speculator , and the honest farmer  --  professional men of all creeds and characters  --  Wolvereens , Suckers , Hoosiers , Buckeyes , and Corncrackers , beside a " plentiful sprinkling " of the half-horse and half-alligator species of men , who are peculiar to " old Mississippi , " and who appear to gain a livelihood simply by going up and down the river . In the pursuit of pleasure or business , I have frequently found myself in such a crowd . On one occasion , when in New Orleans , I had occasion to take a trip of a few miles up the Mississippi , and I hurried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just as the last note of the last bell was sounding ; and when the confusion and bustle that is natural to a boat 's getting under way had subsided , I discovered that I was associated in as heterogeneous a crowd as was ever got together . As my trip was to be of a few hours ' duration only , I made no endeavours to become acquainted with my fellow passengers , most of whom would be together many days . Instead of this , I took out of my pocket the " latest paper , " and more critically than usual examined its contents ; my fellow passengers at the same time disposed of themselves in little groups . While I was thus busily employed in reading , and my companions were more busily still employed in discussing such subjects as suited their humours best , we were startled most unexpectedly by a loud Indian whoop , uttered in the " social hall , " that part of the cabin fitted off for a bar ; then was to be heard a loud crowing , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being quite common in that place of spirits  --  had not the hero of these windy accomplishments stuck his head into the cabin and hallooed out , " Hurra for the Big Bar of Arkansaw ! " and then might be heard a confused hum of voices , unintelligible , save in such broken sentences as " horse , " " screamer , " " lightning is slow , " &c.; As might have been expected , this continued interruption attracted the attention of every one in the cabin ; all conversation dropped , and in the midst of this surprise the " Big Bar " walked into the cabin , took a chair , put his feet on the stove , and looking back over his shoulder , passed the general and familiar salute of " Strangers , how are you ? " He then expressed himself as much at home as if he had been at " the Forks of Cypress , " and " prehaps a little more so . " Some of the company at this familiarity looked a little angry , and some astonished ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something about the intruder that won the heart on sight . He appeared to be a man enjoying perfect health and contentment : his eyes were as sparkling as diamonds , and good-natured to simplicity . Then his perfect confidence in himself was irresistibly droll . " Prehaps , " said he , " gentlemen , " running on without a person speaking , " prehaps you have been to New Orleans often ; I never made the first visit before , and I do n't intend to make another in a crow 's life . I am thrown away in that ar place , and useless , that ar a fact . Some of the gentlemen thar called me green  --  well , prehaps I am , said I , but I ar n't so at home ; and if I ai nt off my trail much , the heads of them perlite chaps themselves wer n't much the hardest ; for according to my notion , they were real know-nothings , green as a pumpkin-vine  --  could'nt , in farming , I 'll bet , raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd miss a barn if the door was swinging , and that , too , with the best rifle in the country . And then they talked to me ' bout hunting , and laughed at my calling the principal game in Arkansaw poker , and high-low-jack . Prehaps , ' said I , you prefer chickens and rolette ; ' at this they laughed harder than ever , and asked me if I lived in the woods , and did n't know what game was ? At this I rather think I laughed . Yes , ' I roared , and says , Strangers , if you 'd asked me how we got our meat in Arkansaw , I 'd a told you at once , and given you a list of varmints that would make a caravan , beginning with the bar , and ending off with the cat ; that 's meat though , not game . ' Game , indeed , that 's what city folks call it ; and with them it means chippen-birds and shite-pokes ; maybe such trash live in my diggins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way is too trifling . I never did shoot at but one , and I 'd never forgiven myself for that , had it weighed less than forty pounds . I would n't draw a rifle on any thing less than that ; and when I meet with another wild turkey of the same weight I will drap him . " " A wild turkey weighing forty pounds ! " exclaimed twenty voices in the cabin at once . " Yes , strangers , and was n't it a whopper ? You see , the thing was so fat that it could n't fly far ; and when he fell out of the tree , after I shot him , on striking the ground he bust open behind , and the way the pound gobs of tallow rolled out of the opening was perfectly beautiful . " " Where did all that happen ? " asked a cynical-looking Hoosier . " Happen ! happened in Arkansaw : where else could it have happened , but in the creation state , the finishing-up country  --  a state where the sile runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government gives you a title to every inch of it ? Then its airs  --  just breathe them , and they will make you snort like a horse . It 's a state without a fault , it is . " " Excepting mosquitoes , " cried the Hoosier . " Well , stranger , except them ; for it ar a fact that they are rather enormous , and do push themselves in somewhat troublesome . But , stranger , they never stick twice in the same place ; and give them a fair chance for a few months , and you will get as much above noticing them as an alligator . They ca n't hurt my feelings , for they lay under the skin ; and I never knew but one case of injury resulting from them , and that was to a Yankee : and they take worse to foreigners , any how , than they do to natives . But the way they used that fellow up ! first they punched him until he swelled up and busted ; then he sup-per-a-ted , as the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then he took the ager , owing to the warm weather , and finally he took a steamboat and left the country . He was the only man that ever took mosquitoes at heart that I know of . But mosquitoes is natur , and I never find fault with her . If they ar large , Arkansaw is large , her varmints ar large , her trees ar large , her rivers ar large , and a small mosquitoe would be of no more use in Arkansaw than preaching in a cane-brake . " This knock-down argument in favour of big mosquitoes used the Hoosier up , and the logician started on a new track , to explain how numerous bear were in his " diggins , " where he represented them to be " about as plenty as blackberries , and a little plentifuler . " Upon the utterance of this assertion , a timid little man near me inquired if the bear in Arkansaw ever attacked the settlers in numbers . " No , " said our hero , warming with the subject , " no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bar to go in droves ; but the way they squander about in pairs and single ones in edifying . And then the way I hunt them  --  the old black rascals know the crack of my gun as well as they know a pig 's squealing . They grow thin in our parts , it frightens them so , and they do take the noise dreadfully , poor things . That gun of mine is a perfect epidemic among bar : if not watched closely , it will go off as quick on a warm scent as my dog Bowie-knife will : and then that dog  --  whew ! why the fellow thinks that the world is full of bar , he finds them so easy . It 's lucky he do n't talk as well as think ; for with his natural modesty , if he should suddenly learn how much he is acknowledged to be ahead of all other dogs in the universe , he would be astonished to death in two minutes . Strangers , that dog knows a bar 's way as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time , bites at the exact place , and whips without getting a scratch . I never could tell whether he was made expressly to hunt bar , or whether bar was made expressly for him to hunt : any way , I believe they were ordained to go together as naturally as Squire Jones says a man and woman is , when he moralizes in marrying a couple . In fact , Jones once said , said he , Marriage according to law is a civil contract of divine origin ; it 's common to all countries as well as Arkansaw , and people take to it as naturally as Jim Doggett 's Bowie-knife takes to bar . " ' " What season of the year do your hunts take place ? " inquired a gentlemanly foreigner , who , from some peculiarities of his baggage , I suspected to be an Englishman , on some hunting expedition , probably at the foot of the Rocky mountains . " The season for bar hunting , stranger , " said the man of Arkansaw , " is generally all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regular . I read in history that varmints have their fat season , and their lean season . That is not the case in Arkansaw , feeding as they do upon the spontenacious productions of the sile , they have one continued fat season the year round : though in winter things in this way is rather more greasy than in summer , I must admit . For that reason bar with us run in warm weather , but in winter they only waddle . Fat , fat ! it 's an enemy to speed ; it tames every thing that has plenty of it . I have seen wild turkeys , from its influence , as gentle as chickens . Run a bar in this fat condition , and the way it improves the critter for eating is amazing ; it sort of mixes the ile up with the meat , until you ca n't tell t' other from which . I 've done this often . I recollect one perty morning in particular , of putting an old he fellow on the stretch , and considering the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon tired him down , and when I came up with him was n't he in a beautiful sweat  --  I might say fever ; and then to see his tongue sticking out of his mouth a feet , and his sides sinking and opening like a bellows , and his cheeks so fat he could n't look cross . In this fix I blazed at him , and pitch me naked into a briar patch if the steam did n't come out of the bullet-hole ten foot in a straight line . The fellow , I reckon , was made on the high-pressure system , and the lead sort of bust his biler . " " That column of steam was rather curious , or else the bear must have been warm , " observed the foreigner , with a laugh . " Stranger , as you observe , that bar was WARM , and the blowing off of the steam show 'd it , and also how hard the varmint had been run . I have no doubt if he had kept on two miles farther his insides would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a varmint yet of extra bottom , who will run himself into a skinfull of bar 's grease : it is possible ; much onlikelier things have happened . " " Whereabouts are these bears so abundant ? " inquired the foreigner , with increasing interest . " Why , stranger , they inhabit the neighbourhood of my settlement , one of the prettiest places on old Mississippi  --  a perfect location , and no mistake ; a place that had some defects until the river made the cut-off ' at Shirt-tail bend , ' and that remedied the evil , as it brought my cabin on the edge of the river  --  a great advantage in wet weather , I assure you , as you can now roll a barrel of whiskey into my yard in high water from a boat , as easy as falling off a log . It 's a great improvement , as toting it by land in a jug , as I used to do , evaporated it too fast , and it became expensive . Just stop with me , stranger , a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will appreciate my place . I can give you plenty to eat ; for beside hog and hominy , you can have bar-ham , and bar-sausages , and a mattrass of bar-skins to sleep on , and a wildcat-skin , pulled off hull , stuffed with corn-shucks , for a pillow . That bed would put you to sleep if you had the rheumatics in every joint in your body . I call that ar bed a quietus . Then look at my land  --  the government ai n't got another such a piece to dispose of . Such timber , and such bottom land , why you ca n't preserve any thing natural you plant in it unless you pick it young , things thar will grow out of shape so quick . I once planted in those diggins a few potatoes and beets : they took a fine start , and after that an ox team could n't have kept them from growing . About that time I went off to old Kentuck on bisiness , and did not hear from them things in three months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my place , with an idea of buying me out . How did you like things ? ' said I. Pretty well , ' said he ; the cabin is convenient , and the timber land is good ; but that bottom land ai n't worth the first red cent . ' Why ? ' said I. ' Cause , ' said he . ' Cause what ? ' said I. ' Cause it 's full of cedar stumps and Indian mounds , ' said he , and it ca n't be cleared . ' Lord , ' said I , them ar " cedar stumps " is beets , and them ar " Indian mounds " ar tater hills . ' As I expected , the crop was overgrown and useless : the sile is too rich , and planting in Arkansaw is dangerous . I had a good-sized sow killed in that same bottom land . The old thief stole an ear of corn , and took it down where she slept at night to eat . Well , she left a grain or two on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn shot up , and the percussion killed her dead . I do n't plant any more : natur intended Arkansaw for a hunting ground , and I go according to natur . " The questioner who thus elicited the description of our hero 's settlement , seemed to be perfectly satisfied , and said no more ; but the " Big Bar of Arkansaw " rambled on from one thing to another with a volubility perfectly astonishing , occasionally disputing with those around him , particularly with a " live Sucker " from Illinois , who had the daring to say that our Arkansaw friend 's stories " smelt rather tall . " In this manner the evening was spent ; but conscious that my own association with so singular a personage href= " http : **52;2132;TOOLONG ? i d=eaf396 &image=396-031.jpg"; name=f396-031Page image - Page 023. would probably end before morning , I asked him if he would not give me a description of some particular bear hunt ; adding , that I took great interest in such things , though I was no sportsman . The desire seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , that he could give me an idea of a bar hunt that was never beat in this world , or in any other . His manner was so singular , that half of his story consisted in his excellent way of telling it , the great peculiarity of which was , the happy manner he had of emphasizing the prominent parts of his conversation . As near as I can recollect , I have italicized them , and given the story in his own words . " Stranger , " said he , " in bar hunts I am numerous , and which particular one , as you say , I shall tell , puzzles me . There was the old she devil I shot at the Hurricane last fall  --  then there was the old hog thief I popped over at the Bloody Crossing , and then  --  Yes , I have it ! I will give you an idea of a hunt , in which the greatest bar was killed that ever lived , none excepted ; about an old fellow that I hunted , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that ai n't a particular bar hunt , I ai n't got one to tell . But in the first place , stranger , let me say , I am pleased with you , because you ai n't ashamed to gain information by asking , and listening ; and that 's what I say to Countess 's pups every day when I 'm home ; and I have got great hopes of them ar pups , because they are continually nosing about ; and though they stick it sometimes in the wrong place , they gain experience any how , and may learn something useful to boot . Well , as I was saying about this big bar , you see when I and some more first settled in our region , we were drivin to hunting naturally ; we soon liked it , and after that we found it an easy matter to make the thing our business . One old chap who had pioneered ' afore us , gave us to understand that we had settled in the right place . He dwelt upon its merits until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions , more marks on the sassafras trees than I ever saw on a tavern door ' lection time . Who keeps that ar reckoning ? ' said I. The bar , ' said he . What for ? ' said I. Ca n't tell , ' said he ; but so it is : the bar bite the bark and wood too , at the highest point from the ground they can reach , and you can tell , by the marks , ' said he , the length of the bar to an inch . ' Enough , ' said I ; I 've learned something here a'ready , and I 'll put it in practice . ' Well , stranger , just one month from that time I killed a bar , and told its exact length before I measured it , by those very marks ; and when I did that , I swelled up considerable  --  I 've been a prouder man ever since . So I went on , larning something every day , until I was reckoned a buster , and allowed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a reputation as much harder to earn than to be reckoned first man in Congress , as an iron ramrod is harder than a toadstool . Did the varmints grow over-cunning by being fooled with by green-horn hunters , and by this means get troublesome , they send for me as a matter of course ; and thus I do my own hunting , and most of my neighbours ' . I walk into the varmints though , and it has become about as much the same to me as drinking . It is told in two sentences  --  a bar is started , and he is killed . The thing is somewhat monotonous now  --  I know just how much they will run , where they will tire , how much they will growl , and what a thundering time I will have in getting them home . I could give you this history of the chase with all the particulars at the commencement , I know the signs so well  --  Stranger , I 'm certain . Once I met with a match though , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be worth relating . " On a fine fall day , long time ago , I was trailing about for bar , and what should I see but fresh marks on the sassafras trees , about eight inches above any in the forests that I knew of . Says I , them marks is a hoax , or it indicates the d  --  t bar that was ever grown . ' In fact , stranger , I could n't believe it was real , and I went on . Again I saw the same marks , at the same height , and I knew the thing lived . That conviction came home to my soul like an earthquake . Says I , here is something a-purpose for me : that bar is mine , or I give up the hunting business . ' The very next morning what should I see but a number of buzzards hovering over my corn-field . The rascal has been there , ' said I , for that sign is certain : ' and , sure enough , on examining , I found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before , as was ever raised by a Buckeye . Then I tracked the critter out of the field to the woods , and all the marks he left behind , showed me that he was the bar . " Well , stranger , the first fair chase I ever had with that big critter , I saw him no less than three distinct times at a distance : the dogs run him over eighteen miles and broke down , my horse gave out , and I was as nearly used up as a man can be , made on my principle , which is patent . Before this adventure , such things were unknown to me as possible ; but , strange as it was , that bar got me used to it before I was done with him ; for he got so at last , that he would leave me on a long chase quite easy . How he did it , I never could understand . That a bar runs at all , is puzzling ; but how this one could tire down and bust up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to overhauling everything they started after in no time , was past my understanding . Well , stranger , that bar finally got so sassy , that he used to help himself to a hog off my premises whenever he wanted one ; the buzzards followed after what he left , and so , between bar and buzzard , I rather think I was out of pork . " Well , missing that bar so often took hold of my vitals , and I wasted away . The thing had been carried too far , and it reduced me in flesh faster than an ager . I would see that bar in every thing I did : he hunted me , and that , too , like a devil , which I began to think he was . While in this fix , I made preparations to give him a last brush , and he done with it . Having completed every thing to my satisfaction , I started at sunrise , and to my great joy , I discovered from the way the dogs run , that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had become as plain to the pack as a turnpike road . On we went , and coming to an open country , what should I see but the bar very leisurely ascending a hill , and the dogs close at his heels , either a match for him this time in speed , or else he did not care to get out of their way  --  I do n't know which . But was n't he a beauty , though ? I loved him like a brother . " On he went , until he came to a tree , the limbs of which formed a crotch about six feet from the ground . Into this crotch he got and seated himself , the dogs yelling all around it ; and there he sat eyeing them as quiet as a pond in low water . A green-horn friend of mine , in company , reached shooting distance before me , and blazed away , hitting the critter in the centre of his forehead . The bar shook his head as the ball struck it , and then walked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carriage . ' T was a beautiful sight to see him do that  --  he was in such a rage that he seemed to be as little afraid of the dogs as if they had been sucking pigs ; and the dogs war n't slow in making a ring around him at a respectful distance , I tell you ; even Bowie-knife , himself , stood off . Then the way his eyes flashed  --  why the fire of them would have singed a cat 's hair ; in fact that bar was in a wrath all over . Only one pup came near him , and he was brushed out so totally with the bar 's left paw , that he entirely disappeared ; and that made the old dogs more cautious still . In the mean time , I came up , and taking deliberate aim as a man should do , at his side , just back of his foreleg , if my gun did not snap , call me a coward , and I wo n't take it personal . Yes , stranger , it snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . While in this predicament , I turned round to my fool friend  --  says I , Bill , ' says I , you 're an ass  --  you 're a fool  --  you might as well have tried to kill that bar by barking the tree under his belly , as to have done it by hitting him in the head . Your shot has made a tiger of him , and blast me , if a dog gets killed or wounded when they come to blows , I will stick my knife into your liver , I will  --  ' my wrath was up . I had lost my caps , my gun had snapped , the fellow with me had fired at the bar 's head , and I expected every moment to see him close in with the dogs , and kill a dozen of them at least . In this thing I was mistaken , for the bar leaped over the ring formed by the dogs , and giving a fierce growl , was off  --  the pack , of course , in full cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coming to the edge of a lake the varmint jumped in , and swam to a little island in the lake , which it reached just a moment before the dogs . I 'll have him now , ' said I , for I had found my caps in the lining of my coat  --  so , rolling a log into the lake , I paddled myself across to the island , just as the dogs had cornered the bar in a thicket . I rushed up and fired  --  at the same time the critter leaped over the dogs and came within three feet of me , running like mad ; he jumped into the lake , and tried to mount the log I had just deserted , but every time he got half his body on it , it would roll over and send him under ; the dogs , too , got around him , and pulled him about , and finally Bowie-knife clenched with him , and they sunk into the lake together . Stranger , about this time I was excited , and I stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have taken a part with Bowie-knife myself , when the bar rose to the surface . But the varmint staid under  --  Bowie-knife came up alone , more dead than alive , and with the pack came ashore . Thank God , ' said I , the old villain has got his deserts at last . ' Determined to have the body , I cut a grape-vine for a rope , and dove down where I could see the bar in the water , fastened my queer rope to his leg , and fished him , with great difficulty , ashore . Stranger , may I be chawed to death by young alligators , if the thing I looked at was n't a she bar , and not the old critter after all . The way matters got mixed on that island was onaccountably curious , and thinking of it made me more than ever convinced that I was hunting the devil himself . I went home that night and took to my bed  --  the thing was killing me . The entire team of Arkansaw in bar-hunting , acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings like a snagged boat will in the Mississippi . I grew as cross as a bar with two cubs and a sore tail . The thing got out ' mong my neighbours , and I was asked how come on that individ-u-al that never lost a bar when once started ? and if that same individ-u-al did n't wear telescopes when he turned a she bar , of ordinary size , into an old he one , a little larger than a horse ? Prehaps , ' said I , friends '  --  getting wrathy  --  prehaps you want to call somebody a liar . ' Oh , no , ' said they , we only heard such things as being rather common of late , but we do n't believe one word of it ; oh , no , '  --  and then they would ride off and laugh like so many hyenas over a dead nigger . It was too much , and I determined to catch that bar , go to Texas , or die ,  --  and I made my preparations accordin ' . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle to pieces , and iled it . I put caps in every pocket about my person , for fear of the lining . I then told my neighbours , that on Monday morning  --  naming the day  --  I would start THAT BAR , and bring him home with me , or they might divide my settlement among them , the owner having disappeared . Well , stranger , on the morning previous to the great day of my hunting expedition , I went into the woods near my house , taking my gun and Bowie-knife along , just from habit , and there sitting down also from habit , what should I see , getting over my fence , but the bar ! Yes , the old varmint was within a hundred yards of me , and the way he walked over that fence  --  stranger , he loomed up like a black mist , he seemed so large , and he walked right towards me . I raised myself , took deliberate aim , and fired . Instantly the varmint wheeled , gave a yell , and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobweb . I started after , but was tripped up by my inexpressibles , which either from habit , or the excitement of the moment , were about my heels , and before I had really gathered myself up , I heard the old varmint groaning in a thicket near by , like a thousand sinners , and by the time I reached him he was a corpse . Stranger , it took five niggers and myself to put that carcass on a mule 's back , and old long-ears waddled under his load , as if he was foundered in every leg of his body , and with a common whopper of a bar , he would have trotted off , and enjoyed himself . ' T would astonish you to know how big he was : I made a bed-spread of his skin , and the way it used to cover my bar mattress , and leave several feet on each side to tuck up , would have delighted you . It was in fact a creation bar , and if it had lived in Samson 's time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have licked him in the twinkling of a dice-box . But , stranger , I never liked the way I hunted him , and missed him . There is something curious about it , I could never understand ,  --  and I never was satisfied at his giving in so easy at last . Prehaps , he had heard of my preparations to hunt him the next day , so he jist come in , like Capt . Scott 's coon , to save his wind to grunt with in dying ; but that ai n't likely . My private opinion is , that that bar was an unhuntable bar , and died when his time come . " When the story was ended , our hero sat some minutes with his auditors in a grave silence ; I saw there was a mystery to him connected with the bear whose death he had just related , that had evidently made a strong impression on his mind . It was also evident that there was some superstitious awe connected with the affair ,  --  a feeling common with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any thing out of their everyday experience . He was the first one , however , to break the silence , and jumping up , he asked all present to " liquor " before going to bed ,  --  a thing which he did , with a number of companions , evidently to his heart 's content . Long before day , I was put ashore at my place of destination , and I can only follow with the reader , in imagination , our Arkansas friend , in his adventures at the " Forks of Cypress " on the Mississippi .
