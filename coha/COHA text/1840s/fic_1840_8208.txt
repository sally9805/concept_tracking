Smith , Seba , 1792-1868 : THE MOTHER PERISHING IN A SNOW-STORM. from Poems , in The Bowdoin poets ( 1840 ) Side note : 1Kb The cold wind swept the mountain 's height , And pathless was the dreary wild , And ' mid the cheerless hours of night A mother wandered with her child . As through the drifting snow she pressed , The babe was sleeping on her breast . And colder still the winds did blow , And darker hours of night came on , And deeper grew the drifting snow ; Her limbs were chilled her strength was gone . ' Oh , God ! ' she cried , in accents wild , ' If I must perish , save my child ! ' She stripped her mantle from her breast , And bared her bosom to the storm , And round the child she wrapped the vest , And smiled to think her babe was warm . With one cold kiss one tear she shed , And sunk upon her snowy bed . At dawn a traveler passed by , And saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was in her eye , Her cheek was cold , and hard , and pale ;  --  He moved the robe from off the child , The babe looked up and sweetly smiled ! Smith , Seba , 1792-1868 : TO THE AUTHOR 'S WIFE , ABSENT ON A VISIT . from Poems , in The Bowdoin poets ( 1840 ) Come home my dear Elizabeth ; I 'm sure could you but know The sadness of my lonely hours , You would not leave so . If love could not restrain you , Sure the kindness of your heart Would not allow that mine so long Should feel this aching smart . Like the dove that found no resting On the weary waters wide , I wander , but I find no rest Apart from thee , my bride . Yes bride I still must call thee , Though sixteen years have fled , Fraught with the ills and joys of life , Since the day that saw us wed . Yes bride I still must call thee , For still I feel thou art The morning light unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind friends may be around me , With gentle words and tone , And all the light , gay world may smile , But still I am alone . The bright bird that you left me , Chirps often through the day , And his music but reminds me That you are far away . For your sake I will feed him With fresh seeds and with flowers , And his morning and his evening song Shall count my weary hours . And oft our little Edward Comes clinging to my knee , And says with loud and hearty laugh , ' Dear Father , play with me . ' And when I kiss his little cheek , His bright blue eyes look glad ; And I talk with him and play with him , But still my heart is sad . My sun of life , Elizabeth , Hath passed its fervent noon ; I feel the ' sear and yellow leaf ' Will be upon me soon :  --  But though misfortunes press me , And the world be false and cold , Let thy love and presence bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll mind not fortune 's frowning , Nor the heartlessness of men , When I see thee home returning , Our abode to cheer again . Smith , Seba , 1792-1868 : THE LITTLE GRAVES . from Poems , in The Bowdoin poets ( 1840 ) BY SEBA SMITH . ' T was autumn , and the leaves were dry , And rustled on the ground , And chilly winds went whistling by With low and pensive sound , As through the grave yard 's lone retreat , By meditation led , I walked with slow and cautious feet Above the sleeping dead . Three little graves , ranged side by side , My close attention drew ; O'er two the tall grass bending sighed , And one seemed fresh and new . As lingering there I mused awhile On death 's long , dreamless sleep , And morning life 's deceitful smile , A mourner came to weep . Her form was bowed , but not with years , Her words were faint and few , And on those little graves her tears Distilled like evening dew . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand embraced , And from my heart the tale he told Will never be effaced . ' Mamma , now you must love me more , ' For little sister 's dead ; ' And t' other sister died before , ' And brother too , you said . ' Mamma , what made sweet sister die ? ' She loved me when we played : ' You told me , if I would not cry , ' You 'd show me where she 's laid . ' ' ' T is here , my child , that sister lies , ' Deep buried in the ground ; ' No light comes to her little eyes , ' And she can hear no sound . ' Mamma , why ca n't we take her up , ' And put her in my bed ? ' I 'll feed her from my little cup , ' And then she wont be dead . ' For sister ' ll be afraid to lie ' In this dark grave to-night , ' And she 'll be very cold , and cry , ' Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not cold , my child , ' For God , who saw her die , ' As He looked down from Heaven and smiled , ' Called her above the sky . ' And then her spirit quickly fled ' To God by whom ' t was given ; ' Her body in the ground is dead , ' But sister lives in Heaven . ' ' Mamma , wont she be hungry there , ' And want some bread to eat ? ' And who will give her clothes to wear , ' And keep them clean and neat ? ' Papa must go and carry some , ' I 'll send her all I 've got ; ' And he must bring sweet sister home , ' Mamma , now must he not ? ' ' No , my dear child , that can not be ; ' But if you 're good and true , ' You 'll one day go to her , but she ' Can never come to you . ' Let little children come to me , ' Once the good Savior said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' And God will give her bread . '
