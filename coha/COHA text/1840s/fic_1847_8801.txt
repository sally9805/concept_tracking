TO THE READER . The first of the following series of Comedies was written shortly after the conclusion of the late war with England , while the feelings it produced were still fresh in the public mind ; and the author has been induced to publish it now , after keeping it so long , by considerations with which he will not trouble the reader at present . The others are the earliest productions of a young man scarcely one-and-twenty ; and the whole is now published as an experiment , how far the public taste may incline to relish this species of literature , and in what degree the authors are qualified to make the appeal with any degree of success . Hitherto the people of the United States have been almost entirely dependent on foreign writers for this , one of the most influential of all the censors of public manners , morals and tastes , and it seems obvious that the productions of foreigners , adapted to actions in a state of society so widely different from that of our country , can have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like every other people , we require a drama of our own , based on our own manners , habits , character and political institutions ; and such a drama , it seems to us , if sustained with sufficient spirit by American writers , would take root and flourish in the United States . The foundation must be laid , however weak and unfinished , and a hope , not indeed very sanguine , is entertained that this experiment may at least be sufficiently successful to stimulate others better qualified to excel in this rather neglected species of literature .

Mrs. Carlton and Jane at their needles . JANE . Jane Warfield Heigh ho ! sister . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton Well , Jane , translate that sigh into English . Is it for a husband , or what ? JANE . Jane Warfield In plain English , then , I am tired of England , and Bath in particular , which is like a belle who has seen her best days , and given place to other rivals in the beau monde . It is little better than an Invalid Hospital now . I 'm right down home-sick . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton So then , Jane , you would leave me alone in a land of strangers , where , of all others , strangers , without rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would you , Jane ? JANE . Jane Warfield No , dearest sister .  --  You were a mother to me when I had no other ; my guide when I most wanted one  --  and ( kissing her ) I will never leave thee or forsake thee . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton Not even for a husband , Jane ? But what have you to complain of here ? We live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world , in spite of all you may say to the contrary ; we have health and competency  --  I have an affectionate husband and you a host of admirers , of such infinite variety of character , that you may pass your whole life in the charming perplexity of not knowing which to choose . JANE . Jane Warfield Yes , a delightful variety , indeed ! The tower does not contain a rarer collection of animals , and the best of it is , they are so disinterested ! I dare say not one of them has an eye to the hundred thousand pounds my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor man , he could n't trust his own country ! Tell me now , sister , on your conscience , is there one among them that will pass muster in any court of Cupid in all Christendom ? MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton The admiral  --  for instance . JANE . Jane Warfield He ! why he 's so asthmatic that he wants breath to tell his exploits , which is a sore pity , since everybody else has forgot them . Then his limbs are scatter 'd over the four seas , and the worst of it is , that nobody knows in what battles he lost them . Then he is continually boasting of the flag of England , flying triumphantly in every sea , which might have done well enough before the time of Perry and Decatur . No  --  no , sister , if I ever marry a sailor , it shall be one of our own sprightly young heroes , that have risen by their own merit instead of the merits of those below them . Then he 's so old  --  MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue runs finely ! What say you to the gallant Major ? JANE . Jane Warfield What ! the valiant Cid of the peninsula ?  --  he that drinks nothing but gunpowder tea for breakfast  --  who has bled whole kingdoms  --  whose conquests would make a geography larger than Pinkerton 's ! He was made a knight-companion of Bath , in the last batch , but he shall never be my night companion , I promise you . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton No ! Well , then , what think you of the little banker , Thread-needle ? JANE . Jane Warfield Lord , sister ! he should have been a tailor by his name ; and , to say the truth , I think by his nature too . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton How so ? JANE . Jane Warfield Why he worships the goose , and , according to his own account , has invented more fashions than a score of tailors . Then he 's such a simpleton ,  --  I do n't believe he has wit enough to make a marriage lawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll never get a husband . What have you to say to the antiquary , and the member of ever so many societies ? JANE . Jane Warfield What ! Mr. Obsolete and Sir Christopher ? Eh ! ( shivers . ) Why sister , would you have me become an unsuccessful rival to a dry parchment manuscript , a rare copy in black letter , or an old Saxon inscription ? One of them , I am positively assured , broke the heart of his wife , because the poor woman cut up a sheet of old parchment , with some fragments of unknown letters upon it , to cover her pots of sweetmeats . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton O , that 's one of Carlton 's jokes . JANE . Jane Warfield Upon my honor , I believe every word of it . It was no longer ago than yesterday that Mr. Obsolete , after looking me in the face a whole quarter of an hour with such intensity that I actually thought he was admiring my beauty , and gave him one of my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured me the dimple in my cheek was exactly the shape of the old Saxon letter C ! That ever I should live to be coupled with an old Saxon parchment ! Why he 'd barter me away before the honeymoon for a rare book of old ballads , and be in ecstasies with his bargain . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton Jane ! Jane ! If you go on at this rate , I shall set you down for an old maid . Why , Mr. Obsolete is consulted by the connoisseurs for his knowledge of all sorts of old things . JANE . Jane Warfield Say no more , dear sister . That 's a sure sign he 'd care little for young things . He 'll hate me for not having been born in the time of King Bladud . My youth will be a perpetual reproach to one who is such an admirer of old things ; he shuts his doors against new brooms in defiance of the proverb . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton But you know every year would obviate his objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband that would love you the better , the older you grew . JANE . Jane Warfield True , sister . But I should n't like to wait till I grow old to be loved by my husband . Besides , I should never grow old enough to rival Signior Belzoni 's Mummy . I am told he goes to London once a month to ogle it , and has been detected making downright love . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton Well , even this is better than some husbands , who do n't confine themselves to making love to mummies , I promise you . You 'd better consider . JANE . Jane Warfield Dear sister , say no more . I should stand no chance against the mummy , or even the dead mermaid , lately brought from the Indies . Why , he do n't value a newspaper till it 's a century old , and hates everything not rusted with age to such a degree , that he 'll never forgive me for being young , and born in a new world . MRS . CARLTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list , with the exception of my Lord . Is not he a distinguished person ? JANE . Jane Warfield What ! the hereditary legislator , who , according to the law of England , inherits wisdom as a fox does instinct ? Distinguished ! Notorious , you mean , sister . With talents to be respectable , he is a nuisance in that society whose laws he violates , and whose rules he thinks himself privileged to despise . I am sure , rather than be overlooked , he would play the merry-Andrew at a fair , or run away to Gretna Green , with an old apple-woman , to be talked of one day . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton Now , Jane , you are coming out with what Carlton calls your Bucktail notions . I wish he were back from London to keep you in order . JANE . Jane Warfield I do n't care  --  I 've no patience with these degenerate men , who abuse the advantages which birth and fortune throw in their way . His lordship has attempted to rival every boxer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last twenty years , and failing in this noble species of ambition , is now indebted to his follies and absurdities for the notice of mankind . But let us leave this subject . I shall never marry out of my own dear country . MRS . CARLTON . Mrs. Carlton You are right , Jane . Women , and especially American women should never marry to go abroad , or go abroad to be married . In this country the distinctions in society rest upon other foundations than those of mere education , morals or manners . Rank and title everywhere take precedence , and condemn strangers without either , to the society of vulgar riches , thriving haberdashers , yellow admirals , card-playing dowagers and tattling spinsters , who think they honor us by winning our money and taking away our reputations . Take my word for it Jane ; though chance , or caprice , or novelty , may give a momentary clat to one of our strolling countrywomen , they will only find solid respectability and lasting happiness among the friends of their youth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get our bonnets and take advantage of this fine English day  --  for I see the sun almost shines . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE II .  --  THE ANTIQUARY 'S ROOM . Obsolete and Rust . RUST . Rust Have you heard the news , sir ? OBSOLETE . Obsolete News ? How often have I commanded you never to use that detestable word in my presence . What care I for news , marry ? Knowest thou not , most precious Rust of Antiquity , that I feel no interest whatever in what has taken place since the deluge , and that unless I were assured of living some six thousand years hence , the events of the present time would be utterly indifferent ? RUST . Rust But , sir  --  OBSOLETE . Obsolete Most venerable Rust , shut thy juvenile mouth , unless , like another Herculaneum , thou couldst yield up therefrom some precious obliterated manuscript , or invaluable fragment of stone jug , out of which an unknown person drank some two thousand years ago . RUST . Rust But , sir  --  the mummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new world have arrived . They left this letter while you were out . OBSOLETE . Obsolete The expected arrival of the mummy , most venerable Rust , makes some amends for the actual arrival of the youths from America . Young men  --  new world  --  bad , both bad . I hate young men , and above all , I hate new worlds . Why , I 'm told there is nothing to be found there to puzzle a learned inquirer , or confound the ingenuity of antiquaries .  --  Everything is new and detestable ; and the very rocks they say were made but yesterday . But where is Miss Obsolete ? She 's certainly neither very young nor very new , for by Cox-body she carries her nativity beyond all record , and the time of her birth is as great a mystery as the building of the Pyramids . Then as for novelty , she has read me the same lecture every day for the last thirty years . RUST . Rust Miss Obsolete is gone to jail , sir . OBSOLETE . Obsolete The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an action of debt , assault and battery , or Scan-mag ? RUST . Rust No , sir  --  She 's gone to comfort the unfortunate man that murdered his wife the other day , and teach him to become a good husband . After that , she 's going to the alehouse , where there is a deal of immorality to correct . From thence she goes to the Bridewell , to reform some compunctious ladies who are willing to be good if they are well paid for it . From the Bridewell she goes to the hospital , where  --  OBSOLETE . Obsolete Where I wish they would shut her up , with all my heart . Why , the woman is like to become a precious helpmate in my house , by keeping such worshipful company . Marry , I expect nothing else but she will bring home all the plagues of Egypt in her train one of these days . RUST . Rust I think she will reform the world in good sooth , sir . OBSOLETE . Obsolete Reform a fiddlestick ! She 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care a fig about her niece , and I verily believe it is because she has never been in Bridewell , or committed a fauxpas.  --  As for me  --  ' sfoot ! I am become perfectly indifferent to her , for lack of the irresistible attraction of some incurable disease that qualifies me for the hospital , or some interesting crime that qualifies me for the gallows . I begin to fear she will one day or other elope with some heroic highwayman , or wooden-legged Adonis of a beggar , and deprive me of her fortune merely because I am neither a cripple nor a culprit . RUST . Rust Of a truth , sir , she hath a tender heart . OBSOLETE . Obsolete That 's more than I know . People that require the most high-seasoned dishes have not the most delicate appetites . I am strongly inclined to think the sympathies of those who can only be excited by high-wrought scenes of guilt and misery , are not of the finest kind . Feelings that can only be awakened by the undeserving , are not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say misery loves company . OBSOLETE . Obsolete Ay , and Miss Obsolete loves misery ; so they are well met . But where is the letter you spoke of ? ( Rust gives the letter . ) Ah ! parchment , as I live ! This looks something like antiquity . Primeval was always a man smacking of olden time .  --  Rust , go and inquire if Miss Obsolete has returned  --  I want to consult her about giving a dinner to these moderns . Let me see . ( Reads . ) Worthy Sir : Thine of the 25th came safe to hand . I think this new world must be somewhat older than you suppose , for I have detected several large masses of primitive rocks in various parts . But of this anon . I commend to your old English hospitality , two youngsters , at whose father 's house I have been entertained for the last two months , during which I was confined by a tertian ague . They come abroad to be civilized , and are somewhat tinctured with radical notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality to your old friend . You need not be afraid they will borrow money of you , for they are rich for this country . Adam Primeval . P. S.  --  I have lately heard of a real mummy found in a cave in Kentucky . Does not this indicate an Egyptian origin ? Enter Miss Obsolete ( speaking ) . My dear Mr. Obsolete , I 'm in such spirits ! I 've just come from seeing  --  OBSOLETE Obsolete ( not noticing her ) . A mummy ! a mummy ! found in a cave in Kentucky ! MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete A mummy found in a cave in Kentucky ! A fool 's head from  --  Pray , brother , where was you born ? But as I was saying , I 've seen the most edifying example of  --  OBSOLETE . Obsolete O  --  ay  --  yes  --  I know what your edifying sights are , my good sister  --  but pray spare me at this moment  --  some penitent culprit , or  --  But I 'm just now going to visit two youngsters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we must give them a dinner , you know . They come from the wilds fresh as an unlick 'd cub , I suppose , so we 'll give them a good stuffing , and let them run . Good-by , sister  --  Tell Mary to beware of their claws . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Claws ! Why you do n't mean to trust your daughter with these wild men , brother ? OBSOLETE . Obsolete O , never fear ; I shall invite a sufficient number of civilized men to keep them in order . I mean to bid them to-morrow  --  a short notice is good policy , you know  --  They may be engaged , you know  --  and if not , it looks as if one were eager to see them at one 's house , you know . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Lord , brother , what shall we do with these aboriginals ? I have been assured they wear copper rings in their noses  --  eat raw meat  --  paint one-half their faces red and the other black  --  and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest about the dinner . OBSOLETE . Obsolete Not I , indeed , marry , I never joke  --  I ca n't find that the antediluvians were given to jesting , and therefore hold it as a modern abomination . But suppose they do wear copper rings in their noses , we 'll set that off against those in your ears .  --  Touching the raw meat , our rare roast beef will serve instead ;  --  as to painting , that is all the rage among our most fashionable young men  --  and the fine ladies will keep their nakedness in countenance . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete But how in the name of wonder shall we make them understand without an interpreter ? OBSOLETE . Obsolete O , do n't be uneasy about that . I dare say they 've brought one with them , and if not , they are very expert at signs . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Well  --  well , if it must be , it must . I wish it was any other day , for I am engaged so delightfully to-morrow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening at the Penitentiary  --  But I suppose I must send an apology to Mrs. Toogood . ( Heigho ! ) ( Going out , she returns . ) Pray , brother , is either of these aboriginals crippled ? OBSOLETE . Obsolete No , thank my stars  --  at least I believe not  --  So there 's no danger they should prove too interesting . ( Exit Obsolete . ) Miss Obsolete rings , and enter Rust . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Call your young lady . I must write a note of apology to Mrs. Toogood , and say I ca n't go with her to Bridewell . ( Writes . ) Enter Mary . Did you want me , aunt ? MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Yes  --  to tell you we are to have company to-morrow to dinner . MARY . Mary Obsolete The old set , I suppose ; the admiral and his crew . In sober sadness , aunt , I 'm sick to death of these tiresome people , and do so long for something new , that I 'm almost tempted sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Obsolete Well , child , you 're like to have something new to-morrow . Two young American aboriginals are to dine with us . MARY . Mary Obsolete Well , aunt , anything for novelty . I am amused with my father 's little whims , and the odd things he sometimes brings home with him . I should like to see a new species of men , for I am tired of the old . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete And I am out of all patience . We shall be the laughing-stock of all the ton here , with two such out of the way animals in our train . What will my Lord Bamboozle and Lady Kitty say to us ? MARY . Mary Obsolete Never mind what they say , aunt ; if it amuses my father , I am content . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Why I expect to see him bring home the Italian Signior 's mummy to dinner one of these days . I verily believe there 's nothing , not even his sister , daughter , or money , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me the other day in ecstasy , that it was certainly three thousand years old . For my part , I almost wish I were three thousand years old , and then I might stand a chance for his admiration . MARY . Mary Obsolete It 's more than I do , aunt , I promise you . I would n't be a year older to please all the lovers of antiquity in the world . I would n't exchange the delicious hopes , and darling dreams , nay , even the little disappointments of youth , for all the reliques of the catacombs . I hate mummies , and feel a hundred times more curiosity to see these living representatives of the new world , than all the dry bones and parched skins of upper or lower Egypt . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Well , well , every one to their taste . But a wooden leg , or a man just going to be turned off , is to my mind a thousand times more interesting . MARY . Mary Obsolete My dear aunt , commend me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Obsolete On my conscience , niece , I begin to believe you have serious designs upon these copper-colored people . Why , would you cross the seas ; live in a wigwam ; eat raw meat , never see a rout , or taste peaches at two guineas a-piece ? Would you forsake the divine Corinthians , and carry a pappoose at your back through a wilderness without beginning or end , while your husband was hunting beaver , or taking scalps ?  --  Mercy upon us ! MARY . Mary Obsolete Why , I do n't know , aunt , what despair may bring me to . I am so sick of the desperate monotony of this fashionable life ; and so tired of the natural or artificial inanity of the present race of beaux , that I almost think I could be tempted to marry anything in the shape of a healthy sprightly young fellow , whose soul was not completely evaporated , and whose frame would not fall into chaos at the shock of a cotillion . Alas ! by the time they are twenty they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lives is spent in search of  --  sensation . In truth , aunt , there is a great scarcity of passable men at present since the invention of loose pantaloons . I fear we shall never see a goodly leg in a handsome silk stocking again . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Poor girl ! she 's far gone in romance ! But I know you 're only jesting . So pray let us go and prepare for this great war-feast . We must muster all our tinsel and feathers , for I have heard the aboriginals are desperately fond of finery . Suppose you paint your face half red and half white  --  you would then be sure of a conquest . MARY . Mary Obsolete Nay , aunt  --  they shall have fair play . I 'll not board them under false colors . I hope , at least , there are still English women that can conquer under their own flag . So come , let 's prepare . ( Exeunt . ) END OF ACT FIRST . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  LORD NOLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admiral Gunwale As I was telling you , my lord , we gave three cheers , and prepared all hands for boarding , when  --  NOLAND . Noland I tell you what , admiral , if you board me with that story again , I 'll bear away , and leave you to fight your battles by yourself , which is but a dull business . I hate fighting , except at boxing matches  --  and harkee , admiral  --  d'ye see this inimitable tie ? There 's little Threadneedle , and a hundred others , would resign a grove of laurels , only to be able to reach the happy folds of this cravat . What 's the use of a man risking his limbs in search of honor , when he can gain it by tying his neckcloth  --  hey , Bully ? ADMIRAL . Admiral Gunwale My lord , let me ask you one question . What would you give to have lost this leg , like me , in the service of your country . NOLAND . Noland What would I give ? Why faith I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it back again . ADMIRAL . Admiral Gunwale Hem ! ( biting his lips . ) Your lordship 's notions are not peculiar . NOLAND . Noland Take notice , admiral , if I had n't been born to honor , honor would never have been born to me . Honor ! what 's modern honor but a pledge at the gaming table  --  a fiddlestick to make music at the expense of other 's heart-strings  --  a tavern bully that pays his debts by cudgeling his landlord , tempting his wife , and kicking duns that have the insolence to ask for money ? ADMIRAL . Admiral Gunwale Your lordship seems to hold honor rather cheap . NOLAND . Noland Yes  --  ' T is amazing how little we that inherit honor from a long line of ancestors , value this idol to which you soldiers sacrifice life and limb . For my part , my noble progenitors and myself have had such a surfeit of it , that , as respects my own particular , I 'd rather at this present moment have a little profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the basin and towel for my pains . Apropos  --  talking of profit  --  you dine at Obsolete 's to day . ADMIRAL . Admiral Gunwale Yes  --  are the rest of our rivals to be there ? NOLAND . Noland I 'll be bound . Obsolete ca n't make a party without the old set . He hates all new things , you know , and especially new faces . ADMIRAL . Admiral Gunwale Have you heard the occasion of this feast ? NOLAND . Noland O , some antediluvian era , I suppose . Probably the birth-day of Noah , or Lot 's wife , for he hates all modern anniversaries . But here comes our learned Sir Kit , the physician , who has been dubbed a knight , not like the major , for killing his majesty 's enemies , but his liege subjects . These tattling fellows know everything  --  I dare say he can tell us all about it . Enter Sir Christopher , the Major and Threadneedle . NOLAND . Noland What news , Sir Kit ? SIR KIT . Sir Christopher Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new planet in Virgo . NOLAND . Noland No ! why I thought there was no breeding of planets in that quarter . It must be illegitimate . What else ? SIR KIT . Sir Christopher Sir Humphrey Davidoff has just announced to the world a method of turning night into day , by means of a perpetual gas lamp . NOLAND . Noland And if he does , there will be worse things brought to light in London than the Lame Devil ever showed to the scholar of Spain . I hope he 'll let me know when he sets about it , for hang me if I have not serious objections to his plan . What will become of the devotees at Shockford 's ? ' T is a breach of privilege thus to interfere with a nobleman 's privacy . What more , Sir Kit ? SIR KIT . Sir Christopher Poor Doctor Burdock died yesterday of a cold he caught sitting up all night in his garden to hear a mandrake scream . The society is inconsolable . NOLAND . Noland Alas ! poor doctor  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIT . Sir Christopher Yes  --  ( sighing . ) But what was I saying ? NOLAND . Noland I ca n't say  --  but for a hundred I 'll tell what you were thinking about . A lady whose name begins with a W.  --  Hey , Sir Kit ? SIR KIT . Sir Christopher Why , where do you expect to go when you die ? Your lordship is akin to the witches . Indeed , I was just then thinking of my lovely duodecimo , Miss Warfield . NOLAND . Noland You mean you are thinking of her hundred thousand pounds , Sir Kit ? SIR KIT . Sir Christopher My lord , I scorn your insinuations . My affection for Miss Warfield is identified with my love of books . There is to be a great sale of precious black letter jewels at Fonthill , all unique , and unless I marry the pretty Jane , I ca n't purchase the treasures . Ergo , it is not avarice , but a refined literary taste that causes me to covet her fortune . NOLAND . Noland Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Gunwale But for all this , by Neptune I 'll have her .

I inherit from mine ancestors an estate  --  at least I did inherit it  --  which is gone , and a privilege to precede ye commoners on all occasions , which , as I could neither spend in dice , nor drinking , I still retain .

Miss Obsolete advances cautiously from behind her chair , followed by Rust  --  She plucks a branch from a flower pot in the room  --  motions them to sit down , and attempts a conversation by signs .

This is Mr. Obsolete , who is struck dumb with the pleasure of seeing you . I am called Lord Noland , and if I might be permitted to act as his substitute . I would offer you my hand , and say you 're welcome to England . HENRY .

Pray , gentlemen , are the ladies of your country fond of rural life ? I know you can talk of that if nothing else . ( To Mary . ) HENRY . Henry Tudor Those who live in the cities , madam  --  those who reside in the country are not so fond of retirement . It is easy , however , to give them what taste we please , in this respect , since the most inveterate town lady loves the country  --  when she 's in a crowd  --  and the most ardent votary of rural shades adores a crowd  --  when she 's alone in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tudor , it did not require to be placed at one extreme , in order to admire the other . HENRY . Henry Tudor Perhaps not in all cases , madam . Yet I have very often found , that the ladies who talked most about the charms of rural life , were most often to be seen at public places ; and that the most sincere votaries of the repose of the country , were apt to say the least on the subject . JANE . Jane Warfield You do n't mean to insinuate that we women talk most of what we think the least ? HENRY . Henry Tudor Not among yourselves , madam . ( Bowing . ) MARY Mary Obsolete  --  ( speaking eagerly . ) I 'm sure  --  I 'm sure  --  ( Retires confused , and blushing . ) FRANK Frank Tudor  --  ( aside . ) They say I 'm one of the most impudent fellows in the world  --  and I believe it , for it can be nothing but the force of contrast that draws my heart towards that little flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of errands from her face to her heart !

FRANK Frank Tudor  --  ( to HENRY . ) Bravo ! an ox spoke once at Rome , and so did an ass in Judea ! HENRY . Henry Tudor I fancy not , sir . I remember my grandfather  --  but who his grandfather was , is more than appears in our family tree . OBSOLETE . Obsolete Perhaps by going to the Herald 's office you may trace out the descent . Should we meet in London during the winter , I shall be happy to aid your inquiries . HENRY . Henry Tudor I thank you , sir . But I believe I shall not trouble you . I mean not to detract from the advantages of birth and title , but in America , we lay little claim to such distinctions . Those who left this country to settle mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their descendants , who rely upon the mere identity of names to prove their claim to noble blood , only make themselves ridiculous . NOLAND . Noland Then I presume , sir , there 's no distinction between the cobler and the king , and the son of a cobler and a king ? HENRY . Henry Tudor The law makes none , and that 's sufficient . We are taught to consider a king , and the son of a king , as much the subject of our thoughts and judgment , as the beggar that goes in rags . Man ca n't remove one step from man  --  his nature fixes him . NOLAND Noland  --  ( apart . ) Why , Sir Kit , this smells of the radical ! SIR KIT .

HENRY . Henry Tudor Faith , Miss Warfield , I can not help it . I must submit to the penalty , for I never yet hesitated between the two , though I fear in preferring the company of the ladies to that of the bottle , I only exchange a headache for a heartache . MARY Mary Obsolete  --  ( to FRANK . ) Is it not the custom in your country to sit long after dinner ? FRANK . Frank Tudor Why yes  --  that is , among old bachelors , who must either drink or sleep  --  and reverend young city beaux , who couple women and wine , as people do fire and faggots , to keep their fancy warm .

' T is not the light of the moon , the sacred quiet of a calm evening  --  the repose of a country scene  --  nor the pure beauties of nature  --  nor the innocent intercourse of a lonely walk , that inflame the senses , or corrupt the heart . It is at midnight balls and masquerades , where lascivious music assails the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines and costly viands pamper the heated appetites . It is there that virtue melts like wax , and female purity is most successfully assailed . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete It may be so , sir . But may I ask what sort of wives these strolling moonlight damsels make ? HENRY . Henry Tudor The best in the world , madam . The daily intercourse which is permitted enables them to choose with better judgment ; and the freedom of choice , to consult their hearts . They do not marry to come out into the gay world , but to retire from it . Here , marriage frees the bird from its cage , where it has been all its life confined ; and can it be wondered at , that just escaped from its prison , the charm of new-born liberty sometimes tempts it into the fowler 's net , or the sportsman 's lure ?

SCENE I. Lord Noland and Paddy Whack . PADDY . Paddy Whack Faith , my lord , here 's an invitation , I believe . The genius that brought it , insisted upon coming in ; but I gave him my honor it should be safely delivered . ( Gives a note . ) NOLAND Noland  --  ( opening the note . ) An invitation with a vengeance ! Go and tell the fellow to call next week . ( Exit Paddy. )  --  The rascal threatens extremities unless he 's paid . Confound these impudent clowns , that are so unreasonable as to expect their money , when a man has spent it every sous . Well if I must , I must . Fate 's a spaniel  --  we ca n't drive her from us . I must marry Jane Warfield , whether she will or no , and that off hand , too , by a coup de main .  --  Um  --  carry her off ?

Enter Whack . WHACK . Paddy Whack Faith , he says your lordship has been telling him to call next week till he begins to doubt whether that same next week does n't mean Doomsday . He talks about an execution . I hope he do n't mean to hang your lordship . NOLAND . Noland Well , well , let the fellow go  --  Mr. Whack ! PADDY . Paddy Whack Sir  --  my lord ? NOLAND . Noland Hast any skill in elopements ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Elopements ? Sure , that 's my forte .  --  I ran away from three sweethearts extempore , in my own country . NOLAND .

Paddy Whack Why , then  --  the next thing is to persuade her to be willing . NOLAND . Noland But suppose , Mr. Whack , she ca n't be persuaded ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Why , then , the next best thing is to persuade the world she was willing . ' T is a great matter to keep up appearances , for though I do n't mind running away from a woman against her will , it 's rather against my morality to run away with her , contrary to her conscience  --  NOLAND . Noland You make nice distinctions , Mr. Whack . But would n't being well paid make it one and the same thing ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Why , I ca n't tell , my lord , till I 'm tried . A bright guinea , like a bright sun , is very apt to throw light upon a case of conscience . NOLAND . Noland Very well , Mr. Whack , the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of quieting that troublesome monitor of yours , I promise you my wife shall have an excellent place at the coronation . Rank for money is a fair exchange , you know . PADDY . Paddy Whack Sure my lord . Do n't we every day see plenty of people who will not only part with their lands , but their consciences too , for this same rank and honor ? NOLAND . Noland Nay , Mr. Whack , no reflections upon Parliament , if you please . But , harkee ! You must be as discreet as a prime minister , or a gentleman in the secretary 's department . PADDY . Paddy Whack I warrant , your honor , I 'll be as secret as Scotch wizard , who do n't let even his shadow be seen . But may I be so bold as to ax your lordship who is the lady for whom you intend this great favor ? NOLAND .

Jane Warfield , solus . JANE . Jane Warfield Heigho ! surely there 's something in the very air of this island that makes one dull . When I was in the sprightly land of liberty . I used to skip about like a lamb , and if I happened to be out of the way for half an hour , nobody was frightened lest I had run away to Gretna Green . But here my feet are tied , and my tongue , too , so that I am fain to talk to myself when alone , to keep it in exercise . I 've a great mind to fall in love , if it were only to pass the time  --  Yes  --  Enter Servant . Mr. Tudor , madam . ( Exit . ) JANE . Jane Warfield Heaven preserve us ! there 's certainly a great deal of truth in the old proverb . Enter Henry Tudor . HENRY . Henry Tudor Good day to you , Miss Warfield . JANE . Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you . Do you know I was actually talking to myself for want of better company ? My sister has just set off for London , to meet her husband . HENRY . Henry Tudor Suppose me a second self , Miss Warfield , and continue the conversation . JANE . Jane Warfield No  --  no  --  sir , that would be worse than making you my confessor at once . You 're too young to be trusted with a lady 's secrets . HENRY . Henry Tudor And too indulgent ; I should pardon every sin , but that of falling in love  --  except with a person of my choosing . JANE . Jane Warfield O  --  I suppose you mean Mr. Obsolete ? HENRY . Henry Tudor No  --  he 's not the man .  --  You 'd be rival 'd by the mummy . JANE . Jane Warfield The spruce banker ? HENRY . Henry Tudor No  --  you 'd be rival 'd by his horse . JANE . Jane Warfield Sir Christopher ? HENRY . Henry Tudor No  --  you 'd be rival 'd by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord ! HENERY . Henry Tudor No  --  you 'd be forsaken for dice , drinking and debauchery . JANE . Jane Warfield The major ? HENRY . Henry Tudor No  --  you 'd be rival 'd by the whole sex . JANE . Jane Warfield And yet he 's constant to one lady , I 'll swear . HENRY . Henry Tudor O , every woman of course makes an exception in her own favor . JANE . Jane Warfield I mean the Lady Fortune , sir . HENRY . Henry Tudor There , indeed , I believe the major may be depended upon . JANE . Jane Warfield You 're very hard to be pleased , good father .  --  What say you to the admiral ? HENRY . Henry Tudor Dear Miss Warfield , I ca n't think of your sailing under an enemy 's flag . JANE . Jane Warfield Alas ! for me  --  my list of beaux is exhausted ! I can think of no other . HENRY . Henry Tudor And yet there is another , who , if he dared name himself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare to hope , would lay his heart at your feet , and beg you not to trample on it  --  One who , though almost a stranger to you , would rely upon your virtues , as on the mercy of Heaven  --  whose faith is equal to that of a ' martyr  --  whose devotion exceeds that of a saint  --  whose love , like  --  JANE . Jane Warfield O say no more ! Where is this wonder to be seen ? I 'll go a pilgrimage barefoot to find him , even to the snowy summit of tna . Where dwells he  --  in earth , sea or air ? HENRY . Henry Tudor Here  --  ( Dropping on his knee . ) JANE . Jane Warfield Where ? ( Looks wistfully about the room. )  --  I do n't see him ? I thought it must be some invisible spirit , for I never yet saw such a man . HENRY Henry Tudor  --  ( Rising , and placing himself before her . ) Nay , look at me . Her sprightliness makes me bold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see him , not I  --  Alas ! he has flown away ! ' T was a spirit , sure ! HENRY . Henry Tudor True flesh and blood , I promise you , Miss Warfield . But pray , now , do be serious for once . JANE Jane Warfield  --  ( looking prim . ) Well , sir  --  May I ask how long , according to the best of your knowledge and belief , we two have known each other ? I believe it is little more than a day for every year that Jacob labored for a helpmate . HENRY . Henry Tudor Where hearts are pure , an hour 's acquaintance is equal to an age of hypocritical contest , who shall deceive the other . What if we have not known each other long ? A woman 's curiosity has the better chance of being gratified in finding out my virtues . Were I a woman , I should begin to hate a man as soon as I knew all about him . JANE . Jane Warfield Why so we do , generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I intend to live single , and employ the rest of my life in studying the virtues of your sex , only to gratify my curiosity . HENRY . Henry Tudor Nay , charming Miss Warfield , for once be serious . Though it was thy innocent unaffected gayety that first caught my fancy , and soon engaged my heart , yet there is a time when sprightliness is levity , and laughter cruel . Stab me , but do not tickle me to death in sport . JANE . Jane Warfield Well , good sir . Seriously , then , thou art a bold and a rash man in thy love . Strangers as we are , unknowing whether like flint and steel , we may strike out consuming fires by meeting  --  ignorant whether our tastes or habits mingle in the sweet accord so necessary to the happiness of wedlock . Surely you ca n't be serious ; or if you are , surely , Mr. Tudor , you can not expect me to be so , in order to prosper your suit . Believe me , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , folly . The interchange of sentiments is not that of hearts . Go you to the ball to-night ? HENRY . Henry Tudor The ball !  --  But  --  I understand you , madam . Beshrew me , but I can take a hint  --  I  --  I  --  I can laugh , too  --  be gay  --  and wither in an hour afterwards . I can frisk and giggle , while I stab  --  Farewell , madam  --  thou hast wounded a true bosom  --  ( Going out he sinks into a chair , as though exhausted with his emotions . ) JANE . Jane Warfield What , is it so , dear youth ? Then heart speak , and be heard at last . You are ill , sir . ( Takes his hand . ) HENRY Henry Tudor  --  ( with effort . ) ' T is over , now  --  a mere faintness , common with me at times . ( Turning from her . ) I 'll swallow my feelings , though they were live coals . Were it Promethous ' vulture , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this unfeeling woman . ( Aside . ) Farewell  --  madam  --  It is all over now .  --  ( Going . ) JANE . Jane Warfield But it is not all over  --  listen to me , sir , I have a heart as warm as thine ; but lately I have been plagued by a swarm of flies , in the shape of lovers , who came to suck my blood , and then be gone . Men without heads or hearts  --  who have no feelings left but selfish ones ; who throng about our sex to sate themselves with their spoils  --  to stake their miserable remnant of man , against our unsoil 'd hearts , our unworn sensibilities , our fortunes , and our happiness . To such I have opposed the bitterness of unfeeling scorn , for they deserved it . But you are not of these , I think . HENRY . Henry Tudor In faith I am not . It was thy laughing eyes darting a thousand innocent meanings  --  thy heart that calls down a thousand blessings on the head  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thy scorn , and not the loss of fortune , that wounds my heart to its very core . JANE . Jane Warfield I do believe it . And now ( sighing )  --  though knowing what I pledge and what I hazard  --  knowing that when a woman puts her trust in man , she risks all , and places her stock of happiness where full oft the principal and interest both are lost ,  --  knowing too she puts almost beyond her power , not only her present safety but the welfare of her immortal soul ,  --  knowing and feeling all this  --  here is my hand . He that turns pale and trembles at a woman , must love her . HENRY Henry Tudor  --  ( kneeling . ) And here do I receive that hand , as the best gift of Heaven . ( Kisses her . ) Thus do I seal thee mine forever . I can not speak my happiness . Enter servant Madam , Miss Obsolete to wait on you . ( Exit . ) HENRY . Henry Tudor Then pray excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bliss . Adieu , my best beloved ! ( Exit . ) Enter Miss Obsolete . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete O , Miss Warfield , I 've the most delightful excursion to propose to you ! JANE . Jane Warfield And I am delighted to hear it , madam , for I do long to get into the fields and skip and chirp like a grasshopper . Where is it , and when shall we set out ? MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete As soon as you can get ready . See here  --  read this letter  --  this charming letter . ( Gives a letter . ) JANE Jane Warfield  --  ( reads . ) Honored madam : Hearing of your kind dispositions to the poor , I make bold to address you with my sad tale of woe . I lost my husband at the great victory of the Nile , a long time ago . I have five small children , one deaf , another blind , and my situation prevents me from doing anything for their support . Honored madam , if you will honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , tea , and sugar , you will have an opportunity of witnessing the truth of my statement . Your unfortunate petitioner , Elizabeth Dumps . P. S.  --  My son little Billy , who is a cripple , will show the way , if you honor me with a visit . P. S.  --  Honored madam , you will do me a great favor , if you will let the tea be Souchong , as my nerves will not bear green tea , and the sugar , loaf sugar for I am a little particular in these matters . If you are afraid to come by yourself , bring Miss Warfield with you . I hear she is very charitable . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete  --  ( eagerly and delighted . ) There  --  there , Jane  --  did you ever hear such a delightful tale of woe ? A widow with five children , one dumb , deaf and crippled . I must positively go immediately  --  I would n't miss the sight for the whole world . I 'd rather see it than the coronation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the truth , though I have but little experience in these matters , this seems to be one of those tales expressly got up to impose upon your goodness of heart . They say ; indeed , that misfortunes seldom come single , but here are half a dozen pairs , all following at the heels of each other . I ca n't help doubting the whole story . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete My dear Jane , you must positively go , or I shall think you hard-hearted  --  I ca n't go without you  --  it will be such a beautiful sight . I 've got the tea and the sugar , and the coffee  --  and little Billy is waiting at the door with them . You never saw such a beautiful cripple . JANE . Jane Warfield Well  --  How far does he say it is ? MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete O , just at the skirts of the town . JANE . Jane Warfield But had'nt we better take a servant , or ask Mr. Obsolete to go with us ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete No  --  no  --  my brother wo n't hear of such things ever since I took his daughter to the Penitentiary to see some bad women that talked of being good  --  And besides , I forgot to tell you  --  little Billy says  --  ( whispers in her ear )  --  and do n't like to be seen by the gentlemen . JANE . Jane Warfield Well  --  the motive must excuse the act . I would not willingly forego the chance of doing good , but I really dislike this strolling about the skirts of the city alone . MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete Mercy upon us , Miss Jane , do you suppose I would lead you into any impropriety ? You 'll meet no Bucktails there , I promise you , nor any of those desperate knights that run away with beauteous and rich damsels in romance . Our present race of beaux are not quite so enterprising . I believe they 'd rather run away from me than with me at any time . JANE . Jane Warfield Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I will get ready , for this piece of lady-errantry . But why not order your carriage ? MISS OBSOLETE . Miss Obsolete O , that would look like an ostontatious display of charity , you know . Lord Noland just now offered to send a hack to the door , which Billy says we shall be obliged to leave at some little distance ; so his lordship desired me to take a female companion . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE III .  --  A ROOM IN THE HOTEL . Jonathan and Paddy Whack . PADDY . Paddy Whack As I was saying , Governor Peabody , I 've been looking for you all about town . I want to speak to you . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody I calculate I 've not been out this blessed day . I wonder you did n't find me at home before now . PADDY . Paddy Whack Faith , it never came across me that you might be at home till I 'd looked for you everywhere else , honeycomb . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody Why , I should guess it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Whack . PADDY . Paddy Whack Booh ! that only shows your ignorance . My master , who is a lord , is always out , or never at home when he is n't ; and I his man am just as seldom there as a bishop at his church . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody May be so  --  but what might your business be with me , Mr. Whack ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Why , governor , I came to talk over the affair of the governorship , you as good as promised me . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody Um  --  I guess I remember you did n't finish your biography . I think you said you came over in the king 's suit ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Right  --  I belonged to the court . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody Did you now , by gum  --  marry ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Marry ? No , marry did I not  --  I left my sweetheart in Ireland , and came over a single jontleman , governor . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody Sartin ?  --  Ay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over men when the water is between ' em . But how did you come ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Faith , as an attach , I think they call it . I attached myself to the fat assistant cook of the royal squadron , in which capacity I gain 'd the good will of a certain great lord , who had been an old clothesman in his time . He took me into his service when we landed , upon account of my wardrobe . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody Um  --  I guess he was smitten with your old clothes , Mr. Whack . PADDY . Paddy Whack You say right , bully governor , but it proved the ruin of our friendship . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody How so , Mr. Whack ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Why , as bad luck would have it , I caught my lord one day robbing my trunk of a pair of old breeches , and sundry other articles of no value but to the owner . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody I reckon what 's bred in the bone , Mister Whack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lord . By the way  --  you seem to have a power of lords here . PADDY . Paddy Whack Plenty , dear  --  There 's but one lord above , and thousands below . Howsomever , finding my lord not to be trusted , I discharged him , and got with another lord , who hired me on account of my skill in elopements . JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody Lord Noland , may be ? PADDY . Paddy Whack Right , governor  --  I believe you were born by guess , you 're such a great hand at it . We 've an elopement on hand just at present . ( Bell rings . ) JONATHAN . Jonathan Peabody You do n't say so ? But I hear my pupil 's bell ring , and reckon he wants my advice . So good day , Mr. Whack . PADDY . Paddy Whack I hope you are pleased with my biography , governor ? My sarvice  --  good day to you . I 'll call again to-morrow , if the elopement will permit me that honor .

Little Billy It 's jist nigh hand , now  --  it 's jist t' other side the woods  --  this path leads to it . JANE . Jane Warfield I begin to distrust this boy ;  --  some mischief is on foot , I fear . The place is so lonely , and there 's not a house or a human being in sight , madam .

You can not be so cruel . Since we parted last I have not slept ; I can not sleep or think , but of one thing .

' T is to put out the feeling heart to nurse , Or send it like a lazy schoolboy forth , Unwilling to learn his A B C Under some graybeard flogging pedagogue . Time 's office is to throw cold water on  --  Not feed the flame with oil . So the old poets sing , when wooing Truth From Love and Inspiration . MARY .

Frank Tudor Ah !  --  do not undervalue my true affection if I should pause at this . Long before I saw you , my country was my darling . Her waving woods , her boundless fields , her freedom , and the generous plenty that reigns throughout her vast circumference , have , till now , made her my only mistress . Nay , the very scorn which the proud slaves of kings have cast upon her dear and honored name , has made me love her a thousand times more than if they had overwhelmed her with their hollow praise . O ! such a country  --  if you were but there ! MARY . Mary Obsolete But there I can not be  --  even if I wished it . My dear father has no wife , no kindred , and I might say perhaps no friends , to take care of him when I am gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foibles ?

OBSOLETE . Obsolete And may it please your majesty , who are these worthy persons ? ( Pointing to the beggars in a corner . ) KING . Bamfylde Moore Carew Courtiers , sir , courtiers .  --  This , now , is my prime minister . He 's the keenest hand at raising the wind  --  that is to say , smelling out a new tax , in my whole kingdom . There 's not a hedge that he do n't assess for a shirt or a petticoat , and , like another Titus , he thinks he has lost a day if he has n't cheated somebody . SIR KIT Sir Christopher Cheated ! KING . Bamfylde Moore Carew Ay , marry , slave . What makes the great politician but supe- rior skill in cheating ? Men are slaves to fools ; they to knaves ; and knaves to wealth and power .

Bamfylde Moore Carew That ? O that 's my poet laureate . He 's considered the best beggar in the commonwealth , and finds himself in sack and sugar by writing dedications and birth-day odes . He 's now hard at a poem or poetical law-case , in which the devil is chief justice , and the ghost of a king defendant . OBSOLETE . Obsolete And this ? KING . Bamfylde Moore Carew That 's my attorney-general , a learned limb of the law . ' T is true the only cause he ever pleaded was when he was brought up for cozening a client . But then he 's been up since so often before the justice , that I 'll pit him against any Cicero of the Quarter Sessions . OBSOLETE . Obsolete And this ? KING .

Obsolete Ay , do , Mary . ' T is an ancient and venerable custom , that of consulting the oracle . MARY . Mary Obsolete Excuse me , sir .

Your court seems quite complete , may it please your majesty . KING . Bamfylde Moore Carew Why , yes  --  except that we lack a lord high admiral . May be sir , ( to the Admiral , ) you 'd like the place ? Your wooden leg would be a marvelous recommendation to my service . ( Admiral stumps away in a rage . ) ( Henry and Frank appear in the wood , just outside the ruin . ) KING . Bamfylde Moore Carew Whisht ! I smell an officer ! We shall have the whole posse upon us directly . Fly ! skip like fleas , ye flea-bitten knaves . Meet me at the old hollow oak . Away !

The beggars , who before appeared crippled and deformed , in various ways recover the use of their limbs , and disappear , jumping out of the windows , over the walls , &; C. , with great activity . ) OBSOLETE . Obsolete Ha ! ha ! a miracle ! What wouldst give , Sir Kit , for the power of working such astonishing cures of wooden legs , hump-backs , and crippled arms , hey !  --  But by the way , if the officers are coming , we 'd better retire into the interior for fear of being confounded with his sacred majesty and his courtiers . Here 's a door  --  follow me . ( Exeunt omnes . ) ( Henry and Frank without the castle walls on one side , and Lord Noland with his party on the other .

There is a storm approaching . Let 's in , and wait quietly till it is past . HENRY . Henry Tudor Well , well  --  I despair of finding her now .  --  O , God ! what will become of her and me !

And the scene shifts at the instant to the inside of the castle . ) SCENE IX . NOLAND . Noland " ' T is I  --  Hamlet the Dane ! " HENRY . Henry Tudor Rather say Lord Noland the ravisher  --  the gallant noble who wins a lady as thieves do lambs  --  by running away with them  --  But I 've found you , thank Heaven ! NOLAND .

Noland Look'ee , Mr. Tudor  --  we 'll settle this matter at once . Miss Warfield is not in my possession  --  she escaped last night  --  I swear it , on the honor of a nobleman . HENRY . Henry Tudor The honor of a nobleman ! Pish !  --  Escap 'd , did she ? Pshaw ! But he who is ashamed of his actions , will seldom care about his words . Do not oblige me to believe you 're a coward as well as a villain . NOLAND . Noland Very well  --  very well , sir ! But I have injured you and will be patient as long as I can . To show you I am in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miss Warfield . HENRY . Henry Tudor Cold-blooded poltroon ! Yes ! to lead us astray from the place where you 've conceal 'd your prize ! No , no , my lord , I parley no longer . Restore the lady , or take your distance . Our bullets will find their way by the light of this fire , I warrant you . FRANK . Frank Tudor And do n't forget , my worthy lord , that if any accident happens to one brother , there 's another one to settle the account with , principal and interest . NOLAND . Noland Say you so , my bully Bucktails ? Come on then , and you precious mischiefs go your ways , and be silent , or I 'll hang you all  --  Begone !  --  ( Exit Ruffians . ) I 'll trust to your honor , gentlemen , for fair play , though you wo n't to mine .

Noland I owe you no grudge , sir  --  you 've not robbed me of my mistress . Now do I see no special reason why I should n't go and hang myself on the next tree ; yet still I cling to life like ivy to an old wall  --  the more decayed the closer it sticks  --  ( aside . ) ( Then turning to Henry . ) Mr. Tudor , you must have perceived that I dare fight even in a bad cause , and when I beg pardon , as I do now , of you and this injured lady , you will do me the justice to believe that not fear , but compunction and shame , have brought me to this avowal .
