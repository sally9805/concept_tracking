txt T the latest glimpse that we can get of the distinguished author whose name has drawn our attention to the above-mentioned publications , we find him an infirm , retired octogenarian , long , gaunt , and ghastly , careless and slovenly in dress , with a countenance deeply furrow*d by a life of intense thought , and indicating great mental vigor and rigid inflexibility of character . He was revered and cherished as the last of a constellation of luminaries , that bad for half a century or more shed lustre on the previously obscure and overshadowed denomination of Particular or Calvinistic Baptists . He , too , has now gone to his rest ; and , as his finished life and testimony pass to be matters of record and history , we avail ourselves of the opportunity to present such imperfect sketches of his person and character as we can obtain , and to de@@184059375.txt IN a recent number of this Journal , we noticed at some length the Life and Correspondence of Dr. Arnold , by his friend and pupil , Mr. Stanley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first American edition of that work . The appearance of this interesting biography has been naturally followed by a desire to know more of the character and opinions of so vigorous a thinker and admirable a man . The demand for new editions of his works has been immense* and within only a few weeks , his biographical and historical contributions to the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana , which constitute the germ of his Roman History , have been republished . In the eagerness to save every relic , his occasional and even his fragmentary productions have been deemed worthy of republication ; and the volume of miscellanies which we have now under review contains a series of treatises , pamphlets , and articles collected from a great variety of sources . We are indebted to the American publishers for several additions to the contents of the English volume which bears the same title ; and although the volume has thus already reached a goodly size , we should have been glad to meet with two or three more of the Introductions and Appendices to the Sermons , one only of which do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows any thing of Dr. Arnold , will expect to find in him the qualities of a modern essayist . For mere literary criticism , and the graces or the artifices of style , he had little time or taste . The fragments of leisure gathered out of the cares of a laborious vocation were too precious to be spent upon the amusement of an idle reader . The lighter moods of authorship he willingly left to those who could afford to indulge in them . For himself , he found life too serious a pilgrimage for these wayside diversions . He could not play with the pen ; he had more work for it than he could find time for . And even when he enters upon some // weighty subject , he seldom thinks it worth while to be very nice about the expression of his thoughts . His early writings have the bard and homely manner of one who is busy only with the substance of the subject in hand , and is much more anxious to instruct , than to please or amuse . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowing ; yet be was always very indifferent about the mere art of composition and the graces of rhetoric . The great warmth of his nature , and the zeal with which he set about all his undertakings , supplied in a great measure this neglect . As he threw his whole soul into every thing he wrote , there is a freshness in his works which more than atones for their occasional want of finish . The bold honesty of his nature spared him the necessity of that second thought which is often needed by the lukewarm and insincere to perfect the disguise they have assumed . We sometimes wonder , indeed , that the singular boyishness of his nature , breaking out at times into the most exuberant spirits , should have infused so little liveliness into his style . His letters afford ample proof of the possession of a bluff English wit , of which hardly a trace appears in his other writings . But devoid as these writings are of wit and sprightliness , there is , especially in his Lectures and the closing volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is highly attractive . And when , under the sting of manly indignation , he assumes the grave vehemence of his sterner tone , the reader feels that nothing but charity and truthfulness stood in the way of his becoming one of the most formidable polemics of the day . It was fortunate , perhaps , that his other occupations were too pressing to allow him many Opportunities to engage in the controversies raging around him . He had such a hatred of all shams and " parrot-like phrases , " that he could hardly write on any of the agitating questions of the day , without giving serious umbrage to some of those to whom an old sham is a reality , and parrot-like phrases have all the charm of current coin . It was not his way to mince words ; and his distance from the busy world may sometimes have blinded him to the startling vehemence of his own expressions . Had he been more in the habit of trying his phrases on other men before he published them , perhaps he would have seen , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the // man , the vanity or ignorance of an opponent might not . His attack on the Tractarians , for instance , notwithstanding the careful reservation at the close , might naturally disturb men who were not the most unlikely to identify themselves with their doctrines . The keen contempt with which he stigmatizes " the Oxford Malignants " ( an appellation , by the way , for which , it should be remembered , he is not responsible ) as men of the Hophni and Phinehas school , formalists , fanatics , Judaizers , and nonjurors , was not likely to be easily forgotten by those who were the subject of the picture . That they were thus noted only in their character as members of a party would help the matter but little with such violent partisans . The severe , but not harsh , manner , in which , at the close of his pamphlet on the Catholic question , he exposes the shallowness of the current plan of theological education , might sting more deeply than he supposed . He felt keenlv all the odium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of bold words to arouse sleeping men , that we question whether he would have retracted a line , even if he could have foreseen the treatment which it brought upon him . There are times when prudence finds her occupation gone , and the unvarnished truth is the best wisdom . And , indeed , he may have found it so ; for the world came round to him at last . Nothing in his whole life is more striking than the change from great unpopularity to the other extreme , and that without compromise or concession on his part . As an author , Dr. Arnold is best known by his historical labors ; and the more we read of his other works , the better are we satisfied that his peculiar talents fitted him best for that department . There is hardly one of his occasional essays , in which more or less of the historian 's faculty does not appear . His power of analyzing states of society and dissecting the complex relations of parties is quite remarkable . Those who have read his Lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sketched the condition of the parties in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . The essay on the Social Progress of States is distinguished by the same facility . He had studied history with the eye of a classical scholar and that of a churchman at the same time . Hence the happy manner in which he brings civil to bear on ecclesiastical history ; and hence also his profound acquaintance with English history , // that almost equal mixture of both . In one of his letters , he says , " I should like to write a hook on The Theory of Tides , ' the flood and ebb of parties . " No man could have done it better , as he has sufficiently shown by his occasional attempts at this sort of writing in illustration of the controverted questions of the day . The best instances of his best manner are to be found in his historical works . It is in these that we trace the growth of that softer and calmer style which characterized the close of his life . The judicial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other times are treated inspires the reader both with confidence and sympathy . Hannibal and Scipio are evidently present with the historian . His deep religious faith , too , throws over those distant times , which he regards as seasons in the great year of Providence , a present interest , and binds together periods the most remote . His ever-growing personal sympathies , his exquisite relish for the beauties of nature , his quick perception of the historical points , so to speak , of a scene , and the experience gained in his short summer tours on the continent , together with a continued habit of writing , had brought his narrative and descriptive style to a high degree of excellence . The growth of Rome 's civil as well as military grandeur , the infusion of Grecian civilization and literature , the tragedy of the Gracchi , the aristocratic proscriptions of Sylla and the democratic butcheries of Marius , the bloody social war and the glorious death of the heroic gladiator , the career of the vain and bashful , but able , Pompey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire , were themes worthy of the best powers of any man . To treat them well required all his statesmanlike sagacity , his high sense of justice , and the broad range of his historical reading . It was neither more nor less than the history of the world for centuries . It is a history which has never yet been adequately written ; nor is it , probably , too much to say , that no man living could have executed the task more successfully than Dr. Arnold . Though the duties of Dr. Arnold 's station , at the head of one of the great public schools of England , were so engrossing as to leave him only short and broken intervals of leisure , such was his interest in the leading questions of his time , that it was sometimes impossible for him to be silent . How he found time to write at all , or even think , is extraordinary . // For never was devotion more earnest and absorbing than his to his profession . But the intensity of his zeal seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great rapidity , and seldom submitted to the labor of correction . Thus it was , that , when the stir of distant debate reached his ear in his seclusion at Rugby , it found him eager enough to put on the harness and do battle in the good cause . A good hater , never of men , but of what he deemed the detestable doctrines of some men , he could not sleep till he had uttered his anathema against them . A son and friend of the church , he could not away with the parricidal obstinacy which would hurry her to her fall , or the hierarchical arrogance that would make her privileges inaccessible , to any of the true heirs of the promises of the gospel . A hearty and steady friend of the poor , he felt to the quick the miseries of their unhappy lot , and was constrained to speak out in their behalf . A deeply committed foe to every shape and shade of oppression , he could hardly contain himself when oppressive measures were even broached . When to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of all party trammels , we can not wonder that he felt himself at times imperatively summoned to undertake the championship of the highest doctrines in church and state . Indeed , he appears to have been haunted by a spirit of restless sympathy , which made his interest in great public questions like that which most men take only in their private concerns , and which inspired him with an impatient eagerness to make himself heard before it should be too late . Full as his life was of busy deeds , it was fuller of uncompleted projects . He planned out future works , with all the hopeful enthusiasm and buoyant energy of a boy just let loose from college . He reminds us of the anecdote related of his namesake , the PortRoyalist Arnauld , who , hearing Nicole , weary of so many strifes , speak of repose , replied , - " Repose ! will you not have an eternity to repose in ? " He seems , indeed , to have looked forward to his retreat at Fox How as a scene of rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacations there amounted to , and the summary of his plans drawn up by Mr. Stanley , will not interpret the expression precisely as other men would understand it . He felt that he had no time to lose on earth ; nor could even old age have tamed that public spirit which was in him almost a passion , and that holy in // dignation at every form of wrong which burned like a fire within him . There is a curious passage in the last page of his private diary , which shows a sense of this peculiar restlessness : " Let me mind my own personal work , laboring to do God 's will ; yet not anxious that it should be done by me rather than by others , if God disapproves of my doing it . " The lives of some men are read for the sake of their writings ; the writings of others for the sake of their lives . It is no injustice to Dr. Arnold to place his writings in the second class . For to us , unquestionable as is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than them all . The chief charm of the writings is , that they are his . We explore them for indications of the traits of his noble character . We love to detect in them those singular contrasts which were so conspicuous in the man ; - the mixture of boldness and humility ; the almost childlike reverence for men , and the distrust of bodies of men ; the eagerness to propose remedies for existing disorders , alternating with the deepest despondency as to their success ; the grave sternness and the overflowing benevolence ; the quick sentiment and the sturdy good sense the love of old things and the confidence in new ; a composition , in fact , so peculiar , that it would be difficult to devise any curve to represent the devious , yet not wayward , course of his opinio.ns . We take pleasure in watching the influence of his affections on his opinions ; for they went always in company . Nor does this impair our respect for the opinions for so true were his feelings , that they were the salt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strong impulses , not always prudent , perhaps , but generally right . We admire , almost envy , his well established faith , and the tenacity with which , etiarn mordicus , he clings to the great leading ideas of his life . Cut off , too , in the midst of an active career , just when his powers had reached their full development , he had never done himself full justice in his *vorks . His admirable Historical Lectures are only introductory , and only lectures . Of the three volumes of Roman History , the first two were written under the weight of his reverence for Niebuhr ; and the last , in which he amply proves himself equal to his subject , leaves us at the threshold of Rome 's glory . As in the unfinished painting of our great artist , we admire the work // less for itself than as the evidence of its author 's power . Dr. Arnold 's opinions , like those of almost every strong thinker , revolved ahout a few leading thoughts , which are perpetually hreaking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This of course impairs the interest with which a miscellaneous collection of his writings is read . Essays are here thrown together , which were independently written , and we grow weary of the repetition of the same ideas and forms . This is especially the case with those fragmentary attempts which we find in this volume ; each being the beginning of a complete work which was to unite the whole . rllhus , to a casual reader , the volume may appear dull ; hut when read in the light of its author 's life and character , it is full of interest and instruction . The great idea of Dr. Arnold 's life was the restoration of the church . For this he sighed as did the captive in Babylon when he remembered Zion . In weal and woe , through good report and evil report , he dave to this hope as to his life . He wept over the unchristian state of Christendom , the unconverted spirit of the laws and customs of the most enlightened nations , and looked anxiously around for some means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her true mission , to have narrowed her borders , and shorn her crown of some of its jewels . Hence the zeal with which he pressed his theory of the relation of church and state , as an important instrument towards the renovation of the Christian world . The readers of his biography are well aware , that he had sketched the plan of a work on Christian politics , the idea of which was borrowed from the Politics of Aristotle . This work he never finished . Indeed , he was never able to present with any completeness his views on this great subject . Less tangible and immediately practical in its character than the other topics with which he had to deal , and less involved in the stirring controversies of the day , it was again and again opened , but never exhausted . Dr. Arnold seemed to be waiting for that retired leisure which he hoped to gain by his withdrawal from Rugby , to work out more fully the ideas with which he was possessed . He felt that he had a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered . No one can forget the earnestness of desire which breathes in his last written words , that " he might be spared to do that great work , if he might be permitted to take // part in it . " On this , his dearest theme , he was ever ready to meet both friend and foe . With his usual hold candor , he pushed his opinions to their consequences , and met the objections of his opponents by arguments and statements , which to him were none the less powerful because to them they were not a little startling . The volume before us is full of ' his views on these great points . And yet we find some difficulty in attempting an exposition of them , particularly of his theory of church and state ; partly from an inability to trace the gradual modifications which time may have produced in his opinions , and more , as it seems to us , from a want of definiteness either in the theory itself or in its development . Dr. Arnold had a most exalted idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religion with the church , a confusion which he takes especial care to avoid , calling the one " the divine philosophy , " the other " the divine polity , " of Christianity , he insists most positively on the necessity of the cooperation of Christians for moral and religious ends . This coöperative l ) principle should extend to every part of life , embracing not only moral good as such , but physical well-being , because this involves moral considerations . The object , then , of Christian society being the putting down of moral evil , and so coextensive with life itself , " the natural and fit state of the church is , that it should he a sovereign society or commonwealth ; as long as it is subordinate and municipal , it can not fully carry its purposes into effect . " But the church , since the cessation of miraculous gifts , has been deficient in power ; and to become sovereign must arm itself with the necessarily sovereign power of the state . The state , too , on its part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its power it may reward vice and punish virtue , as well as the reverse ; it may allure or drive its subjects by fear or favor into unchristian , as well as Christian , ways . By uniting , then , the wise church with the strong state , we perfect the union of knowledge and power . " The one has , as it were , the soul , and the other the organized body , each of which requires to be united with the other . " This union , it will be perceived , is not in any form an alliance , conjunction , or codperation of church and state , hut a pure and thorough identification of them . The church , in its formal character , is lost in the state ; hut the spirit of the whole is that of the // church . What was a kingdom of the world has become a kingdom of Christ ; and the church is no longer an outward local organization , but a Christian kingdom . Such , it is believed , though a meagre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , it is little more than a cento of his own phrases , culled from different parts of his works . The scheme is equally opposed to papal or hierarchical supremacy or independence in almost every known instance on the one hand , and to the theory which would limit the objects of the state to the providing for the security of men 's bodies and goods , making the support of religion subservient simply to these ends , on the other . In fact , it is difficult to say to which of these two extremes he was more hostile . To adopt the one was in his view to abase the church in pretending to exalt it ; and to adopt the other was to degrade the state . He finds in his master , Aristotle , the true conception of the object of the state ; not the mere security of life and property , but human happiness in its largest sense , - the happiness conferred by wisdom and virtue , no less than the comfort derived from the senses . Dr. Arnold did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rather strove to adduce in its support the opinions of leading minds in church and state . He quotes a very remarkable passage favoring his views from one of Burke 's speeches , and appeals also to Coleridge , an authority for whom he had no slight respect . But we may find , as far back as Hooker , a full and open statement of the theory . He held it , perhaps , as broadly as Arnold , but in a somewhat different order . Hooker urges the identity of church and state in defence of the supremacy of the king ; Arnold defends the supremacy , as the proof and bond of the identification . Hooker scarcely , if at all , insists on the theory till he comes to his last hook ; Arnold makes it the substratum and total of the system . He loved to quote Hooker 's magnificent eulogy of law ; but it was the law of that Christian state for the establishment of which he so earnestly longed . To show how far Dr. Arnold 's theory is indebted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the eighth hook of the Ecclesiastical Polity . " Of every politick society that being true which Aristotle saith , namely , that the scope thereof is not simply to live , nor the duty so much to provide for the life , as for the means of living well ' ; 15* // and that even as the soul is the worthier part of man , so human societies are much more to care for that which tendeth properly to the soul 's estate , than for such temporal things which the life hath need of When whole Rome became Christian when they all embraced the gospel and made laws in defence thereof , if it he held that the church and commonweal of Rome did then remain as before , there is no way how this could he possible , save only one , and that is , they must restrain the name of a church in a Christian commonweal to the clergy , excluding all the rest of believers , both prince and people . For , if all that believe be contained in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsistence divided from the commonweal , when the whole commonweal doth believe ? The church and the commonweal are in this case therefore personally one society , which society being termed commonweal as it liveth under whatsoever form of secular law and government , a church as it liveth under the spiritual law of Christ ; forsomuch as these two laws contain so many and different offices , there must of necessity be appointed in it some to one charge and some to another , yet without dividing the whole , and making it two several impaled societies When we oppose the church and commonwealth in Christian society , we mean by the commonwealth that society with relation to all the public affairs thereof , only the matter of true religion excepted ; by the church , the same society with only reference unto the matter of true religion , without any affairs . " Dr. Arnold was well aware that his theory , to be fully realized , would require a very different state of society from any now existing . He was forced to admit that such aninterfusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the preface to the first volume of his History , he speaks of the distinction between the church and the state , as " now so deeply seated in our laws , our language , and our institutions , that nothing less than a miraculous interposition of God 's providence seems capable , within any definite time , of eradicating it . " Yet to him it wore less of a utopian aspect than it would have done to a mind less ardent in its anticipations , or less alive to the gross corruptions of church and state . His desire of this perfect union and assimilation of the two great powers of society begat the hope , at least , of its final achievement . He did not always allude to it in the desponding tone of the passage above quoted ; for in spite of the clouds which enveloped it , he could not help // turning his eye to the east , where he hoped for the breaking of the dawn . He insists upon it as the perfect idea or model , to which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church and state should ever tend , and by aiming to copy which , they may be ever realizing a positive and palpable progress . He had applied a similar theory in his school at Rugby , and might naturally augur well from his success there for an experiment conducted on a larger scale . As it is our object in the present article less to criticize Dr. Arnold 's opinions than to exhibit them , we shall not attempt a discussion of the merits of this system . It is , perhaps , presented by its author in too dogmatical a form . His apology for this is , that a long work on the subject would find but few readers ; and he adds , - " When error dogmatizes , truth may do the same ; a position not likely to satisfy those who are anxious to discover where the truth actually lies . Had his life been spared , he would probably have given a more detailed exposition of his system . In its present state , we hardly find a satisfactory answer to the abstract objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are essentially distinct and independent . Nor do we perceive that Warburton 's argument , that the identity of the members of two societies does not necessarily destroy the independent character and existence of the societies , as such , is set aside by alleging the necessity of an inherent sovereignty residing in the state . It is not shown , that an alliance of church and state is less adequate to Christianize the legislation of the state than the proposed fusion of them into one . There is something , to our minds , indistinct in the proposal of a mutual transfer of wisdom and power between the two societies . The church is wise ; make the state a church , and the state must be wise ; - such , is the argument . We confess onr inability , without fuller illustration than we have yet found , to understand either the nature of the wisdom intended , or the force of the reasoning . Whether the wisdom of the church is the collective wisdom of its members , as the power of the state is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn ; and if it be not , why may not eaGh Christian bring his religious principles to the discharge of his civil duties as well as if citizen and churchman were really one . We do not presume to deny the truth of the theory ; we // only wish for a more thorough development of it . It seems in its present form , as if the bold gospel figure of the " kingdom of Christ " had dazzled Dr. Arnold 's eyes with a bright , but unsubstantial , vision of a heaven upon earth . The practical difficulties which beset this theory , if indeed it can be said to have any practical bearing , are a host . Unless we assume at once the perfection of the men who are to sway this celestial empire , - that is , unless we postpone the consummation of this union till the final consummation of all things , church and state among the number , which would be a sort of death-bed nuptials , we find it difficult to conceive of any appreciable approach to the fulfilment of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be possible , one is tempted to ask if there is no danger that every civil dissension would be made a church quarrel . Inasmuch , too , as worldly men are prone to use worldly means for worldly ends , and as mere community of belief , the proposed test and bond of citizenship , will not insure singleness of purpose , one may doubt if the robes of the church would not be occasionally soiled by the touch of unsanctified garments . It is questionable , whether bigotry would be converted to liberalism by the possession of political power ; and no other antidote against bigotry is offered by the theory . How , too , stopping short of infallibility , can you avoid that possible oppression of the conscience , so much insisted on in proof of the necessity of this amalgamation ; since , of all wrongs to an honest conscience , those inflicted at the beck of other consciences are not the least ? Is there no danger of adding spiritual to temporal despotism , instead of extinguishing both ? They are both acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know not but that we have treated this system ignorantly and unjustly ; but it is exceedingly difficult to seize it by the horns . It has the air of belonging to another state of society , and almost to another stage of being . We should* not have dwelt so long upon it , if it were possible to give any intelligible statement of Dr. Arnold 's opinions without some outline of his peculiar views on this subject . But the dreams of some men are worth more than the waking thoughts of others . So we can trace in many of Dr. Arnold 's opinions on more practical points the influence of this theory . If he dreamed , he interpreted his dream awake . He could not // hold weakly even a weak doctrine . This favorite idea , which he had caught as in a trance , he made the central point of a system of doctrines , some of which he must have held without it , but others of which either grew out of it , or were materially modified hy it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sensibly affected by the relation which they sustained to this his great idea . He loved to group around it , and bring into neighbourly connection with it , the truths which he deemed of vital importance . His horror , for example , of a priesthood in the church was extreme , and was expressed in the strongest terms . He could see no hope of a perfect church , till the aristocratic claim of the clergy to be in a peculiar sense the church was trampled under foot . He loved to repeat the assertion , and to enforce it from Scripture and history , that we have hut one Mediator and Priest , even Christ . For the * as distinguished from the presbyter , he had no reverence . He would break down the artificial barriers between the clergy and laity . He treated the Warburtonian theory of an alliance of church and state for temporal ends as a mere reaction from the other extreme of spiritual assumption . He would allow the clergy no claim to any divine gift , any peculiar sanctity , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church ; it is our highest country. * ' His unmitigated detestation of the dogma of the apostolical succession , as tending to perpetuate the division between the clergy and the laity , he never disguised ; and in the introduction to the fourth volume of his Sermons it is the gist of his assault upon Newmanism . More than one of the suggestions in his pamphlet on Church Reform are referable to his desire to enlarge the pale of the church till it should become coextensive with the state . His wish to revive church discipline , too , comports well with the desire to invest the church with sovereignty . But the doctrine to which he recurs with peculiar fondness is that of the king 's supremacy , which he regarded not only as an assertion of the true theory , but as a foothold for its establishment . He alludes to it in such terms as these - " I believe that our fathers at the Reformation stumbled accidentally , or rather were unconsciously led by God 's providence , to the declaration of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's supremacy . " He calls it " the charter of the church of England . " In a similar spirit , Dr. Arnold was strenuously opposed to the exclusion of the clergy from either house of Parliament . So far , indeed , did he carry his idea of a perfect state , that , when he was pressed by the objection , that his theory , by making Christian belief the condition of citizenship , would lay Jews and infidels under a perpetual civil disability , he boldly accepted the conclusion , though , in order to uphold a principle so abhorrent to his usual liberal and statesmanlike views , he had to resort to antiquity for the idea of citizenship . The best statement of his views on this subject is to be found in the preface to the third volume of his Thucydides . " To those , who think that political society was ordained for higher purposes than those of mere police or traffic , the principle of the ancient commonwealths in making agreement in religion and morals the test of citizenship can not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the ancient legislators were compelled to seek in sameness of race , is now furnished to us in the profession of Christianity . He who is a Christian , let his race be what it will , let his national customs be ever so different from ours , is fitted to become our fellow-citizen ; for his being a Christian implies that he retains such of his national customs only as are morally indifferent ; and for all such we ought to feel the most perfect toleration . He who is not a Christian , though his family may have lived for generations on the same soil with us , though they may have been protected by our laws , and paid taxes in return for that pro . tection , is yet essentially not a citizen , but a sojourner . In a letter to Mr. Hull he writes - " I want to petition against the Jew Bill , but I believe I must petition alone . I want to take my stand on my favorite principle , that the world is made up of Christians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim whatever of political right . They are strangers in England , and have no more claim to legislate for it than a lodger has to share with the landlord in the management of his house . England is the land of Englishmen , not of Jews . " " We hear a great deal too much in the present day of the political rights of individuals . Individuals , in a political sense , are necessarily members ; as distinct from the body , they are nothing . Against society they have no political rights whatever ; and their belonging to society or not is a matter not of their own choice , but determined for them by their being born and bred members of it . " // This is a theory of citizenship clearly much behind , or much in advance of , the age . Whether Dr. Arnold expected , by driving deists , atheists , and Jews each into a separate society , to promote the conversion of unbelievers , we know not . The precise method of hastening the advent of the universal kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barring out of these every Christian influence , is not detailed . How , too , he was to get over the difficulty of dealing with these unchristian but civilized communities , who must have an equal right with Christians to enjoy the privileges of the law of nations , and an equal voice in its decisions , we are not informed . Though the last man to vindicate any form of persecution , Arnold was no friend to toleration acts . He regarded them as engines of dissent ; as acknowledging , and so perpetuating , division in the church . He desired a liberal system of comprehension which should make toleration unnecessary . He describes the Toleration Act as " a strange measure , by which the nation sanctioned the non-observance of its own institutions , and relaxed by one half the bond of national communion . " It will not appear strange that his historical judgments should sometimes be warped by his theory of church and state . This was apt to be the case , especially in regard to English affairs ; and we may perhaps detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare not analyze too closely the motives of our best actions ; but if ever , grand conceptions of establishing the dominion of good over evil may he allowed to have concealed from the heart the ignohier feelings which may have been mixed with them , this excuse may justly he pleaded for Gregory the Seventh and Innocent the Third . rrhe infallibility of the church was the fond effort of the human mind to believe in the reality of the support which its weakness so needed ; its unity was a splendid dream , beautiful , but impracticable . " Dr. Arnold occupied so isolated a position , and took so little pains to trim his opinions to the measure of any party creed , that we are sometimes unable to reconcile his doctrines with each other , without having recourse to his favorite theory . Viewed in the light of his passionate desire to restore the Christian religion to its supremacy over all temporal concerns , or rather to make temporal concerns spiritual , many apparent inconsistencies vanish ; and we are able to // understand how he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at another to touch the confines of radicalism . His opinions on the subject of oaths are quite curious . One would have expected from him a hearty approval of civil oaths , regarded as a public confession of the existence and authority of a supreme being . But on another side of his system they presented a different aspect . As the doctrine of a priesthood in the church seemed to him to lower the standard of religion among the laity without elevating the faith of the clergy , so the practice of taking oaths was odious in his sight , as seeming to do injustice to the simple truth . By the requisition of an oath , truth lost in the eyes of men its credibility and value , and ordinary unperjured falsehood its hatefulness . He would not consent to take an oath , on assuming the professorial chair at Oxford . Yet , such was his detestation of aristocratic arrogance , that , in one of his letters , he calls the custom of allowing the peers in cases of impeachment to vote upon their honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have already alluded to his opinions on the so-called apostolical succession , a doctrine with which he could keep no terms , not only as it was in itself the extreme of priestly assumption , but as it lay directly across the path of his own cherished theory . His chief protest against the Tractarians , in the introduction to the fourth volume of Sermons , published in 1841 , treats almost exclusively of this topic . In connection , however , with this tract should be read the appendix to the eleventh sermon of the third volume , published in 1834 . The introduction is composed in a more polemical spirit than was usual with him in the later years of his life . Yet it bears many marks of the milder and calmer tone of that period . We see , too , many signs of his ever-growing love of nature ; and quote two or three passages in illustration of it . " So far as we can trace back the manifold streams , flowing some from the eastern mountains , and some from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we find on the one side the ideas of truth and justice , on the other those of beauty and love - things so exalted , and so inseparably united in the divine perfections , that to set either two above the other were presump. tuous and profane . Yet these most divine things separated from each other , and defiled in their passage through this lower world , // do each assume a form in human nature of very great evil : the exclusive and corrupted love of truth and justice becomes in man selfish atheism ; the exclusive and corrupted worship of beauty and love becomes in man a bloody and a lying idolatry. " - p. 237 . " As the vessels in a harbour , and in the open sea without it , may be seen swinging with the tide at the same moment in opposite directions ; the ebb has begun in the roadstead , while it is not yet high water in the harbour ; so one or more nations may be in advance of or behind the general tendency of their age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Again , the tendency or movement in itself is liable to frequent interruptions , and short counter-movements : even when the tide is coming in upon the shore , every wave retires after its advance ; and he who follows incautiously the retreating waters may be caught by some stronger billow , overwhelming again for an instant the spot which had just been left dry . A child standing by the seashore for a few minutes and watching this , as it seems , irregular advance and retreat of the water , could not tell whether it was ebb or flood : and we , standing for a few years on the shore of time , can scarcely tell whether the particular movement which we witness is according to or against the general tendency of the whole period . " - pp. 237 , 238 . " There are states of falsehood and wickedness so monstrous , that , to use the language of Eastern mythology , the Destroyer God is greater than the Creator or the Preserver , and no good can be conceived so great as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs destruction and creation should go hand in hand ; as the evergreen shrubs of our gardens do not cast their old leaves till the young ones are ready to supply their place . " - p. 262 . Dr. Arnold thought that he , as well as the Newmanites , could see the indications of a movement towards " something deeper and truer than satisfied the last century . " Yet no man was less ready to join in the insane cry of those who reviled that century with a bitterness equally unphilosophical and unjust , and in the excess of their hatred of it would throw themselves into the arms of a system against whose errors the alleged secularism of the last age was , as he contended , only the reaction . Of the attempt of these men to put themselves at the head of a movement which ought to be guided towards the restoration of the suffering church , he could speak only in terms of the sharpest censure . That // men should have the impudence to propose as the remedy for the evils of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him equally as a churchman , a Christian , and a historian . Hence the plainness of such passages as these . " There are states of nervous excitement , when the noise of a light footstep is distracting , in such a condition were the authors of the Tracts in 1833 , and all their subsequent proceedings have shown that the disorder was still upon them . Beset by their horror of the nineteenth century , they sought for something most opposite to it , and therefore they tur*ned to what they called Christian antiquity . Had they judged of their own times fairly , had they appreciated the good of the nineteenth century , as well as its evil , they would have looked for their remedy not to the second , or third , or fourth centuries , but the first ; they would have tried to restore not the Church of Cyprian , or Athanasius , or Augustine , but the Church of St. Paul and of St. John . Now , this it is most certain that they have not done The Tracts for the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . guage of Christian antiquity ; they are rather its caricature. - p. 244 . In a word , he charges the Puseyites with confounding the church with the religion , and so attributing an exorbitant value to church ordinances and rules ; with aiming to invest the clergy with priestly powers , and thus usurping the exclusive office of Christ ; with setting the clergy above the laity , and thereby marring the unity of the church . This tract and the appendix above named furnish us with some curious illustrations of his tendency to associate opinions which have seldom been found in company . When we observe his indignant rejection of all priestly mediation , and his claim for the laity of a right to administer the sacraments of the supper and of baptism , we might fancy ourselves in the presence of a stout old Independent of the reign of Charles the First . But in the next breath we find ourselves taken aback by such expressions as these . " No wise man doubts that the Reformation was imperfect , or that in the Romish system there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it would be most desirable to restore amongst ourselves . Daily church services , frequent communions , memorials of our Christian calling continually present . ed to our notice in crosses and way-side oratories ; commemorations of holy men , of all times and countries ; the doctrine of // the communion of saints practically taught ; religious orders , especially of women , of different kinds , and under different rules , delivered only from the snare and sin of perpetual vows ; - all these , most of which are of some efficacy for good , even in a corrupt church , belong no less to the true church , and would there be purely beneficial . " - p. 260 . We can not close our very cursory notice of this characteristic tract , without quoting a passage which seems to us to be expressed in a strain of true eloquence . " What does the true and perfect church want , that she should borrow from the broken cisterns of idolatry ? Holding all those truths in which the clear voice of God 's word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all ages ; holding all the means of grace of which she was designed to be the steward - her common prayers , her pure preaching , her uncorrupted sacraments , her free and living society , her wise and searching discipline , her commemorations and memorials of God 's mercy and grace , whether shown in her Lord himself , or in his and her members ; - looking lovingly upon her elder sisters , the ancient churches , and delighting to be in communion with them , as she hopes that her younger sisters , the churches of later days , will delight to be in communion with her ; - what has she not that Christ 's bride should have ? what has she not that Mr. Newman 's system can give her ? But , because she loves her Lord , and stands fast in his faith , and has been enlightened by his truth , she will endure no other mediator than Christ , she will repose her trust only on his word , she will worship in the light , and will abhor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her sisters , the elder churches , she loves and respects as she would be herself loved and respected ; but she will not , and may not , worship them , nor even , for their sakes , believe error to be truth , or foolishness to be wisdom . She dare not hope that she can be in all things a perfect guide and example to the churches that shall come after her ; as neither have the churches before her been in all things a perfect guide and example to herself . She would not impose her yoke upon future generations , nor will she submit her own neck to the yoke of antiquity . She honors all men , but makes none her idol ; and she would have her own individual members regard her with honor , but neither would she be an idol to them . She dreads especially that sin of which her Lord has so emphatically warned her - the sin against the Holy Ghost . She will neither lie against him , by declaring that he is where his fruits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not where his fruits are . Rites and ordinances // may be vain , prophets may be false , miracles may be miracles of Satan : but the signs of the Lloiy Spirit , truth and holiness , can never be ineffectual , can never deceive , can never be evil ; where they are , and only where they are , there is God . " - pp. 261,262 . The subject of church reform naturally attracted Dr. Arnold 's most earnest attention . As early as the year 1826 , he had contributed to the Edinburgh Review an article on the Letters to an Episcopalian , in which he gives his views on the present condition of the church . His pamphlet on Church Reform appeared in 1833 , at a time when the dangers threatening the church appeared to him to be enormous . It bears every mark of having been written under the pressure of great alarm . There is an eagerness apparent in it to throw over the deck-load , so to speak , in order to save the ship . The character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and sweeping , and they subjected him to the charge of indiscretion . Yet more than one of his projects have since found favor in the eyes of men who are deemed neither indiscreet nor unfriendly to the church . He felt keenly the evils of the times . But the philosophy of folding the arms and leaving the event to Providence he could not understand . In the spirit of his favorite quotation from Herodotus , where the Persian fatalist deplores the misery of brooding over many things , but having power over none , he was for taking positive steps towards effecting a change . Hence , the present pamphlet contains a very broad scheme of reform in the establishment . His great desire was to reduce the evils of sectarianism ; to enlarge the basis of the church by a system of comprehension , broad enough to unite under one establishment the different opinions , and different rites and ceremonies , of the various Christian sects . As to opinions , he did not regard existing differences as vital enough to prevent the inclosing even of Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Episcopalian . He could even find a loophole for the admission of such Unitarians as were willing to address Christ in the language of prayer and praise , whatever might be their peculiar views of Christ 's nature . He hoped by a change in the terms of comnmnion , prompted by a sincere desire of conciliation , to draw Christians of every name to a more fraternal spirit and a closer union . But in order to bring about this happy consummation , some large concessions must be // made as to church government . And here , with his usual boldness , he at once sketches out a plan that might well appall those who fight for vestments and postures as others fight for wives and children . We give his own summary of it . " The Church government then would be made more efficient , and at the same time more popular , than it is at present ; 1 , By reducing the size of ' the dioceses : 2 , By giving the bishop a council consisting of lay members and of clerical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which officers should themselves also be lay and clerical , and for the most part elected directly by the inhabitants : 3 , By the institution of diocesan general assemblies : 4 , By admitting into the Establishment persons of a class much too poor to support the expense of an university education ; but who may be exceedingly useful as ministers , and who do preach at present , but under circumstances which make them necessarily hostile to the National Church , and leave them utterly at liberty to follow their own caprices : 5 , By allowing in many cases the election of ministers , and by giving to the inhabitants of the parish , in every case , a greater check over their appointment than they at present en*joy : and 6 , By constituting church officers in every parish , lay as well as clerical , who should share with the principal minister in its superintendence ; and thus effect generally that good , which in London and elsewhere is now being attempted by individual zeal , in the establishment of district visiting societies . Whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to what was said in the earlier part of this sketch , those who are now Dissenting ministers might at once become ministers of the Establishment , and as such would of course have their share in its government . " - p. 101 . He proceeds to consider the practicability of uniting in one church great varieties of ritual . And here at once he would aholish the exclusive use of the liturgy . He says , that , " even allowing it to be the best conceivable religious service in itself , still it ought not to be the only one . " In his enthusiastic impatience to effect his great plan of " comprehension without compromise , " he lays little stress on the ordinary objects of attack , patronage , pluralities , nonresidence , and the inequality of rank and emoluments . The monstrous evil of sectarianism seemed to him , like Aaron 's rod , to swallow up the rest . " He who knows the history of the Christian church has too good cause to remember how fatally the pursuit of the foolish phantom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attainment of the real and substantial blessing , union . " The readers of the Biography will remember the storm of obloquy and the long-lingering suspicion which this publication drew on its author 's head . They will remember , also , that towards the close of his life he was disposed to lay less emphasis on mere partial and administrative reforms . That the bare proposal of a scheme like the one here set forth , which struck at the choicest flowers of church prerogative , and disturbed the sleek indolence of spiritual exclusiveness , should have exposed him to the charge of hostility to the church on the part of those who loved the church dearly for the sake of the establishment , and whose sensibilities had hardly yet recovered from the shock of the Catholic Bill , was not amazing . It was not strange , even , that men of quite another stamp should have been startled at so radical a remedy ; and we can readily believe that nobody approved the whole project , and many hated , suspected , or pitied its author . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firmer friend . While he could understand the preference of many among the poor for dissenting ministers over conforming clergymen , and was even willing to borrow from Methodism some of its plebeian usages , he declared his allegiance to the church of England in terms which might have satisfied the most zealous of her adherents . Yet he never lost sight of the citizen in the churchman . " The church of Christ is , indeed , far beyond all human ties ; but of all human ties , that to our country is the highest and most sacred ; and England , to a true Englishman , ought to be dearer than the peculiar forms of the church of England . " We have already occupied so much space , that we can only allude to the other writings of Dr. Arnold contained in the volume before us . The pamphlet on the Christian Duty of conceding the Roman Catholic Claims appeared in 1829 . Its title indicates its character . The question is treated as a religious one . In the first place , it is urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second , that it is the part of Christian wisdom , as being the most likely way to mitigate the bitterness of Irish Catholicism , and thereby subserve the cause of true religion . The writer regards the Protestant establishments in Ireland as military colonies , and the English as the true strangers there , who ought to leave the country , // if unable to live there according to justice . At the close of the pamphlet he is led into some severe , but not harsh , strictures on the very imperfect clerical education of that day , to which he attributes much of the bigoted opposition to concession . He recurs to this subject in the introduction to the third volume of Sermons , published in 1834 . We wish we had room for the excellent plan of study he has drawn up for a young clergyman . He could not tolerate a narrow professional training . He would readily abandon many favorite works on controverted points , that the student might devote himself to his Bible and the masterpieces of ancient and modern genius . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull arid Pearson , if he is thus enabled to become more intimately familiar with Bacon and Aristotle . " He would require such a practical knowledge of the ways and wants of the poor , and the great economical and social questions of the day , as should make him a preacher to the men of his own time . His remarks are particularly interesting , because they afford us a good representation of his own course of study and style of preaching . The Letters on the Social Condition of the Operative Classes were published in 1831-2 . They are characterized by the same sense of impending danger , which was so prominent in the pamphlet on Church Reform . On this subject his feelings were interested to a degree hardly conceivable , except by those who knew his intense patriotism and his lively sympathy with the poor . t was with anguish of spirit that he used to speak and write of the social evils of his country . The phantom of the misery of the lower classes broke into his peaceful retirement and haunted his dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original suggestions are made by him , nor does he appear to place much confidence in specific remedies . He felt the want of a total renovation of society , and particularly of a change in the relation between the poor and the rich . He deplores the tendency towards the division of society into employers and employed , particularly in the great manufacturing towns . " A man , " he says , " sets up a factory , and wants hands . Observe the very expressions that are used , for they arc all significant . What he wants of his fellow-creatures is the loan of their hands , - of their heads and hearts he thinks nothing . " He hopes something from an increased sense of responsibili // ty on the part of the aristocracy and the church ; but how faint that hope became is apparent enough in his later correspondence , where he treats the great social problem in England as one of frightful and even desperate difficulty . One passage is so characteristic of his manner , that we quote it at length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheffield , and looking over the magnificent domain of Lord Fitzwilliam , I have often heard my companions exclaim against the steam-engine chimneys which , in various parts of the view , were sending up into the air their columns of smoke ; but I have always said in answer : Those unsightly chimneys , and that disfiguring smoke , are a most wholesome balance to the palace , and the gardens , and the woods of Wentworth . Were it not for them , England would be no better than Russia or Poland , - we should be the mere serfs of a territorial aristocracy . ' And what if a companion of another sort were to exclaim against the aristocratical pride of Wentworth House , and against the useless costliness of keeping up the churches of Ecclesfield and Rotherham ? I should say to him as heartily and truly , - That park and mansion , and those churches , are a most wholesome balance to the chimneys of the iron furnaces . Were it not for them , we should be without two of the greatest means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - we should be in danger of becoming what the French sometimes falsely call us , a nation of buyers and sellers . But as it is , let all work together , and all do their duty , and we have the means of arriving at the happiest and highest state of society that the world has ever yet witnessed . " - pp. 432 , 433 . From Dr. Arnold 's edition of Thucydides , the Essay on the Social Progress of States , published originally as an appendix to the first volume , and the preface to the third volume , have been extracted for this miscellany . The first of these is distinguished by the author 's peculiar tact , which we have already noticed , in analyzing social states and relations , and tracing the rise and fall , the perturbations and transpositions of public parties . One of his favorite ideas , that the separation of history into ancient and modern ought to he rather a philosophical than a chronological division , and that every state may have its ancient and modern period , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps in the history of the progress of the states of antiquity from the modern annals of the city of Augsburg . A part of the volume is devoted to a sketch of the plan of // study pursued at Rugby , and a defence of classical education . We have also the noted paper in vindication of the English practice of fogging . On a previous occasion , however , we have dwelt at such length upon his character as a schoolmaster , that we can now only refer our readers to that article . Here we will but quote the following passage in illustration of his views of corporal punishment . Corporal punishment , ' it is said , is degrading . ' I well know of what feeling this is the expression ; it originates in that proud notion of personal independence , which is neither reasonable nor Christian , hut essentially barbarian . It visited Europe in former times with all the curses of the age of chivalry , and is threatening us now with those of Jacobinism . For so it is , that the evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source - namely , from selfish pride - from an idolatry of personal honor and dignity in the aristocratical form of the disease - of personal independence in its modern and popular form . It is simply impatience of inferiority and submission - a feeling which must be more frequently wrong or nght , in proportion to the relative situation and worthiness of him who entertains it , but which can not be always or generally right except in beings infinitely more perfect than man . Impatience of inferiority felt by a child towards his parents , or by a pupil towards his instructers , is merely wrong , because it is at variance with the truth : there exists a real inferiority in the relation , and it is an error , a fault , a corruption of nature , not to acknowledge it .
