Hoffman , Charles Fenno , 1806-1884 : IMPROMPTU . from Impromptu ( 1848 ) 1 Ah , Blanche , I care not what they say of Flora  --  2 Those musty pedants all begrimed with ink so  --  3 The flowers ne'er found their priestess and adorer 4 Till thou and I were in the fields to think so ! 5 Talk they of " time ? " Who " notes " it more than we do , 6 When blowing " four-o-clocks " whole days together ? 7 And our sweet learning , like " the busy bee , " do 8 We not treasure , love , for life 's cold winter weather ? 9 Let the vile crowd then " improve each shining hour , " 10 Wringing earth 's dross from hardy hands that till it ; 11 I 'll " gather honey from each opening flower " 12 While Blanche 's lips are near me to distil it !
