txt " THE Mississippi Bonds must be paid " - were the opening words of the first article in the first number of this Review for the present year . " The Mississippi Bonds must be paid " - we repeat , after bestowing upon the subject the most attentive revision of our former conclusions , for which the materials have been laid before us in the two pamphlets cited at the foot of this page . Be the cost of entertaining and expressing the opinion what it may - in the resentment of friends , and in the loss of our subscribers , in that section , the number of whom withdrawing their subscriptions since the publication of that article , we shall not even take the trouble of summing up - we reiterate a third time the declaration of our conviction , that " tlz e .

" Our country ! " was Decatur 's famous sentiment- " may she always be right !  --  but our country , right or wrong ! " The Report of the select committee to which the subject was referred in the Mississippi Legislature , drawn by its chairman , James E. Matthews , Esq. , goes over the same ground in rather more elaborate detail , and contains the replies of the Gov . M'Nutt , Gov .

The following resolution exhibits the conclusion to which the committee arrives . What may have been the action of the Legislature upon it , has not , at the date of the present page , reached us . " Resolved , therefore , by the Legislature of the State of Mississippi , Tisat for the reasons set forth in the foregoing Report , this Legislature denies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to redeem the five millions of Bonds , sold by the Commissioners of the Mississippi Union Bank to Nicholas Biddle , on the 18th day of August , 1838 . But while this Legislature does most solemnly repudiate said Bonds , and declare the sale thereof as illegal , fraudulent , and unconstitutional , yet , that the holders of those Bonds may have every possible legal and equitable remedy for collecting the amount paid on said Bonds , they are hereby invited to pursue the remedy afforded by our laws and constitution against the Mississippi Union Bank , and against all and every person , who , by his , her , or their connexion with said institution , have rendered him , her , or themselves liable , either in law or equity , for the debts of said Bank . " Whether the State of Mississippi shall ever see fit to repudiate this repudiation or not , we trust that , at any rate , none of these unfortunate creditors who have been led into their present position , by their reliance upon the faith of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an evil hour induced to purchase , will be tempted to a further ruin , by any judicial pursuit of the " Mississippi Union Bank , " or any of the persons connected with that respectable institution  --  the former being notoriously as bankrupt in its resources as any of the latter in character . That our readers may judge for themselves of the opposite points of view in which the course of the State is regarded by at least a portion of its own citizens , and the general public opinion of other sections of the Union , we select the following extracts from these two documents . The following is tile conclusion of the report of the committee " The Committee , in coming to the foregoing conclusion , are aware that they differ from many worthy men in opinion . But they can not believe but that , if this subject be examined , free from all party influences , and determined by an application of the principles of law and morals to the facts , any other conclusions can be arrived at than those which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views as to the true principles of this government , as well as of the facts in this case , men have taken the liberty of slandering the State , both at home and abroad , on account of the stand she has taken . It was so at that memorable era when our fathers leagued together , and pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor , ' to resist an unconstitutional invasion of their rights as British subjects . They , also , were slandered . Every opprobrious epithet was heaped upon them that the ingenuity or malice of their enemies could invent . Many of their fellow-citizens , under mistaken views of the principles upon which they acted , denounced them as disorganizers , agrarians , and rebels , // and joined their encmies to force them into submission to an unconstitutional law . The result of the memorable and eventful contest that ensued is now known . The decision of the civilized world has been had as to the correctness of the principles and conduct of that much-abused , and slandered , but noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they maintained the position they assumed , and have transmitted to their posterity their principles , together with the rich inheritance of Liberty , secured by a well-regulated and constitutional government . Their names are stamped on the pages of immortality , and their memory is embalmed in the hearts and affections of a grateful people ; and distant generations will pronounce with exultation the names of Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Hancock , Franklin , and a host of worthies who struggled together through that gloomy period in our history . The people of Mississippi have taken a similar stand . They are not controlled by selfish or mercenary motives . The low and grovelling consideration of dollars and cents has nothing to do with the merits of this question . Their honest obligations they will fulfil , should they have to divest themselves of the comforts and necessaries of life to do so . Higher and holier motives than mere pecuniary considerations actuate them . They have determined that they never will submit to an invasion of their constitution by either foreign or domestic foes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain at all hazards And relying on the correctness of their principles and the justness of their cause , they will , with confidence and cheerfulness , submit to the verdict of posterity . " And the following is the conclusion of the speech of Mr. Thompson , on the floor of the House of Representatives " Sir , said Mr. T. , I have looked forward to a glorious destiny for this country . I have imagined , in contemplating the future history of these twenty-six States , to be increased in number as we drive back the savage , and subject the earth to the ploughshare , that we have been a people peculiarly favored , to convince and illustrate to the world that man is capable of self-government ; but unless these States adhere to cardinal first principles , I feel that we never will carry out and realize the great results anticipated by the philanthropist and patriot . To secure life , liberty , and property to every individual in the community , constitutions are formed by the people themselves , limiting the power of their agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other governments , ancient or modern , the legislative authority , I care not under what form it existed , had unlimited control over the rights of the mass . We have made one great step in the march of the destiny which awaits mankind , by adopting written constitutions as the muniments of the people 's rights . " Every infraction of this constitution by those intrusted with power , necessarily violates some of the rights of life , liberty , or property ; and whenever the people shall be brought tamely to submit to these infringements of right , I care not from what motive it may proceed - it may be from ignorance , or for the want of nerve to face down the frowns of the interested , or from want of vigilance to detect the unwarranted assumption of power , - that moment liberty receives a shock , life is rendered insecure , and the rights of property confounded . Obsta principiis , is a sound maxim in morals , but as useful and indispensable in constitutional governments . Let the people rebuke every assumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their agents act without authority , it is the act of the agents , and not of themselves - an act without authority , and therefore is null and void . They owe it to themselves and the institutions they have // inherited , to preserve an eternal vigilance . They owe it to posterity to check and set aside every ag*ression , and to hand down their fundamental law untouched by unholy hands , unimpaired , in full force , as the ark of their political salvation . If their courage fail them , if they are frowned down and insolently told that dishonor awaits those who call in question the acts of their rulers , and thus they submit , they prove themselves degenerate sons of their ancestors , unworthy to be freemen , and will inevitably invoke the curses of an injured posterity . If , therefore , the agents of the State of Mississippi made and disposed of her bonds in defiance of her constitution and laws - if they contracted debt without her consent - will not every honest community - will not every friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - will not justice and expediency alike forbid the submission of her people to taxation for their payment ? " Mr. Chairman , I rejoice that my destiny has been cast in that State . It was not my position by birth , it was so from choice . When years had ripened me into manhood , and I found this extended and prosperous country spread out before me , the soil , the climate , the resources of that State , - the energy , enterprise , honor , and integrity of her people , invited me to pitch my tent among them . And this day , I feel prouder of that people than I ever felt before . Difficult is the task in a free country to call the minds of the people from their various pursuits , and induce them to discuss and decide upon their constitutional rights . They are more disposed to submit to the acts of their agents than to rise up and call them in question . There is an aversion to the discussion of abstract questions , and few have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due appreciation of their constitutional rights . But from the late action of the State of Mississippi , I feel a renewed , a deeper confidence in the intelligence , the honor , the firmness , and patriotism of that people . Frowned upon at home by those who denied their power to inquire into their rights , denounced and misrepresented by their enemies from abroad , they have gone on in the even tenor of their ways , seeking truth and asserting right . And I am now prepared to say to the friends of liberty , of the rights of freemen , of constitutional government , everywhere , Stand firm - be of good cheer . Here is a people who will extend to you sympathy , and succor , and effective aid . Doubt not their courage , their honor , or their willingness . Let the hour and the necessity come , and Mississippi would go forward and take as bold a stand in asserting the rights of mankind , in resisting oppression , in vindicating the integrity of constitutions , as any other State in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution is endangered , or our rights of property invaded , and she will never sleep upon her arms . Let this nation be assailed , and its flag be insulted , and she would be foremost in the ranks of its defenders . " She was a younger member of this confederacy ; but when only a Territory , and her citizens few in number , they tarried not when their country called : but , headed by the lamented Hinds , they acted with such bravery and chivalrous daring at the battle of New Orleans , as to excite the astonishment of one army and the admiration of the other . ' If the rights of the nation should be again invaded , she would be the first to make the heaviest sacrifices for the common cause . Mississippi is one of the largest exporting States of this Union , and if war comes , it will fall heaviest on her . Yet I do not believe there is within her borders a single individual who is not prepared to sacrifice her great agricultural and commercial interests , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through some severe trials . While the credit system was considered a blessing , and others were sipping of its delicious and intoxicating poison , she slaked her thirst with eager haste , and drained the cup to its very // dregs . Exhilaration followed ; for the hour , there was the feast of reason and the flow of soul . ' The hectic flush upon her cheek was mistaken for the rich crimson of health and beauty . The life currents coursed rapidly through her veius , and gave a charm to being , which cast its rainbow tiuts on all surrounding nature . She walked in grandeur - the wonder , the admiration , the envy of all . The excitement grew higher and higher . Flattered and caressed on all sides , she was deemed the fairest of the fair , the loveliest of the lovely , the proudest of the proud . Wherever her citizens travelled abroad , they were the observed of all observers . ' Each one was considered a hero , of princely fortune and princely liberality . The dealer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit , aided and connived at him in his prodigality and irregularity , and quailed at his frown . But the fatal hour came , foretold and foreseen , indeed , by some of the wise and considerate , but well nigh forgotten by all in the general intoxication . Her overstrained nerves gave way , and prostration ensued . Then were seen the awful contortions of the limbs , and the wild ilashings of the eye , which betokened madness , and presaged death . The alarmed Executive called together the legislative doctors , and bade them in their wisdom consult , and speedily administer the healing balm , or dissolution was inevitable . They did consult , and they determined that , as the patient was sinking , more stimulant must be procured , and speedily applied . The Constitution , the bulwark of the freedom of the citizen , intended to guard his rights in this hour of trial and temptation , stood in the way ! With more benevolence than wisdom , they leaped its barriers , and drenched the sufferer with a copious draught of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , and the writhings were more distressing . At last the physician 's skill and the physician 's medicine were exhausted , and no further reliance was placed in artificial means . The patient was told that she must trust for recovery to the strength and vigor of her constitution , and to her natural resources . From that hour she felt more calm and easy , and recovery commenced . The improvement has been slow , but progressive ; still she feels debilitated and enfeebled ; but all look forward to an early and complete restoration . The only precaution required in her condition is a total abstinence from that intoxicating poison which caused her disaster . In recurring to the past , she feels mortified and chagrined at her excesses ; and , in returning to a state of soundness , her first and highest duty is to herself . Restore a bleeding prostrate constitution , which has been trampled under foot . She will CCC To her own self be true ; And it must follow , as the night the day , She can not then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt prouder of Mississippi this day than I ever felt before . I have seen her people tried , and I know them . Too proud to acknowledge themselves insolvent , too firm and too proud to submit to a violation of their rights - regardless of the strokes of calumniators , they take their stand , and appeal , as our ancestors did , to a candid world , and an impartial posterity for support . Every true-hearted Mississippian feels proud of his State . She has forty thousand freemen who are readYto risk all , to sacrifice everything for her honor and her rights . Warmed by a southern sun , fanned by a southern breeze , fed upon a generous soil , our hearts are entwined around our noble State , and we grapple her to our bosom with hooks of steel .

It is praise enough to satisfy the ambition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to say , Mississippi is my home . " VOL . X. , No . XLVI. - 47 // Such are the views and feelings with which distinguished Mississippians themselves regard the recent course of their State , which , we regret to say , has elsewhere elicited a very different tone of opinion . We have been invited and challenged to review our former conclusions in relation to this question , and cheerfully perform the task , though having before us only the ex-parte statement of it , to be found in the two productions above referred to . It may safely be affirmed that together they constitute the most complete vindication of the other side of the case , which its friends can put forth . We have examined them attentively , but in vain , for any reason on which to found a change of our former views . As this is a question second to none in importance that now engages the public attention , we shall make no apology to our readers for again entering into its discussion in a somewhat more full detail . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed-namely first , the unconstitutionality of the well known supplementary law of Feb. 15th , 1838 ; secondly , the violation of the essential requisitions of that law itself in the sale of the bonds to Mr. Biddle . In considering these , we will reverse the order in which they are here stated . It is certainly true , that , in the sale of the bonds , the three commissioners on the part of the bank , Messrs . Wilkins , Wilkinson , and Pinckard , were either most egregiously taken in by the eminent " financier " above named , who now enjoys so deserved apopularity with his own quondam political and pecuniary worshippers , or that they were guilty of a disgraceful and dishonest violation of the law under which they were acting . Their only choice lies between the alternatives of being regarded as the most consummate of knaves or of fools . It appears that after trying in vain to sell their stocks in New York , the market price of such stocks being eight or ten per cent . below the rate to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address Mr. Biddle a note , offering them to him , and proposing to make them payable in England at the rate of four and sixpence to the dollar , or ? 450 to every bond of $2000 . Now , four and sixpence they must have known to be equal at the true par of exchange not to $ 1,00 , but to $1 , 09* , and ? 450 , not to $2000 , but to $2189,92 . That Mr. Biddle accepted their offer by a prompt note of reply , on the same day , will hardly be a matter of surprise . Nor need we have recourse to the liberal motive attributed to him by the commissioners , of a desire to aid the State of Mississippi to a resumption of specie payments , to understand why he was thus ready and // quick to take these astute negotiators at their word . Another advantage was also conceded to Mr. Biddle , namely , that whereas the bonds were to be immediately delivered , the current interest on them dating back to June 7 , 1838 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , payable the first in November , 1838 , and the others in January , March , May , and July , 1839 . This sale on credit gave Mr. Biddle , of course , the advantage of the difference of interest within that interval on all that remained unpaidan amount stated by the committee at $145,993 45 . The total amount of loss on the transaction which would be sustained by this item of interest , and on the future payment of interest and principal at the sterling rate above referred to , the committee compute at $1,091,254 55 . Gov . M'Nutt , in his letter to Hope &amp; Co. , stated it at $l , ' 84,781 00 . The payment , by Mr. Biddle , ( acting on behalf of the Bank of the United States , ) consisted in $1,000,000 in specie , $150,000 in notes of the Merchant 's Bank of New Orleans , and the remainder , $3,850,000 , in exchange upon New Orleansthat is to say , in the privilet*e of dra*ving upon that place to that amount , at the times specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that being the point to which the funds were to he transferred The calculation of the commissioners was , that the premium on these drafts would more than cover the loss of the back interest . In point of fact , such was not the case , the amount of those premiums having been only $86,667 19 , falling short of the amount of back interest , as above stated , by the sum of $59,326 26 . One of the commissioners , in his testimony before the committee , declares , that " an inspection of the books of the Union Bank will , in part , verify the soundness of this calculation , when it is yen capable of proof , that the exchange operations of the Bank were not managed with all the advantages of profit that might have been expected . " On the whole , then , the Bank realized , at Jackson , the amount of $5,086,667 19 , on the sale of the bonds-in what was then universally , in that region , understood as " current money of the United States ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the small loss of the excess of the back interest over the premiums on the exchange , as offering any sufficient basis for the repudiation of the Bonds by the State , on the ground of the violation of the " par value " requisition of the charter . It is true , indeed , that according to the true standard by which toe would measure the " par value in current money of the United States , " and by which it ought always and everywhere to be measured-namely , the constitutional currency of gold and silver  --  the amount thus received by the Bank , in the local currency , for which it sold its drafts on New Orleans , including its own // depreciated post-notes , fell doubtless considerably short of the just and full sum of five millions . Yet a fair allowance ought to be made for the general sense in which these expressions were understood at the time , and in the bank-besotted section referred to . As remarked in our former article on this subject , we all know that extremely vague and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meaning of that little monosyllable . " Par " has had a very different meaning with the one of our political parties than with the other . With the Whigs , including a great majority of the commercial community , the current value of a suspended bank-note circulation has constituted the local standard of " par , " while specie has been said to be at a greater or less " premium ; " while with the Democratic party , the currency of the constitution and the world , the precious metals , have alone afforded the standard level , from which the depreciation of the respective paper circulations have been measured downward . We can not perceive in this feature of the transaction , taken even in its strongest shape , a just and honorable ground for the proposed repudiation . The conversion of the bonds into sterling at the rate of 4s. 6d. to the dollar , by the endorsement on them , was certainly very improper on the part of the commissioners . Being a sacrifice from the face of the bonds of about 9* per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the depreciation of their stocks below par , according to the market price at the time , which , they say , was from 8 to 10 per cent . They were governed by their anxiety to sell the stocks , so as to start the bank ; and this was doubtless the highest price they could get for them . Mississippi would probably have been too hot to hold them , had they returned from their mission without the money . For Mr. Biddle , who intended to pay the greater part of his purchase money in the funds " current " at New Orleans , it was , " per se , " a capital operation . Yet , this fact alone , however it may subject these individuals to censure , would scarcely justify the State 's repudiation of the bonds according to their face , which was in the form of the United States currency . The endorsement , by which each bond was virtually raised from $2,000 to $2,189 92 , ( as above shown , ) was the act of the Bank ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder , yet could not extend the liability of the State beyond its own promise , as stated on the face of the bond . This remark is , of course , equally applicable to the periodical interest payable on them . How this circumstance can , justly or honorribly , be strained into a justification to the State to repudiate the *vhole-* -- -its own promise to pay the $2,000 *n the face of the // bond , as well as the Bank 's endorsement to pay $189 92 more - we are at a loss to understand . On the whole , then , it appears that the Repudiation argument can not find an adequate foundation in the second of the two principal grounds above referred to , namely , the violation of the essential requisitions of the law , ( the Supplementary Act of January 15 , 1838 , ) in the sale of the bonds to Mr. Biddle . It remains for us to ascend to the higher ground of the constitutionality of that law itself , by virtue of which the bonds were executed and sold . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laid by the committee and by Mr. Thompson . The constitutional argument against the payment of the bonds by the State , is this : - The Constitution of the State ( ninth section of the seventh article ) declares , that no law shall ever be passed " to raise a loan of money upon the credit of the State , or to pledge the faith of the State , for the payment or redemption of any loan or debt , " without the express approval of two successive Legislatures ; with provision for the publication of the same in three newspapers of the State , for three months previous to the next regular election after the first passage of the law . This requisition was duly complied with in the passage of the act " to incorporate the subscribers to the Mississippi Union Bank ; " which was originally passed at the session of 1837 , submitted to the people by the proper publication , and re-enacted , so as to become a law , on February 5 , 1838 . This act provided for an issue of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the amount of $15,500,000 , to furnish the capital for its operations . This loan was to be secured by a prior subscription of a corresponding amount to the stock of the Bank ; such subscriptions being confined to citizens and owners of real estate in Mississippi , secured by mortgages to the satisfaction of the directors , and accompanied by payment of ten per cent . of their amount , if the same should be called for by the directors-though this ten per cent . was to be refunded with interest , as soon as the cash proceeds of the Bonds of the State should be realized . The profits of the Bank were to afford a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds-that is to say , the whole profits for the first ten years , and three-fourths after that period ; the other fourth going to the stockholders . After the payment of the whole of the bonds , ten per cent . of the profits were to be paid at certain times into the State treasury , and the State was to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into operation as soon as $500,000 should be subscribed , the Governor thereon appointing , provisionally , thirteen directors , to hold their office for a year . The important // feature ought not to be omitted , that each stockholder was to be entitled to a credit in the Bank to the amount of half of his shares . It will thus be seen that this was to be substantially a Stale Bank , the State furnishing the money capital in the shape of its bonds ; being itself nominally secured , in doing so , by mortgages on the property of its own citizens , to the amount of the face of its bonds . This was one of the great " relief " measures of the time , for the benefit of the great staple interest of the State , to keep up the falling price of cotton . Within ten days after , however , it was concluded that the law in that shape would not answer . Probably it was found that individuals could not subscribe , under the obligation to pay up ten per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , even though the same was to be again refunded to them . A " Sup* pleinentary Act " was passed by the same Legislature , changing the mode or form in which the substance of the transaction took place , and making the State itself a direct subscriber to $5,000,000 of the stock of the Bank , leaving the other $10,500,000 to stand on the same basis as before ; that is to say , the further stock to be issued on the subscription of corresponding amounts by individuals , with the mortgages as stated above . The profits on this $5,000,000 were to be applied for the benefit of the State , to purposes of internal improvement and the promotion of popular education . It is now contended - and we think justly - that this " supplenientary act was a violation of the constitutional provision above cited . It made a material change of the law which had been submitted to the people . It altered the relation of the State to the Bank , and varied those conditions of prior security which it may be presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ought not to have been passed . It ought to have been vetoed by Governor M'Nutt . It ought not to have been carried into execution by him . It was opposed by a minority in the Legislature , at whose head was Mr. Tucker , the present Governor of the State , and its repugnance to the Con stitution denounced . In our former article , we stated that a formal pro* test against the law on this ground was entered by the minority . Such was our impression , though we infer from the silence , both of Mr. Thompson and of the committee , on this point , that it must have been erroneous . So far as it went , the error affected the Anti-Bond argument only to strengthen it . The question then arises , whether this violation of the Consti* // tution was so material as to justify , under the circumstances , the proposed repudiation . It was not . It decidedly was a violation of the strict letter of the restric ' tion referred to . It was also not less decidedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood by any one disposed to a fine and high sense of constitutional duty . But it is very certain that it was not generally understood at the time as so clear a case of gross unconstitutionality as it is now regarded-now that the Bonds are gone ! Else why did Governor M'Nutt sign it ? * Why did he carry it into execution l - he who , according to his own testimony before the committee , ( page 33 , ) " did not recommend either the original or the supplementary charter of the Bank , " who " opposed the charter in 1835 and 1836 , " and whose " vote is recorded against the charter in January , 1837 , on the journals of the Senate . " All that Governor MNutt says himself on this point is , very coolly - when we remember the subsequent lead taken by him in the Repudiation movement that " when I approved that act , ( the supplementary act of Feb. 15th , 1838 , ) I had strong doubts as to its constitutionality and expediency . I yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was warranted in pursuing that course by the precepts of Mr. Jefferson , and all the illustrious fathers of the republican party ; " - and again : " Although opposed to the prin* ciples of both acts , I did not , under the circumstances , feel *varranted in vetoing either . " In the name of " Mr. Jefferson , and all the illustrious fathers of the republican party , " we can not let such an insult to their memory pass without an emphatic repudiation ' of it . To charge that any one of that holy fellowship ' ever penned or spoke a precept , which would palliate the conduct of a Governor who could sign and carry into execution a law clearly , flagrantly , and grossly in violation of his constitutional oath , and then , within a couple of years , and perhaps with the same pen , put forth , on the very ground of its unconstitutionality , a repudiation of the pledge of public faith thereby contracted ,  --  - to make such a charge as this , we say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nant ghosts of the great dead , to frown upon its author the terrible scorn with which , if living , they would have been the first to de . ' nounce his act . No ; they never uttered such a precept , for they never could have anticipated that such a principle could ever be thus invoked - such an act ever perpetrated in practice - in the land to which they bequeathed their own sacred memory , as the best palladium to secure the perpetuity of the freedom they fought for , and the institutions they founded . // We would by no means be understood as applying to other Mississippians who may advocate repudiation , the opinion of which the expression is thus extorted from a just indignation , at this prostitution of the names of " Jefferson and all the illustrious fathers of the republican party , " by Governor M'Nutt . Others may perhaps assume and maintain this ground - he , at least , can not thus plead his own wrong and his own shame . On the contrary , we believe fully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We regard the Anti-Bond party as misled by a confused complexity in the question at issue , and by a natural and rightful indignation at the abominable frauds of which the State has unwisely and unguardedly allowed itself to be made the victim . It is because we entertain this faith in the people of the State that we have before stated , what we fearlessly repeat , our firm assurance that these bonds will yet be recognised and paid , from the teeming treasures which every year developes from their prolific soil . But to return to the point from which we have been thus tempted a little aside . It certainly was not generally understood at the time as so clear a case of gross unconstitutionality as it is *iow regarded-now that the bonds are gone ! The main proposition , of furnishing the capital to the bank by the pledge of the State credit , to the amount of $ 1*,5OO , OOO , had been ratified by the people . The false and morbid public opinion generally prevalent at that time in Mississippi regarded the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " relief , " but of salvation . It was believed that its profits were to be very great . It was to save the tottering cotton interest . The privilege of subscription to its stock was restricted with a patriotic jealousy and exclusiveness , not alone to the mere owners of real estate in Mississippi , but to actual citizens of the State . It was not till the expiration of five years , that the former were even to be entitled to receive it in transfer from the latter . Every subscriber was , as we have seen , to be entitled to a credit in the bank to the amount of half his stock-a credit to be repaid only by the most gentle and gradual process of instalments . The State was all agog ' for the establishment of the Bank . If there were no other evidence of this , it would be sufficiently found in the fact that Governor M'Nutt , with all his former opposition to it , and his present " strong doubts as to its constitutionality and expediency , " did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is easy to conceive the process of reasoning by which both the Legislature and Governor jus* tified to their own minds the constitutionality of their act in making such subsequent variation of the mode in which the State // credit , thus authorized , was to be applied to the object in view , as they deemed best conducive to its efficiency-as in fact necessary to its attainment at all . They doubtless knew that the act would have been as readily ratified in the one form as in the other , by the general public opinion whose prevalence they reflected . They knew , too , that there was nothing material , in point of precedent security to the State , in the provision requiring the payment of ten per cent . on the subscription of stock by individual citizens ; because that was to be paid only if called for by the directors , and on the realization of the proceeds of the bonds of the State was to be refunded with interest . They knew , too , that even the mortgages which were to accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress is laid as a condition precedent to the issue of the bonds , did not after all amount to much , by way of security to the State , inasmuch as each individual subscriber , as above stated , was to receive back half of the amount of his stock or mortgage , in the shape of a credit in the Bank . We , therefore , see little to sur prise us , in the fact , that neither the Governor nor the Legislature of 1838 , under the full sway of the paper-money infatuation of the day , saw , in the Supplementary Act in question , any very essential variation from the spirit and intent of the original act , of which the former was rather a change of form than of substance . Here , then , we come to a point made in our last article on this subject , and on which we feel bound to insist . A legislature representing the People , is. at least to a certain extent , the authoritative judge of its own constitutional powers , until a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mode established by the constitution . The relation is a closer one between the People and their legislature , than between an individual and his delegated private agent , notwithstanding the analogy in many respects subsisting between the two . In the latter case the principal and his agent are t*vain-two separate persons , liable to legal account to each other - in that light regarded by third parties , so as to awaken , naturally and habitually , a prudent caution in dealing with the agent which carries with it its own proper responsibility . But in the former case , the People and their elective legislature or government are not in the same sense twain ; the government is thePeople , embodied , concentrated , represented , if not to all intents and purposes , yet still so far at least as to create a higher degree of equitable responsibility on the part of the one for the acts of the other . So the world are accustomed to regard them in theory , and to deal with them in practice . For the People to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature , // on the ground of a transgression of delegated power , would be nearly analogous , if not identical , with the act of an individual pleading his own past wrong to his present interest  --  the borrower , for example , " repudiating " the debt on which he had himself tempted the lender ( perhaps unconsciously on the part of the latter ) to take usury . We are accustQmed to speak of an unconstitutional law as being " null and void . " In public equity and moral right , even if not in strict technicality of legal effect , this expression must sometimes be understood with a qualification . S&amp; far as it may act prejudicially to the rights of a third party , the act may be declared by the judiciary " null and void . " If the people , by an unconstitutional law , passed by their representative government , injure me or any right of mine , I may treat the law as a nullity and any public officer , or any other individual , may at his peril and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually prove indeed unconstitutional , disregard it and set it at naught . But if by such a law , uncontradicted by any judicial veto , the government has tempted me into a confidence in its integrity , it can not rightfully at a subsequent day declare the law a nullity from its inception to its benefit and my ruin . It can not " rightfully , " we say - and in such questions the phrase means that it can not in the true and proper sense of the word , at all . And before concluding upon this point , we would complete its statement by the following quotation from our January number , though at the expense of a repetition which we regret : " Their act was an expression of their own judgment that it was constitutional ; and representing , as they did by their majority , the people of the State , it is too much to expect that the foreign creditor , when in the act of lending his money , should undertake to revise and overrule their decision upon a point of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities , to the people and their own oath of office . Faithfully and honestly or not - yet actually it can not be denied that they represented the people ; and the doctrine would be absurd , that when in the interval between the passage of a law , of perhaps disputed constitutionality , and a judicial decision to that effect , equitable rights have arisen under its operation , involving the public faith to innocent private parties , a subsequent change of majority should justify the Legislature in repudiating all such obligations , on the ground of the different view now taken by it of the constitutional question . A legislative body must stand as the sole authoritative judge of its own constitutional powers , until the action of the judiciary supervene , in some controversy of private rights . And though a law may of course be declared void for unconstitutionality , as affecting injuriously the rights of others ; yet it would be monstrous to claim for the people of a State , as represented and embodied in its regularly constituted Legislature , the right themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiate , to their own benefit and the injury of innocent third parties , obligations assumed by them with all the solemn formality of an act of legislation , claiming to be for an object of public interest , and in the very act positively asserting its own constitutionality . They // can not thus take advantage of the dishonesty or ignorance , as the case may be , of their own elected representatives . If they will be guilty of the folly of sending such a set of men to their legislative halls , they must for the present submit to the consequences for which they have themselves chiefly to blame , and for the future profit well by the experience for which they have been thus made to pay . " And even if the distinction thus taken between the relation of a principal and his agent and that of a people and its elected representative government be not admitted , yet we might then ask , where were those expressions of dissent on the part of the people , on which alone the repudiation of the act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private relation , if the principal stands quietly by , and with a full knowledge of the transgress ion of delegated power by which his agent is tempting the confidence of a third party-by an operation , too , purporting at least to be for the benefit of the principal himself-if he does not protest against the act so as to give timely warning to those about to be thus imposed upon , he becomes himself particeps criminis ; his silence gives consent ; and certainly so far at least ratifies the act as to estop him from any future " repudiatioa " of it , if the hopes of benefit on which it is based should be ultimately disappointed . Where were the popular meetings to denounce the act , and give notice that it would not be recognised *i Where did the Press , now so loud in its thunders of " Repudiation , " then bury its bolts l Where were the public addresses by the leading politicians , now so vehement in their eloquence i Where were all those many modes of the manifestation of Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that popular dissent which would have forewarned the too trusting foreign capitalist , and which might have justified a subsequent popular refusal to recognise the act * Where were they all then-then ? The Legislature ( the same body of men , indeed , though fresh from a recent intercourse with their constituents ) reassembled in January , 1839 , and , as Mr. Thompson states , sanctioned the sale of the bonds by the commissioners , involving of course a sanction of their issuance . It was not till July 14* , 1844 , that the doctrine of Repudiation was announced to the world ,  --  and then by the very last man in the world from whom it should have proceeded , Governor M'Nutt . We hav2 nowhere seen it advanced that even a minority of the Legislature of 1839 made any movement of Repudiation which might at least have served as a notice of intention . And yet , at the time of their assemblage , only one or two millions , of the five for which the bonds had been sold , had yet been paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be made running , as has been seen above , through tll* // summer of that year . And again , after another popular election , the Legislature of 1840 assembled , nor did any such movement or intimation proceed from it . On the contrary , the remaining ten and a half millions of stock having been issued by the Governor to the Bank in 1839 , after the completion of the subscriptions required by the charter , no step was taken by the Legislature to arrest the Bank in its unconstitutional career ; and it was only by a proclamation of the Governor , of March 2d , 1840 , forbidding any attempt to hypothecate them or sell them on a credit , or for paper money , or other depreciated paper securities , that the further disposition of five millions more was prevented . It is too late , then , we repeat , for the people of Mississippi to " repudiate " the moral and equitable obligation of these bonds , whatever subtly spun argumentsupon legal forms and technicalities her ingenious lawyers may make in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature , or on the floors of that of the Union . The Anti-Bond argument labors also to show that the State never received or had the use of the money in question ; and in support of this position we find Mr. Thompson saying : " No evidence of stock is found in any of the offices of the State . Not a single dollar has ever been received into the Treasury of the State . Not a dollar has been appropriated by the Legislature , since the sale of the bonds , for the use of the people , or for a governmental purpose . Nor has that body , in any way or manner whatever , controlled or used this money . " This is a piece of sophistical special pleading , altogether below the dignity of a high political question of this character . Though the actual form of a delivery of certificates of stock in the Bank , to any public officer of the State , to the amount of the $5,000,000 of its subscription , may not have been performed , yet the omission was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State as a stockholder to that extent , nor her ability to enforce them . Governor M'Nutt , in his message to the Legislature in 1840 , speaking of the refusal of the Bank to be examined , expressly says : " the State at this time was the sole stockholder . " And Governor Runnels , the late President of the Bank , in reply to an inquiry by the committee on this point , says : " If a certificate of stock by the State has not been issued , it is attributable alone to the fact , that it was not applied for by his Excellency . I am not aware that anything in the charter requires the issuance of stock certificates . The stock was subscribed for by Governor M'Nutt , and paid by the delivery of the State bonds , which were sold as before stated . This subscription and delivery of the bonds , I regarded as sufficient to constitute the State a stockholder , as did Governor M'Nutt in his // Message to the Legislature of January , 1839. - House Journal , page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the money proceeds of the bonds never came into the hands of the Legislature , or any department of the State government-it was simply because the act authorizing their issue simultaneously gave the direction and made the appropriation of their proceeds . The Legislature invested them in a Bank , as a great measure of supposed public good and " relief , " and directed the application of the profits expected from this investment , " for the benefit of the State , to purposes of Internal Improvement and the promotion of education. ** So far as the views of any may be influenced by a regard to the parties between whom this issue lies , it may be proper to refer to the obvious fact that the creditors here concerned are neither Mr. Nicholas Biddle , nor the Bank of the United States , nor even Hope &amp; Co. , in Holland , to whom the bonds were passed . They are the hundreds or thousands of private individuals for whom a large European banking-house of that character acts but as an agent for the investment of their moneyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times these bonds , stamped on their face with the pledge of the faith and honor of one of the republican States of our glorious Union , may have changed hands , we can of course have no means of estimnting . But it requires no unusual sagacity to conjecture what must be the influence on the public mind , on the moral sense , of the civilized world-what must be the disheartening effect on the friends of freedom and America , the exulting pleasure of the foes of the one , and the scoffers of the other-when such an act of Repudiation of that pledged faith and honor , by one of our proud and boasted free democracies , without even the excuse of inability to pay , can be pointed to as the practical fruits by which the tree of popular liberty may be known . It has been said that our interference in this question is an impertinent intrusion into the heart of a matter with which we can claim no rightful concern , as a political question affecting the State of Mississippi alone . Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general estimation of the American character , not only in Europe , but to the uttermost ends of the earth , of its influence on the credit of the heavy securities of many of the other States already outstanding and current , there is another point of view in which the course of the State of Mississippi presents a question of public interest and importance to which we could not , if we would , refuse our most anxious attention . The influence of the false and thrice-accursed " Credit System " which has overshadowed the land with the Upas taint of its atmosphere , has // already exerted a sufficiently lamentable effect to demoralize society , and derange the natural and healthful action of all the relations of life among us , without superadding the fatal influence of a public act of sovereign dishonesty and dishonor , such as we feel ourselves compelled to regard this Mississippi repudiation , if , contrary alike to our hope and our belief , it shall be persisted in by the people of that State . The moral mischief of which the myriad seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn governmental example of this nature , it is impossible to conjecture . This is one of the most important points of view in which the great responsibilities of legislation and government ought always to be regarded . If such an act as this is allowed to pass unrebuked by the offended moral sense of the public opinion of the country , unretracted by the returning reason of its authors , it will soon be found to produce a very distinct effect even on the private character of Mississippians , as well as on the public character of their State . It will generate a disregard of the moral equity of contracts , the main principle of cohesion of all human society , suggesting and justifying perpetual evasions of their essential right and spirit , under the screen of legal technicalities aud subtleties akin to those on which the Repudiation argument is seen to rest in the present case . Nor will this influence be confined to the State of Mississippi . As well might we assign a local limit to any of the great movements of the atmosphere , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flow of the mighty Father of Waters , whose name she ought never to dishonor , is to be observed far forth amid the infinite waves of the ocean , even to a greater distance from its mouth than the backward distance thence to their very original rill . The public opinion of the society in which men live is a sort of moral atmosphere , whose pressure upon their minds to restrain them *vitbin the rules of right is a far greater power than that which , in the physical creation , presses upon their bodies with the force , as science tells us , of fifteen pounds to the square inch . There is no higher social interest , no more important social duty , than that of preserving that vital element of our very existence as a people , in a state as pure and healthy as possible . None of the influential organs of this public opinion throughout the whole length and breadth of the land ought to be silent on such an occasion . So far as regards the Democratic Review , it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duty , alike of patriotism , of morality , and of a true party interest , in the only sense in which it understands the words party and interest . We have received and given due heed to the remonstrances which have been addressed to as , as to the injuri // ous bearing of our course on this question upon the interests of " our party " in the local politics of the State referred to in these discussions . We repel , as a slander upon that name , the imputation that the Democratic Party of Mississippi is the Repudiation Party . Accidental circumstances and temporary delusions may perhaps for a while give some seeming color of justification to the charge . A natural and righteous exasperation against the authors of these great public frauds , and against the system of which they are the natural fruits , coupled with the dexterity of party leaders to catch in their sails every present breath of popular excitement , may perhaps have led a portion of the Democracy of Mississippi into a false position on this occasion . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unwavering reliance we have expressed before on their integrity and honor ; and that at the same time that they will visit with an unforgiving wrath all who , with the taint of the slightest art or part in these abominations , should ever present themselves as candidates for their confidence in any post of public employment , they will never allow the stain of this dishonor long to tarnish the fair escutcheon of their State sovereignty . One word farther , in reply to some personal imputations which have been elicited by our former article on this subject , from some to whom its arguments and views happened to be not exactly acceptable . Though no agreeable task , we are unwilling to omit it . The Democratic Review , with the removal of its place of publication from Washington to New York , has not become imbued with " the contagion of the atmosphere of Wall street . " It is not , nor is ever likely to be , under the slightest control or influence , direct or indirect , of any " clique " or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of State credit generally , or of these Mississippi Bonds in particular , except as a general question of public concern . It has not in this matter either fallen or declined from the former " elevated tone of its democratic principles , " whatever that tone and those principles may before have been , or may be now . It has not imbibed , from its nearer contact to the waves and breezes of the Atlantic , any " foreign sympathies " alien to the cause and the rights of our own country or countrymen . And finally , its former article on this question was not written by either " stockjobber " or " financier ; " but , like the present one , undictated by any other influence than his own sense of right , proceeded alone from the pen , humble and feeble as it may be , of the responsible editor and proprietor of this work , whose name is of course easily accessible to any one desirous of inquiring into so unimportant a piece of information.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
