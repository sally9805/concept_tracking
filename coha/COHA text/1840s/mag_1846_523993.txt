txt are arrayed into an infinite diversity of parties , and represent many and opposite tendencies . Each battles with uncompromising energy for the prevalence of his peculiar views . All is activity , agitation . The mnn who can taise himself above the dust and excitement of the arena , and divest himself of prejudice for either party , will not wish the contest hushed , though he may desire its violence to be somewhat subdued and tempered . lie will not wish any particular element or tendency to become exclusively predominant or to be entirely crushed . Extremes meet ; and the result would be either a transition from one to the other no less restless and . violent than the present fermentation , or else a worse transition to the lethargic quiet of social and political death . The highest glory and the chief hope of safety for our civilization , lie in the fact that it gives free scope to the great leading tendencies of human nature and human society-that it embraces and , to some extent , harmonizes them all . Our political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , the two great antitheses-the conservative and the progressive principles . On their preservation its salvation depends . The destruction of either would be the ruin of the other . And as , among us , unlike the case of the Europeans , the progressive is undoubtedly the strongest tendency , the reflecting friends of true freedom and progress are constantly called upon to lend their aid to the weaker side . But the natural consequence of the complete triumph of ultra-conservatism would be that the nation would at length burst with maddened fury from the strait-jacket imposed on it , and rush into the chaos of perfect anarchy . The cramped and tortured giant would prefer the cold , bare ground of savage lawlessness to the Procrustean bed of antiquity . On the other hand , the complete triumph of the ultra-progressive principle would probably result in a speedy transition to monarchy ; and that monarchy would be despotism , as all past history teaches . We should thus be thrown from all our high and peculiar advantages into the same broad and downward road which others have trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most favorable soil for the rapid progress of civilization , and , with a due limitation and intermixture of the conservative principle and spirit , they would be equally favorable for its mature and permanent growth . And perhaps the ideal of a monarchy  --  a monarchy in which all right liberty should have free scope , vigor and development-might accomplish the same purposes . There is always a vast difference between the ideal and the caricature of a thing . Partisans and controversialist3 look at the ideal of their own side and a caricature of their opponents ' - hence their zeal and violence ; while , if they could exchange the points of view , they would exchange characters also . Monarchists can see only a caricature of democracy-they can not distinguish it from mobocracy ; in like manner , we are apt to look at nothing but a caricature ol monarchy , which is undistinguishable from despotism . But to the ideal of a monarchy , if it could be permanently realized , the democrat could have little objection ; while to the ideal of a democracy , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as little . Indeed , the two ideals will not substantially differ-only each , in its progress towards realization , regards a peculiar set of dangers . The one would guard against licentiousness on the part of the governed , the other against corruption and selfish misrule on the part of the governors  --  and unquestionably both dangers exist . The great question is , which of the two theories is the most practicable ? Monarchy has been tried on a large scale in connection with modern civilization , and has undoubtedly accomplished many valuable purposes ; but it seems incapable of securino* , thoroughly and permanently , the %ighest purposes of civil society . It has been tried and found wanting . There is in the civilized world a very general yearning after a change . The most philosophical observers of Europe see and acknowledge that the democratical tendency is the tendency of the age . It remains to be seen whether democracy can perform the p'urposes in which monarchy has failed . The experiment never has // been and never could be tried , under so favorable circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , it fails for many ages , if not forever . Self-government is not , as has been acutely but sophistically maintained by a late writer in the Democratic Review , a self-contradiction : Rather it is , morally and politically speaking , the highest problem of civilization-for it is , in these respects , the proper self-development of man . it by no means implies the rejection of an external rule , a law and an authority emanating from a source above us , and revealed to us as well as in usit only rejects such a rule and authority as emanating from a source which is not above us . Self-government begins with a reverential recognition of a supreme law : its process is a constant endeavor to render that law objective , real , operative  --  to externalize it , if we may use the term . It evolves the law not as derived from itself , but through itself and to itself from a supreme power . Does not every man who has struggled with temptation and sin know that self-government is no absurdity ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved and re-resolved on reformation in vain , but who , after signing a public pledge , finds himself enabled to persevere , is an instance and an illustration of the nature and importance of that process by which the rule of conduct is conceived of and realized as exterior to ourselves . In the case of the nation that would govern itself , it is no less essential it should recognize this supreme law as paramount to its own will , and the objective rule of its conduct , than in the case of the individual , it is not , indeed , necessary that , according to the philosophy of monarchy , this supreme law should be visibly embodied in some particular person . This is a sort of political idolatry or Grand-Lamaism . But the law must be recognized , realized , submitted to as somewhat independent of the people 's will and sovereign over it . The effort of a free people must ever he to render more dim the consciousness of governing , and more distinct that of being governed . They must think less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties ; otherwise , instead of governing themselves , they will end , at best , in governing one another . A prevailing tendency to declai* against , decry and resist authority is of itself sufficient proof , that , where it exists , self-government does not or will not long exist . It is the part of a slave to contend against the government of another ; it is the part of a freeman to submit to his own . Not only is the posture of resistance to external authority not self-government , hut , more than anything else , long continuance in such a posture unfits for its exercise . It is notorious that slaves just emancipated are most unfit to exercise their freedom , i. e. , they have no use and no power of self-government ; the whole tendency and habit of their minds have been **31;1242;TOOLONG to all that ever was presented to them in the shape of government . If such be the character and such the conditions of self-government , it will be seen that it is not yet thoroughly established among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils to our civilization are connected with the likelihood of a mistake on this point . We must remember that self-government is a thing not only most noble , but also most difficult . We proceed to call attention , therefore , to some of the disadvantages. , dangers and defects of our civilization . They may be grouped under two general heads-our extravagant radical , and our equally extravagant tilitarian , tendencies . Let us begin with our radical tendencies , as being in immediate connection with the business of self-government . We hesitate not to say , there is among us too strong a tendency to reduce all the elements of society to a common level . In calling it " too strong , " we mean to admit and imply that it is a tendency not dangerous in kind-for it is a proper and necessary correction of other and opposite tendencies  --  but we mean also to assert that it may exist , and we believe it does exist , in an exorbitant and dangerous degree . It is a very prey-. alent notion among us that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence in the government and social institutions of the country , without any regard to his progress in intellectual and moral culture . Thus intelligence and ignorance , virtue and vice , are mixed up in one general average . This is a notion which the ignorant and vicious , of course , most greedily embrace and cherish , and its abettors are therefore sure of their support and suifrages . But does the self-government of the individual imply that all his faculties and propensities should have an equal voice in the // forum of his conscience ? Does not every one see at once that such a state were an end of all government ? A selfgoverning man is guided by the light of reason , and ruled by the law of conscience , while the lower principles of his nature are checked , restrained , reduced to obedience . Yet that reason and conscience , as well as those lower principles , are his own-ar* his very self . When a question of duty comes up , he does not call together all his powers , passions , appetites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decide according to the major vote . Yet all these are present in the solemn council-all have their voice-all are heard . Better a thousand times be heard fully and patiently then , than come in with their disconcerting cries afterward . The whole man decides the question  --  the whole man submits to the decision  --  and it is executed accordingly . So must it be with a self-governing people . Among them each individual has an influence , and has a right to an influence , not in the arithmetical ratio of one of the whole mass , but in the moral ratio of his intelligence and virtue-s. e. , n proportion as those elements which in their own nature have a legitimate claim to authority predominate in his character . It is a government of intelligence and virtue , not of mere will , not of persons as such . If the ideal of a democracy were a government of mere persons-of arbitrary will-it were a thousand-fold more degrading and detestable than the very caricature of a monarchy . It is true that persons perform the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those who govern , govern as representatives of certain ideas of order , justice , reason , legitimacy ; and those who obey , obey in view of those ideas . Submission to mere personal will , in whatever form , is slavery . If now you ask , who shall distinguish the intelligent and virtuous from the ignorant and vicious ? who shall classify them , and assign to each his proportionate influence ? We answer , nobody in particular-we propose no individual censorship  --  but the whole society must determine the question by a sort of natural instinct  --  and a truly self-governing society in a healthy state will determzne it , and determine it correctly . We do not take it upon ourselves to say to any man in particular , your governmental rights are less than ours , nor is any other man allowed to claim such superiority over us ; but we do say that we and every man should feel that our rights to governmental influence-we speak not now of personal or private rights , or of rights to the protection of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only according to our capacities , attainments , characters ; and such influence we shall actually possess , and no more , in a sound , self-governing community . As to the boasted right of suffrage even , we go so far as to deny its very existence as a natural or moral right of each individual . The ignorant and vicious should not feel that they have any such right-it is allowed them as a legal right , or privilege , because it can not be helped ; because no safe means have been or can be devised to distinguish and separate them by any previous scrutiny from the rest of society . They ought to feel that they enjoy this privilege on sufferance . It is an evil , though a necessary evil . It is a social disease , though we honestly believe that no remedy has been or is likely to be invented-such as a distinction of birth or property or what not-which is not worse than the disease . Therefore , when a people pretend to govern themselves , we insist upon universal suffrage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of right . But in order that a people may govern themselves , intelligence and virtue must also , a a matter of fact , maintain the controlling influence in spite of universal suffrage . And according as this is the result we may determine whether the experiment of self-government is in successful operation . Civil society has certainly not reached its highest ideal in the forms of Shakerism or socialism . It is not a barren plain , or a shifting , shapeless heap of undistinguishable grains of sand , as some vainly dream . It is a living organisma well-compacted body . " Now we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office . " These memorable and significant words were spoken by the holy apostle in reference to the church as a social , visible organi* zation-an organization from whose con stitution all physical force is banishedan organization which should develop itself spontaneously according to the highest moral laws of man 's being under the gutdance and energy of the indwelling Divine Spirit . And if these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reference to the church , most certainly are they true in reference to civil society . We are in danger of forgetting that society is a system  --  a system where all the parts have their proper functions and office  --  and not a mere mass of elements placed in juxtaposition or jostled into a general average ; nor yet a huge , hideous , headless , heartless trunk , whose every particle of flesh , bone , sinew and musclc is endued , and just equally endued , with consciousness , in* telligence , life and energy : who would not shrink from the contact of such a monster with horror ! The essential condition of true freedom in society as well as the individual , is not a lawless discordant equality of elements on the one hand , or a dead , monotonous level on the other , but a living , varied harmony . It were beautiful to see a man all whose powers and affections were thus attuned in sweet , spontaneous concert , based on the normal principles of his constitution and beautiful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both the man and the society who have trained and disciplined themselves to such a state , than they who , if such a thing be possible , by external force and corruption have been constrained to it . Self-government is essential , therefore , to the hrghest elevation both of the individual and social man . Whether it be possible for human society , under the guidance of self-government , to attain such an ideal , or make any reasonable approximations to it , or whether it must ever remain under the tutelage of arbitrary rule , is one of the prohiems which in the Providence of God has been committed to us to solve in behalf of all mankind . We have said that , in rearing our social edifice , we have no rubbish to remove of the decaying and ruinous structures of antiquity . This is a great advantage , if we use it right . But at our present rate of progress , when are we likely to build any edifice at all ? Do we not pull down as fast as we put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we say , or where should we be , if every man were to remodel or rebuild his father 's house the moment it came into his possession ? We should soon come to live in a very miserable sort of hovels , or else should have little time for anything besides house-building . Now is not this precisely our social position ? Indeed , to a fanciful view , the actual July , state of architecture in this country appears emblematical of the stage of its civilization . Our very fundamental laws , our " constitutions , " are daily undergoing changes ; or , if to change them be too difficult , a temporary majority sometimes tramples upon them with impunity . We think that as a people we are in rapid - progress-yet , in fact , are we not constantly beginning ? In respect to social institutions do we build anything for permanence ? If we do , we scarcely get beyond the foundations , and the next generation , if not the next election or next great voluntary society , rips up all our work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be feared this everlasting beginning will he the ruin of us. it is impossible for one generation to build up from the ground , a solid , spacious , well-proportioned fabric of social institutions ; and were it possible , there is little encouragement to attempt it , if the next generation is sure to demolish the whole and begin anew . It is high time for us to have settled something  --  to be ready to take something for granted . If great changes are necessary , it is unfortunate , and progress must be proportionaNy checked ; and the habit of making them is a still greater misfortune . When revolution and change are matters of ordinary preference , and not reserved for cases of stern necessity which knows no law-when they become the favorite rule and not the sad exception  --  the result must be monstrous . Contempt for the past is closely connected with a disregard of the future . " What right has my great grandfather to control me ? " and " What has posteritydone for me ? " are questions very nearly related . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his children . We are in great haste to abolish all those institutions which imply an imperfect state of society , forgetting that we may thereby destroy the very means of attaining perfection . We shall have to put up the scaffolding again . " Haste brings waste , " says the English proverb . " Avarice bursts the bag , " says Sancho . Many fancy that we are on the eve of a social and political as well as religious milleniurn . Social Chiliasm threatens to become the prevailing creed . There is abroad a sort of indistinct notion that we have only to pass a solemn resolution that we have reached a certain state and ape its fashions , and forthwith we are really there ; not considering that facts are too stubborn tliings to yield to the // omnipotence of majorities . No wish is so mighty as to transform the eager boy into a full-grown man . If our agricultural societies should vote that henceforth the earth would need no more culture , but would yield spontaneously all desirable fruits-though by ever so strong a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted on the faith of their vote they might starve the next season . In a perfect state of society penal laws and strong governmental restraints would not he necessary ; but they are excellent schoolmasters to lead us to it . That state of society is best which demands the least government , but hence it by no means follows , that that government is best which governs least . But our radical tendencies assume no more fearful form than that of the overshadowing , paralyzing despotism of " Public Opinion , " which threatens to banish all free and manly thought from among us . In a perfect state of society , public opinion would be a safe guide ; but at certain stages of progress it may be most fatal . In the midst of general ignorance and corruption this is too manifest to need an argument . And by what magic does it happen that , in a mixed state , the opinions of the enlightened and virtuous should be rendered more just and authoritative by being averaged with vulgar prejudice and vicious predilections ? Now those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are precisely those who most decry and contemn authority . Public opinion is the average opinion of the mass . Authority is the opinion of the more enlightened few . With the terms thus defined we hesitate not to prefer authority to public opinion . When public opinion urges upon us its domineering claims , threatening odium and disgrace , social ostracism or political disfranchisement if we refuse obedience , we hurl back its demands on the submission of our free spirit with defiance and contempt , while we yield a profound reverence to the unarmed , persuasive dictates of authority . Look at the accredited organs and exponents of this infallible public opinion . Who and what are they ? A host of paltry newspapers which , like the army of locusts seen in prophetic vision , darken the land , and threaten to destroy and devour every bud , shoot and germ of civilization amongst us . Men who have an abundant command of slang , but could hardly write a respectable paragraph ot good , manly , sober Eng lish ; or who , if not destitute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than man-pleasing and party-success ; men who are as innocent of any effort or thought to promote the general cause of civilization and humanity , in any high and noble sense , as the new-born infant-such men , from the editorial chairs of thousands of city and village newspapers , assume to announce the decisions and decrees of this great invisible , omnipotent , sovereign public opinion . Of course we do not mean that there are no exceptions to this character among the corps editorial . There certainly are exceptions-honorable and splendid exceptions ; the more honorable because they are few . A newspaper editor occupies a noble and responsible station , if he but fill it worthily . We boast of the unshackled freedom of our press ; and well we may . It is a priceless boon won for us by the blood and treasure of our faihers . Shame on us , their degenerate sons , that we can make no better use of it . We wish no harm to any newspaper editor or proprietor , but believe it would be an occasion for hearty rejoicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country were broken up forthwith , those employed about them provided with more lucrative occupation , and those who now exercise the boasted faculty of knowing how to read in scarcely anything else but eagerly conning all their scurrilities and gossipings , were sent back to study their neglected Bible , and read the standard works of wise , virtuous and cultivated men . If now you ask , how we shall distinguish good authority from bad-how we shall determine who are the intelligent and gifted few that have a right to influence our opinions ? again w ehave no particular answer to give . What we insist upon is , that a man in forming his opinions should recognize not the claims of a domineering public sentiment , but the authority of the wise and honest . He must first recognize that a distinction exists , and then endeavor to find it for himself as well as he can . Of course there is no compulsion about the matter , nor any infallible tribunal to decide for all . Each man decides for himself ; and , with these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide for himself . In this sense we would strenuously maintain the right of private judgment-private judgment formed with a due regard // to authority-not a blind but an enlightened deference to authority . While the lawless exercise of private judgme4t , severed from and defying all authority , almost infallibly ends in the despotism of the opinions of the mass  --  a despotism which , being raised above all responsibility , may generally be assumed to be immeasurably worse , more dangerous , more false and more degrading , than any tyranny of authority . Some people seem to forget that the case may sometimes be not " authority versus reason , " but authority versus ignorant presumption . Let the choice of civil rules , and all matters which chiefly or solely regard mere external well-being and present expediency-banks , tariffs , and the likewhen they come up for practical decision , be left to  --  the judgment and decision of the mass . In respect to these things their own contentment and happiness is the highest end . If they err , they themselves suffer the immediate consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theories of government , should by no means be considered proper subjects to be decided by the popular vote . In these things the common mind should be accustomed to recognize an authority above it . And in the other matters , a little modesty on the part of the less informed would do no harm , though they are of course the last to be expected to have it . Many seem to think that questionsnot only of practice but of theory-not only of public preference but of private character-not only what shall actually be done but what ought to be done-may be decided by a vote of the majority . They know no worse stigma , no deeper disgrace , no greater sin , than to he in the minority . They look upon the minority as so many condemned criminals . But who got the majority of votes when the question was propounded to the multitude , " Will ye have this man or Barabbas ? " Who shouted against the Soa ol God , " Crucify him ! crucify him ! " And can men still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Yet multitudes do it , if not in those very words , yet in plain English or still plainer actions . But while we would thus rebuke the insolence of majorities , we are desirous of not being misunderstood . XVilfuI misinterpretation it is impossible to guard against if we would ; hut we are bound to endeavor to make ourselves intelligible to those who honestly would know what we mean . We will say , therefore - there are certain applications of the phrase , " Vox populi , vox Dei , " where we admit and maintain its truth and propriety ; but the trivial and flippant senses in which it is often applied we think little less than blasphemous . They imply either a deification of the people or a popularization of God  --  and probably both . We are making these explanations , not because we feel that we should have any dispute with reasonable men of any party , who reflect upon the subject , and hold independent opinions based upon their own convictions  --  but precisely because we feel we should have no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily sympathize with those statesmen and patriots who , fresh from some great struggle for liberty , and still quivering with its excitement , have burst forth in the hyperbolical exlamationVox populi , vox Dei . " But it is no new or extraordinary thing in the history of the world , that the rhetorical flourishes of one age become the doctrinal formulas of others . We believe in the literal truth of this formula , as far as it implies the validity of arguments drawn from the universal or quasi-universal and uncontradicted consent of mankind-as indicating the laws of man 's spiritual and moral nature , and sometimes even the facts of his history . We believe in the sentiment , so far as it implies the general correctness of the instinct of a people in regard to their own interests and rights-if it be really an instinct , general and spontaneous . We believe in the sentiment , so far as it implies that in governments which are so constituted that the people are sovereign , the people are sovereign  --  to the extent to which the constitution makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general , that looking at the question theoretically and a priori , the people have , under God , a better right to the sovereignty than any other party , person or power whatsoever . Sovereign power must he lodged somewhere , and wherever that sovereign power is lodged its voice is practically the voice of God-it is the voice of destiny . But supremacy and infallibility are two ideas so utterly distinct that they ought not to be , as they too often are , confounded . The people may be supreme , yet not infallible . Their voice may be the fiat of destiny , yet not the sentence of truth or right . In the // 33 same sense , the decision of a judge , the ukase of the Russian Autocrat and the firman of the Grand Seignior , are alike the voice of God . They are so , in a very important sense , to the parties a**cted by such utterances . It is no more true that the sovereign people can do no wrong than that the sovereign king can do no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , the voice of the people uttering itself , not upon a sudden call through the ballot-box , but spontaneously , yet quietly and gradually , through the thousand intelligent organs which nature and society have furnished , will , in the long run , and on the whole , be fair , just and right . Further than this reason and facts forbid us to go . When , therefore , the sentiment in question is appealed to  --  and it sometimes is - as implying that the decision of a bare majority of votes given at the polls , on any question however sudden , however exciting , is the voice of God-in any higher sense than as a practical determination of the question submitted to them - we demur : for that majority may be determined by the vote of a single city , and the vote of that city may be determined by processes of combination and corruption , such as were described in an early number of this Review . Men should pause before they lay such things to the charge of their Maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare majority , the voice of the people very nearly contradicts itself , and may vary , in its judgment upon the same point , from year to year : do truth and right vary with it ? The annexation of Texas , for example , may be unconstitutional in Massachusetts and constitutional in South Carolina ; constitutional to a majority of the union this year , unconstitutional the next . When and where is the voice of God uttered in such a case ? We suppose the voice of God is binding on the conscience . Is the minority , then , bound to give up its intimate convictions and cherished doctrines to the majority of one , and acknowledge on its knees , with Galileo , that opinions of whose truth it has ocular demonstration , are damnable heresies ? if the majority may be sometimes right and sometimes wrong , who shall determine the cases ? Shall each one say the majority is right when he is with it , and wrong when he is against it ? This must be the practical result . But what becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then , before we can deterVOL. iv. - *o . I. 3 mine what is a major part , it is necessary to determine the bounds of the whole-a point which , it seems to us , is almost always forgotten or purposely avoided by radical theorists . At the time of our Revolution we were in the minority . The majority of the British Empire-of the great political society of which we acknowledged ourselves a part - was against us . Were our fathers therefore in the wrong ? Perhaps some may think that a majority of the people of the British Empire , if the question had been left to them , would have voted in favor of American claims . We think decidedly otherwise . *t was rather the people of the mother country who were pressing the government to impose a part of their burdens on the colonies . But be that as it may , we are sure that the patriots of America would have had too much good sense to have staked the decisioii of their rights and liberties on the result of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom gave the lie to the sentiment that the voice of the majority is the voice of God ; and we believe all the conventions who have subsequently framed constitutions for our different political communities have followed the precedent thus set them , by inserting in all their constitutions of government that something more than a bare majority should be required to change the fundamental law ; that two-fifths of the people , for example , if against change , should prevail over three-fifths demanding it . But , certainly , they would not have had the arrogance and impiety to set up their imperfect constitutions against the express voice of God . Did Aaron , the high-priest , obey the voice of God when he made the golden calf ? Did the people of Israel utter the voice of God when they demanded a king ? The whole history of this people is a most striking commentary on the doctrine in question ; and yet this is the only people in connection with whose history the Voice of God has been independently and distinctly revealed . Was it the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being weary of hearing him continually called the Just ? Was it the voice of God which clamored forthe condemnation of Socrates ? Perhaps it will be said , it was not the people who were in fault in these cases , but the demagogues that perverted them - that the people , if left to themselves , // would have decided aright . " Aye , there 's the rub ! " - if left to themselves / But how are they to be left to themselves ? Who does not know that the very essence  --  the fundamental principle - of demagoguism is , first to pervert the popular mind , and then to appeal to it as authority ? It was , indeed , at the instigation of the chief priests and , rulers that the Jewish people preferred a murderer to the innocent man whom , but a few days before , they had been very attentive to hear . But this view of the case , so far from relieving the deifiers of the voice of the people , only adds the last insupportable weight to their burden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If questions could be fairly got before the minds of a community generally so intelligent and virtuous as ours , we should have almost unlimited confidence in the correctness of their practical decisions . But , unfortunately , the good people are not only fallible , but gullible ; and there are sharp-witted men enough who know how to make their account of it . The mischief is , that while the people too often reject and hate those who warn them of their ignorance , and tell them wholesome but unwelcome truths , they are prone to love and follow those who flatter only to betray ; who persuade them to despise all authority only that themselves may profit by their consequent self-conceit ; who promise them liberty only as a cloak to their own ambition , while they themselves are the servants of corruption . The first step towards true wisdom and perfectfreedom on the p art of the people , must be , not to cast off all guidance , but to be more circumspect in selecting their leaders . Until they have learned to do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of popular liberty-let no foreign abettors ( domestic , we trust , there are none ) of the despotism of one , or of the insolence of the few , pervert what we have said to the purpose of showing that the people are unable and unfit to govern themselves . By a similar course of argument it might , with far greater facility , be proved that a monarch or an aristocracy are unable and unfit to govern human society . How then is it to be governed ? But we utterly deny that any such inference against the capacity of the people for self-government can reasonably be drawn from the positions we have taken . And when foreigners officiously intermeddle in our domestic differences , they will learn that the old adage about quarreling man and wife is applicable to other social relations . On the other hand , let no professed friend . of popular rights accuse us of having assailed them . We repel the charge with our soul 's intensest energy . We hold the rights and liberties of the people sacred-we enshrine them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods to be adored and worshiped ? For ourselves we would neither adore the Roman people nor the Roman Emperor . Let those flatter who seek for favor . Those who seek to benefit others must , now as of old , be even ready to sacrifice themselves . And as we would not abase ourselves to flatter a sovereign king or a sovereign aristocracy , so will we not abase ourselves to flatter the sovereign people . It is precisely because the American people are sovereign , and because we rejoice in that sovereignty , that we would have them think on their duties and their dangers . It is because we earnestly desire to bave*that sovereignty not only continued but practically enlarged and completed that we would have the people reminded of their exposures and defects ; that thus they may be led to avoid and remedy them , and self-government may be established among us so firmly , so beautifully and gloriously that the mouths of gainsayers may be forever stopped , and we may become the envy and the exemplar of the world . The other class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather loosely grouped under the designation of extravagant utilitarian tendencies . The useful Arts , and especially the higher forms of the Mechanic Artsto which American genius is too exclusively devoted-do indeed contribute towards the progress of civilization ; both directly , by exercising the intellects of men and giving them a sense of elevation and control over matter and the powers of nature , and indirectly , as a means of obtaining wealth and leisure . Yet utilitarianism and practicalness may get such exclusive possession of the general mind as to prove the most serious obstacle in the way of a higher and nobler culture . The more of the ideal there is thrown around life and all its affitirs , the more of true refinement and genuine culture will prevail . Refined taste looks , perhaps , with the highest pleasure on those things which have no use for us but to be beautiful . // There is among the mass of our population more of a glorying in rudenessa rudeness often put on and cherished of set purpose-than , perhaps , among any other people in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which too often accompany what refineinent there is , betray an upstart character , a narrow-mindedness , a " Little-Pedlingtonism , " which render such superficial village-squire refinement little , if at all , preferable to a proud and sturdy rudeness . Perhaps in this we are not more guilty than all others-at least we may claim our English cousins as participes criminis . If we compare the social character and condition of our common people with that of the same class in France , we shall find much more comfort , mental activity and useful knowledge among us , but vastly less refinement of feeling and manners . Good manners are restricted to no particular class in France ; but every Frenchman seems to be endowed with an easy politeness of address and a nameless delicacy of sensibility and social tact by virtue of his birth . How these little matters throw a charm around social life and give it an air of refinement and elevation , of which , with all our more solid requirements and enjoyments , we are quite unaware . We may despise these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; but , so far as we are destitute of them , we are wanting in one of the elements-though an external rather than an essential element-of civilization . Compare one of our farmers or mechanics with an Italian in a similar position . The snug and thrifty life of the American finds no counterpart with the Italian . But the refinement of the tastes and sensibilities of the latter is equally wanting in the former . Introduce the American into the presence of the Apollo di Belvedere ; and he sees nothing but the figure of a naked man cut in dingy marble , fractured , scarred and defaced in sundry places , which , if he thought he could make a good speculation out of it , lie would consider worth buying-other*vise he can see no use in it . Place the Italian before the same statue ; and , though he may be poor and ignorant and perhaps never read a newspaper in his life , his bosom swells with irrepressible emotions , his eyes brighten and his soul seems going forth to commune with the glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that same dingy marble . And say , which of the two minds is the more cultivated and refined ? which is the more truly civilized ? Both are men . Both have the same nature , and in that nature the same sensibilities and principles of taste . But in the American these are completely overlaid and smothered by the accumulation of exclusively practical habits . This second nature has so annihilated the first , that he looks upon the Italian 's enthusiasm with mingled incredulity and contempt . But again , we may prefer our thrift to the Italian 's taste as much as we l ) lease ; yet let us not therefore claim to be more civilized . Grecian civilization may be characterized as nsthetic  --  the civilization of taste and genius ; the Roman as politico-ethical-the civilization of jurisprudence and the state ; the Jewish as theocratic-popular-the civilization of religion and the tribe ; that of the medieval italian cities as commercial-luxurious ; - that of modern Europe is a combination of all , with the addition of the economic or utilita ' *-. element . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; subsequently the classical element ; in later times the economic-practical . A barbarian element is sometimes reckoned among the constituent principles of modem civilization . But this , if not a barbarism , is at least a solecism . All that can really be meant , is , that our forefathers , the barbarians of the North of Europe , furnished Christianity and the genius of classic culture with materials of a certain character to be civilized ; and the character of the materials has naturally modified the character of the result-for man , when civilized , has other characters besides that of being civilized . Respect for woman , and the sense of personal independence , which have been assigned to a barbarian origin , are , in their normal state , the natural offspring of Christianity . It is true , in their extravagance , they show an unmistakeable affinity with barbarism . That this is the case with the latter is plain ; and if the modern theory of the rights of women is connected with the former , that tends equally to barbarism ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is certain they were always and justly considered as the most anomalous of savages .. Historically speaking , the Grecian element was engrafted on the Roman , and // both the Roman and Jewish engrafted on the modern European . Thus the Grecian is historically one remove farther from us than either of the others ; while the mediuval Italian stands in our immediate neighborhood . In the American phasis of European civilization , the most modern , the utilitarian element is predominant . Under its influence , just then coming into the ascendency , European civilization was transplanted to this country . It is therefore historically as well as practically the basis of our civilization ; next comes the Roman-then the Jewish ; and last of all the Grecian  --  the beautiful Grecian - which in fact has in it more of the distinctive character of proper civilization than any of the others , the religious element not excepted . For the main scope of religion transcends the direct objects of civilization , and only incidentally affects them . Civilization regards , exclusively , the present world ; religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards society , or individuals only as com* ) osing society ; religion regards individuals , or society only as composed of individuals . Each may use the other as a means for the accomplishment of its peculiar ends ; but their ends being different , the two are radically distinguished . So with the Roman element ; it is important , yet secondary . Political institutions , laws , regard the rights and corresponding duties of men chiefly in relation to their external well-being and safety ; civilization regards also fitness , propriety , beauty , intellectual progressthe whole culture of man as a social being . Thus it includes civil law , but includes it as a subordinate element . It is a saying of Guizot , that the dignity of civilization never appears in a more striking light than when we observe that even religion prides itself upon contributing to its progress . " Thus facts the most important ; facts , of themselves and independently of their exterior consequences , the most sublime in their nature , acquire increased importance , reach a higher degree of sublimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of this great principle , that it gives a new value to whatever it touches . " In this view religion is made to play a subordinate part ; and in this view Christianity may be regarded as a constituent of civilization . But , in general , we should choose rather to consider religion as a higher and broader subject , which includes and subordinates civilizatioh as one of the elements of its own development . So that we should pronounce the religion of any age , nation or sect defective , which should not recognize it as one of its important functions to civilize its adherents . And this is not inconsistent with what we have already said of the main scope of religion . Civilization is essential not to the existence but to the perfection of true religion ; as , on the other hand , the true religion is essential not to the existence but to the perfection of civilization . Thus morality also has its foundations in the essential principles of man 's nature , and has its own proper sphere , independently of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality requires the sanction of religion for its full development , and , on the other hand , religion includes morality in its own complete idea ; while , for all this , religion and morality are not identical . Like the sun in the solar system , religion embraces the true centre of the moral , intellectual , and social world-of all human ideas and human institutions ; and , viewed from that centre , all are seen to move in the harmony of their true relations . Yet there are other points of observation . The spectator may plant himself at another point ; and the apparent relations or movements of the system , as seen from that point , are facts , and may be recorded as such . Assuming , then , one of these subordinate points-civilization , in the present instance-as our centre or stand-point ; religion , though in truth the centre , will seem to move in some orbit around us . From this point of view we may rightly and earnestly insist upon moral and religious culture as essential to the permanence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so . It is the element , the only element of certain conservation . We would not utter this sentiment in a corner . We would make it as emphatic as possible . We would repeat it , if needful , a hundred times in a hundred different forms-civilization must look to religion as the only element of certain conservation . Whatever parallel or centrast , if any , might be drawn between American and European civilization in respect to this element , we leave to other and abler hands . But , after all , we think we are right in placing the classical element nearest // the heart of proper civilization . Let it not be said we are exalting taste above morals , and civilization above religion . That is precisely what we are not doing . We are insisting upon being content to call things by their right names , and let them pass for what they are worth . Religion is religion ; and civilization is civilization-that is , it is what , by common usage and under the guidance of common sense , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . The Greeks in the age of Pyrrhus are universally held to have been more civilized than the Romans ; and in the fullest bloom of the classical spirit , in the Augustan age , Roman civilization is regarded as having reached its acme . Both Greeks and Romans we consider more civilized than the Jews ; and even the Mussulman Saracens more civilized than the early Christian crusaders-though the latter in both cases were possessed of the true religion  --  and by what rule ? Whatever other points of distinction there may have been ; the prevalence of the classic spirit , of arts , science , philosophy , intellectual culture , is the decisive test . The revival of letters awakened Europe from the semi-barbarism of the dark ages ; and the influence of classical learning had determined the , peculiar type and refinement of European culture . This element had introduced and firmly established its influence in European society , before the economic-practical or utilitarian element had become expanded with such tremendous energy . The classical element has therefore , in Europe , an advantage in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not possess in this country . In comparing ourselves , therefore , with Europeans in respect to intellectual , and particularly in respect to classical and iesthetical culture , we should expect to find them our superiors . Yet even in making this comparison , one important distinction is not to be forgotten . When we speak of the civilization of a country , we may refer to the aggregate or average condition and culture of society in that country , or taking the term in a more restricted and , by usage , more appropriate sense , we may refer to the higher culture and social progress of those who take the lead in the community around themof those who stand as the representatives of that country in the eyes of the world . These two spheres of civilization do not always correspond either in their centre , circumference or axis . Though , without arrogance , we may claim superiority to England in the former sphere , yet she is so much superior to us in the latter and narrower sphere , that , by the common consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as actually superior to us in point of civilization . If Russia and " Switzerland be compared , the converse will be the result ; that is , Switzerland will be pronounced more civilized than Russia , notwithstanding the superior ciiiture of a few of the Russian nobility . The genius of our civilization leads us to an undue depreciation of this restricted sphere : but it is unfair that we should be compared with others in view of this exclusively ; though foreigners , seeing only what is most prominent , are likely to content themselves with such a comparison . Thus much we may safely say in our behalf , that civilization has nowhere attained its highest , noblest end , until it has pervaded the whole mass of society with its refining influences . In respect to other nations , we insist upon the general diffusion of social and intellectual culture among us ; in respect to ourselves we have reason to deplore our deficiency in higher civilization . The average correctness and propriety , for instance , with which the English language is spoken by our whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties can boast of ; while it is a rare case that an American has that easy , unconscious , graceful command of his mother tongue , both in speaking and writing , which is common among the higher classes in England . If American and English society-using the term society in its more trivial sense - be compared , the result will be similar . Taking the average of all classes-and American society is really a sort of miscellaneous aggregate-we are superior to the English ; while we have scarcely anything to compare with the polished refinement , the natural ease , propriety and simplicity of the English aristocratic circles . Yet these being the representatives of England to foreigners , she of course secures the general voice in favor of her absolute superiority . As a nation we appear abroad in our every-day make their appearance only in their holyday suits , and receive strangers in their best saloons. // rhe substantial facts being ascertained in respect to both parties , it is a mere question of words to inquire which is the more civilized ? Yet it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is right we should have , some pride in being civilized . But we suppose that , according to the general usage and historical acceptation of that term , the question must be answered adversely to our claims . For , paradoxical as it may appear , it must yet he admittcd that the average of mental and social culture may be much higher among us than in England ; and , nevertheless , we may be rightly accounted less civilized . That is , Society as a whole , as a system , may not be so magnificently and harmoniously developed to the eye of the spectator , and for the purposes of outward impression-just as an ill-officered army , with all its soldiers tolerably versed in tactics , may yet be vastly inferior to another composed of ignorant boors , but led by able and experienced generals . Whether our civilization do not want more in intensity than it surpasses in extension , and whether greater intensity be not necessary to preserve and increase its extension , are questions of vital importance for our consideration . Elasticity has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried to a high degree without requiring , either as a condition or a consequence , the general elevation of the community ; but the general elevation of the mass can never proceed safely , or reach a high degree , without being preceded and guided by the higher culture of a few . There is no instance of such a phenomenon in history , and never will be . The course of nature will not be altered to suit any theories of ours , however they may pretend to be purely democratic . Hence the importance not only of retaining but elevating the higher type of education which belongs to our colleges and universities . Hence the peculiar claims of classical education upon the vigorous defence and jealous protection of all enlightened men . If the great fountains are neglected or dried up , what will become of the little streams ? Yet there are aren among us who pretend to be the elect sons of freedom and apostles of progress , and who nevertheless assail all such institutions and studies , not only as useless in themselves but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the genius of democracy is inconsistent with the highest forms of social and intellectual culture ? * Can men in the highest places have the effrontery to say publicly that the establishment of a natioiial institution for the promotion and dissemination of knowledge is abhorrent to the principles of freedom , and could serve only to fetter the mind of the people ? And that when a benevolent foreigner has munificently furnished the means for such a purpose , we must reject them , and say , " we are democrats , and can not use them ? " If the whole object of life be , to get to the end of it as comfortably as possible ; if to eat , drink and sleep , to be clothed and housed in competence in quiet be all men want-there is no need of a liberal education . If men were made to be good farmers , artisans , traders , and nothing more -- there is no need of a liberal education . In proportion as an occupation is manual rather than mental , intellectual discipline is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicrafts of life may depend much upon such discipline and culture . But is it not of some importance to be a man -  --  a civilized man -- as well as a good artisan or tradesman ? Let us not be understood as treating these pursuits with contempt . By no means . The mere classical scholar is as deficient in the full development of manhood as the mere farmer or the mere mechanic . Besides1 men must eat , drink and sleep , or they can not live to be civilized . Those ordinary employments of life are necessary to the very existence of society as well as of man , and their improvement is closely connected with the progress of civilization . It is plain that , although we assign the first place to intellectual culture among the constituents of proper civilization , it is not of itself sufficient for the full development of humanity . in our bodily organization the heart is most necessary , but even the heart will not perform its functions alone . Practical habits must more fully draw out and invigorate intellectual culture , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , intellectual as well as moral culture must interpenetrate , regulate and refine the practical // habits , before the highest type of civilization can be reached-before we can have a whole man or a perfect citizen . The wide separation of learning from life , and the unprecedented extent to which the division of intellectual labor has been carried in Germany , have prevented the immense erudition of German scholars from raising their country to a corresponding rank in the scale of civilization . The principle of division of Inhor , so efficient in promoting the improvement and productiveness of the mechanic arts , is not less efficient as applied to the various departments of scholarship ; hut it is attended , in both cases , with this evil-that , in respect to the individuals employed , it cripples , stints an ( l mutilates humanity . What , then , we chiefly object to , is , that a man should be so entirely absorbed in any one pursuit as to lose all symp4thy with other pursuits , or to set before himself no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligent prosecution of his own handicraft . What we mean , is , that a mere tradesman-if a mere tradesman can be found-though he excel ever so much in his appropriate trade , is but the fraction of a man . The theorizing philosopher and the musing poet , though amidst our thrifty community they may hardly get a living for themselves , or a hearing from others , contribute infinitely more to the advancement of the race , to the civilization of mankind , than multitudes of active and enterprising men of the various lucrative trades and professions . Many men , industrious and successful in their pursuits , lived comfortably and grew rich , while Milton dictated the Paradise Lost ; but has not that single poem contributed more to the culture and elevation of the human mind than the ephemeral labors of them all ? It may sound strange to many , yet we believe it to be a most serious truth , that we need more theorizers and fewer empirics-i. e. , more men of comprehensive thought , and fewer men of mere off-hand practice . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch can judge of certain immediate properties of things better than that of sight , and thus prevent or correct many false optical judgments , are we content to grope our way along through the world , dispensing with vision altogether ? Because , by a sharpened practical instinct , we can determine what is good and profitable for the mo meat , shall we utterly repudiate that " high discourse of reason which looks before and after ? " What has , more than anything else , brought theory and all philosophy into such discredit among us , is , in fact , the pretension of a multitude of mere quacks to be theorists and philosophers , joined with the popular habit of generalizing from the narrow premises of a few present facts . If we have no closet philosophers , we have plenty of street philosophers and bar-room philosophers . We may have discarded the name of philosophy , but we have the men who act as if they had mastered and outrun all the philosophy and theory in the world . But in truth there neither is nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every man who acts with design and plan , who combines means for the accomplishment of an end , is so far a theorist . The question is , shall his theory be a long-sighted or a shortsighted theory ? Shall he think patiently , dig deep and lay its foundations upon a rock , or shall he erect it upon the shifting sands of immediate experience ? We are already beginning to reap the long harvest of bitter fruits , in the shape of indirect consequences , from several of our spasmodic , empirical attempts at religious , moral and social reform . In political theory we think we are -- and if anywhere we ought to be-especially proficient ; yet how many among us , even of our legislators , have thought it necessary to make themselves acquainted with the established principles of political science or even of political economy , or with the general history of legislation and politics in this and other countries and ages ? Yet while it is manifest that , without such knowledge as a basis , there can he no sound theory ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory based upon it , there can be no safe practice or permanent progress . But to say no more of poetry and philosophy-there are certain employments in society which have a special connection with civilization , and are essential to its proper development , but which require a higher discipline and more thorough mental training than are needful for the manual laborer . The business of the merchant , taking the appellation in its higher sense-as it has an important bearing upon civilization , so it forms a connecting link in passing forward // to those other employments which we have in view . A portion of the merchant 's , as of all other , business is indeed routine , drudgery if you *vi1l , but another portion will call every faculty into exercise and task his highest powers . Either , therefore , he must have received a thorough preparatory mental training , or he must be introduced and carried forward in his pursuit very gradually . But who could expect to have good lawyers , good physicians and good divines , without a thorough discipline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their particular professions , but to the due and well-balanced development of the whole mind ? We might indeed have pettifoggers , quacks and ranters ; and these might make not only more noise but more money than well-educated men . But what becomes , in the mean time , of the interests-we will not say , of civilization , but of jurisprudence , and of medipal and theological science ? And when the tree is dead , what will become of the parasite plants , which twined luxuriantly around it and lived upon its sap ? There are indeed some people who think that the learned professions themselves are excrescences upon society , and do more harm than good . Be it so ; how will you remedy it ? No civilized community can exist without them . Abolish them to-day , and they will reappear in some shape or other to-morrow . There will be some persons who will make it their business to tell their neighbors the law , and prescribe for the diseases of their souls and bodies . The only practical question is , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , or with ignorant pre-tenders ? In like manner , if all our higher institutions of learning were annihilated at once ; unless all our civilization and yearnings after civilization were annihilated with them , it would not be many years before our wants would imperiously demand , and infallibly bring about , their restoration , or the establishment of something like them . No better general discipline for the whole mind-including the reason , imagination , taste-will probably ever be invented than is furnished by the classics combined with the mathematics . The study of language itself is a most noble and humanizing discipline ; and the classics furnish the best models of style in poetry , eloquence , history , philosophy . These together with the mathematics are , and should remain-with such additions from the arts and sciences and modern languages as may be found practicable  --  the basis of a liberal , that is to say , of a liberalizing , civilizing education . There is great danger of endeavoring to combine with them too many other things , partly from a laudable desire to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering a liberal education more practical , to propitiate popular prejudices . The consequence of this multifarious mass of study compressed into the space of half-a-dozen years , is either to crowd otit the mathematics and classics , or to cram instead of cultivating the mind-or more probably both : and the end must be to bring our higher institutions of learning into still greater disrepute . If our colleges can not stand on the simple ground of the merits and benefits of a mathematical and classical discipline ; if they must become institutions for the communication and acquisition of all sorts of so-called useful knowledge , merely to furnish abundant materials for stopping empty bags ; in a word , if they must become encyclopedias instead of mental gymnasia ; why , then , they can not be sustained at all in their true character ; they might as well be christened by a new name . Let it never be forgotten that such institutions are designed to furnish facilities for a fundamental , intellectual discipline , and not for wide , general acquisitions , which , under the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things and a knowledge of nothing . We say , they are designed to furnish facilities . They will not communicate mental discipline to a passive recipient by mere external contact . There is no opus operatum in education . Nor is there any so great difference as some seem to imagine between a publicly-educated and a so-called self-educated man-provided only he be really educated . Every disciplined mind must have disciplined itself . Every educated man must have educated himself , and must feel that he has disciplined and educated himself . All thait others-all that any institutions-can do for him , is , to furnish facilities , helps , incitements ; he must do the work himself . The man who thirsts for knowledge , who diligently and greedily improves* // 41 every opportunity , however trifling , for self-improvement , will undoubtedly , with few advantages , make much greater progress both in culture and acquisition , will drink more copious and invigorating draughts , than he who sits listlessly down beside the gushing fountains of science , truth and refinement . The diligent and studious mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily toil to ( levote to the culture of his mind , if he improve those few moments , will infallibly become a better educated , better disciplined , more civilized as well as more respectable and useful man , than the college fopling , dunce or drone . But such a comparison is a comparison of extremes , and though often made to the manifest disadvantage of colleges , is as manifestly unfair . Good were it for colleges as well as for society , if dunces and drones received their deserts  --  a silent dismission instead of an honorary degree  - -   - -    --  or by some means or other were abolished . They bring more discredit upon colleges than all other causes combined . But are the classics or mathematics to blame for it ? But we dismiss this subject , content with protesting against the utilitarian , uncivilizing tendency , which would pervert or destroy our higher institutions of learning ; and with insisting on these two points , that discipline and not acquisition is the fundamental idea of a liberal education , and that public institutions can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for himself . We readily admit that , without the aid of any public institution of learning , a man may , though at great disadvantage , acquire all that is essential in a liberal education . We readily admit , also , that without any thorough education a man may not only get a livelihood , but may make no little sensation in the world . The modesty and refinement that ought to grow out of such an education may even unfit a man for successful competition with audacity and coarseness . In political life is this especially true . The rude and reckless demagogue may secure more popular votes than his refined and cultivated rival . A man of tolerable original capacity will naturally busy his mind about something , and for want of a higher and more generous discipline , he may direct all his efforts to acquiring the mastery of that craft and management , that system of little arts and low cunning , by which to insure a triumph over his opponents who have been accustomed to employ their minds on more elevated and humanizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demagogue is an article of much cheaper manufacture than a Statesman . But the process does not end here . When all Statesmen have been thrown quite off the course , and their competitors are left in exclusive possession , these will not be able quietly to divide the prizes among themselves . What is cheap is abundant ; and now he will succeed best among them who can descend lowest . The problem now is , " beneath the lowest deep to find a lower deep . " But when he who is most skillful in solving this problem has got himself into high office , he may be brought into contact with the highly cultivated and refined minds who act as the representatives of other countries . And if he has any discernment or sensibility left-which indeed is hardly to be supposed-how must he quail before them ! how keenly must he feel his inferiority ! Or if-as must too often be the case -- he is utterly callous and unable to appreciate anything above his accustomed habits ; though he and even the less informed and cultivated portion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of refinement and rules of propriety ; yet what must be the judgment , the just judgment , of other nations in regard to our progress in civilization , when they see such men acting as our organs and representa-tives ? We may be proud of coarseness , vulgarity and ignorance , if we please . We may affect to consider them as signs manual of true democracy . We may despise , or if we can not despise , denounce and renounce , all refinement and taste and learning as useless , pedantic , or worst of all , aristocratic . We have a right  --  a sort of right-so to do , if we please . Nobody has a right to interfere , but let us not then enter the lists in the race of civilization . Let us rather be consistent , and despise and denounce civilization itself as a badge of slavery . Let us rejoice and exult that we are free - savages . If we are not ready to do this  --  and assuredly we are not-there is but one other way of being consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The first step should be to ascertain our true position , to recognize our deficiencies , and look our dangers full in the // face . Let us make a brief recapitulation of some of some of our comparative disadvantages . Want of the refining and uniting influences of national antiquity , and with a disposition to reject the experience and authority of others ; want of a highly educated and cultivated class ; overshadowing and oppressive incubus of popular opinion ; excessive absorption in thrift and money-getting ; a habit of change ; an anticipative millenium ; an impatience and restiveness under the transient or accidental evils on which the final and permanent good is conditioned ; the general preponderance of the centrifugal over the centripetal , of the disorganizing over the conservative , of the leveling over the elevating tendencies ; of selfishness over humanity , of partisanship over patriotism , of sectarianism over catholicity ; in a word , of the negative , the immediate , the tangible , the useful , the practical , over the positive , the distant , the ideal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being all carpenters without an architect-tinkers and coblers without a master-workman . That is the dark side of the picture . But , courage ! there is also a bright side . Our first hope is in a " Divinity that shapes our ends , rough-hew them as we will . " God has given us a great work to do , and we trust he will secure its accomplishment , though it may be by such methods as to save us from all occasion of glorying in ourselves . Faith is the first element of success . Besides we have still an open field ; no insuperable obstacle has yet been thrown in our way . Our body social has certain had habits and tendencies , but no deep-seated , fatal disease , no old , festering wounds , no shriveled limbs , no exhausted spirits . We have evils , but they are far from remediless . Will and wisdom are all we want . After all that we have said , and that some may be ready to condemn as unpatriotic and undemocratic-though we would warn all such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to reason and not to revile-after all that we have said , we would not exchange our whole situation , opportunities , prospects , with those of any other people on earth . We would not exchange our boisterous , changeful , rude , impatient , but active and energetic democracy , for the vegetable life , the lethargic tranquillity , the silence and slavery , of Russian or Austrian despotism , or any of the July , boasted paternal governments on earth ; nor yet for the shocking contrasts hetween the thousands of English aristocrats and the millions of English menials and paupers . We would not exchange our church institutions , fragmentary , illdigested and unsettled as they are , with the organism of death , the galvanized corpse of the Romish hierarchy ; nor yet with a corrupting an ( l degrading dependence on the civil government . in respect to intellectual cultivation , too , America need not be ashamed of her position and prospects ; and the American mind possesses many excellent points . it is generally true of Americans abroad that they have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more apreciation of what is foreign , less of national narrow-mindedness , than their English brethren . We can learn . Besides the English can claim little superiority over us either for great useful inventions or for taste and genius in the fine arts . In painting and sculpture , in poetry and eloquence , we are already their rivals . But as a nation we are yet in our youth . We achieved our independence before we had passed our non-age . We have the characteristic faults , follies , extravagancies , dangers and defects of youth ; but we have also its vigor and freshness , its buoyancy and hope . it is indeed time for us to begin to cherish the sober thoughts of manhood . Wild sallies and boyish excesses must have an end . in developing a manlier and maturer state , our men of education and culture have a most important and noble office to perform . If they put themselves in the right spirit and with due energy to the work , they will yet perform it . Their first step must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step must be to renounce distinctly and resolutely all pursuit and expectancy of wealth and political station . They must set their faces as a flint against such temptations . Called to act as judges on subjects of the highest import , they must not be bribed . They must above all things studiously preserve their mental independence . Let them remember that those who figure most largely in their generation are not ordinarily those who survive it longest . Poets and artistsare proverbially poor and despised ; and this is as it should be . If poets could be idle and honored , all would be poets , hence Providence has appointed a needful remedy . For all real greatness Civilization : American and European . // the present is the time of outlay , of seedsowing ; its harvest lies in the future . What was poor , blind , puritanic Milton , to Charles II . and his licentious cavaliers ? What was the incarcerated and half-maddened Tasso to the noble and haughty Duke of Ferrara ? Inspired men , with a still holier mission-when not endued with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungeon to a Jehoiuchim ? the imprisoned John Baptist to a Herod and his merry-making Court , or Paul to an Agrippa or a Nero ? Nay , what was Jesus of Nazareth to the kings that set themselves and the rulers that took counsel together against him ? But how stand their memories now ? And what is the comparative measure of their present in-43 Iluence ? Truly a prophet is not accepted in his own country . Let then our men of intelligence and virtue-of true culture and refinement-. set about their task with singleness of eye and simplicity of heart ; and let them pursue it with a noble disinterestedness , with an earnest and undaunted boldness , with energy , prudence and perseverance ; and our American civilization , under the blessing of God , is safe ; and good Bishop Berkeley 's prophetic lines will yet be fulfilled : " Westward the star of empire takes its way ; The four first acts already past , The fifth shall close the drama with the day ; Time 's noblest offspring is the last .
