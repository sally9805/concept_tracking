EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION . The Stranger was written by Kotzebue in the year 1787 , during a period of severe illness . " Never before or since , " he says , " did I feel such a rapid flow of ideas and imagery as during that period ; and I believe it to be undeniable that by some kinds of illness , particularly those in which the irritation of the nerves is increased , the powers of the mind are abundantly elevated , as diseased muscles alone produce pearls . " Few dramatic works have ever been so much abused as this by the critics . Even in our own day , we continually hear it condemned as a mawkish combination of false sentiment , exaggerated passion and unnatural incident . And yet for more than half a century it has kept rooted possession of the stage in every city of Europe and America where the drama exists ; and at the present time its popularity seems greater than ever , if we may judge from the frequency of its representation . It is therefore idle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpire , and the popular heart , give them the lie . That interpretation of human passion can not be wholly false , which awakens so many responses . The sentiment can not be wholly mawkish or sickly , which , among various people and at various times , touches the deepest sensibilities of an audience . It can not be denied , however , that there is something repulsive in the terminating scene of this play as it exists in the original German , where the erring wife and the misanthropic husband are reconciled . It is but fair to give the author 's own views on this subject . " Among other accusations that have been brought against me , " he says , " it has been urged that I have not administered strict poetical justice in granting unqualified pardon to Eulalia ( Mrs. Haller ) , and restoring so great a criminal to her station in society and to every joy of life . But no one seems to have considered the dreadful punishment she has necessarily incurred from the reflections upon her own misconduct , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those reflections , and whether a woman with such a mind , laboring under the pressure of a sullied conscience , could ever be happy again . This is an ingenious , but by no means a satisfactory defence of Kotzebue 's conception . The characters of both man and wife suffer in their reconciliation . At any sacrifice of her own feelings , Mrs. Haller should have saved her husband 's honor from the profanation involved in that reconciliation ; and he , like every man with a true reverence for the pure and beautiful in woman , should have shunned while he forgave the fascinating penitent . He loses our respect the moment he takes her again to his arms . Some of our best actors have been of this opinion ; and on the American stage , the reconciliation scene is generally omitted , and the play is supposed to end with the catastrophe of the final separation of husband and wife . There have been several English versions of the Stranger . The present one , which is the most approved , is by Benjamin Thompson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Philip Kemble . One of the most distinguished personators of the character of the Stranger was John Palmer , whose tragical death will always be remembered in connection with the history of this play . He was enacting the part of the hero on the Liverpool stage , and had exerted himself with great effect until , on uttering , in a tone of indescribable pathos , the words , " There is another and a better world , " he seemed overpowered with emotion . He paused for the space of almost ten seconds as if waiting for the prompter to give him the word  --  then put out his right hand  --  heaved a convulsive sigh  --  fell , and never breathed after  --  dying apparently without a pang . The audience for some minutes supposed he was merely acting his part ; but , on the truth being known , the excitement was intense , and the house was immediately cleared . Palmer had been suffering for some days from great depression of spirits occasioned by the loss of his wife and a favorite son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actor , who , in 1758 , while playing the Duke in Measure for Measure , in an unusually masterly style , came to these words : "  --  Reason thus with life : If I do lose thee , I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep : a breath thou art "  --  here he dropped into the arms of Mr. Moody , the Claudio of the evening , and never spoke more ! Augustus Von Kotzebue , the author of the " Stranger , " was doomed at the age of fifty-eight to meet with a death quite as tragical as any he had imagined for the hero of his many dramas . The 23d of March , 1819 , he was assassinated in his own house at Manheim by Karl Ludwig Sand , a political fanatic , who denounced his victim as a traitor to his country and a stipendiary of Russia . Two or three minutes before receiving his death-wound , Kotzebue was seated with his family . Some lady visitors entered the room , and after the usual compliments were exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely two months old , in his arms , " I was exactly the age of this child when my father died . " The next moment Kotzebue was called out to see Sand , and , before many moments more had elapsed , his mortal career was terminated . Of such coincidences we may say with Hamlet , " there is something in them more than natural , if philosophy could but find it out . " CAST OF CHARACTERS . Drury Lane , 1826 . Park , 1846 .

Do I not enjoy this glorious morning ? Am I not in health again ? Believe me , sir , he , who , leaving the bed of sickness , for the first time breathes the fresh pure air , is , at that moment , the happiest of his Maker 's creatures . Fra . Francis Yet ' t is a happiness that fails upon enjoyment . Tob . Tobias True ; but less so in old age . Some sixty years ago , my father left me this cottage . I was a strong lad ; and took an honest wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage with five children . This lasted nine or ten years . Two of my children died . I felt it sorely . The land was afflicted with a famine . My wife assisted me in supporting our family ; but four years after she left our dwelling for a better place . And of my five children , only one son remained . This was blow upon blow . It was long before I regained my fortitude . At length , resignation and religion had their effect . I again attached myself to life . My son grew , and helped me in my work . Now the State has called him away to bear a musket . This is to me a loss indeed . I can work no more . I am old and weak ; and true it is , but for Mrs. Haller , I must have perished . Fra . Francis Still , then , life has charms for you ? Tob . Tobias Why not , while the world holds anything that 's dear to me ? Have not I a son ? Fra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? He may be dead . Tob . Tobias Alas ! he may . But as long as I am not sure of it , he lives to me . And , if he falls , ' t is in his country 's cause . Nay , should I lose him , still I should not wish to die . Here is the but in which I was born . Here is the tree that grew with me : and , I am almost ashamed to confess it  --  I have a dog which I love . Stranger rises and advances , R. Fra . Francis A dog ! Tob . Tobias Yes !  --  Smile , if you please : but hear me . My benefactress once came to my hut herself , some time before you fixed here . The poor animal , unused to see the form of elegance and beauty enter the door of penury , growled at her .  --  " I wonder you keep that surly , ugly animal , Mr. Tobias , " said she ; " you who have hardly food enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied , " and if I part with him , are you sure that anything else will love me ?

Francis Then sir , I wish you would follow this poor old man 's example . Stra . Stranger Here ; take this book and lay it on my desk . Francis goes into the Lodge with the book . How much has this Mrs. Haller given you ? Tob . Tobias Oh , sir , she has given me so much that I can look towards winter without fear . Stra . Stranger No more ? Tob . Tobias What could I do with more ?  --  Ah ! true ; I might  --  Stra . Stranger I know it .  --  You might buy your son 's release .  --  There ! Presses a purse into his hand , and exit , R. Tob .

Tobias He would not even take my thanks . He was gone before I could speak . Fra . Francis Just his way . Tob . Tobias Now I 'll go as quick as these old legs will bear me .

Pet . Peter Bless our noble master ! Peter is on R. of sofa . Bar . Baron Steinfort Old and young , I see they 'll allow me no peace . Aside . Enough , enough , good Mr. Solomon , I am a soldier . I pay but few compliments , and require as few from others . Sol . Mr. Solomon I beg pardon , my lord  --  We do live in the country to be sure , but we are acquainted with the reverence due to exalted personages . Sitting beside the Baron , L. Pet . Peter Yes  --  We are acquainted with exalted personages . Bar . Baron Steinfort What is to become of me ?  --  Well , well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Solomon , I intend to assist , for a couple of months at least , in attacking the well stocked cellars of Wintersen .

I have , in every respect , here , managed matters in so frugal and provident a way , that his Right Honorable Excellency the Count will be astonished . Baron yawns . Extremely sorry it is not in my power to entertain your lordship . Pet . Peter Extremely sorry . Sol . Mr. Solomon Where can Mrs. Haller have hid herself ? Bar . Baron Steinfort Mrs. Haller ! Who is she ? Sol . Mr. Solomon Why , who she is , I ca n't exactly tell your lordship . Pet . Peter No , nor I. Sol . Mr. Solomon None of my correspondents give any account of her .

Bar . Baron Steinfort Oh ! do n't trouble yourself . Sol . Mr. Solomon No trouble whatever ! I remain , at all times , your honorable lordship 's most obedient , humble , and devoted servant . Exit , bowing . R. Pet . Peter Devoted servant . Exit , bowing , L. Bar . Baron Steinfort Now for a fresh plague . Now am I to be tormented by some chattering old ugly hag , till I am stunned with her noise and officious hospitality . O , patience ! what a virtue art thou ! Enter Mrs. Haller , R. with a courtsey ; Baron rises , and returns a bow in confusion . Aside . No , old she is not . Casts another glance at her . No , by Jove , nor ugly . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I rejoice , my lord , in thus becoming acquainted with the brother of my benefactress . Bar . Baron Steinfort Madam , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me an introduction equally to be rejoiced at . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Without attending to the compliment . This lovely weather , then , has enticed the Count from the city . Bar . Baron Steinfort Not exactly that . You know him . Sunshine or clouds are to him alike , as long as eternal summer reigns in his own heart and family . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller The Count possesses a most cheerful and amiable philosophy . Ever in the same happy humor ; ever enjoying each minute of his life . But you must confess , my lord , that he is a favourite child of fortune , and has much to be grateful to her for . Not merely because she has given him birth and riches , but for a native sweetness of temper , never to be acquired ; and a graceful suavity of manners , whose school must be the mind . And , need I enumerate among fortune 's favours , the hand and affections of your accomplished sister ? Bar . Baron Steinfort More and more struck . True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible of his happiness , and is resolved to retain it . He has quitted the service , to live here . I am yet afraid he may soon grow weary of Wintersen and retirement . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I should trust not . They , who bear a cheerful and unreproaching conscience into solitude , surely must increase the measure of their own enjoyments . They quit the poor , precarious , the dependent pleasures which they borrowed from the world , to draw a real bliss from that exhaustless source of true delight , the fountain of a pure unsullied heart . Bar . Baron Steinfort Has retirement long possessed so lovely an advocate ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I have lived here three years . Bar . Baron Steinfort And never felt a secret wish for the society you left , and must have adorned ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Never . Bar . Baron Steinfort To feel thus , belongs either to a very rough or a very polished soul . The first sight convinced me in which class I am to place you . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , be a third class . Bar . Baron Steinfort Indeed , madam , I wish not to be thought forward ; but women always seemed to me less calculated for retirement than men . We have a thousand employments , a thousand amusements , which you have not . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Dare I ask what they are ? Bar . Baron Steinfort We ride  --  we hunt  --  we play  --  read  --  write  --  Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller The noble enjoyments of the chase , and the still more noble enjoyments of play , I grant you . Bar . Baron Steinfort Nay , but dare I ask , what are your employments for a day ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh , my lord ! you can not imagine how quickly time passes , when a certain uniformity guides the minutes of our life . How often do I ask , " Is Saturday come again so soon ? " On a bright cheerful morning , my books and breakfast are carried out upon the grass-plot . Then is the sweet picture of reviving industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bird 's notes so often heard , still waken new ideas : the herds are led into the fields : the peasant bends his eye upon his plough . Every thing lives and moves ; and in every creature 's mind , it seems as it were morning . Towards evening , I begin to roam abroad : from the park into the meadows . And sometimes , returning , I pause to look at the village boys and girls as they play . Then do I bless their innocence , and pray to Heaven those laughing thoughtless hours could be their lot for ever . Bar . Baron Steinfort This is excellent !  --  But these are summer amusements . The winter ! The winter ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Why for ever picture winter like old age , torpid , tedious , and uncheerful ? Winter has its own delights : this is the time to instruct and mend the mind by reading and reflection . At this season , too , I often take my harp , and amuse myself by playing or singing the little favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for the future . Bar . Baron Steinfort Happy indeed are they , who can thus create and vary their own pleasures and employments . Enter Peter , L. ( Mrs. Haller crosses to Peter . ) Pet .

Bar . Baron Steinfort What do you want ? Tob . Tobias To return thanks . Even charity is a burden if one may not be grateful for it . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller To-morrow , good Tobias ; to-morrow . Bar .

Allow him to vent the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene which convinces me , even more powerfully than your conversation , how nobly you employ your time . Speak , old man . Tob . Tobias Oh , lady , that each word which drops from my lips , might call down a blessing on your head ! I lay forsaken and dying in my hut : not even bread or hope remained . Oh ! then you came in the form of an angel ; brought medicines to me ; and your sweet consoling voice did more than those . I am recovered . To-day , for the first time , I have returned thanks in the presence of the sun : and now I come to you , noble lady . Let me drop my tears upon your charitable hand . For your sake , Heaven has blessed my latter days . The Stranger too , who lives near me , has given me a purse of gold to buy my son 's release . I am on my way to the city : I shall purchase my Robert 's release . Then I shall have an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass our happy cottage , oh ! what must you feel when you say to yourself , " This is my work ! " Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller In a tone of entreaty . Enough , Tobias ; enough ! Tob . Tobias I beg pardon ! I can not utter what is breathing in my breast . There is One who knows it . May His blessing and your own heart reward you ! Exit , L. Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Endeavoring to bring about a conversation . I suppose my lord , we may expect the Count and Countess every moment now ? Bar . Baron Steinfort Not just yet , madam . He travels at his leisure . I am selfish , perhaps , in not being anxious for his speed : the delay has procured me a delight which I never shall forget . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Smiling . You satirise mankind , my lord . Bar . Baron Steinfort How so ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller In supposing such scenes to be uncommon . Bar .

Mrs. Haller Suddenly sinking from her cheerful raillery into mournful gloom . I have been married , my lord . Bar . Baron Steinfort Whose enquiries evince curiosity , yet are restrained within the bounds of the nicest respect . A widow , then ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I beseech you  --  There are strings in the human heart , which , touched , will sometimes utter dreadful discord  --  I beseech you  --  Bar . Baron Steinfort I understand you . I see you know how to conceal every thing except your perfections . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller My perfections , alas ! Rural music without , L. But I hear the happy tenantry announce the Count 's arrival .

When the Countess called him William  --  Oh ! she knew not that she plunged a poinard in my heart . I have a William too , who must be as tall as this , if he be still alive . Ah ! yes , if he be still alive . His little sister , too ! Why , fancy , dost thou rack me thus ? Why dost thou image my poor children , fainting in sickness , and crying to their mother ?

Countess Wintersen Well , if I am to be serious , I obey . I do not know who Mrs. Haller is , as I have already told you ; but what I do know of her , shall not be concealed from you . It may now be three years ago , when , one evening , about twilight , a lady was announced , who wished to speak with me in private . Mrs. Haller appeared , with all that grace and modesty which have enchanted you . Her features , at that moment , bore keener marks of the sorrow and confusion which have since settled into gentle melancholy . She threw herself at my feet ; and besought me to save a wretch who was on the brink of despair . She told me she had heard much of my benevolence , and offered herself as a servant to attend me . I endeavoured to dive into the cause of her sufferings , but in vain . She concealed her secret ; yet opening to me more and more each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an understanding improved by the most refined attainments . She no longer remained my servant , but became my friend , and , by her own desire , has ever since resided here . Curtseying . Brother , I have done . Bar . Baron Steinfort Too little to satisfy my curiosity ; yet enough to make me realize my project . Sister , lend me your aid  --  I would marry her . Countess . Countess Wintersen You ! Bar . Baron Steinfort I. Countess . Countess Wintersen Baron Steinfort ! Bar . Baron Steinfort For shame ! If I understand you . Countess . Countess Wintersen Not so harsh , and not so hasty ! Those great sentiments of contempt of inequality in rank are very fine in a romance ; but we happen not to be inhabitants of an ideal world . How could you introduce her to the circle we live in ? You surely would not attempt to present her to  --  Bar . Baron Steinfort Object as you will  --  my answer is  --  I love . Sister , you see a man before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife . Bar . Baron Steinfort No ; who has deliberately poised advantage against disadvantage ; domestic fase and comfort against the false gaieties of fashion . I can withdraw into the country . I need no honours to make my tenants happy ; and my heart will teach me to make their happiness my own . With such a wife as this , children who resemble her , and fortune enough to spread comfort around me , what would the soul of man have more ? Countess . Countess Wintersen This is all vastly fine . I admire your plan ; only you seem to have forgotten one trifling circumstance . Bar . Baron Steinfort And that is  --  Countess . Countess Wintersen Whether Mrs. Haller will have you or not . Bar . Baron Steinfort There , sister , I just want your assistance .  --  Good Henrietta . Countess . Countess Wintersen Well , here 's my hand . I 'll do all I can for you . St !  --  We had near been overheard . They are coming . Be patient and obedient . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his arm , L. They advance , C. Count . Count Wintersen Upon my word , Mrs. Haller , you are a nimble walker ; I should be sorry to run a race with you . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Custom , my lord . You need only take the same walk every day for a month . Count . Count Wintersen Yes ; if I wanted to resemble my greyhounds .  --  Well , what says the Stranger ? Countess . Countess Wintersen He gave Charlotte a flat refusal ; and you see his door , and even his shutters are closed against us . Count . Count Wintersen What an unaccountable being ! But it wo n't do . I must show my gratitude one way or other . Crosses to Steinfort . Steinfort , we will take the ladies home , and then you shall try once again to see him . You can talk to these oddities better than I can . Bar . Baron Steinfort If you wish it , with all my heart . Count . Count Wintersen Thank you , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countess &; Mrs. H. , Count &; Baron , thro ' Gates . Scene II .  --  A Chamber in the Castle . Enter Countess and Mrs. Haller , R. Countess . Countess Wintersen Well , Mrs. Haller , how do you like the man that just now left us ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Who do you mean , madam ? Countess . Countess Wintersen My brother . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller He deserves to be your brother . Countess . Countess Wintersen Curtseying . Your most obedient ! That shall be written in my pocket book . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Without flattery , then , madam , he appears to be most amiable . Countess . Countess Wintersen Good !  --  And a handsome man ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller With indifference . Oh , yes . Countess . Countess Wintersen " Oh , yes ! " It sounded almost like " Oh , no ! " But I must tell you , that he looks upon you to be a handsome woman . Mrs. Haller smiles . You make no reply to this ? Mrs. H. Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lips ; and I am little calculated to support it . Countess . Countess Wintersen As little as you are calculated to be the cause of it . No ;  --  I was in earnest .  --  Now ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller You confuse me !  --  But why should I play the prude ? I will own there was a time when I thought myself handsome . ' T is past . Alas ! The enchanting beauties of a female countenance arise from peace of mind  --  the look , which captivates an honorable man , must be reflected from a noble soul . Countess . Countess Wintersen Then Heaven grant my bosom may ever hold as pure a heart as now these eyes bear witness lives in yours . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller With sudden wildness . Oh ! Heaven forbid ! Countess . Countess Wintersen Astonished . How ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Checking her tears . Spare me ! I am a wretch . The sufferings of three years can give me no claim to your friendship  --  No , not even to your compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countess Wintersen Stay , Mrs. Haller . For the first time , I beg your confidence .  --  My brother loves you . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Starting and gazing full in the face of the Countess . For mirth , too much  --  for earnest , too mournful ! Countess . Countess Wintersen I revere that modest blush . Discover to me who you are . You risk nothing . Pour all your griefs into a sister 's bosom . Am I not kind ? And can I not be silent ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Alas ! But a frank reliance on a generous mind is the greatest sacrifice to be offered by true repentance . This sacrifice I will offer . Hesitating . Did you never hear  --  pardon me  --  did you never hear  --  Oh ! how shocking is it to unmask a deception , which alone has recommended me to your regard ! But it must be so .  --  Madam  --  Fie , Adelaide ! Does pride become you ? Did you ever hear of the Countess Waldbourg ? Countess . Countess Wintersen I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a creature . She plunged an honourable husband into misery . She ran away with a villain . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller She did indeed . Falls at the feet of the Countess . Do not cast me from you . Countess . Countess Wintersen For Heaven 's sake ! You are  --  Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I am that wretch . Countess . Countess Wintersen Turning from her with horror . Ha !  --  Begone ! Going , but her heart draws her back . Yet , she is unfortunate : she is unfriended ! Her image is repentance  --  Her life the proof . Be still awhile , remorseless prejudice , and let the genuine feelings of my soul avow  --  they do not truly honour virtue , who can insult the erring heart that would return to her sanctuary . Looking with sorrow on her . Rise , I beseech you , rise ! My husband and my brother may surprise us . I promise to be silent . Raising her . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Yes , you will be silent  --  But , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Clasping her hands . Do not cast me from you . Countess . Countess Wintersen Never ! Your lonely life , your silent anguish and contrition , may at length atone your crime . And never shall you want an asylum , where your penitence may lament your loss . Your fault was youth and inexperience ! your heart never was , never could be concerned in it . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh ! spare me ! My conscience never reproaches me so bitterly , as when I catch my base thoughts in search of an excuse ! No , nothing can palliate my guilt ; and the only just consolation left me , is to acquit the man I wronged , and own I erred without a cause of fair complaint . Countess . Countess Wintersen And this is the mark of true repentance . Alas ! my friend , when superior sense , recommended , too , by superior charms of person , assail a young though wedded  --  Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Ah ! not even that mean excuse is left me . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far , far beneath my husband . But to attempt to account for my strange infatuation  --  I can not bear it . I thought my husband 's manner grew colder to me . ' T is true , I knew that his expenses , and his confidence in deceitful friends , had embarrassed his means , and clouded his spirits ; yet I thought he denied me pleasures and amusements still within our reach . My vanity was mortified ! My confidence not courted . The serpent tongue of my seducer promised every thing . But never could such arguments avail , till , assisted by forged letters , and the treachery of a servant , whom I most confided in , he fixed my belief that my lord was false , and that all the coldness I complained of was disgust to me , and love for another  --  all his home retrenchments but the means of satisfying a rival 's luxury . Maddened with this conviction , ( conviction it was , for artifice was most ingenious in its proof , ) I left my children  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countess . Countess Wintersen But , with such a heart , my friend could not remain long in her delusion ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Long enough to make a sufficient penitence impossible . Oh , what were my sensations when the mist dispersed before my eyes ! I called for my husband , but in vain !  --  I listened for the prattle of my children , but in vain ! Countess . Countess Wintersen Embracing her . Here , here , on this bosom only shall your future tears be shed ; and may I , dear sufferer , make you again familiar with hope ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh ! impossible ! Countess . Countess Wintersen Have you never heard of your children ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Never . Countess . Countess Wintersen We must endeavor to gain some account of them . We must  --  Hold ! My husband and my brother ! Oh ! my poor brother ! I had quite forgotten him . Quick , dear Mrs. Haller , wipe your eyes . Let us meet them . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose myself .  --  Exit Countess , R. I pause !  --  Oh ! yes  --  to compose myself ! Ironically . She little thinks it is but to gain one solitary moment to vent my soul 's remorse . Once , the purpose of my unsettled mind was self-destruction . Heaven knows how I have sued for hope and resignation . I did trust my prayers were heard .  --  Oh ! spare me further trial ! I feel , I feel my heart and brain can bear no more . Exit , R. END OF ACT III ACT IV . Scene I.  --  The Skirts of the Park , Lodge , &; C. , as before . A Table , spread with Fruits , &; C. Francis discovered placing the Supper . Fra . Francis I know he loves to have his early supper in the fresh air ; and , while he sups , not that I believe any thing can amuse him , yet I will try my little Savoyard 's pretty voices . I have heard him speak as if he had loved music . Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L. , Annette and Claudine , playing on their Guitars . Ann . Annette To welcome mirth and harmless glee , We rambling minstrels , blithe and free , With song the laughing hours beguile , And wear a never fading smile : Where'er we roam , We find a home , And greeting , to reward our toil . Clau . Claudine No anxious griefs disturb our rest , Nor busy cares annoy our breast ; Fearless we sink in soft repose , While night her sable mantle throws . With grateful lay , Hail , rising day , That rosy health and peace bestows ! During the Duet , the Stranger looks from the Lodge window , and at the conclusion , comes out . Stra . Stranger ( R. ) What mummery is this ? Fra . Francis ( R. C. ) I hoped it might amuse you , sir . Stra . Stranger Amuse me  --  fool ! Fra . Francis Well , then , I wished to amuse myself a little . I do n't think my recreations are so very numerous . Stra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not . Let them go on .  --  I 'll listen . Retires and sits down , R. Fra . Francis But to please you , my poor master , I fear it must be a sadder strain .  --  Annette , have you none but these cheerful songs ? Ann . Annette O , plenty . If you are dolefully given , we can be as sad as night . I 'll sing you an air Mrs. Haller taught me , the first year she came to the Castle . Fra . Francis Mrs. Haller ! I should like to hear that . Ann . Annette I have a silent sorrow here , A grief I 'll ne'er impart ; It breathes no sigh , it sheds no tear , But it consumes my heart . This cherish 'd woe , this loved despair , My lot for ever be , So , my soul 's lord , the pangs I bear Be never known by thee ! And when pale characters of death Shall mark this alter 'd cheek , When my poor wasted trembling breath My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise my eyes to Heaven , Nor mercy ask for me ; My soul despairs to be forgiven , Unpardon 'd , love , by thee . Stra . Stranger Surprised and moved . Oh ! I have heard that air before , but ' t was with other words . Rises . Francis , share our supper with your friends  --  I need none . Enters the Lodge . Fra . Francis So I feared . Well , Crosses , C. my pretty favourites , here are refreshments.  --  Leads them to the table.  --  So , disturbed again ! Now will this gentleman call for more music , and make my master mad ! Go , go , and return when you observe this man is gone .  --  Exeunt , L. , Annette and Claudine , singing . Francis sits and eats.  --  I was in hopes that I might at least eat my supper peaceably in the open air ; but they follow at our heels like bloodhounds . Enter Baron from Gates . Bar .

Announce me . Fra . Francis Want no money . Bar . Baron Steinfort Well , only announce me , then . Fra . Francis Rising . I will announce you , sir ; but it wo n't avail ! I shall be abused , and you rejected . However , we can but try . Going . Bar . Baron Steinfort I only ask half a minute . Francis goes into the Lodge . But when he comes , how am I to treat him ? I never encountered a misanthrope before . I have heard of instructions as to conduct in society ; but how am I to behave towards a being who loathes the whole world , and his own existence , I have never learned . Enter the Stranger , from Lodge . Stra . Stranger ( R. ) Now ; what 's your will ? Bar . Baron Steinfort ( L. ) I beg pardon , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stranger Steinfort ! They embrace . Bar . Baron Steinfort Is it really you , my dear friend ? Stra . Stranger It is . Bar . Baron Steinfort Merciful Heavens ! How you are altered ! Stra . Stranger The hand of misery lies heavy on me . But how came you here ? What want you ? Bar . Baron Steinfort Strange ! Here was I ruminating how to address this mysterious recluse ; he appears , and proves to be my old and dearest friend . Stra . Stranger Then you were not in search of me , nor knew that I lived here ? Bar . Baron Steinfort As little as I know who lives on the summit of Caucasus . You this morning saved the life of my brother-in-law 's only son : a grateful family wishes to behold you in its circle . You refused my sister 's messenger ; therefore , to give more weight to the invitation , I was deputed to be the bearer of it . And thus has fortune restored to me a friend , whom my heart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much requires . Stra . Stranger Yes , I am your friend ; your sincere friend . You are a true man ; an uncommon man . Towards you , my heart is still the same . But if this assurance be of any value to you  --  go  --  leave me  --  and return no more . Bar . Baron Steinfort Stay ! All that I see and hear of you , is inexplicable . ' T is you ; but these , alas ! are not the features which once enchanted every female bosom , beamed gaiety through all society , and won you friends before your lips were opened ! Why do you avert your face ? Is the sight of a friend become hateful ? Or , do you fear that I should read in your eye what passes in your soul ? Where is that open look of fire , which at once penetrated into every heart and revealed your own ? Stra . Stranger With asperity . My look penetrate into every heart !  --  Ha ! ha ! ha ! Bar . Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you laugh , than in such a tone !  --  For Heaven 's sake , tell me , Charles ! tell me , I conjure you , what has happened to you ? Stra . Stranger Things that happen every day ; occurrences heard of in every street . Steinfort , if I am not to hate you , ask me not another question . If I am to love you , leave me . Bar . Baron Steinfort Oh , Charles ! awake the faded ideas of past joys . Feel that a friend is near . Recollect the days we passed in Hungary , when we wandered arm in arm upon the banks of the Danube , while nature opened our hearts , and made us enamored of benevolence and friendship . In those blessed moments , you gave me this seal as a pledge of your regard . Do you remember it ? Stra . Stranger Yes . Bar . Baron Steinfort Am I , since that time , become less worthy of your confidence ? Stra . Stranger No ! Bar . Baron Steinfort Charles ! it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights upon you . Do you know this scar ?

Baron Steinfort Speak , then , I beseech you . Stra . Stranger You can not help me . Bar . Baron Steinfort Then I can mourn with you . Stra . Stranger That I hate . Besides , I can not weep . Bar . Baron Steinfort Then give me words instead of tears . Both relieve the heart . Stra . Stranger Relieve the heart ! My heart is like a close-shut sepulchre . Let what is within it , moulder and decay . Why , why open the wretched charnel-house to spread a pestilence around ? Bar . Baron Steinfort How horrid are your looks ! For shame ! A man like you thus to crouch beneath the chance of fortune ! Stra . Stranger Steinfort !

Listen  --  Much misery may be contained in few words ! Attracted by my native country , I quitted you and the service . What pleasing pictures did I form of a life employed in improving society and diffusing happiness ! I fixed on Cassel to be my abode . All went on admirably . I found friends . At length , too , I found a wife ; a lovely , innocent creature , scarce sixteen years of age . Oh ! how I loved her ! She bore me a son and a daughter . Both were endowed by nature with the beauty of their mother . Ask me not how I loved my wife and children ! Yes ; then , then I was really happy . Wiping his eyes . Ha ! a tear !

Contentment needs but little . I forgave him . Another friend  --  a villain ! to whom I was attached heart and soul ; whom I had assisted with my means , and promoted by my interest , this fiend ! seduced my wife , and bore her from me . Tell me , sir , is this enough to justify my hatred of mankind , and palliate my seclusion from the world ?  --  Kings , laws , tyranny , or guilt , can but imprison me , or kill me . But , O God ! O God ! Oh ! what are chains or death , compared to the tortures of a deceived , yet doting husband ! Crosses , L. Bar . Baron Steinfort To lament the loss of a faithless wife is madness . Stra .

Stra . Stranger I left them at a small town hard by . Bar . Baron Steinfort But why did you not keep your children with you ! They would have amused you in many a dreary hour . Stra . Stranger Amused me ! Oh , yes ! while their likeness to their mother , should every hour remind me of my past happiness ! No . For three years I have never seen them . I hate that any human creature should be near me , young or old ! Had not ridiculous habit made a servant necessary , I should never have engaged him , though he is not the worst among the bad . Bar . Baron Steinfort Such too often are the consequences of great alliances . Therefore , Charles , I have resolved to take a wife from a lower rank of life . Stra . Stranger You marry ! Bar . Baron Steinfort You shall see her . She is in the house where you are expected . Come with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ! Bar . Baron Steinfort To do a generous action without requiring thanks is noble and praiseworthy . But so obstinately to avoid those thanks , as to make the kindness a burthen , is affectation . Stra .

As long as there remains a bird in these woods to greet the rising sun with its melody I shall court no other society . Crosses R. Bar .

There are not ten dozen bottles left ; and not a drop has gone down my throat , I 'll swear . Bar . Baron Steinfort Smiling . Mrs. Haller has not drank it , I suppose ? Sol . Mr. Solomon Not she herself , for she never drinks wine . But if anybody be ill in the village , any poor woman lying-in , away goes a bottle of the six-and-twenty ! Innumerable are the times that I 've reproved her ; but she always answers me snappishly , that she will be responsible for it . Bar . Baron Steinfort So will I , Mr. Solomon . Sol . Mr. Solomon Oh ! with all my heart , your Honourable Lordship . It makes no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years , and can safely take my oath , that I never gave the poor a single drop in the whole course of my life . Bar .

To-morrow , you may see her sitting with all the women in the village . To be sure , she and I agree pretty well ; for between me and your Honourable Lordship , she has cast as eye upon my son Peter . Bar . Baron Steinfort Has she ? Sol . Mr. Solomon Yes  --  Peter 's no fool , I assure you . The schoolmaster is teaching him to write . Would your Honourable Lordship please to see a specimen ? I 'll go for his copybook .

I have letters from Leghorn , Cape Horn , and every known part of the habitable globe . Exit , L. Bar . Baron Steinfort Tedious old fool ! Yet hold . Did he not speak in praise of Mrs. Haller ? Pardoned be his rage for news and politics . Enter Countess , R. Well , sister , have you spoken to her ? Countess .

There is no art in conquering us poor devils ; but this strange man who does not care a doit for you all together , is worth your efforts . Try your skill . I sha n't be jealous . Countess . Countess Wintersen I allow the conquest to be worth the trouble . But what Mrs. Haller has not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh , madam , he has given me no opportunity of trying the force of my charms , for I never once happened to see him . Count . Count Wintersen Then he 's a blockhead ; and you an idler . Sol . Mr. Solomon Without , L. This way , sir ! This way ! Enter Solomon , L. Sol . Mr. Solomon The Stranger begs leave to have the honour  --  Count . Count Wintersen Welcome ! Welcome ! Exit Solomon . Runs to meet the Stranger , whom he conducts in by the hand . My dear sir  --  Lady Wintersen  --  Mrs. Haller  --  Mrs. Haller , as soon as she sees the Stranger , shricks , and swoons in the arms of the Baron . The Stranger casts a look at her , and , struck with astonishment and horror , rushes out of the room , L. The Baron and Countess bear Mrs. Haller off , R. ; Count following in great surprise .

Wretched Steinfort ! The mystery is solved . She is the wife of my friend ! I can not myself be happy ; but I may , perhaps , be able to reunite two lovely souls whom cruel fate has severed . Ha ! they are here . I must propose it instantly . Enter Countess and Mrs. Haller , R. Countess . Countess Wintersen Into the garden , my dear friend ! Into the air ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I am quite well . Do not alarm yourselves on my account . Bar . Baron Steinfort Madam , pardon my intrusion ; but to lose a moment may be fatal . He means to quit the country to-morrow . We must devise means to reconcile you to the Stranger . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller How , my lord ! You seem acquainted with my history ? Bar . Baron Steinfort I am . Waldbourg has been my friend ever since we were boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been separated seven years . Chance brought us this day together , and his heart was open to me . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller How do I feel what it is to be in the presence of an honest man , when I dare not meet his eye . Bar . Baron Steinfort If sincere repentance , if years without reproach , do not give us a title to man 's forgiveness , what must we expect hereafter ? No , lovely penitent ! your contrition is complete . Error for a moment wrested from slumbering virtue the dominion of your heart ; but she awoke , and , with a look , banished her enemy forever . I know my friend . He has the firmness of a man ; but , with it , the gentlest feelings of your sex . I hasten to him . With the fire of pure , disinterested friendship will I enter on this work ; that , when I look back upon my past life , I may derive from this good action consolation in disappointment , and even resignation in despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Oh , stay ! What would you do ? No ! never ! My husband 's honour is sacred to me . I love him unutterably : but never , never can I be his wife again ; even if he were generous enough to pardon me . Bar . Baron Steinfort Madam ! Can you , Countess , be serious ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Not that title , I beseech you ! I am not a child who wishes to avoid deserved punishment . What were my penitence , if I hoped advantage from it beyond the consciousness of atonement for past offence ? Countess . Countess Wintersen But if your husband himself ?  --  Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh ! he will not ! he can not ! And let him rest assured I never would replace my honour at the expense of his . Bar . Baron Steinfort He still loves you . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Loves me ! Then he must not  --  no  --  he must purify his heart from a weakness which would degrade him ! Bar . Baron Steinfort Incomparable woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time ! Have you not one word to send him ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Yes , I have two requests to make . Often , when , in excess of grief , I have despaired of every consolation , I have thought I should be easier if I might behold my husband once again , acknowledge my injustice to him , and take a gentle leave of him forever . This , therefore , is my first request  --  a conversation for a few short minutes , if he does not quite abhor the sight of me . My second request is  --  Oh  --  not to see , but to hear some account of my poor children . Bar . Baron Steinfort If humanity and friendship can avail , he will not for a moment delay your wishes . Countess . Countess Wintersen Heaven be with you ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller And my prayers . Exit Baron , L. Countess . Countess Wintersen Come , my friend , come into the air , till he returns with hope and consolation . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My little ones ! Past joys and future fears .  --  Oh , dearest madam , there are moments in which we live years ! moments which steal the roses from the cheek of health , and plough deep furrows in the brow of youth . Countess . Countess Wintersen Banish these sad reflections . Crosses , L.  --  Come , let us walk . The sun will set soon ; let nature 's beauties dissipate anxiety . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Alas ! Yes , the setting sun is a proper scene for me . Countess . Countess Wintersen Never forget that a morning will succeed . Exeunt L. Scene II .  --  The Skirts of the Park , Lodge , &c.,; as before . Enter Baron , from Gates . Bar . Baron Steinfort On earth , there is but one such pair . They shall not be parted . Yet what I have undertaken is not so easy as I at first hoped . What can I answer when he asks me , whether I would persuade him to renounce his character , and become the derision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is a dishonor ! and to forgive her , is to share her shame . What though Adelaide may be an exception ; a young deluded girl , who has so long and so sincerely repented ; yet what cares an unfeeling world for this ? The world ! He has quitted it . ' T is evident he loves her still ; and upon this assurance builds my sanguine heart the hope of a happy termination to an honest enterprise . Enter Francis with two children , William and Amelia , R. Fra . Francis ( R. C. ) Come along , my pretty ones  --  come . Will . William ( L. C. ) Is it far to home ? Fra . Francis No , we shall be there directly now . Bar . Baron Steinfort ( L. ) Hold ! Whose children are these ? Fra . Francis My master 's . Will . William Is that my father ? Bar . Baron Steinfort It darts like lightning through my brain . A word with you . Francis puts the children a little back . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your master has found his wife again . Fra . Francis Indeed ! Glad to hear it . Bar . Baron Steinfort Mrs. Haller  --  Fra . Francis Is she his wife ? Still more glad to hear it . Bar . Baron Steinfort But he is determined to go from her . Fra . Francis Oh ! Bar . Baron Steinfort We must try to prevent it . Fra . Francis Surely . Bar . Baron Steinfort The unexpected appearance of the children may perhaps assist us . Fra . Francis How so ? Bar . Baron Steinfort Hide yourself with them in that hut . Before a quarter of an hour is passed , you shall know more . Fra . Francis But  --  Bar . Baron Steinfort No more questions , I entreat you . Time is precious . Fra . Francis Well , well : questions are not much in my way . Come , children . Takes them in each hand . Will . William Why , I thought you told me I should see my father ? Fra . Francis So you shall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hut with the Children , L. U. E. Bar . Baron Steinfort Excellent ! I promise myself much from this little artifice . If the mild look of the mother fails , the innocent smiles of these , his own children , will surely find the way to his heart . Taps at the Lodge door : the Stranger comes out . Charles , I wish you joy . Stra . Stranger Of what ? Bar . Baron Steinfort You have found her again . Stra . Stranger Show a bankrupt the treasure which he once possessed , and then congratulate him on the amount ! Bar . Baron Steinfort Why not , if it be in your power to retrieve the whole ? Stra . Stranger I understand you : you are a negociator from my wife . It wo n't avail . Bar . Baron Steinfort Learn to know your wife better . Yes , I am a messenger from her ; but without power to treat . She , who loves you unutterably , who without you never can be happy , renounces your forgiveness ; because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weakness Stra . Stranger Pshaw ! I am not to be caught . Bar . Baron Steinfort Charles ! consider well  --  Stra . Stranger Steinfort , let me explain all this . I have lived here three years . Adelaide knew it . Bar . Baron Steinfort Knew it ! She never saw you till to-day . Stra . Stranger That you may make fools believe . Hear further : she knows , too , that I am not a common sort of man ; that my heart is not to be attacked in the usual manner . She , therefore , framed a deep-concerted plan . She played a charitable part ; but in such a way , that it always reached my ears . She played a pious , modest , reserved part , in order to excite my curiosity . And , at last , to-day she plays the prude . She refuses my forgiveness , in hopes , by this generous device , to extort it from my compassion . Bar . Baron Steinfort Charles ! I have listened to you with astonishment . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has so often been deceived by the world . Your wife has expressly and steadfastly declared , that she will not accept your forgiveness , even if you yourself were weak enough to offer it . Stra . Stranger What then has brought you hither ? Bar . Baron Steinfort More than one reason . First , I am come in my own name , as your friend and comrade , to conjure you solemnly not to spurn this creature from you ; for , by my soul , you will not find her equal . Stra . Stranger Give yourself no further trouble . Bar . Baron Steinfort Be candid , Charles . You love her still ? Stra . Stranger Alas ! yes . Bar . Baron Steinfort Her sincere repentance has long since obliterated her crime . Stra . Stranger Sir ! a wife , once induced to forfeit her honour , must be capable of a second crime . Bar . Baron Steinfort Not so , Charles . Ask your heart what portion of the blame may be your own . Stra . Stranger Mine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry a thoughtless inexperienced girl ? One scarce expects established principles at five-and-twenty in a man , yet you require them in a girl of sixteen ! But of this no more . She has erred ; she has repented ; and , during three years , her conduct has been so far above reproach , that even the piercing eye of calumny has not discovered a speck upon this radiant orb . Stra . Stranger Now , were I to believe all this  --  and I confess I would willingly believe it  --  yet she can never again be mine . Ah ! what a feast would it be for the painted dolls and vermin of the world , when I appeared among them with my runaway wife upon my arm ! What mocking , whispering , pointing !  --  Never ! Never ! Never ! Crosses , L. Bar . Baron Steinfort Enough ! As a friend I have done my duty ; I now appear as Adelaide 's ambassador . She requests one moment 's conversation : she wishes once again to see you , and never more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last request . Stra . Stranger I understand this too : she thinks my firmness will be melted by her tears : she is mistaken . She may come . Bar . Baron Steinfort She will come to make you feel how much you mistake her . I go for her . Stra . Stranger Another word . Bar . Baron Steinfort Another word ! Stra . Stranger Give her this paper , and these jewels . They belong to her . Presenting them . Bar . Baron Steinfort That you may do yourself . Exit at Gate , C. Stra . Stranger The last anxious moment of my life draws near . I shall see her once again ; I shall see her on whom my soul doats . Is this the language of an injured husband ? What is this principle which we call honor ? Is it a feeling of the heart , or a quibble in the brain ? I must be resolute : it can not now be otherwise . Let me speak solemnly , yet mildly ; and beware that nothing of reproach escape my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Gates . Yes , her penitence is real , it is real . She shall not be obliged to live in mean dependence : she shall be mistress of herself , she shall  --  Ha ! they come . Awake , insulted pride ! Protect me , injured honour ! Gets over to R. of Stage . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Advances slowly , and in a tremour , L. Countess attempts to support her . Leave me now , I beseech you . Baron and Countess retire into the hut , L. U. E. Approaches the Stranger , who , with averted countenance , and in extreme agitation , awaits her address . My lord ! Stra . Stranger With gentle tremulous utterance , and face still turned away . What would you with me , Adelaide ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Much agitated . No  --  for Heaven 's sake ! I was not prepared for this  --  Adelaide !  --  No , no . For Heaven 's sake !  --  Harsh words alone are suited to a culprit 's ear . Stra . Stranger Endeavoring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Mrs. Haller Oh ! If you will ease my heart , if you will spare and pity me , use reproaches . Stra . Stranger Reproaches ! Here they are ; here on my sallow cheek  --  here in my hollow eye  --  here in my faded form . These reproaches I could not spare you . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Were I a hardened sinner , this forbearance would be charity : but I am a suffering penitent , and it overpowers me ! Alas ! then I must be the herald of my own shame . For where shall I find peace till I have eased my soul by my confession . Stra . Stranger No confession , madam . I release you from every humiliation . I perceive you feel that we must part forever . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I know it . Nor come I here to supplicate your pardon ; nor has my heart contained a ray of hope that you would grant it . All I dare ask , is , that you will not curse my memory . Stra . Stranger No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse you . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller From the inward conviction that I am unworthy of your name , I have , during three years , abandoned it . But this is not enough ; you must have that redress which will enable you to choose another  --  another wife ; in whose chaste arms may Heaven protect your hours of bliss ! This paper will be necessary for the purpose ; it contains a written acknowledgment of my guilt . Offers it , trembling . Stra . Stranger Tearing it . Perish the record for ever !  --  No , Adelaide , you only have possessed my heart ; and I am not ashamed to own it , you alone will reign there forever .  --  Your own sensations of virtue , your resolute honour , forbid you to profit by my weakness ; and even if  --  this is beneath a man ! But  --  never  --  will another fill Adelaide 's place here . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Then nothing now remains but that one sad , hard , just word  --  farewell ! Going , L. Stra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , without knowing it , lived near each other . I have learnt much good of you . You have a heart open to the wants of your fellow creatures . I am happy that it is so . You shall not be without the power of gratifying your benevolence . I know you have a spirit that must shrink from a state of obligation . This paper , to which the whole remnant of my fortune is pledged , secures you independence , Adelaide ; and let the only recommendation of the gift be , that it will administer to you the means of indulging in charity the divine propensity of your nature . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Never ! To the labor of my hands alone will I owe my sustenance . A morsel of bread , moistened with the tear of penitence , will suffice my wishes , and exceed my merits . It would be an additional reproach , to think that I served myself , or even others , from the bounty of the man whom I had so deeply injured . Stra . Stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Haller I have deserved this . But I throw myself upon your generosity . Have compassion on me ! Stra . Stranger Aside . Villain ! Of what a woman hast thou robbed me !  --  Puts up the paper . Well , madam , I respect your sentiments and withdraw my request ; but on condition , that if ever you shall be in want of anything , I may be the first and only person in the world to whom you will make your application . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller I promise it , my lord . Stra . Stranger And now I may , at least , desire you to take back what is your own  --  your jewels . Gives her the casket . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Opens it , and weeps . How well do I recollect the sweet evening when you gave me these ! That evening my father joined our hands ; and joyfully I pronounced the oath of eternal fidelity .  --  It is broken . This locket you gave me on my birth-day.  --  That was a happy day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were !  --  This bracelet I received after my William was born !  --  No ! Take them  --  take them  --  I can not take these , unless you wish that the sight of them should be an incessant reproach to my almost broken heart . Gives them back . Stra . Stranger I must go . My soul and pride will hold no longer . Farewell . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Oh ! But one minute more ! An answer to but one more question .  --  Feel for a mother 's heart !  --  Are my children still alive ? Stra . Stranger Yes , they are alive . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller And well ? Stra . Stranger Yes , they are well . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller Heaven be praised ! William must be much grown ? Stra . Stranger I believe so . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller What ! Have you not seen them , then ? And little Amelia , is she still your favorite ? The Stranger , who is in violent agitation throughout this scene , remains in silent contention between honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to behold them once again !  --  Let me once more kiss the features of their father in his babes , and I will kneel to you , and part with them forever . She kneels  --  he raises her . Stra . Stranger Willingly , Adelaide ! This very night . I expect the children every minute . They have been brought up near this spot . I have already sent my servant for them . He might , ere this time , have returned . I pledge my word to send them to the Castle as soon as they arrive . There , if you please , they may remain till daybreak to-morrow : then they must go with me . The Countess and Baron , having re-entered and listened to the whole conversation with the warmest sympathy , exchange signals . Baron goes into the Hut , and soon returns with the Children . He gives the Girl to the Countess , who places herself behind the Stranger . He himself walks with the Boy behind Mrs. Haller . Mrs. H. Mrs. Haller In this world , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Forget a wretch who never will forget you .  --  Let me press this hand once more to my lips  --  this hand which once was mine . And when my penance shall have broken my heart ,  --  when we again meet in a better world  --  Stra . Stranger There , Adelaide , you may be mine again . Stra . Mrs. H. Stranger , Mrs. Haller Oh ! Oh ! Parting . But , as they are going , she encounters the Boy , and he the Girl . Children . Children Dear father ! Dear mother ! They press the Children in their arms with speechless affection ; then tear themselves away  --  gaze at each other  --  spread their arms and rush into an embrace .
