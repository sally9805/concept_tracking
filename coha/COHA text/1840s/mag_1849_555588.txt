txt CONSIDERING how highly every age has prized the history and biography of previous times , it is matter of surprise that there are not always found those who systematically record // passing events and delineate living characters . Fame is , indeed , in a good degree , an affair of distance . It is difficult for friends , associates , or contemporaries to be sure that actions or events , which arise from the present condition of things , will seem as important to posterity as to those who have an immediate interest in the emergencies which gave them birth . But the desire to know what has been done and said by those who have gone before us - who helped to prepare the world for the coming of our day - is so universal , and we are so often vexed to think we know so little , that it seems wonderful that mere sympathy should not lead us to prepare pleasant things of this sort for the people whose pioneers we are . How delicious are the bits of private history now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How we pounce upon some quaint diary , some old hoard of seemingly insig .. nificant letters , some enlightening passage in an old author , who little suspected his blunt quill of playing the part of an elucidator of history ! What could repay the world for the withdrawal from its knowledge of the straight-forward fibs of Sir John Mandeville , illustrative as they are of the state of general credulity in his day ? Or of Pepys 's Diary , or Horace Walpole 's , or Madame de Sevigne 's letters , or Bozzy 's inestimable jottings ? Each and every generation lives in " a very remarkable age , ** and it is obviously a high moral duty of somebody to write it down circumstantially for the benefit of those who are destined , through its preparing influence , to enter upon experiences still more remarkable . Yet when we would seek materials for the minute private history of a time , in the bosom of whose common life were contained the characterizing elements of this great empire , - as the rich satin folds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that humble piece of domesticity , an onion , - we are obliged to search as if for the proverbial needle ; to dive into family records , dim with the dust of time , or useless from the suspicious coloring of pride or affection ; to call upon the East and the West , the North and the South , to rummage the memory-garrets of their " oldest inhabitants ; " in short , to pick , as it were , from thorns and briers by the way-side , stray locks of the material which should have been carded and spun by the growers , ready for the weaving skill of the present day . // Mrs. Ellet has performed this not easy task with a care and patience which deserve to be called pious . Setting out with a hearty interest in the subject , and fitted , by previous study and acquaintance with the particulars of our early history , to judge of the authenticity of the new information she might obtain from private sources , she explored every part of the United States , either personally or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass of anecdote and reminiscence , she verified every particular , which was in any way connected with public events , by the most sedulous examination of accredited records . Many public and private libraries can bear testimony to the conscientious perseverance with which Mrs. Ellet sought confirmation or correction of the information afforded her from private sources ; and if the result has not proved entirely free from error , it must be conceded that the industry and faithfulness of the biographer are worthy of all praise . Why with all the just pride which we , as a nation , feel in the peculiarly quiet heroism , the heroism of home , called forth by the circumstances of the Revolution , circumstances which afforded especial opportunity for the display , or rather the exercise , of female heroism , - why no one before Mrs. Ellet had thought of erecting the best of all monuments for the women of the Revolution , it is difficult to imagine . We have talked of the mother of Washington ; of Mrs. Adams , and Mrs. Motte , and Mrs. Schuyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a careless , generalizing way , acknowledged the importance of feminine devotion and self-sacrifice during the war ; but unless some one had conceived the happy thought of committing to enduring print , just now , all we know of these and the rest of our revolutionary mothers , our children and grandchildren , after inquiring in vain whether there had been any revolutionary mothers , and coming to the rational conclusion that such a revolution must , from its very nature , have owed much to women , might properly have accused us of either the silliest carelessness or the darkest ingratitude . We say just now , because the scantiness of the materials brought to light by Mrs. Ellet 's researches , and the difficulty of finding them , scanty as they are , justify the conclusion that another age of indifference would have consigned all authentic memories of individual // women , whose heroism bore upon our success in the struggle with England , to hopeless oblivion . To have undertaken the work at all , then , entitles the author to our gratitude ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history be invented in future times , rendering research valueless and facts superfluous ; deducing conduct from circumstances and character from results ; showing how things must have been ; in short , inventing history by means of a new and triumphant philosophy , some inklings of which have already appeared in our day , - we can hardly doubt that works like that before us will bear even a higher value in the appreciation of posterity than in our own . No one perhaps will question , that the women of the Revolution bore a far larger share of its actual hardships and suffer ings than the men . The life afield , shorn though it may be of home comforts , has its poetry , its inspirations , its heroic element , for compensation of its ills . The very physical influence of duties performed in the open air , - of excitement , exercise , variety , and liberty , is enlivening and invigorating to mind and body reciprocally . Military discipline , - the stimulus of command and of subordination , of regularity , of enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits in a somewhat equable , if not elated state , and to keep sad personal thoughts at bay . Activity , having a direct bearing upon the great object in view , keeps up the heart more easily and more steadily than quieter service can . It is , indeed , an attainment in philosophy to have , and to be consoled and sustained by , the feeling that " They also serve who only stand anil wait . " To do is the great pleasure of life ; to suffer , or to be passive , is a sustained effort of self-denial . It was to this difficult service that the women of the Revolution were called . The hard labor of waiting , in patient anxiety and a composure that did not exclude agony , while husbands , sons , fathers , brothers , went in search of danger , called forth fortitude and faith far beyond that required for night-watches under snowy skies , or forced marches without shoes . To follow with heart and eye , day after day , the ebbing life of a darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blow that hung over him , drew more 31 * // severely upon the springs of life and hope than a wound in a skirmish or a baffled enterprise . The women 's lot , in those times , was the ingenious prolongation of torture with which the savage takes care not to kill , - torture that would nerve the impatient soul to pray for a bullet , rather than to dread it . To prepare a loved one for the camp and the battle , to see him depart , yet withhold the protest that nature must prompt , were enough ; how much more was it to combat his own misgivings at the thought of leaving lonely and unprotected his dearer than life ; to nerve his heart for the strife by a deep sympathy in his sense of wrong ; to send him forth , in the spirit of the Greek matron , with a charge to return with his shield or upon it ! The noble qualities called forth by circumstances such as these excite the imagination and thrill the heart , till we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl throws herself between a threatening pistol and her father 's body , and by her intrepidity preserves him from butchery ; and again , when she is threatened with death if she refuses to give information of the course taken by a party of her countrymen , bares her bosom to the shot of a brutal marauder , who is only prevented from murder by the shame or the humanity of a comrade who strikes up his weapon . A wife , who has seen her husband shot down by a musket levelled over her own shoulder as she entreated for his life , afterwards keeps watch over his blood-stained corpse in a lonely house , in the midst of enemies , resolute to protect the precious remains from further outrage . A war of invasion , whose success depended upon the devastation it might be able to carry into private homes , fell , of course , very heavily upon women , and awakened a spirit and called forth a resistance which are habitually foreign to the sex . The peculiarly feminine quality of fortitude was warmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the necessity of caring for the absent , produced prudence and awakened ingenuity ; all frivolous interests were thrown out of sight by the continual presence of important duties ; in short , woman was forced , by the dread power of necessity , into the exercise of those noble qualities with which her Maker endowed her when he gave her to be the helpmeet of man , - qualities too generally allowed to lie dormant under the circumstances of common life , or suppressed // because man , the ruler of her destiny , approves rather the lighter graces which threaten no competition in his own peculiar sphere of self-complacency . The impression left by this simple record of woman 's part in the revolutionary struggle is that of the general tone of feeling rather than of particular incidents of heroism. ; we remember not so much that particular women did or suffered particular things , as that the whole tone of female society was raised . The standard of behavior was a heroic one ; the emulation was no longer who should be most fastidious and dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicate woman , which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness , " - so favorite a role ordinarily , that women will endure much rather than appear able to endure any thing ; - but who should utterly put away self , forget privileges , forego indulgences , encounter dangers ; who should bind up wounds , walk noisome hospitals , convey intelligence , defend the obnoxious . It seems , truly , to have been woman who held the keys of the precious reservoir of Hope from which was drawn strength to endure to the end . Invaders , far away from their wives and daughters , may fight perfunctorily and fail ; men drawn up in defence of their own firesides , and receiving ever new supplies of energy and assurance from the home stores , are irresistible . But it is time to turn from our general view of the influence of woman upon the great contest , to the contemplation of particular characters and incidents , as sketched by Mrs. Ellet . And we begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key-note of this high harmony when she gave her faultless son to his country without a tremor ; and who afterwards uttered as a comment upon the homage offered him by a grateful nation - " George was always a good boy . " The Spartan simplicity and dignity of this matron make her memoir the most striking one in the collection . If without injury to the sterner features of this character , it were possible to infuse among its elements some of the lighter feminine graces , we could find it in our hearts to advise our young countrywomen to study it as the type of American womanhood . In the traits of many of the heroines of the earlier days of the Revolution , we find a remarkable union of strength and // softness , courage and refinement , simplicity and shrewdness , the fruit of patriotic sentiments engrafted on the habits and acquirements of aristocratic society . Mrs. Reed , Mrs. Schuyler , Mrs. Warren , Mrs. Montgomery , and many others , were of this class of women . Their adventures are less striking , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom circumstances brought into more conspicuous relation with the war . Mrs. Knox was perhaps the most splendid of these ladies , both on account of her elegance of person and manner , and the strength and perseverance of her character . Her position in society was next to that of Mrs. Washington , ever her intimate friend ; and the aged officers who still survive , and love to talk of the scenes and adventures of that day , never fail to speak of Mrs. Knox , of her beauty , her wit , her gay and free manners , and the kindly and hospitable manner in which she knew how to entertain guests of every degree . Mrs. Ellet says : - " In various journals we find the presence of Mrs. Knox noticed in camp . Chastellux describes the hut on a small farm where she lived with her children , a short distance from head-quarters at Verplanck 's Point . Whenever her health permitted , she fol. lowed the army ; and it is represented that her presence and cheerful manners did much to diffuse contentment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privations which she endured without complaint There is reason to believe that General Knox often deferred to his wife 's judgment , regarding her as a superior being ; and it is said that her influence and superiority were owned by Washington him . self . Her mind was undoubtedly of a high order , and her char. acter a remarkable one . She appears to have possessed an ascendency over all with whom she associated . " Like other women of marked intellectual power , who are rendered conspicuous by station , Mrs. Knox excited envy , and became occasionally the subject of severe and ungenerous comment . Her very frankness , the result of conscious strength and honesty , was turned against her by petty minds . Thus , a traditional speech of hers , in the decline of life , purporting that , if she could live her life over again , she would be " more of a wife , more of a mother , more of a woman ' than she had been , has been interpreted as an expression of remorse ; while , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was doubtless prompted by the spirit of humility , which implies a recognition of the highest and purest motives of conduct . Lest this remark and others , exceedingly natural and praiseworthy , currently ascribed to Mrs. Knox , should be misconstrued to the disadvantage of a distinguished woman , whose candor and modesty were enhanced , in the decline of life , by the adoption of a religious standard of action , we venture to insert a passage or two from a private letter , written by a still surviving daughter , who feels a daughter 's interest in the memory of a beloved mother , while she carefully disclaims all wish to make one so loved pass for " The faultless monster whom the world ne'er saw . " " I claim for my mother no perfection of character ; she undoubtedly had her share of the failings which attach to us all . I am very conscious that the partiality of friends , and particularly of children , is too apt to give a brighter coloring to the character of those who were so dear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , I would say , that while ample justice is done , as I think , to my mother 's intellectual powers , which were undoubtedly of a superior order , and gave her a commanding influence in society , it may not perhaps be equally acknowledged that she had heart as well as mind . Those who knew her inti ' mately would , I firmly believe , bear full testimony to the warmth of her domestic attachments . A more devoted wife and mother I never knew . The keenest sorrows of her life sprung from this source . It was the will of God to take from her nine of her twelve children , previous to the still greater trial of parting with the husband of her youth , the friend and companion of many eventful years , and many scenes of joy and sorrow ; and the anguish she endured on these trying occasions gave abundant evidence that her heart was feelingly alive to the tender and sacred claims of wife and mother . Yet I think it very probable , that in the retrospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many duties imperfectly performed- instances innumerable in which a different course ought to have been pursued . Feelings like these I have often heard her express , and can now most fully sympathize with . Her lot was cast in the midst of all that was most attractive in our land ; yet I do not believe in its busiest scenes she ever lost sight of her more private and indispensable duties . " // With regard to the early life of General and Mrs. Knox , the same lady , whose letters do honor to herself and to the parents of whom she preserves so vivid and pious a memory , says , - " My father was then moving in a comparatively humble sphere . Deprived of his own father while yet a boy , his energies were called into early action for the supply of his own wants , and yet more , those of an excellent mother , to whom he was strongly attached , and of a young brother , to whom he was a father through life . At the beginning of his acquaintance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few of which Boston then could boast ; and as she was a young lady of literary taste , the nature of his employment combined with other attractions to draw her frequently there . That she was first prepossessed by his fine figure in military costume , there can be no doubt ; but she was not long in discovering that this was not his only or principal recommendation . His engaging manners , wellfurnished mind , and warm heart soon confirmed and strengthened the favorable impression first created by external advantages . She found , too , that their feelings and views on most points coincided ; and although differentLy educated , that there were many bonds of sympathy between them . On the great absorbing question which then agitated the public mind , they very soon learned to think and feel alike ; how far his opinions influenced hers , I know not ; but certain it is that she early entered , heart and soul , into the cause of her oppressed country , and identified herself thenceforward with its interests They joined General Washington at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to Canada for cannon , ( left by the English at Ticonderoga and Crown Point , ) inwhich our army was deplorably deficient , was thenceforth the commander of that branch of the service throughout the war , which kept him constantly near his beloved commander-in-chief . My mother was naturally brought much into contact with Mrs. Washington , who was generally with the army when circumstances permitted , although not so constantly , I have understood , as my mother , who was always located as near as possible to the scene of action , that she might receive the earliest intelligence , and be at hand if evil occurred My parents were both of a cheerful , sanguine temperament , and in the darkest scenes of the war felt strong confidence that all would be eventually well . These sentiments are frequently expressed in letters which passed between them at this period . " // The letters here alluded to are at present in possession of a gentleman who has undertaken a life of General Knox . When he shall have completed his task , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and character of Mrs. Knox will also be brought before the public , since a woman of so much mark can scarcely have failed unconsciously to delineate herself in her easy private letters . After the conclusion of the war , and when the services of General Knox were no longer required by the country , he retired to a splendid country residence in Maine , where his wife assisted him in dispensing a hospitality such as this country has seldom seen . It is said to have been not unusual with them to kill an ox and twenty sheep on Monday morning , to be consumed in the course of the week by a concourse of guests for whom a hundred beds were daily made . Among the visitors entertained here were the Duc de Liancourt , who was , as he said , heir to three dukedoms , yet without a suit of clothes to his back , until supplied by General Knox ; Talleyrand , who pretended that it was impossible for him to learn English , while he had two masters and was believed to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his friend Mrs. Knox , when he visited this country as " the nation 's guest ; " and many others , who have figured on the stage of history . At Boston , Louis Philippe and his brothers , the Ducs de Montpensier and de Charolais , had been frequent visitors at the house of General Knox , and found solace in the friendship of its fair mistress ; and at all times and in all places where this happy couple resided , their society was sought by the great , the patriotic , and the distinguished . Speaking of the Maine residence , the letter from which we have already quoted says - " My mother , I think , was never more entirely satisfied with her situation . Her greatest trouble was , that the retirement she anticipated was far from being realized . My father 's hospitable propensities still induced him to open his doors to all who were disposed to visit him ; and as every thing that could interest or amuse was liberally provided , we were often favored much longer than was desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no possible claim . It was to some such visitors as these , I doubt not , that my mother may have appeared distant and haughty . Such instances I well recollect , particu. // larly when these unasked visits were unreasonably prolonged ; but those whom she liked , or was at all interested in , would have given her a far different character . " We have dwelt thus upon the character of Mrs. Knox , because , although there was no woman except Mrs. Washington more conspicuous throughout the period of the Revolution , the materials placed within Mrs. Ellet 's reach seem to have been particularly meagre . We have no doubt that , in a future edition of the " Women of the Revolution , " due use will . be made of the interesting particulars to be gleaned from the excellent and affectionate reminiscences of the daughter from whose letters we have been quoting . The character and adventures of the Baroness de Riedesel are well known , and as she did not belong to the patriot side , we shall have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice each of the hundred and twenty heroines of these sketches , even by a word ; we shall be obliged , by imperative limits , to content ourselves with recalling a few of those whose position or adventures render them peculiarly interesting or worthy of contemplation . Lydia Darrah was a Quakeress of Philadelphia , who , while entertaining perforce a party of the enemy , played the eavesdropper , and used the information she obtained at the keyhole to save the Americans a surprise at White Marsh . Those who approve of war can not object to this mode of obtaining intelligence ; and the sagacity and perseverance of the good woman certainly deserve all the praise bestowed upon them . How Lydia stood with the Quaker meeting , after this exploit , we are not informed . " The celebrated Miss Franks " was noted for " the keenness of her irony , and her readiness at repartee ; " but the sharp speeches recorded of her are lacking in the delicacy which should distinguish feminine wit . Mrs. Ellet 's sketch of this loyalist lady , converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlivened by an account of the " Mischianza , ** a festival given by the British officers in Philadelphia , as a parting compliment to Sir William Howe , on his departure for England , when he was superseded by Sir Henry Clinton . This account is especially interesting , from having been originally written by Major Andre , who contributed largely to the more poetical portion of the festival . // " The entertainment was given on the 18th of May , 1778 . It commenced with a grand regatta , in three divisions . In the first was the Ferret galley , on board of which were several general officers and ladies . In the centre , the Hussar galley bore Sir William and Lord Howe , Sir Henry Clinton , their suite , and many ladies . The Cornwallis galley brought up the rear - General Knyphhausen and suite , three British generals , and ladies , being on board . On each quarter of these galleys , and forming their division , were five flat boats lined with green cloth , and filled with ladies and gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music . Six barges rowed about each flank , to keep off the swarm of boats in the river . The galleys were dressed in colors and streamers ; the ships lying at anchor were magnificently decorated ; and the transport ships with colors flying , which extended in a line the whole length of the city , were crowded , as well as the wharves , with spectators . The rendezvous was at Knight 's wharf , at the northern extremity of the city . The company embarked at half.past four , the three divisions moving slowly down to the music . Arrived opposite Market wharf , at a signal all rested on their oars , and the music played " God save the King , " answered by three cheers from the vessels . The landing was at the Old Fort , a little south of the town , and in front of the building prepared for the company - a few hundred yards from the water . This regatta was gazed at from the wharves and warehouses by all the uninvited population of the city . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute of seventeen guns was fired from his Majesty 's ship Roebuck ; and , after an interval , seventeen from the Vigilant . The procession advanced through an avenue formed by two files of grenadiers , each supported by a line of light-horse . The avenue led to a spacious lawn , lined with troops , and prepared for the exhibition of a tilt and tournament . The music , and managers with favors of white and blue ribbons in their breasts , led the way , followed by the generals and the rest of the company . " In front , the building bounded the view through a vista formed by two triumphal arches in a line with the landing place . Two pavilions , with rows of benches rising one above another , received the ladies , while the gentlemen ranged themselves on each side . On the front seat of each pavilion were seven young ladies as princesses , in Turkish habits , and wearing in their turbans the favors meant for the knights who contended . The sound of trumpets was heard in the distance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red silk , mounted on gray horses caparisoned in the same colors , attended by squires on // foot , heralds and trumpeters , entered the lists . Lord Cathcart was chief of these knights ; and appeared in honor of Miss Auchmuty . One of his esquires bore his lance , another his shield ; and two black slaves in blue and white silk , with silver clasps on their bare necks and arms , held his stirrups . The band made the circuit of the square , saluting the ladies , and then ranged themselves in a line with the pavilion , in which were the ladies of their device . Their herald , after a flourish of trumpets , proclaimed a challenge ; asserting the superiority of the ladies of the Blended Rose , in wit , beauty , and accomplishment , and offering to prove it by deeds of arms according to the ancient laws of chivalry . At the third repetition of the challenge , another herald and trumpeters advanced from the other side of the square , dressed in black and orange , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knights of the Burning Mountain . Captain Watson , the chief , appeared in honor of Miss Franks ; his device - a heart with a wreath of flowers ; his motto - Love and Glory . This band also rode round the lists , and drew up in front of the White Knights . The gauntlet was thrown down and lifted ; the encounter took place . After the fourth encounter , the two chiefs , spurring to the centre , fought singly , till the marshal of the field rushed between , and declared that the ladies of the Blended Rose and the Burning Mountain were satisfied with the proofs of love and valor already given , and commanded their knights to desist . The bands then filed off in different directions , saluting the ladies as they approached the pavilions . " The company then passed in procession through triumphal arches built in the Tuscan order , to a garden in front of the building , and thence ascended to a spacious hall painted in imitation of Sienna marble . In this hall and apartment adjoining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , received their favors from the ladies . On entering the room appropriated for the faro table , a cornucopia was seen filled with fruit and flowers ; another appeared in going out , shrunk , reversed , and empty . The next advance was to a ball-room painted in pale blue , pannelled with gold , with dropping festoons of flowers ; the surbase pink , with drapery festooned in blue . Eighty-five mirrors , decked with flowers and ribbons , reflected the light from thirty.four branches of wax lights . On the same floor were four drawing-rooms with sideboards of refreshments , also decorated and lighted up . The dancing continued till ten ; the windows were then thrown open , and the fireworks commenced with a magnificent bouquet of rockets . " At twelve , large folding doors , which had hitherto been concealed , were suddenly thrown open , discovering a splendid and // spacious saloon , richly painted , and brilliantly illuminated ; the mirrors and branches decorated , as also the supper table ; which was set out-according to Major Andr&amp;s account-with four hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ended , the herald and trumpeters of the Blended Rose entered the saloon , and proclaimed the health of the king and royal family - followed by that of the knights and ladies ; each toast being accompanied by a flourish of music . The company then returned to the ball-room , and the dancing continued till four o'clock . " This entertainment took place at the opening of the spring which followed the dreadful winter at Valley Forge . After this period , the scene of action was in a great measure changed to the southern country , and the war took a more romantic character . Savannah was surrendered to the British at the close of 1779 , and on the 12th of May , 1781 , Charleston capitulated , and was occupied by Sir Henry Clinton , who from that centre of operations harassed the surrounding country at pleasure . The bad faith of the British commander , by means of which one portion of the inhabitants was terrified into adhesion to the crown , nerved the hearts and arms of many more , who , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they held dearest , commenced a partisan and skirmishing warfare , far more wearing and distressing than the pitched battles at the North , from the immediate dangers of which , at least , women and children and helpless age were safe . Circumstances like these naturally called forth a kind of personal heroism , for which there is little field in regular warfare . Instances not unfrequently occurred , when all , for the moment , depended on the courage , the ingenuity , the firmness , or the judgment of a woman ; when children without hesitation risked their lives at the call of duty or affection ; when the negro forgot the stupidity which his master is so fond of imputing to him , and under the stimulus of love or pity , was inspired with an ingenuity of equivocation or a boldness of defence quite at variance with his supposed character . Mrs. Ellet 's poetical blood is fired by these episodical exploits , and she is evidently in her element when she tells of the brave doings of our Southern sisters , among whom she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for much that is noble , true , and // heroic in their national or " sectional " character . The comparative simplicity of plantation life imparts a healthful tone to love and friendship , and depth and constancy to all the domestic affections ; and we love to think of the women of the South as the guardian angels of their firesides or their palmetto shades , ever ready , with sweet influences , to ward off a far as human creatures may , the curse of slavery , and meliorate , as only gentle creatures can , its sting . Mrs. Gibbes , the first lady on the Southern list , may serve as a type of one class of the heroic women of the South . With the quiet energy of a veteran commander , she prepares her house for the reception of the invaders after they had already surrounded it , and that closely . She did not conquer , but she disarmed the enemy , by opening the front door when all was ready , and showing the majestic form of her invalid husband , helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children . And when her beautiful plantation was given up to ruthless pillage , and the officers became her compulsory guests , she continued to preside at the head of her table , awing the intruders into respect and decent order by the power of her presence . Flying afterwards in the midst of a heavy fire from the river , and having under her charge , with the helpless husband , sixteen children , - her own and those of her sister - she discovers on reaching the neighboring plantation , towards which these fugitive steps were directed , that a little boy-one of her sister*s - is missing . " The roar of the distant guns was still heard , breaking at short intervals the deep silence of the night . The chilly rain was falling , and the darkness was profound . Yet the thowght of abandoning the helpless boy to destruction was agony to the hearts of his relatives . In this extremity , the self.devotion of a young girl interposed to save him . Mary Anna , the eldest daughter of Mrs. *Gibbes - then only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the fearful peril , alone . The mother dared not oppose her noble resolution , which seemed indeed an inspiration of heaven ; and she was permitted to go . Hastening along the path with all the speed of which she was capable , she reached the house , still in the undisturbed possession of the enemy ; and entreated permission from the sentinel to enter ; persisting , in spite of refusal , till by earnest importunity of supplication , she gained her object . Searching anxiously through the house , she found the child in a room in a third story , and // lifting him joyfully jif her arms , carried him down , and fled with him to the spot where her anxious parents were awaiting her return . The shot still flew thickly around her , frequently throwing up the earth in her way ; but protected by the Providence that watches over innocence , she joined the rest of the family in safety . " Mrs. Martha Bratton , beginning her career of heroism by defying the brutal Huck , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say a word that should endanger her husband 's safety , finished it by blowing up a dep6t of powder just as the enemy were approaching it . I " The officer in commnd , irritated to fury , demanded who had dared to perpetrate such an act , and threatened instant and severe vengeance upon the culprit . The intrepid woman to whom he owed his disappointment , answered for herself . It was I who did it , ' she replied . Let the consequence be what it will , I glory in having prevented the mischief contemplated by the cruel enemies of my country . ' " Mrs. Thomas was of similar spirit ; and we might enumerate a host more , if the South were not so rich in heroines . Miss Langston , a girl of sixteen , already under British ban for having been more than suspected of giving private information to her countrymen , sets out on foot , alone , at night , to cross a deep river in order to warn her brother and his associates of a threatened attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ford , became bewildered , and knew not which direction to take . The hoarse rush of the waters , which were up to her neck - the blackness of the night - the utter solitude around her - the uncertainty lest the next step should ingulph her past help , confused her ; and losing in a degree her self-possession , she wandered for some time in the channel , without knowing whither to turn her steps . But the energy of a resolute will , under the care of Providence , sustained her . " Mary Slocumb , the wife of a lieutenant of rangers , who was absent with a party on duty when Tarleton took possession of his plantation , had all the spirit of border chivalry , - that of the Ladye of Branksome herself , - Through me no friend shall meet his doom ; Here , while I live , no foe finds room ! " // In the war of words she was decidedly too much for Colonel Tarleton , who gave his orders for scouring the country all the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his searching questions , and her biting allusions to his own ill fortune at the battle of the Cowpens . A most stirring account of the various dangers and escapes of the daring lieutenant and his family would grace our page but for its too great length ; we pass on , therefore , to a later occurrence , which includes a personal exploit of the lady . The country had risen en masse to oppose the passage of the royal troops , who were hurrying to join their standard at Wilmington . This corps of fire-breathing volunteers - " every man of whom had mischief in him , " as Mrs. Slocumb said , - met McDonald and his Highlanders at Moore 's Creek , February 27th , 1776 , and fought there one of the bloodiest battles of that eventful year . Mary Slocumb was at home - what ? skirmishing with Colonel Tarleton ? no - dreaming ! Wo*man still , under all the unfeminine porcupinishness induced by the unnatural circumstances of the time . We must let her tell her own story . " I lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a dream ; yet it was not all a dream . ( She used the words , unconsciously , of the poet who was not then in being . ) I saw distinctly a body wrapped in my husband 's guard-cloak - bloody - dead ; and others dead and wounded on the ground about him . I saw them plainly and distinctly . I uttered a cry , and sprang to my feet on the floor ; and so strong was the impression on my mind , that I rushed in the direction the Vision appeared , and came up against the side of the house . The fire in the room gave lit. tie light , and I gazed in every direction to catch another glimpse of the scene . I raised the light ; every thing was still and quiet . My child was sleeping , but my woman was awakened by my crying out or jumping on the floor . If ever I felt fear it was at that moment . Seated on the bed , I reflected a few moments - and said aloud : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman I could not sleep and would ride down the road . She appeared in great alarm ; but I merely told her to lock the door after me , and look after the child . I went to the stable , saddled my mare - as fleet and easy a nag as ever travelled ; and in one minute we were tearing down the road at full speed . The cool night seemed after a mile or two 's gallop to bring reflection with it ; and I asked myself where I was going , and for what purpose . Again and again I was tempted to turn back ; but I was soon ten miles // from home , and my mind became stronger every mile I rode . I should find my husband dead or dying - was as firmly my presentiment and conviction as any fact in my life . When day broke I was some thirty miles from home . I knew the general route our little army expected to take , and had followed them without hesitation . About sunrise , I came upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road-side , each one of them showing the same anxiety of mind I felt . Stopping a few minutes I inquired if the battle had been fought . They knew nothing , but were assembled on the road to catch intelligence . They thought Caswell had taken the right of the Wilmington road , and gone towards the northwest ( Cape Fear . ) Again was I skimming over the ground through a country thinly settled , and very poor and swampy ; but neither my own spirits nor my beautiful nag 's failed in the least . We followed the wellmarked trail of the troops . " The sun must have been well up , say eight or nine o clock , when I heard a sound like thunder , which I knew must be cannon . It was the first time I ever heard a cannon . I stopped still ; when presently the cannon thundered again . The battle was then fighting . What a fool ! my husband could not be dead last night , and the battle only fighting now ! Still , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they come out . So away we went again , faster than ever ; and I soon found by the noise of guns that I was near the fight . Again I stopped . I could hear muskets , I could hear rifles , and I could hear shouting . I spoke to my mare , and dashed on in the direction of the firing and the shouts , now louder than ever . The blind path I had been following brought me into the Wilmington road leading to Moore 's Creek Bridge a few hundred yards below the bridge . A few yards from the road , under a cluster of trees , were lying perhaps twenty men . They were the wounded . I knew the spot ; the very trees ; and the position of the men I knew as if I had seen it a thousand times . I had seen it all night ! I saw all at once ; but in an instant my whole soul was centred in one spot ; for there , wrapped in his bloody guard-cloak , was my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my saddle to the place I never knew . I remember uncovering his head and seeing a face clothed with gore from a dreadful wound across the temple . I put my hand on the bloody face ; t was warm ; and an unknown voice begged for water . A small camp-kettle was lying near , and a stream of water was close by . I brought it ; poured some in his mouth ; washed his face ; and behold - it was Frank Cogdell . He soon revived and could speak . I was washing the wound in his head . Said he , It is not that ; it is // that hole in my leg that is killing me . ' A puddle of blood was standing on the ground about his feet . I took his knife , cut away his trousers and stocking , and found the blood came from a shothole through and through the fleshy part of his leg . I looked about and could see nothing that looked as if it would do for dressing wounds but some heart-leaves . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the bleeding stopped . I then went to the others ; and - Doctor ! I dressed the wounds of many a brave fellow who did good fighting long after that day ! I had not inquired for my husband ; but while I was busy Caswell came up . He appeared very much surprised to see me ; and was with his hat in hand about to pay some compliment : but I interrupted him by asking - Where is my husband ? ' " Where he ought to be , madam ; in pursuit of the enemy . But pray , ' said he , how came you here ? ' " Oh , I thought , ' replied I , you would need nurses as well as soldiers . See ! I have already dressed many of these good fellows ; and here is one ' - going to Frank , and lifting him up with my arm under his head , so that he could drink some more water - would have died before any of you men could have helped him . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked up , and my husband , as bloody as a butcher , and as muddy as a ditcher , stood before me . " Why , Mary ! ' he exclaimed , What are you doing there ? Hugging Frank Cogdell , the greatest reprobate in the army ? ' " In the middle of the night , I again mounted my mare and started for home . Caswell and my husband wanted me to stay till next morning , and they would send a party with me ; but no ! I wanted to see my child , and I told them they could send no party who could keep up with me . What a happy ride I had back ! and with what joy did I embrace my child as he ran to meet me ! " Lest we should be wanting , both to Mrs. Slocumb and her unwelcome guest Colonel Tarleton , we give a passage which does credit to them both . " When the British army broke up their encamp*nent at the plantation , a sergeant was ordered by Colonel Tarleton to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , to ensure protection to a lady whose noble bearing had inspired them all with the most profound respect . This order was obeyed : the guard brought up the rear of that army in their march northward . Mrs. Slocumb saw them depart with tears of joy ; and on her knees gave thanks , with a full heart , to the Divine Being who had protected her . " // 1849 . Ellet 's Women of the Revolution . This lady lived , through all her toils and dangers , a happy wife for sixty years , with the husband of her youth . In her seventy-second year , being afflicted with a cancer in her hand , she with characteristic bravery held it forth to the surgeon 's knife , declining the usual assistance . She died in 1836 , her husband in 1841 , - the patriarchs of their district . The exploit of Mrs. Motte , who furnished the arrows which were to carry combustibles to the roof of her own new and valuable mansion , is well known . It may not be equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that through the disastrous accidents of the times , his estate was insolvent , Mrs. Motte determined to devote the remainder of her life to the honorable task of paying his debts . " Her friends and connections , whose acquaintance with her affairs gave weight to their judgment , warned her of the apparent hopelessness of such an effort . But , steadfast in the principles that governed all her conduct , she persevered ; induced a friend to purchase for her , on credit , a valuable body of rice.land , then an uncleared swamp - on the Santee - built houses for the negroes , who constituted nearly all her available property - even that being encumbered with claims - and took up her own abode as the new plantation . Living in an humble dwelling - and relinquishing many of her habitual comforts - she devoted herself with such zeal , untiring industry , and indomitable resolution to the attainment of her object , that her success triumphed over every difficulty , and exceeded the expectations of all who had discouraged her . She not only paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her children and descendants a handsome and unincumbered estate . This is the heroism of peace , a far more difficult heroism , we must take leave to say , than that of war , even for women . Actions to be truly great must be performed without the stimulus of present excitement . The true dignity of such as this will be recognized when war is forgotten , or remembered as an almost impossible barbarism of past ages . Further south , we come upon the exploit of a " warwoman " indeed . Nancy Hart , a Georgian Amazon , hideous in person as ferocious in nature , is represented as having shot a man or two with her own hand , in her own house , and coolly recommended the hanging of four more before her door , on a tree which may still be seen . The stream near this Penthesilea 's bower is called " War-woman 's creek , " in // her honor . Nature makes strange mistakes sometimes , and seems to have given the virago 's husband the milk omitted in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Nancy called him " a poor stick . " The thirteen pages devoted to the women of Kentucky include many very interesting anecdotes , illustrative of Indian cruelty , and female courage and patriotic feeling . The satisfaction with which we read these touching records of American pioneer life makes us regret , that so much more is doubtless lost than saved . These things happened in days and regions belonging far less to the pen than the axe and the rifle . It were worth a pilgrimage through that land of " forest , flood , and fell , " to glean the fragments yet extant among those who must soon pass away . We come next upon a story of Wheeling , on the Ohio , then called Fort Henry , whither , in 1777 , a large Indian force was brought by a notorious renegade and tory , Simeon Girty . Within the fort were collected , as usual , all the helpless of the neighborhood , and a garrison numbering barely twelve , including boys , the rest having been killed in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stockade was stormed by the Indians , and defended by the marksmen within with good hope , until it was discovered that the powder was exhausted . The only supply lay in a house about sixty yards from the gate . In this emergency , when all depended on obtaining the powder , and the person who should seek it must become a mere target for the savage horde without , a young girl , Elizabeth Zane , volunteered to be the messenger , insisting that no one else could be as well spared . The blood thrills as we picture her , leaving the fort on this desperate errand , reaching the house in safety , emerging again with the keg of powder in her arms , and skimming the ground toward the gate , amid a shower of bullets . But the bullets had no billet for her , and she reached the fort in safety . We need not say that her heroism saved her friends . We have adopted something of geographical order in our notice of particular sketches ; but we proceed to call up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic and poetical instances of feminine patriotism . And first comes Mrs. Bache , the only daughter of Franklin . There is an odd homeliness in the character of this // lady ; what in her father appeared dignified and independent , gives her an almost rustic air . She begins her letters to her father " Honored Sir , " and ends with saying " There is not a young lady of my acquaintance but what desires to be remembered to you . " The simplicity of her habits does credit to her father , who , figuring at the court of France in his blue woollen stockings , writes reprovingly to her about Philadelphia gaieties . " But how could my dear papa give me so severe a reprimand for wishing a little finery . He would not , I am sure , if he knew how much I have felt it . Last winter was a season of triumph to the whigs , and they spent it gaily . You would not have had me , I am sure , stay away from the Ambassador 's or General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day with General Washington and his lady ; and you would have been the last person , I am sure , to have wished to see me dressed with singularity . Though I never loved dress so much as to wish to be particularly fine , yet I never will gd out when I can not appear so as to do credit to my family and husband I can assure my dear papa that industry in this country is by no means laid aside ; but as to spinning linen , we can not think of that till we have got that wove which we spun three years ago . Mr. Duffield has bribed a weaver that lives on his farm to weave me eighteen yards , by making him three or four shuttles for nothing , and keeping it a secret from the country people , who will not suffer them to weave for those in town . This is the third weaver 's it has been at , and many fair promises I have had about it . T is now done and whitening ; but forty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to have had home a t*velvemonth last month . Mrs. Keppele , who is gone to Lancaster , is to try to get it done there for me ; but not a thread will they weave but for hard money . My maid is now spinning wool for winter stock . ings for the whole family , which will be no difficulty in the manufactory , as I knit them myself . I only mention these things that you may see that balls are not the only reason that the wheel is laid aside This winter approaches with so many horrors , that I shall not want any thing to go abroad in , if I can be comfortable at home . My spirits , which I have kept up during my being drove about from place to place , much better than most people 's I meet with , have been lowered by nothing but the depreciation of the money , which has been amazing lately , so that home will be the place for me this winter , as I can not get a common winter cloak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gauze now , it is fifty dollars a yard ; // t is beyond my wish , and I should think it not only a shame but a sin to buy it , if I had millions . " Mrs. Bache merits her place among the heroines of the Revolution by personal services in the hour of deep need . " In the patriotic effort of the ladies of Philadelphia , to furnish the destitute American soldiers with money and clothing during the year 1780 , Mrs. Bache took a very active part . After the death of Mrs. Reed , the duty of completing the collections and contributions devolved on her and four other ladies , as a sort of Executive Committee . The shirts provided were cut out at her house . A letter to Dr. Franklin , part of which has been published , shows how earnestly she was engaged in the work . The Marquis de Chastellux thus describes a visit which he paid her about this time After this slight repast , which only lasted an hour and a half , we went to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning is the most proper hour for paying visits . We began by Mrs. Bache . She merited all the anxiety we had to see her , for she is the daughter of Mr. Franklin . Simple in her manners , like her respected father , she possesses his benevolence . She conducted us into a room filled with work , lately finished by the ladies of Philadelphia . This work consisted neither of embroidered tambour waistcoats , nor of net work edging , nor of gold and silver brocade . It was a quantity of shirts for the soldiers of Pennsylvania . The ladies bought the linen from their own private purses , and took a pleasure in cutting them out and sewing them themselves . On each shirt was the name of the married or unmarried lady who made it ; and they amounted to twenty-two hundred . ' " One of her unpublished letters contains a curious passage referring to the author of the Age of Reason , as well as some caustic remarks on the conduct of certain actors in the great drama . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . I do not know what would become of us if there were not ; for our great folks appear to me to be entirely taken up with trying to raise their fortunes or endeavoring to gain honors . T is quite a different place from what it was when you left us ; but all revolutions produce a change of manners , and we are not to wonder at the alterations we now see . I hear Mr. Payne is gone to France with Mr. Lawrence ; he did not call on us . I had a little dispute with him more than a year ago , about Mr. Dean , since which time he has never even moved his hat to me . He has lately written a pamphlet , called Public Good , ' which you will // receive . It is called sensible , hut he appears throughout to be much afraid of ' his old employers , the Lees , who are strong Vir . ginians . There never was a man less beloved in a place than Payne , having at different times disputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done would have been to have died the instant he had finished his Common Sense ; for he never again will have it in his power to leave the world with so much credit . " In another letter to her father , speaking of her having met with General and Mrs. Washington several times , she adds , " He always inquires after you in the most affectionate manner , and speaks of you highly . We danced at Mrs. Powell 's on your birth-day , or night , I should say , in company together , and he told me it was the anniversary of his marriage ; it was just twenty years that night . " Washington dancing ! The statue stepped down from its pedestal ! Miss Mary Phulipse , afterwards the wife of Captain Roger Morris , who was attainted of treason , and sufibred confiscation in punishment of his " loyalty , " is celebrated as having fascinated Washington , when , in his twenty-fourth year , he travelled from Virginia to Boston , on horseback , attended by his aides-de-camp . He was entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose wife was the sister of the charming Mary Philipse . It seems quite problematical whether the young chief actually offered himself and suffered the mortification of a refusal , but it is not disputed that his heart was touched , and that the young lady might have been the wife of the Commander-in1.chief , and the lady of our first President , if she had chosen . She is represented to have been one of those who rule all about them by an irresistible charm , and the honor in which her memory is held among her descendants proves that Washington was as wise in love as in war . The wife of the traitor Arnold was the daughter of Edward Shippen , Chief Justice of Pennsylvania , of a family distinguished among the aristocracy of the day , and prominent after the commencement of the contest among those who cherished loyalist principles . She was a beautiful girl of eighteen when she became the object of Arnold 's attentions ; but although he appears , even before marriage , to have imbued her with his own discontented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish ambition , there is not a shadow of proof that the knowledge of his treason did not fall on her , as on the country , like a thunderbolt . But it can not be pretended that she was one of the women who help to keep men true and brave . " She was young , gay , and frivolous ; fond of display and admiration , and used to luxury ; she was utterly unfitted for the duties and privations of a poor man 's wife . A loyalist 's daughter , she had been taught to mourn over even the poor pageantry of colonial rank and authority , and to recollect with pleasure the pomp of those brief days of enjoyment , when military men of noble station were her admirers . " Mrs. Arnold was at breakfast with her husband and the aidesde.camp - Washington and the other officers having not yet come - when the letter arrived which bore to the traitor the first intelligence of Andre 's capture . He left the room immediately , went to his wife 's chamber , sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his instant flight to the enemy . This was , probably , the first intelligence she received of what had been so long going on ; the news overwhelmed her , and when Arnold quitted the apartment , he left her lying in a swoon on the floor . " Her almost frantic condition is described with sympathy by Colonel Hamilton , in a letter written the next day : The Qen. eral , ' he says , went to see her ; she upbraided him with being in a plot to murder her child , raved , shed tears , and lamented the fate of the infant All the sweetness of beauty , all the loveliness of innocence , all the tenderness of a wife , and all the fondness of a mother , showed themselves in her appearance and conduct . ' He , too , expresses his conviction that she had no knowledge of Arnold 's plan , till his announcement to her that he must banish himself from his country forever . The opinion of other persons qualified to judge without prejudice , acquitted her of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing from Madrid to Catharine Livingston , says- ' All the world here are cursing Arnold , and pitying his wife . ' And Robert Morris writes- ' Poor Mrs. Arnold ! was there ever such an infernal villain ! ' Mrs. Arnold went from West Point to her father 's house ; but was not long permitted to remain in Philadelphia . The traitor 's papers having been seized , by direction of the Executive authorities , the correspondence with Andre was brought to light ; suspicion rested on her ; and by an order of the Council , dated Oct. // join her husband in New York . The respect and forbearance shown towards her on her journey through the country , notwithstanding her banishment , testified the popular belief in her innocence . M. de Marbois relates , that when she stopped at a village where the people were about to burn Arnold in effigy , they put it off till the next night . " One of the most poetical pictures in the book is found in volume II. , pp. 264-5 , the account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Lexington , Kentucky , which was besieged by the English . The extract would be too long for our limits , but the story is a charming one . Truth to say , these reminiscences of the women of our forming day are so interesting , that we might extract more than half the book if we should indulge our disposition to hold up to honor the daughters of the various portions of this extensive country , whose characters were brought out by the influences and chances of the times . We have , however , offered enough to justify the expression of gratitude to Mrs. Ellet , with which we set out . Few Americans who read at all will probably remain unpossessed of a book so truly national and unique . As to the literary execution of the work , we can say but little . The writer 's interest in her subject is exclusive ; she seems sedulously to have avoided all graces of language , and to have been inspired sympathetically with the homely diction of some of her heroines . To collect facts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been her sole endeavor . The grace with which she can use the English language elsewhere , the poetry which flows with such facility from her pen , are here forgotten or laid purposely aside . It is evident that she felt bound to eschew all aid from the imagination , and equally evident that , in her warm appreciation of the nobleness of her countrywomen , such aid appeared to her unnecessary or impertinent . We dissent from this view , and should prize the plain truth all the more highly if it were set forth with some degree of elegance , and some indulgence in the graces of fancy . Naked facts are like the iron framework on which the taste of the sculptor models the rounded outline of a Hebe ; essential , but not sufficient . All that they suggest is fairly material for the raconteur . To arrange them into pictures , to adorn them with poetry , to // compare them with each other , and follow them into their relations , - these labors and adornments fall within the province of the reciter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , simplicity and elegance , may all be used in the sketch of a character or the record of an incident ; and thus we have all the pleasure the author can give , in addition to the contribution , small or great , to our store of truth . We should have valued the " Women of the Revolution** more highly , if Mrs. Ellet had proceeded upon this principle . The arrangement of the book , again , is not quite what we would have chosen . Beginning chronologically , it soon goes off with a hop , skip , and jump , as to both time and place . We should prefer a decided adherence to a chronological , geographical , or characteristic sequence . To the lack of this must be attributed , in some measure , the desultory character of our review , for we had not leisure to systematize for the author . The work has already gone through three editions , and it is said there is ample material for another volume.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
