txt THE military conduct of the war against Mexico , seems to us deserving of more critical examination than it has yet received at the hands of journalism-that power of modern times , which may so truly he called one of the Estates of the republic . We propose in the following pages to consider this matter somewhat in detail . First : as elucidating a deliberate purpose on the part of the administration to bring about a war with Mexico ; and , secondly , as illustrating the really martial character of our race . Concerning the original motives of this untoward contest , and the rapid development which has been given to the principles upon which it was undertaken , there does not now seem-out of the immediate sphere of partisan influence , and beyond the circle of that brotherhood of hope , the most rapacious and uncleanest spawn of war-army contractors , and army jobbers , executive printers , and executive parasites , of all degrees-there does not seem , we repeat , any essential difference of opinion . It was , from its inception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the strong , confident in their strength , against the feeble , because they were feeble ; a war prompted by the coveting of our neighbor 's possessions , and by the consciousness that this covetousness might here be indulged with greater impunity , than would have followed the gratification of the same lawless cupidity in reference to " the whole of Oregon or none , " or at an earlier day , in reference to the north-eastern boundary . A very elaborate attempt is indeed made in the message , at the opening of the present session of Congress , to prove that Mexico , and not the United States , commenced the war , that she was the blood-thirsty wolf that muddied the water up stream , for the innocent lamb of the United States , and there threw the blame upon the innocent ; and that it was only with reluctance , and after much tribulation and patient suffering , that we , the people of this Model Republic , turned upon our nearest American neighbor with fire and sword-not to conquer her territories , nor extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The common sense of mankind , however , revolts at the absurdity ; and we shall make it appear , by reference to dates and facts , that our own records bear witness against this weak presidential fiction . The resolutions , inviting the annexation of Texas , passed both houses of Congress , and became the law of the land-at least in the *ordinary forms-at the very heel of Mr. Tyler 's administration , in March , 1845 ; and that unhappy Magistrate used the last moments of his most humiliating rule , to transmit these resolutions to the government of Texas , in that form which most aggravated the evils of annexation . VOL . V. No . II . // Mr. Polk , who succeeded not unworthily Mr. Tyler , fell at once into his footsteps in this matter ; and , disregarding the solemn protest of the Mexican minister against annexation as offensive to Mexico , and entailing upon her the necessity of looking upon it as a measure of war , he went forward in the work in a spirit apparently of premeditated and deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the act of our Congress , the army and the navy of the U. States were in their ordinary force and inactivity , and at their ordinary peace stations , little dreaming of any near occasion for change ; for no assurance had been more confident , on the part of the friends of annexation , than that it would be a " bloodless achievement ; " and no ridicule more loud or scornful than that heaped upon those " prophets of disaster , " as they were called , who foresaw and foretold that , only at the cost of countless lives and countless treasure , could this iniquity be perpetrated . Even as late as December , 1845 , in his first annual message to Congress , the President used this emphatic and exulting language respecting annexation , then all complete , except the formal act , soon after passed by Congress , for admitting the new State into the Union . " This accession to our territory has been a bloodless achievement . No arm of force has been raised to produce the result , the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sought to extend our territorial possessions by conquest , or our republican institutions over a reluctant people . It was the deliberate homage of that people to the great principles of our federative Union. ** When it shall be seen in the sequel what " bloody instructions* ' had , previously to this date , been given by the President to our commanders , the readers of this Review will agree with us , probably , in thinking the language of this extract most extraordinary indeed . And this brings us to our immediate subject . In the very same message of 2d Dec. , 1845 , from which we have just quoted , occurs this passage , so apparently contradictory , in spirit and import at least , if not in terms , of the seif-gratulation about peaceful annexation : " When orders were given , during the past summer , for concentrating a military force on the western frontier of Texas , our troops were widely dispersed , and in small detachments , occupying posts remote from each other . The prompt and expeditious manner in which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was drawn together , on an emergency so sudden , reflects great credit on the officers who were intrusted with the execution of these orders , as well as upon the discipline of the army itself . To be in strength to defend the people of Texas , in the event Mexico should commence hostilities with a large army , as she threatened , I authorized the general commanding , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . " No arm of force , " says the President , in the opening of this message , " has been raised to produce this result ! " Yet , a few pages further on , he tells us that " an army , embracing near the half of our peace establishment , " was suddenly drawn together from all points of the Union , and dispatched to the Western frontier of Texas , which Mexico " threatened " to invade . Nay more  --  the navy , too , was sent to prevent this land invasion ! Hear the same message : " Both the Congress and Convention of the people of Texas invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect and defend them against a menaced attack . The moment the terms of annexation , offered by the United States , were accepted by Texas , the latter became so far a part of our country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defence . 1 , therefore , deemed it proper , as a precautionary measure , to order a strong squadron to the coasts of Mexico , and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of Texas . Our army was ordered to take positions in the country between the Nueces and the del Norte , and to repel any invasion of the Texan territory which might be attempted by the Mexican forces , Our squadron in the Gulf was ordered to co.operate with the army . But though our army and navy were placed in a position to defend our own and the rights of Texas , they were ordered to commit no act of hostility against Mexico , unless she declared war , or was herself the aggressor by striking the first blow . " The resolution of annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter-although a total change in the personel of the administration had intervened  --  a new President and new Secretaries-orders were dispatched on 21st March , to General Taylor , at Fort Jessup , in Louisiana , to prepare his command , and hold it in readi. // ness to be moved into Texas as soon as ordered . On 28th May , and we beg the dates may be attended to , a confidential letter from Mr. Secretary Marcy to General Taylor , directed him by " order of the President to cause the forces now under your command , and those which may be assigned to it , to be put into a position where they may , most promptly and efficiently , act in defence of Texas , in the event it shall become necessary or proper to employ them for that purpose. ** As yet Texas had not , in any manner , acceded to annexation : neither by her Congress nor her convention . In the same confidential letter , founding himself on an article in the treaty between the United States and Mexico , whereby each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands on their borders from attacking , in any manner , the citizens of the other ; or the Indians residing upon the territories of the other , Mr. Secretary Marcy declares that " the obligations which are due in this respect to Mexico by this treaty , are due , also , to Texas ! " How so , unless Texas were a part of Mexico ? and if a part of Mexico , how could we annex it in defiance of Mexico ? If rightfully a part of the United Slates , it needed no authority from a treaty with Mexico to authorize an American commander to prevent or punish Indian hostilities . This application , therefore , of a treaty with Mexico , to the case of Texas , seems , at least , unfortunate . But it is in truth only introduced to furnish an excuse-which was not lost-for pushing some of the American troops across the upper Red river into Texas , before that country was ours by any sort of title . Events , however , did not seem to march fast enough for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th June , Mr. Bancroft , in the absence of Mr. Marcy , ad interim Secretary of War , writes another confidential , but most extraordinary , dispatch to General Taylor . We give extracts from it : ( CONFIDENTIAL . ) War Department , June 15 , 1845 . " SIR ,  --  On the 4th day of July , or very soon thereafter , the convention of the peo. pIe of Texas will probably accept the proposition of annexation under the joint resolution of the late Congress of the United States . That acceptance will constitute Texas an integral portion of our country . " In anticipation of that event , you will forthwith make a forward movement with the troops under your command , and advance to the mouth of the Sabine , or to such other point on the Gulf of Mexico , or itsnavigable waters , as in your judgment may he most convenient for an embarkation , at the proper time , for the western frontier of Texas . * * * * The point of your ultimate destination is the western frontier of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the Rio Grande del Norte , such a site as will consist with the health of your troops , and will be best adapted to repel invasion , and to protect what , in the event of annexation , will be our western border . You will limit yourself to the defence of the territory of Texas , unless Mexico should declare war against the United States . " Your movement to the Gulf of Mexico , and your preparations to embark for the western frontier of Texas , are to be made without delay ; but you will not efiisct a landing on that frontier until you have yourself ascertained the due acceptance , by Texas , of iihe proffered terms of annexation . " The italics in the above extract are ours  --  but what " hot haste " is here evinced , to anticipate difficulties ! What disregard of the special malediction pronounced by the revealed Word of God upon those " whose feet are swift to shed blood ! " Yet the writer of this confidential , stimulating missive , was an expriest !  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French revolution , seemed , in the intoxication of political power , to delight in violating the holy precepts they were trained to inculcate and exemplify . The real Secretary-returned to his post-appears to have had some apprehension lest the fiery zeal of his locum-tenens should lead the commanding officer into indiscretion and , therefore , by a letter , not marked confidential , of 8th July , he thus cautions him- " this department is informed that Mexico has some military establishments on the east side of the Rio Grande , which are , and , for some time have been , in the actual occupancy of her troops . In carrying out the instructions , heretofore received , you will be careful to avoid any acts of aggression , unless an actual war shall exist . The Mexican forces , at the posts in their possession , and which have been so , will not be disturbed , as long as the relations of peace between the United States and Mexico continue . " // From New Orleans , on 20th July , Gen. Taylor acknowledges the receipt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at receiving such instructions , " as they confirm , " says he , " my views , previously communicated , in regard to the proper line to be occupied , at present , by our troops ; those instructions will be closely followed , and the department may rest assured that I will take no step to interrupt the friendly relations between the United States and Mexico . " It no where appears , from any information communicated by the Executive to Congress-nor to the public-what these " views previously communicated " by General Taylor , as to " the proper line to be occupied , " were , but it is quite fair to infer that if they had been in unison with those of the President , he could not have failed to strengthen himself before the country , by showing that in taking up a position in the disputed territory , he was fortified by the military opinion of the commanding general . That such , however , was not the line indicated by General Taylor , we have evidence , both direct and indirect . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Secretary Marcy , of 30th July , wherein-acknowledging the receipt of General Taylor 's dispatch , as above , from New Orleans , of 20th Julyhe thus seeks to coax General Taylor to advance , against his own better judgment , to the Rio Grande ; and at any rate , after affecting to leave the whole discretion with him , peremptorily orders him to occupy a position , with a part of his forces at least , west of the Nueces : ( EXTRACT . ) " War Department , Washington , 30th July . 5 He ( the President ) has not the requisite information in regard to the country , to enable him to give any . positive directions as to the position you ought to take , or the movements which it may be expedient to make : these must be governed by circumstances . While avoiding , as you have been instructed to do , all aggressive measures towards Mexico , as long as the relations of peace exist between that republic and the United States , you are expected to occupy , protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that it has been occupied by the people of Texas . The Rio Grande is claimed to be the boundary between the two countries , and up to this boundary you are to extend your protection , only excepting any posts on the eastern side thereof whizh are in the actual occupancy of Mexican forces , or Mexican settlements , over which the republic of Texas did not exercise jurisdiction at the time of annexation , or shortly before that event . It is expected that in selecting the establishment for your troops , you will approach as near the boundary line , the Rio Grande , as prudence will dictate . With this view the President desires that your position , for part of your forces at least , should be west of the Nueces . " Two things appear to us obvious from this crafty letter . First , that Taylor 's views , as to the line to be occupied , did not suit the President ; and , &amp;cond , that if his line was not to be adopted , Taylor had asked positive and specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , under the plea of insufficient information , shrinks from giving positive instructions , but his cunning scribe of the war department tells the frank General that he is expected to defend all Texas , and that Texas extends to the Rio Grande , save and except the Mexican armed stations , and the Mexican settlements east of it , over which Texas never had even claimed jurisdiction ; and , finally , after trying to coax Taylor to assume the responsibility of marching to the Rio Grande , ventures , at last , the positive order that he must cross and encamp , with a part of his force , west of the Nueces . This much must suffice for the indirect proof that Taylor 's own judgment was against advancing into the disputed territory . The following extract , from a letter of General Taylor , from the camp at Corpus Christi , on the 30th Oct. , is a direct proof in point : " Before the President 's instructions of 30th July reached me , ( the cunning letter of Sec . Marcy ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . " He , indeed , adds , that the position whence he writes , on the right bank , has more advantages than any on the other , and suggests , in addition-falling in , apparently , with the spirit which he found to be prevailing with the cabinet-that " one or two suitable points , on or near the Rio Grande " should be taken possession of , as soon as the entire force under him is concentrated , as " greatly facilitating " the settlement of the boundary , if the line of the Rio Grande is determined on as the " ultimatum " of our government . IBut to resume the regular order of events : // On the 6th August , the Adjutant-General notifies General Taylor that the 7th infantry , andthree companies of dragoons , are ordered to join him in Texas , for , says the letter , " although a state of war with Mexico , or an invasion of Texas by her forces , may not take place , it is , nevertheless , deemed proper and necessary that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success , any crisis which may arise in Texas , and which would require you , by force of arms , to carry out the instructions of the government . " The letter further calls upon General Taylor to report what auxiliary troops , in case of an emergency , he could rely upon from Texas , and " what additional troops , designating the arms , and what supply and description of ordnance , ordnance stores , and small arms , &amp;c. , judgingfrom any information you may possess as to the future exigencies of the public service , " he , General Taylor , might deem necessary to be sent into Texas ; informing him , at the same time , that 10,000 muskets and 1,000 rifles had already been issued for Texas . Here is another of the cunning devices of politicians to shift the responsibility for all consequences upon the commanding general ; and , although it occurs in a dispatch from the office of the adjutant general , yet he writes , as he expressly says , " pursuant to the instructions of the Secretary at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , that the very paragraph we have printed above in italics , was interlined by the Secretary himself . How could a general in the field , in a region like that of Texas , judge of " future exigencies of the public service , " when those exigencies-whatever they might be-would be wholly dependent on measures adopted at Washington , over which the general cotild exercise no control , nor form any judgment as to what they were likely to be . The whole purport of this insidious inquiry strikes us as preparing , in advance , a justification of the administration forany deficiency in adequate supplies of men or munitions , in case of the worst ; while all the benefit and all the credit of diminished expenditure , arising from not forwarding such supplies-as , knowing their own views , they were bound to dowere to inure to the administration . On the 23d August , Secretary Marcy writes to the General that the administration has no information , respecting the purposes of Mexico , that could enable them to give him more explicit instructions than heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe Mexico is making efforts to assemble a large army on the frontier of Texas , for the purpose of entering its territory and holding forcible possession of it , " and that it is trusted he will " take prompt and efficient steps to meet and repel any such hostile invasion . If Mexico cross the Rio Grande with any considerable force , such a movement must be regarded as an invasion of the United States , and a commencement of hostilities , " which , " to the utmost extent of all the means you possess , or can command , " must be repelled . The sequel of this letter , written three months and a half before the delivery of the President 's Message , in which he boasts of the annexation of Texas , as a " bloodless achievement , " which " no arm of force was raised " to accomplish , is tot ) significant-both of the expectation , and , we can not but think , wish of the administration , that some pretext would , or might be found , for drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given entire : " An order has been this day issued for sending one thousand more men into Texas to join those under your command . When the existing orders are carried into effect , you will have with you a force of four thousand men of the regular army . We are not enabled to judge what auxiliary force can , upon an emergency , be brought together from Texas , and , as a precautionary measure , you are authorized to accept volunteers from the States of Louisiana and Alabama , and even from Mississippi , Tennessee , and Kentucky . Should Mexico declare war , or commence hostilities ny crossing the Rio Grande with a considerable force , you are instructed to lose no time in giving information to the authorities of each of any of the ahovementioned States as to the number of volunteers you may want from them respectively . Should you require troops from any of these States , it would be important to have them with the least possible delay . It is not doubted that at least two regiments from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into the field . You will cause it to be known at these places what number and description of troops you desire to receive from them in the contemplated emergency . The authorities of these States will be apprized that you are authorized to receive volunteers from them , and you may calci*-late that they will promptly join you when // it is made known that their services are required . Arms , ammunition , and camp equipage for the auxiliary troops that you may require , xviii be sent forward subject to your orders . You will so dispose of them as to be most available in case they should be needed , at the same time with a due regard to their safety and preservation . Orders have been issued to the naval force in the gulf of Mexico to co-operate with you . You will , as far as practicable , hold communication with the commanders of our national vessels in your vicinity , and avail yourself of any assistance that can be derived from their co-operation . The Lexington is ordered into service as a transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York with a detachment of United States troops for Corpus Christi . She will be employed as the exigency of the public service may require . In order to keep up a proper communication between the army in Texas and the United States , the On-ka-hy-e , the Harney , and the Dolphin will be put into service as soon as they can be made ready as despatch vessels to convey intelligence , supplies , &amp;c . You will avail yourself of these vessels and all other proper means to keep the government here advised of your operations , and of the state of things in Texas and Mexico . " Accompanying this letter was a copy of a letter from the War Department to the Governors of Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , Tennesee , and Kentucky , apprizing them that General Taylor was authorized to call for such detachments of volunteers from each of them as he might require , and that it was not doubted the contingent asked from each would be cheerfully and promptly forwarded . A like letter had previously been written to the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from the adjutant*general , apprizing General Taylor that more troops were ordered to him , and urging him to frequent communications with the Department , as most alarming and exaggerated rumors fill the country , which , for want of official tidings from the army , the Department can not correct . On 30th August follows a letter from the Secretary to the General , repeating the injunction of frequent communication , and saying that only one letter had been received from him since he entered Texas . Referring to previous letters in which instructions had been given to repel any invasion of Texas , and to draw for that purpose whatever troops he should need , this letter-written appa rently under the apprehension ( the word is deliberately used ) that after all the talk about the Mexican army on the Rio Grande , nothing deserving of that name existed there , and therefore that the desired occasion of striking a blow and commencing hostilities , might not under previous instructions occur-holds this extraordinary language : " You have been advised that the assembling of a large Mexican army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grande , with a considerable force , will he regard . ' ed by . the executive here as an invasion of the United States , and the commencement of hostilities . An attempt to cross that river with such force will also be considered in the same light ! " Here is plainly seen the spirit in which the whole matter was conducted . First of all the deed was to be the cause of war ; but as the possibility of its being accomplished , lessened , the attempt was to be considered a sufficient cause ; and for the purposes of the administration , it is not to be doubted , that an attempt by a few hundred rancheros or other lawless and irregular partisans , to cross the Rio Grande , by swimming their horses into it with an appearance of earnest , would have been gladly seized upon and considered by our war-desiring cabinet as a " considerable force . " It is further evidence of this , that the despatch in question thus concludes : " In case of war either declared , or made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of Texas ; but the pursuit of this object will not necessarily confine your action within the territory of Texas . " In the passage here italicised by us , peeps out the first distinct avowal of the dearly cherished purpose of conquest and territorial aggrandizement . An attempt being made , or imagined to be preparing , the General is told he may consider defence to mean offence , and that instead of protecting Texas to her extremest western limits , he may invade Mexico . Look to the sequel of this letter . " Mexico having then commenced hostilities , that is by an attempt real , or feigned , or feared , " you may in your discretion , should you have sufficient force , and be in a condition to do so , cross the Rio Grande , disperse or capture the forces assembling , to invade Texas , defeat the junction of troops assembling for that purpose , drive them from their position on either side of that river , and , if deemed practicable and expedient take and hold poesession // of Matamoras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need say , " adds oar moral Secretary , " that enterprises of this kind are only to be ventured upon under circumstances , presenting afair prospect of success ! " Success , not right , is thus to be the chief consideration , and so that he can make sure of the plunder , the General is not to stand about the guilt , and blood and outrage , through which alone it can be obtained . Still peace remained undisturbed-the Mexicans would not cross nor attempt to cross the Rio Grande , and General Taylor would not do anything in the way of provoking them , by advancing at his own discretion , into the vicinity of that river . Another month and a half past , and the prospect of an invasion by Mexico becomes fainter and fainter , so that on the 16th October , the Secretary is obliged to inform Gen. Taylor that " the information we possess renders it probable that no serious attempt willbe at present made by Mexico to invade Texas , although she continues to threaten incursions . " Something then must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is the expedient thus communicated to the General in the same letter of 16th Oct . " On the supposition that no active operations on your part , will be required during the approaching winter , an important question to be decided is the position or positions to be occupied by your forces ; this must be determined mainly with reference to the objects for which the army under your command was sent to Texas . You will approach as near the western boundary of Texas ( the Rio Grande ) as circumstances will permit , having reference to reasonable security , &amp;c. , &amp;c . " Farther on in examining whether the present position occupied by General Taylor ought to be changed , and whether his whole force should be kept together , or divided , the Secretary concludes that " these are questions which must be in a measure left to your judgment , or at least the decision upon them here-if there be time - will be influenced in no inconsiderable degree by the information and views which you may furnish the department . You need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what you deem proper to be done . " The italics in the above extract are ours , and are introduced in order to mark the true character of this correspondence - designed , and artfully calculated , from beginning to end , to stimulate Taylor , without incurring the responsibility of a positive order , to advance to the Rio Grande , in the hope , as we can not but believe , of provoking Mexico to some overt act of resistance , which should be the signal of immediate invasion and war . The wary General was not to be so entangled , for although in a letter of 4th October , from Corpus Christi , he had expressed a belief that if Mr. Bancroft 's instructions of 15th June , directing him to occupy a site on , or near , the Rio Grande , were to be carried into effect , Point Isabel , at the mouth , and Laredo , higher up on the left bank of the river , and holding in observation the main route from the interior of Mexico passing from Monterey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the occupation of those points , the ultimate settlement of the boundary question would be facilitated ; he yet added : " Mexico as yet having made no positive declaration of war , or committed any overt act of hostilities , I do not feel at liberty , under my instructions , particularly those of July 8th , ( the cautionary ones to which we have already called attention , as issued by Mr. Secretary Marcy , on returning to his post , and finding what a fire-brand had occupied it during his temporary absence , ) to make a forward movement to the Rio Grande without authority from the War Department . " On the  |p7th  November , General Taylor refers , specifically , to Mr. Secretary Marcy 's letter of 16th October , of which he had previously acknowledged the reception in letters of 1st and 2d November , which letters are not given . In this letter of the 7th he says , in reference to the views expressed in his letter of the 4th , which , so far as they designated Point Isabel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occupy , coincided with the wishes of the cabinet ; that the intelligence since received from Mexico had tended to modify those views . The General evidently supposed negotiations were in progress , and in that persuasion he adds : " The position now occupied by the troops may , perhaps , be the best , while negotiations are pending , or , at any rate , until a disposition shall be manifested by Mexico to protract them unreasonably . Under the supposition that such may be the views of the Department , I shall make no movements from this point , until further instructions are received . " General Taylor had jua* // received from Commodore Conner , a letter of the 24th October , from off Vera Cruz , in which he informed him " that the Mexican government had just acceded to the proposal to arrange the existing difficulties by negotiation . " From this time forth to the end of the year , all General Taylor 's dispatches seemed to anticipate a peaceful and successful negotiation . Hence , as the General would not see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor take upon himself the responsibility of hazarding the success of the negotiation he supposed pending , by advancing to the Rio Grande , and menacing Matamoras , the war-seekers at Washington were obliged to take the responsibility , so long and anxiously shunned ; and accordingly on the 13th January , 1846 , Congress then being in session , the Secretary of War thus writes , " I am directed by the President to instruct you to advance and occupy , with the troops under your command , positions on , or near the east bank of the Rio del Norte , as soon as it can conveniently be done , with reference to the season and the routes by which your movements must be made . From the views heretofore presented to this department , it is presumed Point Isabel will be considered by you an eligible position ; this point , or some one near it , and points opposite Matamoras , and Mier , and in the vicinity of Loredo , are suggested to your consideration . * * * Should you attempt to exercise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a free navigation of the Del Norte , it is probable that Mexico would interpose resistance . You will not attempt to enforce this right without further instructions . " Nothing can be plainer than that the administration foresaw , that by advancing Gen. Taylor to the river overlooking Mexican towns , and claiming to exercise as of right the free navigation of a river , heretofore wholly Mexican , and where Texas had never had a custom-house , nor shown a flag , resistance would necessarily follow on the part of Mexico . But though ordered to provoke , General Taylor was not as yet to be at liberty to overcome this resistance , while confined merely to the question of navigation ; but his , ld instructions still remained in full force : to consider any attempt by a considerable body of Mexicans to cross the Rio Grande as an act of war , and to repel it accordingly . Feb. , These specific instructions to advance , General Tayloracknowledges on 4th February ; and says he shall lose no time in carrying them out : urging anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had previously done , that a small vessel of war should coverthe movement to Point Isabel . It is not out of place here to remark that when these orders were given to General Taylor to advance , it was not known , and could not be known , in Washington , whether Mr. Slidell , the minister appointed to negotiate with Mexico , and who was then in that capital , would be received or not . He reached Vera Cruz on 30th of November , proceeded soon after to the city of Mexico , was courteously received there ; and but for the overthrow of Herrera 's administration by a military revolt , headed by General Paredes , would , as the President says , in his message of 11th May , 1846 , " there is great reason to believe , have been received by Herrera . " But , on the 30th December , thatfunctionary resigned the presidency , and the supreme power of Mexico passed into the hands of a military leader . But Mr. Slidell still remained in the country . Yet , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that our negotiator might be received , the peremptory order is given from Washington to the commander of the army on the Nueces , to advance to the Rio Grande ; and this order is thus , in the face of the facts here specified , justified by the President in his message " This force ( that under Gen. Taylor ) was concentrated at Corpus Christi , and remained there until after I had received such information from Mexico , as rendered it probable , if not certain , that the Mexican government would refuse to receive our envoy . " Yet it was not till 21st December , that President Herrera did refuse to receive him , and that , as President Polk acknowledges , under duress and against his own inclinations , and at the moment of a revolutionary explosion . The minister himself did not think this final , for he remained in the country . President Polk did not think it final , for he instructed Mr. Slidell to present himself anew to the successful rival of Herrera , Paredes , and ask to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country till late in March , before asking for his passports , and abandoning all hope of negotiation . Notwithstand* ing all which Mr. Polk , who , on the 13th // 117 January , had ordered the army to march to the Rio Grande , tells Congress , in his message of 11th May , 1846 , that this army was not moved from Corpus Christi until he had received information from Mexico , that an envoy could not be received . General Taylor marched from Corpus Christi on 10th March , and encamped opposite Matamoras on the 28th March , having effected his march without firing a shot or experiencing any resistance . In crossing the Arroyo Colorado , however , a Salt Lagoon about thirty miles east of the Rio Grande , he was warned by a picquet of Mexican Cavalry , that if he persisted in crossing that stream , it would be taken as an act of war ; and in like manner , before reaching Point Isabel , a formal protest by the Prefect of Tamaulipas , was put into his hands against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any portion of the department under his , the Prefect 's , charge . Disregarding these notices , but not molesting or detaining the Mexican officials ; disseminating on all hands assurances that the rights , person , property and religion of all persons peacefully pursuing their avocations , would be scrupulously respected ; and that all provisions and forage furnished for the army would be paid for at the highest prices , the American troops moved onward to the riverthe fatal river , as now it was to be too soon and truly designated . Before the march , the inhabitants along the river were represented to be welldisposed to the Americans . Traders from Matamoras were constantly in the camp at Corpus Christi . In the letter of 26th February , Gen. Taylor alludes to some influential citizens of that town , as then in his camp , with a large number of mules for sale . But no sooner arrived and encamped in hostile array , opposite Matamoras , than all seemed changed . " Our approach , " says Gen. Taylor , in a dispatch of 29th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matamoras , " seems to have created unusual excitement at that place , and a great deal of activity has been displayed since our arrival , in the preparation of batteries . * * * The attitude of the Mexicans is so far decidedly hostile . An interview has been held , by my direction , with the military authorities of Matamoras , but with no satisfactory result . " In his next dispatch , of 6th April , Gen. Taylor says : " On our side , a battery for four 18 pounders will be completed , and the guns placed in battery to-day . These guns bear directly upon the public square of Matamoras , and within good range for demolishing the town . THEIR OBJECT CAN NOT BE MISTAKEN BY THE ENEMY ! " In point of law and of fact , however , the two peoples were at peace-there was no " enemy . " Congress was in session , which alone has the power to declare or authorize war ; and yet , under the bidding of the Executive , a general officer of the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range to demolish the peaceful town of a neighboring nation ; tells us the object of the battery can not be mistaken by the enemy ! meaning the aforesaid peaceful inhabitants ; and , in the face of all this , the President reports , and the Congress of the U. S. votes , that we are the injured party-that we are not the assailants but the assailed ; and that Mexico , stung to desperation by the aggravated insult of thus having one of her chief cities placed under the fire of our batteries , and maddened by the morningandthe evening drum beat of a stranger army , which , without a declaration of war , was then domineering over the soil always before ruled by Mexico-that Mexico causelessly , unjustly , rushed into hostilities with us . It is an insult to the sense of right , and to the spirit of manhood of every American , thus to argue . We feel , we all feel , that under like circumstances , not a day , not an hour , would elapse before we should rush , sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult us , nor suspect that in thus doing we were the aggressors , but solely acting upon that instinct which God has implanted in the breast of every man fit for life and freedom , to defend both-at all hazards-against all who menaced the one or would degrade the other . When any body of reputable American citizens can persuade themselves that the responsibility of really commencing the war , belongs , under such circumstances , to Mexico , they may be ready to accept Mr. Polk 's version of this whole matter , but most assuredly they would not be accepted by the American people at large as the true exponents of national feeling . The Mexicans , who , as General Taylor says , could not mistake the object of his batteries , were expected to resist . It was , as we verily believe , a deliberate calculation that , under such provocation , they could not but commit some overt // act , which would be immediately availed of as an apology to " cry havoc , and let slip the dogs of war , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unsuccessful but prophetic opponents of annexation had foreseen , the unrighteous schemes of aggression and conquest . Unless we have failed in the preceding pages to make ourselves understood , it follows that in the whole operation , first of ordering the army into Texas , and then of marching it to the Rio Grande , the Cabinet have acted without the concurrence of judgment , but rather in opposition to the judgment of the commanding general , whom they have , at the same time , sought by every sort of device , to put forward in such position , as , in the event of defeat and disaster , would make him the scape-goat . It has been an ungracious and humiliating task , thus to track the devious windings of selfish partisans , incapable apparently of appreciating the elevation in which circumstances have placed them , and wholly strangers to that noble ambition which puts country before all personal calculation , and if war is to be made , makes it with a full consciousness of its evils , but with a lofty conviction that the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it be no little peddling parsimonious war . From the beginning it has been a party war , for party purposes , and selfish and sectional interests , so fashioned and stamped by those who plunged us into it , and so conducted wherever their influence could confine its operation within party limits . Happily  --  and this brings us to the consideration of the second head in our chapter-the army of the U. S. knows no party , but , looking to the flag of the Union , and deeply imbued with love of country , it has won laurels , beneath the lustre of which we all are proud to repose , and to feel that humanity , courtesy and discipline , not less than daring valor , have been exemplified and honored by their conduct . The length to which this paper has already extended , will compel us to abridge , more than we desire , the summary it was proposed to make of the feats of arms of our soldiers , but it will be a welcome relief to turn to it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet at Washington . We have already stated that on the 11th March Gen. Taylor broke up his encampment at Corpus Christi , and marched to the Rio Grande . From the difficulty of subsistence , and scarceness of water and of forage , he was obliged to put intervals of days between the detachments of even his small army , which did not number 4000 , nor , in spite of repeated and urgent requisitions , for a small armed vessel , of light draft of water , to cover the left flank of the force , and facilitate and strengthen the occupation of Point Isabel , was Gen. Taylor able to obtain this succor . The whole force which thus commenced the active campaign , was of the regular army , consisting of part of the 2d regt. of dragoons , under Col. Twiggs ; detachments from the four regiments of artillery , constituting one battalion under the command of Bt . Lieut. - Colonel Childs ; and portions of the 3d , 4th , 5th , 7th and 8th regiments of infantry , with Ringgold 's and Dun-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer and ordnance officers . rrhe discipline acquired in the camp at Corpus Christi , where large portions of the troops had , for the first time , the opportunity of seeing and learning the evolutions of the line , having mostly before been stationed in small detachments at widely separated posts , told with good effect upon the long march to the Rio Grande , of about 180 miles . Atthe crossing of the Arroyo Colorado , a deep ford , where resistance was denounced if they should attempt to pass , the passage was effected with a degree of order , regularity and despatch eminently creditable . The field pieces being placed in battery on the bank , so as to cover the crossing , the advance was led by Capt . C. F. Smith , of the 2d art. , with the light companies of the 2d brigade , ( Worth 's , ) and a more spirited movement , or one more steady withal , is , it is conceded , rarely witnessed . it was sufficient to satisfy the Mexican cavalry corps of observation , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of resistance , and the whole personel and materiel of the army , men , ammunition , artillery and wagon train were safely crossed . Point Isabel was thus the firstplace permanently occupied and garrisoned . As our troops approached it , they perceived that the buildings were in flames . They hastened their march and arrived , still unresisted , in time to aid in extinguishing the conflagration , and rescuing the town from destruction . // 1847 . Military Conduct of the War . Leaving , at this point , his train and stores , with a garrison sufficient-with the aid of some vessels of war , opportunely arrived off the Brazos , to co-operate with him  --  to hold it against attack , Gen. Taylor followed up the left bank of the Rio Grande till he came opposite Matamoras , and then made his stand . Before he began his march , and during its whole course , the General took great pains to impress upon the people and the authorities , that he was not advancing as an enemy , nor to make war upon Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. to Texas up to the Rio Grande , including the free navigation of that river , free alike to the Mexicans and the Americans . The protest of the Prefect of Tamaulipas , and the warning at the Arroyo Colorado , had led to no ill words or ill conduct , and thus far all was bloodless . Two dragoons , who , on the approach of Gen. Taylor towards Matamoras , had fallen into the hands of the Mexicans , were , upon the requisition of Gen. Taylor , returned to him , and , notwithstanding the commotion which his encampment over against Matamoras naturally excited there , no overt acts of hostility were perpetrated . Gen. Taylor at once proceeded to fortify his position , and there he lay ; bugle answering to bugle ; and all the fierce and dread array of war , exhibited on either side of the river , and yet war was there none . The first untoward incident , was the disappearance of Col. Cross , the Quartermaster in chief of the army , who , having ridden out from the camp unattended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command at Matamoras , to the inquiry addressed to him by Gen. Taylor , disclaimed all knowledge of the fate of Col. Cross : and it was only after several days that the body was found , mutilated in death at the hands , as seemed to be understood , of some straggling rancheros , a sort of predatory mounted peasantry , who had fallen in with , murdered , and robbed him . About the same time , Lieut . Porter , sent out with a scout of men , was attacked by a party of these rancheros , superior to his own in number , and the fire-arms of his men being rendered useless by rain , they could make no resistance , and by the order of their officer dispe*sed and saved themselves . The Lieutenant and one of his men were killed ; these , however , were not avowed acts of war , nor acknowledged as such by the Mexican commander , who treated them as robberies and murders . Soon , however , a more serious face was put upon matters . Desertion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be added , mostly confined to foreign born soldiers ; while that of the Mexicans was daily increasing . Arista having succeeded to the command in chief , immediately notified Gen. Taylor of the fact , and summoned him to retire behind the Nueces , and to commence his march within 24 hours ; failing whereof he , Arista , would consider it an act of war . The Mexican commander was courteously , but firmly answered b* Gen. Taylor , that , being where he was by order of his government , he could only retire from that position by like order , and that meantime he was prepared and resolved to hold it . Having ascertained at the same time , that the Mexican force at Matamoras was mainly provisioned from the sea , and looking upon the summons of Gen. Arista as decisive of hostile purposes , Gen. Taylor immediately ordered the blockade of the Rio Grande , and thus cut off the supplies of the Mexican camp . He was himself , at that time , distant some 30 miles from the bulk of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown only what was needful for a few days . Rumors were soon spread of the purpose of Arista to cross the river and throw himself between Fort Brown and Point Isabel , and frequent alerts in the American camp were occasioned by these rumors . One in an authentic shape having reached the American commander , he on the 24th of April sent forth a detachment of dragoons some 60 or 60 strong , under the command of Capt . Thornton , to reconnoitre ; this detachment coming suddenly upon a small body of Mexicans , without waiting to ascertain their number , or choose favorable ground for operating , at once charged upon the enemy-as Mexicans in arms on the east side of the river were considered . Engaged beyond retreat in an unfavorable position , surrounded , as was soon evident by a greatly superior force , the gallant efforts of the detachment to disengage itself were in vain ; the officers were shot down or disabled , and some sixteen officers and men , altogether , being killed or wounded , the remainder were compelled to surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such , immediately made a call upon the Governors of Texas and // Louisiana , for four regiments of volunteers from each State , to be sent forward with the least possible delay . Apprehensive , moreover , now that blood had been shed , that active operations might be undertaken by the Mexican forces , to cut him off from his supplies at Point Isabel , the General , leaving a small guard at Fort Brown , marched with his main force , on the evening of the 3d May , to Point Isabel , for the purpose of escorting thence his trains of munitions and provisions . He accomplished the march without encountering any obstacle ; and after resting his forces for a day , and organizing a Very large train , he commenced his returning march on the 7th of May , and after advancing about 12 miles , and ascertaining that a considerable enemy 's force was before him , bivouacked for the night ; the next morning the army moved again , in hourly expectation , and with an ardent desire to meet the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At two o'clock in the afternoon. , at a place until then obscure , but which the events of that day have consecrated to history , they found their enemy posted on ground of their choice at Palo Alto ; the battle was immediately joined , and for more than five hours it was fought with gallantry unsurpassed , and with decisive success by an American army of 2,200 men , against a Mexican force of 6,000 regulars composed in great part , of regiments inured to war , and led by skillful chiefs ; there was too , a considerable irregular or guerilla force . Our gallant soldiers slept upon the field of victory ; and the next morning , 9th May , sought the enemy , who , it was ascertained , had been reinforced from the opposite side of the river , and still stood betwixt Gen. Taylor and his camp at Fort Brown . Fierce and bloody as had been the contest of the 8th , that of the morrow was yet more obstinate and bloody ; for the position in which the Mexicans had posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they held all the roads , and which , off the roads , was impassable to man or horse-was , of itself , most difficult of appproach and uneven ; defeat , then , might be the destruction of the whole army : for Fort Brown was in the rear of the Mexicans , and the Rio Grande on their right and rear . With strength of position , therefore , superior numbers , and under the eye almost of one of their capital cities , Matamoras , Feb. , the Mexicans had every motive to impart courage and confidence . The small American force- " few and faint , but fearless still , " reduced but exasperated by the loss of precious lives on the 8th , encumbered with an immense provision train in the rear , which must be protected against sudden and separate attacks , while the real battle should be raging in front-suffering for want of food , and especially of water-aware too that defeat was ruin , not to themselves alone , but to the gallant and devoted band left in Fort Brown , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was heard by Taylor 's force-boldly advanced , and in reliance upon their own hearts and arms for all that men could do , they promptly accepted the battle offered them by the Mexicans  --  and by a display , alike decisive and admirable , of skill and high daring , in all the arms , artillery , infantry and horse , they swept the enemy with slaughter and in confusion from the field . We do not repeat here the brilliant incidents of these battles , nor reproduce the official dispatches of the commander ; dispatches hardly less admirable for modesty and precision , than the acts they commemmorate were for courage and conduct , because both the events and the record of them are fresh in every mind . The overthrow of the Mexican army was complete - it was a rout  --  and the Rio Grande , which was crossed in haste and terror , while swallowing up many a victim who had escaped the sword of battle , interposed an impassable barrier to the pursuit of our army . Properly equipped and provided , that army would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Mexican force , and at once taken possession of Matamoras . But arrived at the bank of the river , neither boats nor pontoon train were there to enable the troops to cross , and the victors were obliged to look on with unavailing chagrin , while their prey , almost within their grasp , escaped them ; because the authorities at home , in spite of repeated calls and remonstrances , from Gen. Taylor , had not provided the army with any means of crossing rivers . It was , from the very moment when General Taylor was first ordered to Texas , the favorite project of the administration , that he should occupy the left bank of the Rio Grande ; and that he should be prepared , at need , to carry the war across that river ; yet sent they to him // neither flat and shallow boats , which , after he had occupied Point Isabel and blockaded the Rio Grande , might so readily have been transported up the river , nor the yet more convenient and portable ponlon trains . Bitterly did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of the victories of the 8th and 9th . In a dispatch from Matamoras , ( which city he entered without resistance on the 18th May , ) he thus writes to the Secretary of War , under date of 18th May : " I have the honor to report that my very limited means for crossing rivers , prevented a complete prosecution of the victory of the 9th . A ponton train , the tieees8ity of which lexhibited to the department last year , would have enabled the army to cross , on the evening of the battle , take the city , with all the artillery and stores of the enemy , and a great number of prisoners-in short to destroy the Mexican army . But I am compelled to await the arrival of heavy mortars , with which to menace the town from the left hank , and also the accummulation of small boats . In the mean time the enemy had somewhat recovered from the confusion of the fight , and ought still , with the 3,000 men left him , to have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor on the morning of the 18th ; General Arista , after a vain attempt to negotiate an armistice during which both forces should remain separated by the riverhaving abandoned the place with all his available force , leaving his sick and wounded to our mercy . Thus was consummated the first act in the great national drama of war , and it must not be forgotten that the glorious actors were of the regular army . The regiments and companies were all skeleton regiments and companies , with a number of officers and non-commissioned officers equal to full war complements of privates , while , in fact , the effective rank and file of each company was about one-third of the war complement . This excess of officers will explain at once , in a great measure , the success of the troops , and the unusual proportion of casualties among officers . The gallant youths whom the nation had educated at West Point , and five-sixths of all the officers engaged on the Rio Grande were graduates of the Military Academy-had many of them never seen an enemy before-yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ness , and more resource . From the nature of the ground and of the contests , the results depended very much - much more than in battles of considerable numbers is usual-upon the individual judgment and prowess of each officer andseparate squad , or detachment . Foreseeing this , after arranging the order of battle , almost the only order given by General Taylor was , that his troops " should feel the enemy with their bayonets , " holding the cavalry in reserve to act as occasion should require . Well indeed was the order carried out at Resaca de Ia Palma , and when Duncan 's dreadful artillery had turned the tide of battle , and Ridgely ' seeing his comrade May , of the dragoons , darting forward to storm a Mexican battery with horse , drew by his opportune fire , the fire of the Mexicans , the day was ours-for the steady bayonet of the infantry following up the slaughtering fire of the light artillery , and the impetuous charge of the dragoons , put an end to all resistance , and converted retreat into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown which , during seven mortal days and nights , had been constantly bombarded and cannonaded from the opposite shore . Without a single heavy mortar , with few heavy pieces of artillery , with an insufficient supply of ammunition , and a garrison of about 400 men , Major Brown , of the 7th infantry , to whose fidelity and skill this fort was intrusted , had maintained , without flinching , the unequal fight , until on the 4th day , by the explosion of a shell he was dangerously wounded , and died on the very day , and within hearing , of the victorious battle , of the 9th . But the garrison never dreamed of surrender , though often and again summoned ; and sorely as they were tried , for in the occasional lull of the fire upon them , from very weariness sometimes-they beard with beating hearts the cannonading of the battle field of the 8th  --  a contest almost wholly of artillery  --  and when the sun went down that night , and no tidings came of the result , these beleaguered few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fortunes of their country , and in the valor of their comrades ; and the next day when the cannonading was renewed , and the sound and rush of men came nearer and nearer , they felt then that ours was the conquering cause , and finally from their ramparts they saw , and by some distant // but well-directed shots , increased the confusion and the danger of the Mexican rout and flight across the river ; and then soon opened their arms and hearts to receive and welcome back their own victorious brethren , exulting in their success , and mourning , as men and soldiers only mourn , the precious comrades who were to return no more . From this period the war assumed a new aspect . Thus far the regulars alone had done the work . Now large bodies of volunteers were poured forth , and soon an army of some 20,000 men was under the command of Taylor . The various towns on the Rio Grande were in succession occupied , and finally the march to Monterey was undertaken , and that strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrisoned by a regular force , numerically superior to the whole of that volunteer and regular displayed against it , was , after several days ' bloody fighting , captured . The conduct of the volunteers in these trying scenes was remarkable for steadiness under fire , and impetuosity in attack . They showed themselves worthy rivals and competitors with the regulars . The gallant Watson , of the Baltimore battalion , laid down his life while leading a charge in the streets of the city , and other brave men of the Ohio and other regiments sealed their devotion to country with their blood . It has been made a matter , if not of reproach , at least of that sort of comment which wounds as much as decided censure , against Gen. Taylor , that he should have permitted this city to capitulate upon what are called such easy terms ; and we find , by a private letter from the General himself , which , while these sheets are passing through the press , has ( most indiscreetly , and , in our judgment , unjustifiably ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the war department and the Executive joined in the quasi condemnation . The General 's answer is complete , alike , we should appiehend , to military judgment and to that of humanity and duty . Here it is : " Although the terms of capitulation may be considered as too liberal on our part , by the President and his advisers , as well as by many others at a distance , particularly by those who do not understand the position which we occupied , ( otherwise they might come to a different conclusion in regard to the matter , ) yet , on due reflection , I see nothing to induce me to regret the course I pursued . The proposition on the part of General Ampudia , which had much to do in determining my course in the matter , was based on the ground that our government had proposed to his to settle the existing difficulties by negotiation , ( which I knew was the case without knowing the result , ) which was then under consideration by the proper authorities , and which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the whole of his people were in favor of peace . If so , I considered the effusion of blood not only unnecessary , but improper . Their force was also considerably larger than ours ; and from the size and position of the place , we could not completely invest it ; so that the greater portion of their troops , if not the whole , had they been disposed to do so , could , any night , have abandoned the city , at once entered the mountain passes , and effected their retreat ,  --  do what we would ! Had we been put to the alternative of taking the place by storm , ( which there is no doubt we should have succeeded in doing , ) we should , in all probability , have lost fifty or a hundred men in killed , besides the wounded ; which I wished to avoid , as there appeared to be a prospect of peace , even if a distant one . I also wished to avoid the destruction of women and children , which must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , they had a very large and strong fortification , a short distance from the city , which , if carried with the bayonet , must have been taken at a great sacrifice of life ; and , with our limited train of heavy or battering artillery , it would have required twenty or twenty-five days to take it by regular approaches . " This is the language of a commander who knows how to despise the clap-trap of his profession  --  and no profession is without it-who , amid the wildest scenes of war , and the excitement of victory , preserves the serene balance of his mind , and is neither afraid nor ashamed to listen to the voice of humanity , in thus consummating a triumph , which could not be more complete , though it might have been more doubtful , and would certainly have been more bloody , if extorted from the resistance of resolute despair . We are prevented , by want of space , from following up the progress of these victorious troops , in their advance upon , and occupation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we designed to do , at the movements of the columns under Generals Wool and Kearney ; the last having performed a march and accomplished results of the greatest moment and diffi@@184028179.txt OuR author , we have said , has no dramatic power ; he can not pass out of himself into other minds , so as to express their thoughts and feelings ; but merely practises a sort of ventriloquism ; expresses his own thoughts and feelings under other names ; and if he can not mould , can not osganize the elements of character into individual unity , much less can he organize several characters into dramatic unity . But there is a further question , namely , whether and how far he evinces any truly poetic power . Milton , for example , has little dramatic power , and Wordsworth still less ; nevertheless , both are true poets ; though always expressing their own thoughts and feelings , they express them poetically ; that is , they express them in images , not in propositions . Shakspeare , as everybody knows , keeps himself entirely out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nature does , and lets us see them with our own eyes : Milton and Wordsworth transfuse themselves into whatever they represent , so that , to see the objects they set before us , we have to look through their eyes ; nevertheless , they do give us objects , not mere impressions ; their thoughts and feelings are imaged forth , not merely uttered ; are organized into sensuous forms , which stand out before the mind objectively and independently , like the living , organic forms of nature . Here is obviously involved a process of creation ; thought and image are moulded , are created into organic unity . This , then , is to make , to create , as nature creates ; and this is what we mean by poetry . One of our author 's eulogists says , " nature is as rife with symbols to this poet as she is withfacts to a common observer . " We are at a loss to conceive what this writer means by symbols , when he instances " Festus * as an example of symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct idea of poetry , though a very gross misstatement , in regard to the book . " Festus , " it seems to us , is in no wise replete with symbols , but with mere analogies , which this writer has probably mistaken for symbols . A symbol , we take it , is an incarnation of something ; that is , a significant form , involving a consubstantiation of the thing signified with the form signifying , as man is a consubstantiation of soul and body . To the true poet , undoubtedly , the facts and forms of nature do become symbolic ; he incarnates his life in them ; informs them with his passion ; makes them embody and express his meanings ; in a word , he creates the spiritual elements of thought and the material elements of nature into organic unity , and thus speaks in symbols , instead of propositions . When , for example , Ben Jonson says , " Slaughter bestrid the streets and stretched himself To seem more huge ; " and when Coleridge says , " The scorpion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its sting in its own bead ; " here , we see , the thought is incorporated , consubstantiated with the image ; and if we undertake to disembedy the thought into a proposition , we shall inevitably lose it . If this be a just account of symbolic writing , we shall find very little of it in " Festus . " For synibols , he gives us mere similes ; uses the facts and forms of nature , not to enibody , but only to illustrate his meaning ; nay , he often seems to use the illustration rather for its own sake , than for the sake of the thing illustrated ; he has a morbid hunting after analogies , and is perpetually tormenting truth and nature to get them . Accordingly , we have never seen a book so stuffed with figures , and rarely seen one so barree of imagination . He gives us thoughts and images , not in concrescence , but in collation ; instead of containing and expressing the thought , the image , if image it can be called , merely lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His power is not synthetic , creative , but merely aggregative ; the elements are not fused , or even welded , but only tied together . He has , indeed , a good degree of subtlety in detecting analogies , and an unheeding VOL . V.-NO . II . Continued from p. 61. 9 // vanity or fondness for using them , which often startles the reader on a first perusal , hut is pretty sure to weary him on a second , and disgust him on a third . This is shown in his constant use of the them ; so that , instead of having the one in the other , we have the one and the other . Take , for illustration , this passage from Wordsworth " The most alluring clouds which mount the sky Owe to a troubled element their forms ; Their hues , to sunset ; " Or this , from Ben Johnson : " Morn riseth slowly , as her sullen ear Had all the weights of sleep and death hung at it : She is not rosy-fingered , but swol'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds As if she threatened night ere noon . " Or this , from Shakspeare " Come , seeling night , Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day ; And , with thy bloody and invisible hand , Cancel , and tear to pieces the great bond Which keeps me pale In these passages , the thought is given in the image , as the soul in the body ; the two are perfectly organized together , so that in graspingone we get them both . Now , compare with these the following passages from Festus : " And thy love ever hangs about my heart , Like the pure pearl-wreath which enrings thy brow . " * * * * . * * * " Truth and falsehood meet in seeming , like The leaf and shadow on the pool 's face . " $ 5 ' * * * * * " This same sweet world , Which thou would'st deem eternal , I shall see Destruction suck back , as the tide a shell . " * 5 ' 5 ' 5 ' * " The wild-flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so we fling our feelings out , The tendrils of the heart to bear us up . " It will be seen at once that , in the former passages , the image is used to express , in the latter to illustrate the thought ; in those , the two are grown together ; in these , they are merely laid together ; there we have a coalescence , here a mere analogy , between them . We will subjoin two more passages from " Festus , " to illustrate our meaning still further . " Sometimes the thought ( of God ) comes swiftening over us , Like a small bird winging the still blue air And then again , at other times , it rises Slow , like a cloud which scales the sky , all breathless , And just over head lets itself down on us . Sometimes we feel the wish across the mind Rush , like a rocket tearing up the sky , That we should join with God , and give the world The slip . " The next is from the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet , Venus , where the author is manifestly " in the very torrent , tempest , and whirlwind of his passion , " and therefore would naturally be as poetical as he possibly could . Speaking of " the great bards of Greece and Romp and his own masterland , " the herQ goes on to describe them as men , " In whose words , to be read with many a heaving Of the heart , is a power like wind in rain ; - Who , like a rainbow clasping the sweet earth , And melting in a covenant of love , Left here a bright precipitate of soul , Which lives forever through the lives of men , Flashing by fits like fire from an enemy 's frontWhose thoughts , like bars of sunbeams in shut rooms , Mid gloom all glory , win the world to lightWho make their very follies like their souls , And , like the young moon with a ragged ed * , e , Still in their imperfection beautifulWhose weaknesses are lovely as their strengths , Like the white nebulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least is likest light : Men whom we build our love round like an arch Of triumph , as they pass us on their way To glory and to immortalityMen whose great thoughts possess us , like a passion Through every limb and the whole heart ; whose words // Haunt us , as eagles haunt the mountain all ; Thoughts which command all coming times and minds , As from a tower , a warden-fix themselves Deep in the heart , as meteor-stones in earth , Dropped from some higher sphere . " Thus the author frequently tumbles out a huge rabblement of thoughts and figures , in such a way , that , while grasping the one , we lose the other ; the body becomes a mere corpse and the soul a mere ghost in our embrace . He often stimulates the mind , indeed , but seldom feeds it ; is always provoking the desire of something , but withholding the performance ; rarely brings the mind anything to lay hold of and rest upon , as an external , objective support , but keeps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own shadow . In a word , it *s not things , but his perceptions , that he delights in showing us ; and objects seem of no value to him but for the analogies he can find or fancy between them . What we have been saying of particular . passages , holds equally true of the work as a whole . It has no vitality , no organic unity ; is at best but a string of beads , the thing that connects being no part of the things connected : nothing grows out of what has gone before , or grows into what comes after ; the parts do not vitally cohere at all , do not come along in living continuity , but only in a sort of mechanicaljuxtaposition . Though the work abounds in changes and shiftings beyond almost any other , it has no real progress ; is always gyrating , never advancing : and , so far as we see , it makes little difference whether we begin at one end and read towards the other , or begin in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends and read towards the middle . The book , in short , is in no sense an organization of elements , but simply an aggregation of fragments ; of fiagments , too , not drawn together by any mutual affinity , but held together from without ; the parts containing within themselves no reason why they are there , and not elsewhere , or why they are so , and not otherwise ; but bundled up without order , or method , or consistency , and differing from a work of art , as a chaos differs from a world . Though after reading it we have a vague recollection of many things , we have no impression of the work as a whole . It has no more unity of interest or of effect , than of time and place ; the only unity it can boast is in the paper and binding . We can not make the parts stand together in our thoughts , can not make them blend into one result . As the work is but a succession of disjointed members , without any living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , it seems to the retrospect unusually crowded with matter , as " things scattered seem more numerous than composed ; " we remember many parts , because there is nothing but parts , no whole , to be remembered . A genuine work of art might contain much more matter , and yet seem , in the recollection , to contain less , because we should think of it as one and entire ; - forget all the parts , and retain the whole . And the parts are often no better in themselves than in their relations to others . As the whole is but a collection of incoherent passages , so particular passages are often but collections of incoherent thoughts . When he would , apparently , make us believe him absorbed in some single passion or purpose ,  --  a condition which would be apt to bring all his movements into sympathy and unanimity ,  - -  he can not , or will not , keep true to our state of mind through the same speech , or even the same sentence . There is a heterogeneousness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not lie together in the mind ; lest the effect should not be startling and original enough , he heaps together incongruities . We will give a few specimens , though the book is so full of them that we hardly know what ones to select . The first is from the hero : " Oh ! I was glad when something in me said , Come , let us worship beauty ! and I bowed , And went about to find a shrine , but found None that my soul , when seeing , said enough to . Many I met with where I put up prayers , And had them more than answered ; and at such I worshipped , partly because others did , Partly because I could not help myself ; But none of these were for me , and away I went , champing and choking in proud pain ; In a burning wrath that not a sea could slake . " Truly , " there is no composition " in these statements . If he wanted to worship beauty so much , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than answered , and where he could never worship enough , why did he conclude none of them were for him ; why worship so reluctantly , and finally tear himself away , brimful of wrath and vengeance ? In another place , the hero begins one of his most brilliant speeches by saying : " Merit or demerit none I see In nature , human as material ; In passions or affections , good or bad . " A little further on , however , he declares : " Why , Conscience is The basest thing of all ; its life is passed In justifying and condemning sin ; Accomplice , traitor , judge and headsman , too . " And shortly afterwards , he breaks out : " Oh ! everything To me seems good , and lovely , and im-mortal ; The whole is beautiful ; and I can see Nought wrong in man or nature . " Here we learn , that , though there be good and bad passions and affections , yet there is no merit or demerit in them ; that , though all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all ; that , though there be no such thing as right or wrong , everything is good and beautiful ; and that , though conscience is the worst of all things , yet there is nothing wrong in man or nature . The next specimen is from the same person , describing to one of his lady-loves the beings and objects he has encountered on some of his excursions with Lucifer : " There is no keeping back the power we have ; He bath no power , who bath not power to use . Some of these bodies whom I speak of are Pure spirits ; others , bodies soulical , For spirit is to soul as wind to air . " We confess ourselves unable to interpret this passage ; as nearly , however , as we can judge , the logic of it is this : He hath no power , who can not use it ; therefore , he who bath power , can not help using it . But perhaps the meaning is : He who bath power , can not keep from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , bath none . So much for the logic of this profound remark ; its truth , we presume , can be made apparent in this way : If we have power to walk , then we can not help walking ; or , if we can help walking , then we have no power to walk . The logic of the second remark we take to be this : spirit is to soul as wind to air ; therefore , some of these bodies are pure spirits , others " soulical " bodies . Such , we say , appears to be its logic ; its meaning , we presume , will be obvious enough to every one at a glance . Now , what shall be said of an author that produces , or of a public that praises , . such stuff as the above , under the name of poetry ? But does any one say there is much in the book " that has no merit but its truth , and no excuse but nature ? " Then we answer , these things are utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , unless to the author 's " divine insanity of dreams : " and even if they were ever so natural , it is not tho business of art to dish us up the offal and dregs of nature . Nothing but a diseased craving for the notoriety of fools or madmen ; nothing but a restless desire to attract attention by provoking ridicule and contempt , could ever induce men or boys to talk like the dramatis personn of this book : and we do not see how any on* could give such a representation of them , unless he had forsaken truth and nature , or been forsaken by them ; that is , unless he had become a liar or a lunatic . The book is , if possible , still more replete with rhetorical than with logical incongruities . His exquisite perception of analogies often leads him to see them where there are none to be seen . Thus , Lucifer , speaking in heaven , says : " What is the dark abyss of fire , and what The ravenous heights of air o'er which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats ? " What does he mean by ravenous heights of air ? We can not make the words hang together into an image at all . Does he mean that the heights of air are greedy , or that they are black ? - that they have the stomach or the plumage of the raven ? Again , in the same speech , addressing the Almighty , he says : " Father of spirits , as the sun of air We can not perceive any resemblance between the relation of the sun to air , and that of God to his creatures . In another place , Festus , after relating several things that have happened to him , goes on : // " At last came love , not whence I sought nor thought it , As on a ruined and bewildered wight Rises the roof he meant to have lost for-ever : " Now , is not that a queer explanation of the coming of love ? That love often steals upon us when and where we neither expect nor desire it , we know very well from experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might stray under the roof he meant to shun ; but we can not conceive how " on a bewildered wight rises the roof he meant to have lost . " Again , the hero , speaking of himself and his lady-love , says : " And we Grew like each other , for we loved each other ; She , mild and generous as the sun in spring , And I , like earth , all budding out with love . " So then , it seems she grew like the sun in spring , and he like the earth in spring , and yet they grew like each other . What a difference there must have been between them ! In the description of " the evil spirit of the universe impersonate , " it is said : " Perdition and destruction dwelt in him , Like to a pair of eagles in one nest . " Why , this is like setting a grand object before us , and then throwing a mote into the eye to aid our vision of it . The description goes on : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his heart as earthquake , and en-gulphed World upon world . " How was his heart like an earthquake , if it swallowed world upon world ? Festus somewhere expresses his dread of old age thus : " I hate the thought of wrinkling up to rest ; The toothlike aching ruin of the body , With the heart all out , and nothing left but edge . " Is toothlike aching ruin but another expression for wrinkling up to rest ? Or , are they two distinct things , which meet together in old age ? What can he mean by saying that when a man 's heart is all out , there is nothing left but edge ? Is a man made up altogether of heart and edge ? But perhaps edge is some one of the intestines which we are not acquainted with . Elsewhere , the hero assigns , as his reasons for cafling upon God ,  --  " That the feeling of the boundless bounds All feeling , as the welkin doth the world . " This we can not understand enough to criticise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book , to contain a great deal of expression where , nothing is expressed . We will add a few more specimens , without attempting to analyze them . The first is from a lady , calling attention to his piano : Hush its tones ; They melt the soul within one , like a sword , . *1lbeit sheathed by lightning . " In the next , the voice of one singing is described as " A soft rich tone , a rainbow of sweet sounds , Just spanning the soothed sense . " Is not this somewhat like setting Niagara to music , and playing it on a fiddle ? Here is a description of patience under grief : " She never murmured at the doom which made The sorrow that contained her , as the air Infolds the orb whereon we dwell . " The following is from the hero 's account of the author , or rather , the author 's account of himself : " All things talked thoughts into him . The sea went mad , And the wind whined , as t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the awful sun Thundered his thoughts into him ; and at night The stars would whisper theirs , the moon sigh hers . " This is the first time we recollect to have heard of the sun , moon , and stars addressing , or seeming to address , themselves to the ear . But especially , as the sun does not ordinarily appear at all in a thundershower , we do not see how he could appear to do the thundering . The author frequently runs an idea through several successive figures , until the reader 's thoughts , dandled about from figure to figure , lose both the idea and themselves in a sort of poetical bag : // " This is a snakelike world , And always hath its tail within its mouth , As if it ate itself , and moraled time ; The world is like a children 's merry-go-round ; What men admire , is carriages and hobbies . " Here is another : " Thus saith the hard to his work : lam Thy god , and bid thee live , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soul of my soul ! Thou earnest and wentst , sunlike. from morn to eve ; And smiledst fire upon my heaving heart , Like the sun in the sea , till it arose And dashed about its house , all night and mirth , Like Ocean 's tongue in Staffa 's stormy cave . Thou art a weakly reed to leon upon ; But , like that reed the false one filched from heaven , Full of immortal fire . " Lest there should not be enough , we will add one more , still finer : The hard 's aim is to give us thoughts his art Lieth in giving them as bright as may be . And even when their looks are earthy , still , If opened , like geodes , they may be found Full of all sparkling , sparry loveliness . They should be wrought , not cast ; like tempered steel , Burned and cooled , burned again , and cooled again . A thought is like a ray of light-complex In nature , simple only in effect ; Words are the motes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shore ; they show Where the mind ends , not how far it has been . Let every thought , too , soldier-like , be stripped , And roughly looked over . The dress of words , Like to the Roman girl 's enticing garb , Should let the play of limb be seen through it , And the round rising form . A mist of words , Like halos round the moon , though they enlarge The seeming size of thoughts , make the light less . " This rather beats the passage in the play : " Hamlet . Do you see yonder cloud , that 's almost in shape of a camel ? Polonius . By the mass , and t is like a camel , indeed . hamlet . Methinks it is like a weasel . Polonius . It is backed like a weasel . Hamlet . Or , like a whale ? Polonius . Very like a whale . " In this way the author frequently goes on comparing , and comparing , and comparing a thing , until there is nothing but comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a broken mirror , which so breaks , and scatters , and multiplies the image , that the eye gets bewildered , and takes no impression at all ; one piece of the mirror , by itself , might he good for something , but all of them together are worse than none . In the examples we have given , the author seems to have thrown in figure after figure , not because they suited his purpose , but because he had them in his mind , and wanted to dispose of them . Often his thoughts and illustrations darken and perplex each other , because his mind gets so captivated by some slight analogy between them , as to lose sight of the many differences , in which another mind can hardly help losing the analogy . It is this thing , among others , that makes the book so difficult to read . Though one of the shallowest books we have ever seen , it is one of the hardest to understand . We can not follow the meaning , superficial as it is , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many inaptitudes and impertinences , that , before we reach the end of a thing , we have totally forgot the beginning . The imagery is in no wise taken up , and assimilated and incorporated with the idea , but glued , or nailed , or plastered on ; and thus overlays and hides what it should have been made to express . Perhaps we shall not have a better place than this to point out certain passages in the book which we are utterly at loss how to class , or how to characterize . The first is from the hero 's speech at the centre of the earth , expressing his desire to return to the surface : " Thee , agy world , thee , universal heaven , And heavenly universe ! thee , sacred seat Of intellective Time , the throned stars , And old oracular Night , by night as day To me thou canst not but be beautiful ! Whether the sun all-light thee , or the moon , // Embayed in clouds , mid starry islands round , With mighty beauty inundate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great drop of light , From her full , fiaming urn hangs trenzu-bus ,  - -  Yea , like a tear from her the eye of night , Let Jail o'er nature 's volume as she reads ; - Or when , in radiant thousands , each star reigns In imparticipable royalty , Leaderless , uncontrasted with the light Wherein their light is lost , the sons of fire , Arch element of heavens ; when storm and cloud Debar the mortal vision of the eye From wandering o'er thy threshold-more and more I love thee , thinking on the splendid calm Which bounds the deadly fever of these days . " The next is from the same person , alluding , obviously , to his early doings in the way of poetry " Oh ! to create within the mind is bliss ; And , shaping forth the lofty thought , or lovely , We seek not , need not heaven : and when the thought , Cloudy and shapeless , first forms on the ? mind , Slow darkening into some gigantic make , How the heart shakes with pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder ; 1 or as might , Of old , the mortal mother of a god , *Vhen first she saw him lessening up the skies . And I began the toil divine of verse , Which , like a burning bush , doth guest a god . " One more passage , we presume , will suffice . It is from the Muse , giving Festus an account of a sunbeam she seems to have spent a day with : " And but this morn , with the first wink of light , A sunbeam left the sun , and , as it sped , I followed , watched , and listened what it said . " Here follows the sunbeam 's speech , which we omit on account of its length . Well , the Muse kept eaves-dropping about the sunbeam , until it came where " a boyish bard sate suing night and stars for his reward , " when , lo " The sunbeam swerved and grew , a breathing , dim , For the first time , as it lit and looked on him ; His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fever fed his eye . Clouds lay about his brain , as on a hill , Quick with the thunder thought and lightning will . His clenched hand shook from its more than midnight clasp . Till his pen fluttered like a winged asp , Save that no deadly poison blacked its lips : T was his to life enlighten , not eclipse . The young moon laid her down as one who dies , Knowing that death can he no sacrifice , For that the sun , her god , through nature 's night , Shall make her bosom to grow great with light . Still he sate , though his lamp sunk , and he strained His eyes to work the nightness which remained . Vain pain ! he could not make the light he wanted , And soon thought 's wizard ring gets disenchanted . When earth was dayed , was marrowed , the first ray Perched on his pen and diamonded its way ; - The sunray that I watched ; which , proud to mark The line it loved as deathless , there died darkDied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as many ways as worlds to God ; There in the eye of God again to burn , As all men 's glory into God 's must turn . " Now , will any one have the goodness to tell us what all this means ? " The lines have under meanings ? " But have they any upper meanings ? On the whole , we reckon there is no meaning in them ; that the whole thing is mere nonsense or mere glory , done up in a wrappage of transcendental mud . One article of our author 's creed is , " believe thou art inspired , and thou art ; " and surely nothing but the most invincible faith in his own inspiration could ever have induced him to perpetrate such passages as the above . Being , and believing himself to be , inspired , he was of course bound to utter whatever came into his mind , or into the place where his mind ought to be , presuming it to be very true and very deep , even though he could not himself understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he was inspired , but with such a conceit , and affectation , and lust of originality , that he spontaneously rejected truth and sense , and took to falsehood and nonsense , as offering him a wider field , and less competition . But our author is armed at all points ; and we know very well that whatever censure we may aim at him on this score must inevitably rebound upon ourselves . Hear him : " All rests with those who read . A work or thought Is what each makes it to himself , and may Be full of great dark meanings , like the sea With shoals of life rushing ; or like the air , Benighted with the wing of the wild dove , Sweeping miles broad o'er the far western woods , With mighty glimpsesof the central lightOr may be nothing-bodiless , spiritless . " According to this principle , unintelligible jargon is just as good as anything-nay , better , because it sets no limit or restraintto the reader 's perceptions . XVhere there is nothing to be seen , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is this great advantage in total darkness , that one " finds in it nothing but what he brings to it ; " and such is the plan upon which much of this book seems to have been written . Other authors seem to have thought that the mind was to feed , not on itself , but on something out of itself ; that it was to grow and thrive by assimilation , not by introspection ; and that it was to rise by laying hold of something without and above itself-not by pulling away at its own ears . They therefore regarded truth , beauty , nature , as something objective and external to the mind ; something that the mind was to go out after , and submit to , and learn from . Accordingly they aimed at giving the reader something to grasp and understand ; objects to see , and light to see them by ; in a word , to teach him , and feed him , as they had been taught and fed-instead of surrounding him with darkness and vacuity , where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and where his mind might snuff back its own exhalation s , and project , and realize , and enjoy its own figments , and fancies , and dreams , and passions , with no objects to check its freedom , or tame its self-will , or humble its pride , or rebuke its vanity . Of course , therefore , their writings are not full of " great dark meanings , " as of " nothing , " according to the state of mind the reader happens to be in ; the very objects they bring before him cut off his vision of transcendental infinitudes ; and they do not give him the satisfaction of feeling that " he finds nothing in them but what he brings to them . " But men are liable to err ; that is , unless they be " inspired , " - at least with confidence in their own inspiration . But our author has other ways to attract attention besides wading in the mud , and one of the chief is-walking on stilts . We have never seen a book so filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely step , but strides from the sublime into the ridiculous ; rushes over the line in a perfect gallop . From his representations , one would think he considered works of nature , like works of art , to be just what each one made them to himself . As he finds nothing in natural objects but what he brings to them , so , of course , he finds the same things in them all ; that is , sees the same great dark meanings everywhere . This extreme subjectiveness , this perpetual substituting of his own feelings , and fancies , and sensations , and conceptions , for external objects , is incompatible with everything in the shape of truth and nature . To say that a man perceives the same things everywhere , is , to say he has no perceptions whatever ; at least , no true ones . He who sees all things to be of the same shape , and size , and color , and quality , of course sees nothing as it is . This is not seeing things , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting the one God has made for us ; and things dreamed , of course are of no consequence , save to him who dreams them , nor even to him , save while he is dreaming them ; and he who goes about dreaming awake , and substituting his dreams for things , is what we call a lunatic , not a poet . To he sure , we ought not , and we mean not , to blame the lunatic for uttering his lunacy ; but we do mean to blame sane people ( if , indeed , they be sane ) for calling his utterings poetry . We digress . To return to the work before us . There is n6 calmness , no repose , no equanimity about it . Scorning the modesties of nature , the author is perpetually working himself into a spasm , a very paroxysm of poetry . Free , natural , spon // 131 taneous movements are not original and surprising enough ; so he goes into convulsions , and writhings , and distortions , and feats of " ground and lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice into a monotonous squall ; lest his work should not throw all others into the shade , he colors everything till it glares ; that he may overtop all competition , he runs everything up as high as he possibly can , and so of course runs them all up into a dead level . Thus his work is chiefly made up of the pinnacles of things ; taking its start where nature leaves off , and ending in a wearisome flat of superlatives . Diamonds , doublerefined stars , and unfadino* rainhows , heavenly harmonies , and paradisaical fragrances , agonies , ecstacies , suns risen on midday , darkness organized , seventh heavens , and central hells , creatures girded with lightning and shod with sunbeams , eyes revolving lightning , and words revolving death and fire ; - these , and such like rarities , form the staple of the hook . We will suhjoin a few examples in this kind . Here is the hero 's account of a scene between himself and one of his lady-loves : " I came and knelt beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes the feeling which unmakes , undoes , Which tears the sea-like soul up by the roots , And lashes it in scorn against the skies . Twice did I madly swear to God , hand clenched , That not even He nor death should tear her from me . Then first we wept ; then closed and clung to , , ether ; And my heart shook this building breast , - of my Like a live engine booming up and down . She fell upon me like a snow-wreath thawing ; Never were bliss and beauty , love and woe , ilaveled and twined together into madness , As in that one wild hour . " In the next , the same person is describing his feelings towards another of his fair friends , speaking of himself in the " third person singular . " " She did but look upon him , and his blood Blushed deeper , even from his inmost heart ; For at each glance of those sweet eyes a soul Looked forth as from the azure gates of heaven ; She laid her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formless mass of marble feel While feature after feature of a god Were being wrought from out of it . She spake , and his love-wildered and idolatrous soul Clung to the airy music of her words , Like a bird on a bough , high-swaying with the wind . He looked upon her beauty , and forgot , As in a sense of dreaming , all things else ; And right and wrong seemed one , seemed nothing ; She was beauty , and that beauty everything . He looked upon her as the sun on earth , Until , like him , he gazed himself away From heaven , so doing ; till he wept ,  - -  Wept on her bosom , as a storm-charged cloud Weeps itself out upon a hill . " Here is something from the hero about himself : " God bath endowed me with a soul that scorns lifeAn element over and above the world 's : But the price one pays for peril is mountains high . There is a sense beyond the rock of deathA woe wherein God bath put out his strengthA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred secret hath flown out of us , And the heart broken open by deep careThe curse of a high famishing spirit , Because all earth but sickens it . " Here is something more about himself : " Enough shall not fool me . I fling the foil Away . Let me hut look on aught which casts The shadow of a pleasure , and here I bare A heart which would embrace a bride of fire . Pleasure , we part not . No . It were easier To wring God 's lightning from the grasp of God . " " What are years to me ? Traitors ! that vice-like fang the hand ye lick Ye fall like small birds beaten by a storm Against a dead wall , dead . I pity ye . Oh ! that such mean things should raise hope or fear ; Those Titans of the heart , that fight at Heaven And sleep by fits on fire ; whose slightest stir s An earthquake . " Here is something rather grand about his own poetry : // " His words Felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , when in a dark , hot , cloudful state , Doth make metallic , meteoric , ball-like . He spake to spirits with a spirit 's tongue , Who came compelled by wizard word of truth , And ranged them round him from the ends of heaven . " And here is something about old age : " Yet some will last to die out thought by thought , And power by power , and limb of mind by limb , Like lamps upon a gay device of glass , Till all of soul that 's left by day and dark ; Till even the burden of some ninety years Hath crashed into them like a rock ; shat-tered Their system , as if ninety suns had rushed To ruin earth ,  --  or heaven had rained its stars . " We could fill pages with just such passages , but we presume these are enough . Even if he begins with a good thought , well expressed , he is pretty sure to run it-into the ground-before he gets through . Here is an instance : " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrest and search , And shake it - bow the tall soul as by windRush over it , like rivers over reeds , Which quiver in the current-turn us cold , And pale , and voiceless , leaving in the brain A rocking and a rio ing-glor ious , But momentary-madness , might it last , And close the soul with heaven as with a seal . " Assuredly nothing is less poetical than this lost of exaggeration-this fanaticism of effect . There is no poetry in it , because there is no truth . It is utterly false ; false to nature and to the human mind ; false to all that is within , and all that is around us . It results , at best , in meie tumidities , which may , indeed , look very plump and solid at first , but which , under a little scarifying , at once collapse into the merest platitudes . The truth is , there are real differences in things ; differences of color , of size , and of quality ; to make them all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent them all alike , is to misrepresent them all ; and a universe of superlatives is but a universe of nothings . Besides , by always attempting thus to force a grand effect , our author , as might be expected , strikes so hard and so often as to stun the very sensibilities on which the effect depends . Our minds are susceptible in proportion as they are delicate ; and in proportion as they are delicate , are they disabled for going by all attempts to force them along , Accordingly , true poetry is modest and reserved ; implies more than is expressed ; " means more than meets the ear ; " especially avoids making what is inexpressible ridiculous , by attempting to express it : and , by shunning all extremes ; by keeping hack much that is thought and felt ; by shadings , softenings , and concealings , so that " part is seen , imagined part ; " in a word , by observing the harmonies and proportions of things , it sends our thoughts beyond itself to that nature of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work very much on the principle of offering as little as possible to the eye , and leaving as much as possible to the thoughts . Accordingly , in most of her productions , and in all of her best productions , there is a manifest inclination to roundness , as though she knew this to be the form which unites most matters with least show . Where this modesty of nature is violated , and everything exposed to the eye-.flattened out , so to speak , into visibility -- of course there is nothing left for the mind and the feelings to do . Probably no poet has been praised so much by the judicious as Shakspeare ; and all , who have praised him understandingly , have praised him , because he was true to nature and to life-true to facts and things as they appear to the common sense and feeling of mankind . Doubtless much of his excellence as a poet was due to his singular purity of heart ; his freedom from everything like vanity and selfishness ; his willingness to make his character everything , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting upon it . Had he been less humble and receptive , he would have been less productive ; had he turned his thoughts inward upon themselves , rather than outward upon nature , and preferred his own consciousness of truth and right to all external embodiments of them , his works would , no doubt , have seemed as important to himself as they do to us , and as insignificant to us as they did to himself . On the other hand , // many of our author 's literary vices probably spring from the bad moral state of his mind . He has , we should say , got up so high in his self-esteem , as to become vertiginous ; and his vertigo of course prevents all just visions of the objects around him . His mind seems to have fed on itself , on its own feelings , and fancies , and conceptions , until it has become inflated into a want of docility and deference ; a contempt for all rule , and precedent , and example , and authority . Claiming to oversee everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , he of course has no reverence , nothing to shame his personal peculiarities into the back-ground of his works ; and he sinks into littleness , because he finds no objects to awe down his passions , while they call up his powers . We know not whether this be more the author 's fault or his misfortune . It is the fault of the age ; and we intend these remarks not so much for him as for the class he represents ; the radicals and ultraists of the time ; men who seem to regard everything as folly but their own inventions ; who , though they have the law before them , sanctioned by much time and interpreted by long experience , prefer to be , or to make , a law unto themselves ; and who seem bent on substituting their own theories , which are of no consequence to us , for facts , which are of no consequence to them . XVe know not how to account for our author 's constant , unparalleled extravagances , except by supposing his vanity so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a thing , he can not choose but step between , and enjoy the gaze . He seems unwilling to see or show anything as it , or as others see and show it . He can not endure to share the credit of his work with nature . He must have a truth altogether his own , else he will none of it ; lest , as in Shakspeare , we should forget the giver in the gift . So inordinate is his passion for originality , that he will even embrace absurdity and falsehood to compass it . He therefore suffers no object in nature to pass him , until he has discolored and disfigured it with the marks of his own ingenuity ; can not bear to part with the gift until he has spoilt it by writing it all over with the giver 's name . We must say a few words in regard to our author 's versification , if , indeed , he can be said to have any versification . Poetry is justly regarded as the most comprehensive and catholic form of com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore addresses the greatest number of susceptibilities ; and what addresses the greatest number of susceptibilities in the individual mind , of course addresses the greatest number of minds . In this respect poetry approaches , more nearly than any other species of writing , to nature , none of whose works are addressed to the reason alone , or the feelings alone , or the senses alone , hut to them all alike , and at once . She everywhere speaks to us in a synthesis and concrescence of many elements , and therefore speaks to all our faculties of sense , and thought , and feeling , at the same time . It seems , indeed , to be a general law of things , that all truth , all life shall come to us in forms and combinations addressed equally and simultaneously to all the elements of our being . Hence Christianity entered into nature , so to speak , clothed itself in natural forms , in order to reveal itself to us ; nay , perhaps it had to be thus embodied in order to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to raise us ; had to become like us in order to assimilate us to itself . It thus comes to us in the most complex , catholic expressionan expression as comprehensive as humanity itself , and covering all the sensuous , intellectual , social , moral , and religious susceptibilities of our nature . In like manner , poetry , as the word itself implies , is a synthesis and concrescence of many elements ; and among these elements , not the least important is that of verbal harmony . Thought , image , feeling and music enter alike into the structure and substance of poetry ; and if either element be in excess or defi ciency , the work is proportionably imperfect . Thus the whole structure is homogeneous , accordant , consentaneous ; and the head , the heart , the eye , the ear , all our susceptibilities of sensuous and spiritual communication , are moved and satisfied together ; and perhaps none of them will move to much purpose , save in a concert of them all . Accordingly , Milton speaks of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move harmonious numbers ; " that is , a state of mind in which the thoughts spontaneously flow into " numerous verse , " as the only audible expression of that rhythmical tendency which seems to pervade and govern all the higher movements of our nature . Thus the true poet is at once a painter and a musi // cian ; expressing thought and feeling both pictorially and musically at the same time ; blending , creating the elements and functions of light and sound , of imagery and melody , of vision and hearing , into one movement and one result . In poetry , however , imagery and melody bear much the same relation to thought and feeling , as body does to soul ; the former , though essential to the true , full expression of the latter , are subordinate to the latter . Thought and feeling , to he effectively expressed , have to be embodied to the senses ; and imagery and melody are their fittest embodiment . But the test of a good body is , that there be neither so much nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there he enough of it to hold , and yet not so much as to hide , the spirit which it enshrines ; that , in a word , the soul be neither lost out of it , nor buried up in it . In like manner , the test of good expression in poetry is , that there be neither so much nor so little as to divert the mind from what is expressed ; that there he enough of it to keep the thought for us , and yet not so much as to keep the thought from us . " Something too much of this . " Pope 's verse has been justly censured for its " creamy smoothness , " its monotonous regularity . Though perfectly loaded down with thought , and not particularly deficient in imagery , it has an excess of sweetness which operates to the reader 's annoyance . We can not call the versification harmonious , for the melody is pushed into disproportions , and therefore into disharmony with the other elements , so as to hinder rather than help a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a musical concert should be played so loud as to droxvn rather than complete the harmony of the other parts , and thus prevent that abandonment of mind to the whole , which forms its appropriate effect . Still worse , however , is it with a species of so-called poetrythe work of certain melodists or musical grammarians-which it is now very much the fashion to admire and rehearse , especially among those who have got so spiritual as to see all paradise in mere vibrations of air ; - poetry in which the true order of the poetic elements is reversed-thought made subordinate to music , instead of music to thoughtsense the vehicle of sound , instead of sound the vehicle of sense  --  and which , being designed altogether for the ear , has little imagery and less thought , and consists merely of articulate wind , ingeniously done into verse . However , it is very popular , especially with the female and juvenile public ; so , Heaven defend that we should speak disrespectfully of it . We will only add , that , being hut lipdeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its effects ; so that all it can do is , to tickle the hearing awhile , and then die . Such is not the fault with our author ; no one can charge him with excess of melody . His versification is monotonously irregular-it is as ragged and jagged as a cross-cut saw . With all other great poets , harmony has been the rule and discord the exception ; with him , this order seems reversed : as others indulge in discords to keep their harmony from tiring , so he seems to indulge in harmonies to keep his discord from tiring . He had resolved , we should think , that his manner should be as original as his matter ; and knew not how to carry out his resolution , save by choosing what everybody else had rejected . We trust he will he safe from the annoyances of imitation . His style has neither the rhythm of verse nor of prose ; nay , it has not the rhythm of anything , unless of chaos or bedlam . We should suppose he had cultivated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not imagined that such a crude , awkward , bungling , uncouth , grotesque piece of versification could he wrought out of the English language . How his Pegasus could have traveled such a long , rough , rugged journey , without jarring its teeth all out , is beyond our comprehension . He even seems to affect what is ugly and offensive in language ; goes out of his way to get it ; sacrifices grammar and perspicuity to compass it ; as though he were under a fascination of deformity , and supposed that ugliness , if pushed far enough , would become beautiful and attractive . But , seriously , his versification is altogether the worst we have ever seen ; it is madness , without any method ; impertinency , without any reason mixed with it . His irregularities are so far from relieving the otherwise monotonous movement , that , as we said before , they form a monotony by themselves : discords are the most prominent element in the work ; are constantly grating on the reader 's ear , distracting his attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot , nor amble , nor pace , nor gallop ; all movements are // 135 jumbled in together ; and no sooner does the mind get started in any one of them , than it is jerked off into another . The verse is thus a perpetual tantalization of the ear , a constant succession of expectations and disappointments ; no sooner does the ear set itself to enjoy music , than the music is snatched away from it ; no sooner does the ear set itself to do without music , than the music is thrust upon it . Thus continually plucked on and off , with too much music to let it sleep , and not enough to keep it awake , the ear is held in just that state which is most vexatious and distressing . Such a versification would have been fatal to the best of thinkers ; Shakspeare would have sunk beneath it , Milton could never have stood up under it : in short , there never was an author whose matter was good enough to redeem such a style ; nor , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good enough to redeem such matter . Judging merely from the specimens we have given , our readers may be surprised to hear that there is some genuine poetry in the book . It seems hardly credible that any one , capable of true poetry , should ever indulge in such absurd stuff as we have been quoting .. But as no man is wise at all hours , so , perhaps , few men are foolish at all hours . The truth is , no book can be accurately judged from mere specimens ; for the viewing of a thing by poets of course brings us at once into the regions of inequalities . Without attempting to explain how such different waters could flow from the same spring , we will simply assure the reader , that there are good passages in the book ; several that would do honor to a second or third-rate poet , and some even that might not disgrace a first-rate poet . We will produce a few of the passages which strike us as most worthy of honorable mention . The first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are calm , and fair , and passive . Earth Looks as if lulled upon an angel 's lap Into a hreathless , dewy sleep ; so still , That we can only say of things , they be . The lakelet now , no longer vexed with gusts , Replaces in her breast the pictured moon , Pearled round with stars ; sweet imaged scene of time To come , perchance , when , this vain life o erspent , Earth may some purer being 's presence bear ; Mayhap even God may walk among His saints , In eminence and brightness like yon moon , Mildly outbeaming all the heads of light Strung o'er nivht 's proud , dark brow . How strangely fair Yon round , still star , which looks half suffering from , . /lnd ha 11 rejoicing in , its own strongfire , . Miaking itself a lonelihood of light .

" " T was on a lovely summer afternoon , Close by the grassy maze of a deep tarn , Nigh half . way up a mountain , that we stood , I and the angel , when she told me this . Above us rose the gray rocks ; by our side Forests of pines , and the bright breaking wavelets Came crowding , dancing to the brink , like thoughts Unto our lips . Before us shone the sun . The angel waved her hand ere she begun , *1s bidding earth be still . The birds ceased singing , The trees from breathing , and the lake smoothed down Each shining wrinkle , and the wind drew off . Time leant him o'er his scythe , and , listenin went The circling world reined in her lightning pace A moment ; Ocean hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , as does the hand . *1 medit ative face . " Here is another passage of the descriptive kind from Lucifer , which strikes us as very clever : " Layer on layer God made earth , fashioned it , and hardened it Into the great , bright , useful thing it is . Its seas life-crowded , and soul-hallowed lands He girded with the girdle of the sun ; Veined it with gold and dusted it with gems , Lined it with fire , and round its heart.fire bowed // Rock-ribs unbreakable ; until at last Earth took her shining station as a star , In heaven 's dark hail , high up the crowd of worlds . " And here is one still better , from the Parson I now , an early riser , love to hail The dreamy struggles of the stars with light , And the recovering breath of earth , sleep-drowned , Awakening to the wisdom of the sun , And life of light within the tent of heaven ; - To kiss the feet of morning as she walks In dewy light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loveliness . " Besides occasional passages like these , the book contains a goodly number of detached thoughts and images , not unworthy to be remembered , and some of which , if properly read , will be apt to make themselves remembered . We will add such of these as most readily occur to us . " When we have truth , she is so cold And proud we know not what to do with her ; We can not understand her , can not touch ; She makes us love her , but she loves not us , And quits us as she came , and looks not back : Wherefore we fly to fiction 's warm em-brace , With her relax and bask ourselves at ease And in her loving and unhindering lap Voluptuously lulled , we dream at most On truth . " I loved her for she was beautiful ; And that she seemed to be all nature And all varieties of things in one : Would sit at night in clouds of tears , and rise All light and laughter in the morning ; yea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought or feeling , but gave holiday To all . " " Millions never think a noble thought ; But , with brute hate of brightness , bay a mind Which drives the darkness out of them , like hounds ; Throw but a false glare round them , and in shoals They rush upon perdition . " " To learn How to detect , distrust , despise mankind ; To ken a false , factitious glare mid much That shines with seeming saint-like purity ; To gloss misdeeds ; to trifle with great truths ; To pit the brain against the heart , and plead Wit before wisdom ; - these are the world 's ways : It teaches us to lose in crowds what we Must after seek alone-our innocence. ** " What is't to die ? I can not hold the meaning more than can An oak 's arms clasp the blast that blows on it . " " We live in deeds , not years , in thoughts , not breaths , In feelings , not in figures on a dial . " " Grciat thoughts are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not though many systems tend round them . " " I have studied my own life , And know t is like to a tear-blistered letter , Which holdeth fruit and proof of deeper feeling Than the poor pen can utter , or the eye discover . " " The poet 's pen s the true divining rod Which trembles towards the inner founts of feeling , Bringing to light and use , else hid from all , The many sweet , clear sources which we have Of good and beauty in our own deep bosoms . " " We live not to ourselves ; our work is life In bright and ceaseless labor as a star Which shineth unto all worlds but itself . " " There s a something in The shape of harps , as though they had been made By music . " There are several songs in the book , some of which , though marred by the author 's usual extravagance , are very touching and beautiful . We have room to extract but one " Oh ! if we e'er have loved , lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart be moved , lady , Wlien bound to break its vow . I 'll alway think on thee , And thou sometimes-on whom , lady ? And yet those thoughts must be Like flowers flung on the tomb , lady .

" With this and another equally fine , perhaps finer , beginning , " Oh , the wee green neuk , the sly green neuk , The wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a word of fault to find . For this strange medley , where we thus have a little divinity and a great deal of dirt , a few sunbeams scattered in amidst heaps of rubbish and mud , we know not how to account , except that the author , though capable of good things and beautiful things , has no sense or perception of fitness , or order , or propriety . He seems to have poured out whatever came into his mind ; to have uttered everything he could , however unfitly ; as though he thought it all inspired , sure enough , so that he could use no judgment or election in the matter . Perhaps we can not do better than apply to him some remarks of Ben Jonson 's touching certain of his contemporaries : " I deny not , " says he , " but that these men , who always seek to do more than enough , may sometimes happen on something good and great ; but very seldom : and when it comes , it doth not recompense the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more eminent , because all is sordid and vile about it ; as lights are more discerned in a thick darkness than a faint shadow . " Had Jonson written with a special eye to our author , he could not have given a better description of him . So much for the pretensions of this work as a poem . Though containing some poetry , it has not the least title , nor the least shadow of a title , to be called a poem . Viewed , indeed , as a literary production of any sort , it is altogether raw and crude ; crude alike in the conception and the execution ; crude as a whole , and crude in the details ; at least , the exceptions , like Gratiano 's reasons , " are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff ; you shall seek them all day ere you find them ; and when you have them they are not worth the search . " Because he had a few good thoughts , the author seems to have taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to quote his own words , " his soul was like the wind-harp , and sounded only when the spirit blew . " Acting on this principle , he obviously mistook certain agreeable sensations , arising , probably , from a healthy state of the digestive , or nervous , or veinous system , for supernatural visitings . It is well known that authors of his class are greatly addicted to inspirations of this kind . They are constantly putting forth their " glad animal movements " as divine imbreathings ; and the result is , any quantity of revelations , or utterances fresh from the limbo of sensual emotion , that is , from the fool 's paradise . To hear such people talk about inspiration , reminds us of a certain philanthropist we have read of , who , feeling the buttons of his pantaloons give way during one of his preachments , fancied that the chains were falling from the hands of oppressed millions . However , if any of the wise ones insist on calling " Festus " a poem , we will not quarrel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a monstrous mass of crudities , or rather , one monstrous crudity . A few remarks , touching the morality and religion of " Festus , " will close this article . Theologically speaking , the hook is in no wise a development of an idea or principle into a coherent , original system , but an eclecticism of whatever is most absurd and offensive in several systems : Calvinism , Fatalism , Universalism , Swedenborgianism , Pantheism , and Rationalism . Our author , as he informs us in the person of Festus , is " an ominist and believer in all religions . " And he believes in them all , not merely as essays or approximations towards " the absolutely true religion , " but as fragments thereof , yet to be reunited into their original whole ; and he probably designed his work as an effort towards this reunion . In justice to him , however , we ought to state , that he regards Christianity as , on the whole , the largest and best of those fragments . Nevertheless , he attributes no essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " All are relatively true and false , As evidence and earnest of the heart To those who practice or have faith in them . " // 138 Fe8t us . Accordingly he does not hold steadily to any one of them , but goes about culling and collecting whatever he finds true in them all , or as many as he thinks he has mastered . As might be expected , therefore , the book is a tissue of theological contradictions , which it is utterly impossible to follow ; the reader seems , indeed , to understand them for a while , but presently finds himself involved in perplexities which he can get over only by not trying to understand them . Under this surface , however , of contradictions , there runs a tolerably uniform spirit which may he best defined , perhaps , as subjective transcendentalism . It is to this spirit that our remarks will be directed . The docirines of the book , if , indeed , it can be said to have any , are altogether beneath criticism ; they are so exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to understand them , o* , if it understauds them , will be in any danger from them . Even in respect of its spirit , the work , as it con6entrates and utters the filth of the time , so it derives its chief importance from the tendencies of the time . We called the spirit of " Festus " subjective transcendentalism , to distinguish it from a kind of objective transcendentalism which is generally thought involved more or less in all morality , and rcligion , and even science . Doubtless there is something , both in nature and revelation , that transcends experience ; that is , transcends the powers and perceptions of sense . The things we see force upon us a knowledge of things that can not be seen . Nobody , we presume , believes there is nothing in a dog or an oak but the visible structure ; on the contrary , one can hardly help regarding the visible structure as the residence of something invisible . Thus , in the objects of sense the mind recognizes something akin to itself , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital powers and principles suspended and developed in material forms . Indeed , we can hardly think of truth , life , law , otherwise than as things spiritual and invisible , underlying and informing visible , material things . The mindrecognizes these things , because like-natured , congenerate , with them ; perceives truth and life , because itself is veriform and viviform-as the eye receives light in virtue of its lucifo rmity . Nay , the objects that we see contain something that transcends not only the senses but the understanding ; something mysterious , inexplicable , inex haustible : for , in nature , everything is related by some inherent virtue to every other thing ; and science has never yet exhausted the contents of a single fact . This , then , is what we mean by objective transcendentalism . It is the transcendentalism taught by Plato and Coleridge ; and is the opposite of that barren , lifeless materialism , which not merely conditions our knowledge on the perceptions of sense , but limits it to them ; and according to which nature is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers and principles , but only a succession and juxtaposition of phenomena . Here the mind is obviously taken out of the regions of truth , and life , and law , and shut up in a prison of matter and mechanism . On this ground there can be no such thing as morality or religion at all ; right , duty , justice , are words without meaning ; law means necessity and government is but a set of municipal regulations , where no man can possibly do wrong , because might is the very thing that constitutes right . Nay , on this ground , there can not , properly speaking , be any such thing as science ; for science aims , not so much at facts , as at the laws that determine them , and uses the former as exponents of the latter . But according to certain old-fashioned ideas , trdth , life , law , though transcending the perceptions of sense , are nevertheless truly and essentially objective , and must be known objectively or not at all . Embodied in the visible facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our senses to our minds ; " but we know and can know nothing of them , save as they are thus embodied . To learn them , in short , the mind has to resort and submit to the visible facts and forms in which they are objectively presented ; that is , the mind has to receive them from without , and can in no wise produce them from itself . Deferring and submitting to those facts and forms , the mind continually learns more and more of their contents , as it becomes more and more capable of them ; has something solid and permanent to rest upon , and is thus saved from the captivity and thraldom of theories and abstractions . Hence we may often hear a man of sense and experience , who has learnt enough of things to know he has not exhausted them , saying to a conceited , glib-tongued theorist : " My dear sir , please give me some facts ; a handful of these will outweigh a cart-load of your theories . " And he is right in speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of truth in their harmony and co-existence ; and so express a mulijiudinous meaning which it is not in the power of theories and abstractions to convey . Indeed , it is by recognizing truth , beauty , good , as existing without , that the mind unfolds something within corresponding to them ; it is by receiving and obeying law as an objective reality , that the mind develops it as a subjective principle : and if the mind presumes to reject the external embodiments of truth and law , to dispense with the facts in which they are objectively disclosed , and goes into itself in quest of them , it will only substitute its own notions and feelings for them . Here , then , the mind is obviously directed to external sources , and dependent on external objects ; has its centre out of itself ; finds peace and strength by moving in harmony with the order it is placed amidst ; is concerned to reform itself , rather than its whereabout ; to shape itself to truth and right , instead of misshaping truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and nature , and society , not the author or censor of them ; has something to aspire to and learn from , an opportunity to erect itself above itself : and the natural result is , reverence , docility , obedience , self-renunciation . At present , however , the world is favored with a set of teachers who have discovered that the things we have been speaking of have only a subjective origin and existence . The scope of their instructions is , that if we would find truth , beauty , good , we must introvert our thoughts , go into ourselves , and prosecute voyages of discovery among our own sentiments and conceptions . For facts , they substitute consciousness ; for external objects , states of mind : and as , according to the old system , truth , life , law , underlie visible facts and forms , and so transcend perception , so , according to this , they underlie thought and feeling , and so transcend introversion . Instead of facts , therefore , we are to take consciousness as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . We are to admit , indeed , the outward existence of what is seen and temporal , but the things that are unseen and eternal have no reality but within us . Thus , in respect of external objects , this system differs from the materialism alluded to above , only in making us substitute ourselves for what the other teaches us to deny . The old materialism , therefore , is not nearly so bad as this ; for the one is lifeless and barren , produces nothing ; the other produces what is far worse than nothing , is prolific of whatever is loathsome and diabolical , of unspeakable pride , and conceit , and vain-glory , and selfsufficiency . According to this system , God is revealed to us , not in what He has made and said , but in what we chance to think and feel ; and as no two minds have the same thoughts and feelings , and even those of the same mind are constantly changing , of course no two individuals have the same God , nor any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , God is but a creation of the mind ; heaven but a state of the mind ; the passage to heaven lies through ourselves ; our own spirits are the Door ; and the Way , the Truth , and the Life is to be found in our own hearts . Or rather , on this ground , we have and can have no God at all , but are under the sweet necessity of deifying our own passions and conceptions ; all our worship , reverence , obedience are due to the divine , ineffable , transcendental " Me ; " and when we are weary and heavy laden , we need but come to this same " Me , " and it will give us rest . In short , every man is to be , or to make a truth , a law , a religion , a God , a Saviour , a heaven , for himself ; is to fence himself , if possible , entirely with in himself , and fence everything else entirely out of himself ; must refuse to stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; must scorn to be upheld by any external support , and assert the inalienable right to hold himself up by his own breeches . Therefore it is , that the leading transcendentalists among us have become so stale , and sapless , and barren . Claiming to be sufficient for themselves , despising facts , renouncing all objective trusts , cutting themselves off from external resources , and isolating themselves altogether within themselves ; without sympathy , and without docility ; ambitious to produce , but scorning to be replenished from without ; carrying their head so high , in short , thmtt no streams can flow into them , they of course run themselves dry , and wither up in the solitude of their own self-sufficiency . As they began by refusing to be taught and influenced by the past , so they have lost their power to teach and influence the present . Lest their light should owe something to the // surrounding atmosphere , they enclose it in an exhausted receiver . They fail of originality , because they date everything from themselves , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as most men have , though few are so conceited as to publish them ; for , after concluding there is no divinity but within us , the next step is , to conclude that whatever comes from within us must be very divine . They give out as truth whatever seems true to them , though science or experience may have a thousand times proved it false . Ignorant of other men 's knowledge , they fancy themselves to have made discoveries , because they have not docility enough to learn what was known before . Most of what they glory in as original is as old as sin ; and about the only thing to be learnt from them is their own indocility . Such , then , is the moral and religious spirit in which nearly the whole of " Festus " is written . This subjective transcendentalism runs through the work as a sort of undercurrent , occasionally emerging to the surface in expressions like the following : " Oh there is naught on earth worth being known , But God and our own souls , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but the sense and soul We have of God within us , that can serve us . " " T is man aye makes His own God and his hell . " " Heaven is no place , Unless it be a place with God , all.where . It is the being good  --  the knowing GodThe consciousness of happiness and power . " " In all of us God hath his agony ; *Te are the cross and death of God , and graYe . But this spirit forms the support , not the surface of the book ; is rather everywhere tacitly assumed than anywhere openly expressed . All the characters agree in presupposing it as the root and basis of their thoughts ; it is the common substratum of all their notions and sentiments ; appears not so much in their words as in the breath their words are made of ; in short , it is the soul of the work , which , though itself unseen , gives cast and complexion to what is seen . It is involved in the author 's avowed preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his manifest inclination to speak as one having authority , in the very things where he has least right to speak at all ; in his attributing a divine origin and sanction to his own instincts and impulses , putting forth his amatory motions and carnal appetites for such virtues and affections as came only by grace , the slow , silent growth of religiouR doctrine and discipline ; in his regarding external objects and announcements as but occasions to develop the innate wisdom of the heart , and so freely substituting his own sentiments and conceptions for the objects and announcements that occasioned them ; in his elevating the spontaneous promptings of nature to the rank of objective truth , presuming everything to be good which gives him pleasure , everything bad which his inclination rejects ; framing a religion for himself out of his own desires and inventions ; making Revelation derive its authority from the heart to which it is addressed ; subjecting whatever comes as duty to his own judgment , thus making himself a law unto it , instead of receiving it as a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author 's moral and religious creed is all of a piece with his literary creed ; the spirit of the work , in these respects , is inseparably part and parcel with the same intense subjectiveness which we charged upon it as a work of art ; and is equally fatal to the author 's claims as an artist and as a moralist . As in books he finds no meaning , so in nature and Revelation he finds no truth , no law , no God , but what he brings to them . He has discovered that " the thoughts we think subsist the sar*ie in God , as stars in heaven . " As , with him , external facts and objects derive all their significance from the mind that contemplates them , so of course there is nothing in them for him to learn . If , therefore , a Revelation comes to him , instead of receiving it in order that he may study and know its contents , he receives it only because and so far as he already understands and approves them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , to be regenerated and sanctified thereby into a knowledge of the truth , he subjects the Written Word to his " Me , " and makes it say whatever the " Me " thinks it ought to say , or else has nothing to do with it : that is , his faith is in no wise in the Author of the // gift , but only in his own judgment of what is given ; and he values it , not as a fountain of doctrine , but as a support to his own inventions ; marvelously delighted of course to find Heaven proclaiming his own thoughts , and disclosing to him his own wisdom , and presuming that , as he had anticipated the matter of Revelation , so he could supersede the form in which it was revealed . Thus he just reverses the old order of things ; makes his perceptions the test and measure of truth , instead of making truth the test and measure of his perceptions . Hence the peculiarly vicious and vitiating tendency of his book ; the sensuality of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its morals , the vulgarity of its manners . From the principle that every man is a revealer unto himself , that external objects are but mirrors for self-contemplation , and that his own heart is to him the only source of truth and good , he very naturally infers that everything is true and good which comes from his heart . Accordingly , his attitude towards Revelation is rather one of patronage than of dependence ; and its effect is , not so much to correct him as to persuade him he needs no correction : from the example of its authors , he only infers the right to speak as they did , and so undertakes to rival them in their own mission . As he sees no nieaning but his own in external objects , he of course sees in them any meaning he happens to choose , and thus holds them responsible for whatever thoughts and feelings he chances to have in their presence . Studying things not to learn 4om them , but to find in them what he already knows , or thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies ; if he anywhere gets an element of truth , he at once turns it into a lie , by detaching it from its harmony and co-existence with other elements . Going to Scripture , for example , brimful of something which he chooses to call love , and there finding the Creator set forth as a God of love , he concludes that love , and especially his love , is a very divine thing , sure enough , fresh from heaven ; abstracts this attribute from the others , deifies his own abstractions , and then , for the God of love , substitutes and worships his miserable deification of love . This pestilent stuff was first spawned from Tophet upon Germany , then transferred from Germany to England , and finally from England to America . Having thus gone the rounds , it is to be hoped it will now return to its own place . And our author everywhere attributes to his characters , from the highest to the lowest , the same subjectiveness which he practices himself . Thus , he speaks of God as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " worshiping himself eternally in the great glass of things . " In the self-same spirit are all his love-scenes written . His lovers everywhere appear occupied , not with the object of their passion , but with the passion itself ; in each other 's beauty they seem to see only the beauty of their own emotions ; are always admiring and talking about their heavenly sentiments ; do not so much love each other , indeed , as love the exquisite feelings they have of each other ; at once conceiving the objects very divine , to give them so much pleasure , and themselves very divine , to take so much pleasure in them . Hence we have any quantity of such stuff , as would far better become the regions of prostitution than the bowers of chaste affliction , dignified with the name of love , and set forth as a social religion . Such a representation of love is really but an apotheo4s of lust , and ought to be so regarded . Let it be once settled , indeed , that our own hearts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom , and there is no end to the delusions and deviltnies that will have possession of us ; reason itself will be bribed to support the wrongs of passion ; the light we have from nature will be turned into darkness ; and " the candle of the Lord within us , " instead of being lighted by truth , will melt away in the enthusiasm of self-conceit . Assuredly , if we wish to find truth , beauty , good , we had better look out of ourselves , nay , almost anywhere rather than in ourselves ; seeking them within our own hearts , we shall only be drawn to love their opposites indeed , our very seeking them there implies a secret preference of their opposites ; and the very wish to find them would prompt us to look far elsewhere . Undoubtedly , in some sense , though it might puzzle anybody to tell what , there is truth in the maxim , that in our age we ought to remember and revere the dreams of youth ; but in such sense as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcendentalists , it is one of the falsest and worst maxims ever given . For , if the human heart contains , the // genns of the noblest plants , it also contains the germs of the vilest weeds ; the plants require patient , skillful culture , the weeds grow fast enough of themselves ; and who knows not that the cultivation of the former involves the careful uprooting and extinguishing of the latter ? The ignorance of childhood is indeed beautiful , because coupled with innocence ; and to be innocent , is a kind of wisdom : but it is hardly in our nature to pass directly from innocence to virtue ; and to recover us from the depravity we fall into , requires a far higher wisdom than we fall from . It is from a feigned or fancied reverence for what they call the dreams of their youth , that divers people have come to prefer the unrectified , undisciplined promptings of nature to the wisdom which comes only by experience , which is inculcated upon us and conveyed into us from without , the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obedient spirit . Hence the exquisite doctrine , that " nature does never wrong , it is society which sins ; " and the equally exquisite practice of arraigning and condemning the State and the Church for the crimes men commit against them , or in spite of them ; of setting aside whatever human wisdom , instructed by Revelation , by Providence and by time , has established for the better ordering and edifying of our lives , to make room for the vain theories and paradoxes of beardless transcendental preachers and lecturers , whose only sanction for what they say , is the positiveness , the effrontery , and the contempt of authority with which they speak . Society , in all its forms , of course involves government , authority , subordination , as its organic law ; and an external jurisdiction of any sort is better than being left to what are sometimes called our divine instincts and intuitions . Assuredly , truth and law , if they be anything at all , are something objective and permanent-a standard which we may all recognize , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bind us all , are the common school-masters of us all ; we are theirs , not they ours , and it is by consenting to be theirs that we are to make them ours ; they exist for us , not by us , come to us , not from us , to exact our allegiance , not to crave our allowance ; they are embodied and revealed to us in the institutions into which we are born , from which we draw the aliment of our higher being , which are the very atmosphere and breath of our spiritual life , and through which the awful spirit of human reason  --  a thing that is rather over us than in us-by a well-ordered doctrine and discipline gradually passes and grows into an individual possession . It is by loyalty to those institutions that our manhood truly unfolds itself , that we become partakers and inheritors of the Divine Wisdom , which , working through nature and Providence , founded and fashioned them ; it is by revering and obeying the forms in which truth and law are thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance of our minds , building us up into the strength , and beauand majesty of their own being : and of our transcendental prophets who go about appealing from those institutions to the dreams of their youth and the innate wisdom of their own hearts , what hall we say , but that , in the words of an old writer , describing certain fanatics of his time , " they clothe their own fancy with the Spirit of God , and their own invention with the gift of revelation . " On the whole , we suspect the dreams of our youth and the innate wisdom of our own hearts are but fond conceits , under which such people caress and try to accredit the instigations of Satan , conceiving them to be the dreams of their youth , because they have forgotten all the dreams their youth ever had , and presuming them to be from heaven , because they know not , and will not be taught , whence they are . At all events , if we are to consult the wisdom of childhood , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the docility of childhood ; " let us have babes and sucklings f* our oracles ; " instead of going to those who , with the ignorance of childhood , unite the arrogance and audacity of depraved manhood ; and whose reverence for the dreams of their youth only prompts them to carry foreheads of brass , where it is alike the instinct of childhood and the wisdom of manhood to be gentle , reverent and submissive . It is this spirit which , married to philanthropy and theology , has produced and is producing such interesting fruits among us . Scarce a day passes without some additional proof of its nialignant energy . Hence the detestable sentimentalism which eats the soul out of men , and replaces it with boundless conceit ; and which inspires them with such a marvelous affection for all mankind , that they make it a matter of conscience // Feslu8. to lynch or assassinate the character of whoever questions their theories and rejects their reasonings . Hence , divers people , smitten with the beauty of their own sentiments , and calling their passion benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the very thing , by the way , which , if they had them , they would be sure not to do ,  - -  and compound for their neglect of private , particular duties , with professions of universal philanthropy . To discharge one 's private duties , costs much labor and makes no noise ; to spout universal benevolence , brings great notoriety and costs nothing . People commissioned to reform the whole world , of course have to deny themselves the pleasure of minding their own business . To stay at home , and take care of their families , would defraud Providence of their patronage . No law or gospel , hitherto promulgated , is good enough for them ; their consciences are so enormously big , ns to transform all that has hitherto been called virtue into crime ; their own reason and humanity are so loud , that they can not be made to hear anything else . Christianity aims to regenerate and rectify the inner man ; but no religion comes up to their ideal , unless it goes to disorganize society , and regenerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , that if the Bible tolerates slavery or capital punishment , the Bible itself can not be tolerated . Thus they appeal from everything to themselves ; will not allow Heaven to reveal anything out what their reason can endorse ; the voice of nature as expressed in laws and institutions , which have survived all the innovations of time , is drowned in the thunders with which they proclaim the truth from their own minds . To attain their ends , they seem willing to sacrifice everything but their malignant passions . The innate wisdom of their own hearts instigates them to preach sedition , treason , and sacrilege , against all that is sacred and venerable in society ; even the hallowed ashes of the dead are , not exempt from their infuriated desecration ; pushing their theories into personalities , they have found that even Washington , a name synonymous with whatever is best and noblest in human character , was a thief , a liar , and a murderer . Their philanthropy has got so intense that it has to vent itself in the dialect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped together , for benevolent 143 uses , a vocabulary that would disgrace the lowest fish-women of Billingsgate ; some of them have fed on the milk of humanity , until they have come to unite in their characters all the meanness of a puppy with all the ferocity of a tiger . They seem to value their theories , in proportion as they contradict the oldest and deepest sentiments of mankind ; since , on this principle , the wisdom of all past time can the more easily he convicted of folly in their presence . To establish the supremacy of their own reason and conscience , they must discredit all other tribunals ; to discredit them they must of course differ from them ; and the more they differ from them , the more they seem to have risen above them ; for difference , with them , always argues a superiority in their favor : and the only discipline they submit to is one that teaches every man to esteem himself wiser than all other men . Hence their morbid preference for whatever is most eccentric , outlandish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they clothe their philanthropy in the most extravagant , unnatural , and monstrous forms ; their sympathies are expended on condemned criminals and despised prostitutes ; what has hitherto been revered as justice , they decry as murder ; what has hitherto been abhorred as crime , they pity as misfortune ; the greatest crime , with them , is , to reverence the laws and magistrates that are set over us ; instead of obeying the powers that be for conscience ' sake , they hold it a matter of conscience to scoff , and blaspheme , and defy them . That any way of doing good has been long tried and found successful , as far as human depravity will permit anything good to succeed , is their strongest reason for opposing it ; the better it is , the more furious they are against it , because , forsooth , it leaves the less work for them to do , and the less need of their counsels . The same principle which leads them to array their own judgment against the combined wisdom of all past time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization of their schemes . They have such a lust of reform , that they can not endure to let anything go unreformed ; must revolutionize all things , lest the world should not be sufficiently indebted to their beneficence ; must destroy everything that exists to make room for the monuments of their genius , and that they may have " ample room and verge enough " to - // establish their own righteousness . Their redundancy of conscience only operates to make them fearless of doing evil ; and yet this is the very thing which a truly conscientious man is most fearful of doing ; for it is characteristic of good men to refrain even from meddling with what they know to be bad , presuming it to be the best the circumstances will admit , and fearing lest , in their short-sighted innovations , they may make it worse . Having experienced the infirmity and insufficiency of their reason , such men naturally distrust their own wisdom , and accept a higher in its stead . It is by such experience and such distrust that men become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can recognize , in what they have inherited , sources out of which to reinforce their feeble powers , and thus become strong to do good by receiving the good that has been done for them . But our philanthropists are obviously incapable of any such experience ; and if they were ever so capable of it , they would not stoop to learn from so vulgar a teacher as experience . Scorning to trade on any but their own individual stock ' of wisdom , they of course become bankrupt in everything but selfconfidence . Their affections are so engrossed with their theories , that they can not stop for so trifling a consideration as persons ; they are laboring for the greatest happiness of the greatest number ; this happiness depends on the adoption of their systems ; and there are no arts too mean or too wicked to be employed in furtherance of this cause : to promote the good of all mankind , they invade the sacredest rights , and outrage the holiest ties of life ; convert their tongues into daggers , their words into venom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murdering the best feelings of our nature . There are certainly evils enough in the world ; but all of them put together are not so bad as the spirit with which these men go about to remedy them ; the self-worship , the moral and religious subjectiveness , which all their proceedings tend to encourage , would blast all the virtues that adorn , and foster all the vices that degrade human nature ; and many of them are known to exemplify in their own characters the worst tendencies of their system . All that is best and purest in human character comes out in the exercise of the private affections ; and nothing is so desolating to these affections as universal philanthropy . It is vain to say such men act from conscience , for conscience is a self-annulling principle ; implies a conviction of our own frailty , and a recognition of a wisdom superior to ours ; spontaneously looks to an external law , stays itself upon authority , and prefers to walk by the light of prescription ; shuns original , and seeks approved methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its charities to others , that it even hides them from itself . As conscience begins with a conviction of our own guilt , and a reference of moral evil to individual depravity , so it prompts us to correct the inward sources , rather than the outward occasions , of wrong ; to seek the reformation of individuals , rather than of institutions ; to convince men of their misdeeds , rather than of their misfortunes ; to inspire them with sorrow for their transgressions , rather than with anger at the law for punishing them ; in a word , to make them better and happier where they are , instead of encouraging them to wait for better circumstances , and saddle their crimes upon society . The conscience which inculcates upon men an oblivion rather than a confession of their own guilt , and to criminate the occasions rather than rectify the sources of their evil-doings , may be of a great quantity , but is of a most wretched quality . It is this conscience which , charging men 's crimes upon their circumstances , is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue can not exist . The truth is , the people in question are actuated by the worst form of selfishness , the offspring of that old depravity whose " darling , sin is pride that apes humility ; " a selfishness which is all the worse for proceeding upon an inordinate love , not of our interest , but of our own opinions ; which makes men envious of all the virtue and happiness hut what they can take to themselves the credit of producing-thus causing them to look with an evil eye upon all the blessings they have not had a hand in bestowing , and upon all the lights they have not been the means of kindling ; which prompts them to call the evil of their own doing , good , and the good that others do , evil ; and , if they can not have things their own way , to make them as bad as they can ,  --  a selfishness which , under the name of moral courage , casts // off all reverence , spurns at all authority , and , glorying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , and supplies their place with moral violence , and so puts all its valor into the tongue , and reinforces itself out of the worst passions of our nature . So much for the philanthropists . We can not stop to give them their deservings now . Perhaps they will hear from us again . Married to theology , the spirit in question has been prolific of results still more worthy of attention ,  --  results which , though less apparent , strike deeper , and therefore are more malignant . Casting off prejudice and prescription , looking up only to their own judgment , and drawing all their authority from within , certain men have become wise and good altogether beyond what is written ; have come to prefer God as revealed in their reason , to God as revealed in the Scriptures . Hence the execrable custom which these men have , of sitting in judgment on Revelation , and of subjecting it to their arrogant and impious eclecticism , gravely endorsing such parts as accord with their notions , and rejecting such as they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rev. Mr. - virtually says , and from the pulpit , too : This is none of God 's word ; my reason tells me better ; God would not , could not speak thus ; these are the sentiments of a barbarous age concerning Him . Respecting certain other portions , his virtual position is : This is undoubtedly true ; my reason assures me it is divine ; I know it came from God , because it has the approval of my conscience , the voice of God within me . Such is the style in which the savans of the time habitually speak and write . The Bible , as it is , has something to say about the stern , awful beauty of justice , sets forth the fearful as well as adorable majesty of law ; but these men will know no religion but humanity . By judicious analysis , and selection , and recomposition , - leaving out old errors and absurdities , as the ofi*pring of a fiercejudicial spirit ,  - -  they extract from the Bible a religion which must supersede the one hitherto taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its being in a sea of unadulterated love . Thus we are taught to seek religion within ourselves ; to erect our reason into a sovereign tribunal , a last appeal ; to adjust and reform Revelation into accordance with our own judgment ; to receive its contents , not because they come attested and authenticated by miracles and works which no man could do , but simply because they seem to us good and true ; wherein our only difficulty is , we have to assume that we are competent to judge what is good and true , which is the very thing we are not competent to do , and which it is everywhere the office and aim of Revelation to teach us we are not competent to do . There is obviously no occasion for God to speak to those who already know whatHe ought to say ; and His speaking to them tends , not to humble them in view of His wisdom , but to elate them in view of their own . Claiming to have seized the spiritual sense of Scripture , these sapient philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life out of the organization in which it is given , and putting it into a form better suited to their enlightened notions . In this way they think to dispense with the body , and to retain the pure soul of divine truth ; and all who prefer to keep the soul in the body they denounce as formalists ; as altogether behind the age ; and as opposed to all progress . Of course they never trouble themselves with the question , whether , in thus divorcing the spirit and the form , they may not lose them both ; indeed , it is quite possible they do this on purpose to get rid of them both , and that there may be no permanent , stubborn facts to contradict their doctrines or hinder the reception of their ideas . But for this fixed , objective embodiment of truth , their own inventions could obviously have free course . It seems not to have occurred to them , and yet perhaps it has occurred to them , that though they may keep the body awhile without the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nay , their very efforts to get rid of the body seem to argue that it has already lost its soul to them , and is beginning to stink in their refined nostrils . However , under the name of the disembodied spirit of Christianity , they can easily smuggle in their own notions and feelings . When a man 's father is dead and gone , of course he can only see him in his mind 's eye , where it is not so easy for another to test his perceptions . Where there are no objers to be seen , a man can locate his own conceptions with all imaginable facility ; and if others see // 146 Festus. nothing but vacancy there , he can accredit his visions on the ground of his superior insight ; he " Has lights where other eyes are blind , As pigs are said to see the wind . " But really all this is not submitting ourselves to the written word , but substituting ourselves for it ; not so much consentingto receive , as claiming to originate a religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be assured that they are so far from being elevated , that they have not risen high enough to see what is above them ; that instead of having attained to superior light , they are altogether below the region of light . Equally ignorant of all , such men of course think themselves equally masters of all ; conceive that they know the whole , for the simple reason that they know nothing . He who presumes to oversee Revelation , shows that he has not seen , and can not , or will not , see anything of it whatever ; that he has not even the eye to see it with , or if he has , will not use it . In thus perpetually deferring to the god within them , and declaring themselves independent of external guides and sources , these men simply publish their own arrogance and insolence . We care not what appearance of modesty and humility they may put on , at heart they are as proud , selfish , conceited , and impudent , as Satan himself ; or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the donkey in them ; for the stupidest brutes and the most enlightened demons agree in equally lacking docility and reverence . Their appealing from all acknowledged and accredited standards of truth and good , to their own reason and conscience , only proves that the voice of reason and conscience is utterly stifled within them ; that they are but clearing up the ground to let loose their own will and pleasure ; and that the freedom they preach is but for a license to riot in the luxuries of selfassertion . Assuredly , if men can not find anything this side of heaven to reverence , they will find nothing to reverence there ; if they have any docility , they can learn from the powers that be ; if they have no docility , they will not learn from the Power that ordained them , but will only use His name to accredit their own abominable conceit ! * . To seditious , refractory spirits all authority of course seems tyranny ; and the only condition upon which they will consent to be governed , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their humble servant , and let them do precisely as they have a mind to . Thus , the same principle which instructs men to appeal from all earthly tribunals to God , will instruct them to appeal from God to their own reason . We know of nothing more offensive , not only to religion , but even to good taste , than the habit these men have of eulogizing the Scriptures . This habit they seem to have caught from Rousseau , that great high-priest of the synagogue of Antichrist . With them , as with him , it springs , not from reverence , but from the intensest vanity ; not because they regard the Scriptures , but because they wish for the votes of such as do regard them ; for no one who properly regards them will dare to eulogize them . Men seldom pronounce funeral orations until they have buried the subjects of them . In like manner , the worst husbands , for example , are generally loudest in praising their wives ; their praises are but the fig-leaves to their infidelity ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , the greatest ruffians and murderers that ever polluted the earth have sought impunity for their butcheries in sounding the praises of their victims ! Eulogy implies some equality between the author and the object ; and the author is generally understood to share the honor he confers . Where the eulogy is volunteered , we take for granted the author is but seeking to distinguish himself-making capital out of the virtues he celebrates . It is not so much an acknowledgment as an appropriation of merit . The truth is , the puffs which these men inflict on the Scriptures are but the offspring of a supercilious patronage ; eulogy is the price they pay for impunity in sacrilege ; they glorify the Bible merely to compound for their desecration of it . By gratuitous endorsement and laudation of the Scriptures , they seem to acquire a right to nullify as much of them as they please ; by adding their sanction to what God has revealed , they seek to purchase the prerogative of adding God 's sanction to their own inventions . Their aim is , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revelation . In this way they can keep up the show of modesty while indulging their impudence and audacity , and thus gratify their vanity both ways at once . The self-same spirit which prompts them // to eulogize , also prompts them to criticise , since each of these serves alike , in its place , to approve their keenness of appreciation ; indeed , the right to eulogize involves , in some sort , the right to criticise . In short , theirraptures and rhapsodies over the Scriptures are designed merely to coordinate their own inspiration ; they spring not from love of what is revealed , but from lust of the authority that revealed it ; they extol its wisdom but to establish their own ; laud the Apostles , not so much to confirm , as to usurp , their commission ; commend the Prophets , merely to accredit their own prophesyings . Having mastered Revelation , having climbed to where they can overlook , and endorse , and patronize it , they are of course qualified to discriminate , and select , and winnow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to supersede it , and substitute revelations of their own in its stead . They would not depreciate the authors of the Bible ; - by no means . They only aspire to an equality with them . From the example of Him who spoke as never man spake , they merely infer their own right and duty to enter into competition with Him ; - that 's all . This intense subjectiveness in religion of course involves an equally intense individualism . Christianity has always been accounted a religion of means and media ; it supposes that man has strayed away from his Maker , and that some mediation is required to bring him hack ; that he is somewhat fallen from his first estate , and has to climb up over many steps , in order to recover it ; that , in short , it needs a ladder with several rounds to aid his ascent . That it might come to us in the form of a practical discipline , Christianity organized itself into a Church , on the ground that many men have to grow up together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order are brought home to us , and reincorporated with the substance of our minds , by being embodied in the state . This social organization evidently supposes that each individual is to be subordinate to the whole , and that in and through this subordination he is to find the life which the whole is appointed to preserve and impart . Whatever now passes for Holy Scripture , has been transmitted to us by and through the organs of this consecrated body : has been adjudged to the place it holds by human , or rather , by ecclesiastical authority . Here we have a somewhat complex mediatorial system , such as seems adapted to the state of fallen man . But to men who have not faflen , this scheme of religious polity is obviously useless . No such means are required to purify those who are already pure ; and the pure in heart can see divine truth better perhaps without any media than with them ; men who are already in heaven need no ladder to help them thither . Accordingly , unfallen men  --  and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this organization and setting up for themselves , and professing allegiance only to God and their own reason . What other men gladly accept as media , these men justly reject as obstructions to the wisdom that cometh from above . This , then , is what we mean by religious individualism . Such is the ground virtually assumed by that saint and apostle , the Rev. Mr. - alluded to above . The scope of his theology is : God and I are enough ; there is no occasion for anything to mediate between us ; I will offer all my worship immediately to Him , and receive whatever blessings I want immediately from Him ; I need no Church , no Bible , no Saviour , and I declare myself independent of them ; to be sure , they may have been necessary once , before the dawn of modern illumination , and may be so still to some whom the day-spring from on high bath not visited : but I have reached a point of view where they may profitably be dispensed with ; God and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly light would only be intercepted by all such channels *of communication . Well , the Rev. Mr.- , after all , is but the representative of a class ; he is just like many others , only " rather more so and perhaps the astonishing beauty of his conclusons will throw them back upon a reconsideration of the principles which they hold in common with him . These subjective , transcendental philanthropists and theologians seem to have been commissioned expressly to prepare the way for " Festus . " We confess we like not the style of denunciation which we have adopted towards them . In using it we have but followed their example ; but their example , in whatever aspect viewed , is one which no sane man can desire to emulate . We have done it merely to show them that they are as vulnerable as they are violent ; that they are as open to denunciation as they are given to denouncing . It is for their sake , // not for the book 's , that this article is written ; that the work concentrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sole reason for noticing it ; but for them the hook never would have troubled us , and we never should have troubled our readers with this review . Well , the book , as was to have been expected , has had a great run ; the author has got his notoriety , the publishers have got their money , the public have got what they have paid for , and we have got our article written . Incorrigible transcendentalists and hopeful young men and maidens , literary freshmen and coxcombs and dotards , those who are too hard to admit , and those who are too soft to exclude anything that offers itself , those who have transcendental eyes and those who have no eyes at all , those who can see everything where there is nothing to be seen , and those who can see nothing where there is everything to be seen ,  - -  in short , all who are above and all who are below appreciating what is sober , and solid , and judicious , and spontaneously take to whatever is grotesque , and mawkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book with all imaginable greediness , and have doubtless become the emptier for what they have swallowed.
