txt THERE is A NECESSITY FOR EcCLESIASTiCAL BODIES MORE EXTENDED THAN SINGLE CHURCHES . Each church of Christ sustains important relations to all other churches , and to the church universal , in addition to its peculiar ties to its own members . If the direct end of its organization is the due regulation and training of its own members , for the furtherance of their peace and holiness , the ultimate end of it , to which this first end is subservient , is the advancement of the kingdom of Christ in the world , the welfare of the church universal . This is evident from the fact that each church , like each individual , is but a member of the body of Christ . Hence it is bound indissolubly to that body and to all its members . Its prosperity and peace are in a high degree identified with theirs . - For it is divinely ordered , so that of necessity the members should have the same care one for another , and whether one member suffer , all suffer with it ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . 1 Cor. xii , 25 , 26 . Hence , while the first and immediate concern of every church is with its own members , its obligations do not terminate with them . It has still higher relations , and owes still bigher duties to the whole body of Christ . Nor can it sunder these ligaments , or disown this relationship , without at the same time committing suicide . As well might a a member of the human body undertake to subsist and act for itself alone , refusing to help or be helped by its fellow members . The very attempt to appropriate its whole life to itself , or its own exclusive welfare , would sever it from the common spring of life , torn from which none can live . So is it with the body of Christ and its members . And it is well observed by Owen , that a church which isolates itself from other evangelical churches , is a body to which it is dangerous for any person to commit his soul . Thus arises a twofold necessity for communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more extended than single congregations of believers . 1 . They are needed for the care of those common interests which affect the well being of the whole body , not less than of its single members . It is one of the clearest of all axioms in secular as well as religious affairs , that all who are affected by given measures , should have a share in their management . // Quod tangit omnes , debet ab omnibus tractari . Things which relate to the common defense , welfare , and peace of the churches ; and in which agreement is of the highest moment to nil and each of them , should be adjusted by a common council representing all , and not by the caprice of single churches . The good which they are all bound to promote , the evil which they are all bound to resist , they may manage with far greater efficiency and success in combined than separate action . United they stand against all assaults ; divided they are an easy prey to foes within and without . the preservation and promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the suppression of error , discord , and prevailing sins , obviously require their united action . 2 . Various cases arise in the administration of the affairs of a single church , which either deeply affect other churches in their consequences , or are beyond the ability of the churches in which they occur to issue safely without assistance from sister churches . The settlement and dismission of pastors requires the counsel and assistance of other churches on both these grounds . Cases of discipline , either because they are weighty or complex in their own nature , or on account of the obstinate dissensions they engender , or because the person censured insists that he is oppressed , it may be absolutely indispensable to submit to a higher court for advice , before they can be issued with safety . In such emergencies it is the duty of a church to ask , and of its associate churches to render the requisite assistance , to be helpers of their joy , without lording it over their faith . Thus it is clear that the great ends of church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical bodies more extended than sitigle churches , and capable of reaching those churches themselves , so far as to further their individual peace and prosperity , and render them tributary to the welfare of the whole body of Christ . Any system of church polity , therefore , which does not make adequate provision for this purpose , is so far forth vitiated by a radical defect . A system which claims adoption , should not only show itself adapted to the internal regimen of single churches , but also well fitted to bring into exercise the communion of churches in all needful combined ecclesiastical action . It must provide ecclesiastical bodies , constituted by a union of churches , which are competent to promote the peace , purity , and prosperity of the whole body ; to " provide for the common defense , and promote the general welfare . " We believe it can be shown that no system of church government secures these ends so well as the Congregational . Congregationalism reaches these objects by means of councils formed by a union of churches , each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pastor , who is always a member exojJlcio . These councils may be either standing bodies to attend to all cases within their circuit , as in Connecticut ; or occasional , selected and formed for each successive case , and dissolved when it is issued . Of the comparative merits of standing and occasional councils , we shall treat hereafter . But we have described the general character of those bodies , which on the Congregational system , transact such ec5iesiastical business as is beyond the province or ability of particular churches . And it is maintained , that on a general view , aside from a minute survey of their workings , they are eminently scriptural and rational . 1 . They are scriptural . The only example recorded in the New Testament of any ecclesiastical body more extensive than a particular church and its officers , is found in Acts xv . Here it appears that the // church at Antioch was annoyed with a contention about circumcision , which it could not of itself compose . They determined to send to the apostles and elders at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this council , verses 22 , 23 , it appears that the brethren of the church were joined with the apostles and elders , in deliberating upon and deciding this question . This case is the more striking and conclusive , as to the place which the brethren should have in these councils , from the fact that the apostles were present . Great as were their powers in the planting and organizing of churches , it appears that after these churches attained a settled state , they assumed no exclusive authority or rule over them . Much less then can such a prerogative be conceded to their pretended successors , or to inferior church officers . This example , therefore , is our divine warrant for resorting to councils to dispose of whatever lies beyond the province of single churches , and for composing such councils of ministers and people , as two co-ordinate , mutually poising , harmonious powers . 2 . This is agreeable to reason . It accords with first principles , as applied in all analogous cases . All well constructed governments which preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous extremes of anarchy and despotism , are composed of different powers which represent the different parties in interest . rfhese balance each other , and thus prevent all extreme and oppressive measures . In the doings of ecclesiastical bodies , ministers and churches have each a great and palpable stake . How reasonable then , that they both participate equally in their proceedings ? Guarding the rights and interests of all , it secures their hearty cooperation in the great common cause . Withal , the fundamental principles of government in particular churches , are thus carried out into higher ecclesiastical bodies . In each case the ministry and brethren cooperate in its administration . Finally , this construction of councils furnishes the highest security , that the choice , wisdom , and piety of the churches will be collected , and brought to manage her great and weighty concerns . They are composed of pastors , the chosen spiritual guides of the churches , who give themselves wholly to these things , and of representatives of the people , who will ordinarily be chosen on account of their superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of these councils , and the extent to which their decisions are binding upon churches . THE DECISIONS OF CONGREGATIONAL COUNCILS ARE ADVISORY , AND FOR THAT REASON OF MOST SALUTARY EFFIcACY . Here we find a distinctive peculiarity of Congregationalism . As , in states , that is the best government which secures the just rights and liberties of the subject on the one hand , and the supremacy of law and order on the other ; so in ecclesiastical polity , the great problem is , to preserve the rights of conscience and Christian liberty inviolate on the one side , and on the other to preserve truth , holiness and unity in the churches . XVe believe that no men who live , or have lived , have mastered this problem so well as our Puritan fathers : that they understood the Lord 's way , and therefore the true way , of guarding each interest , without detriment to the other , and of bringing both to their utmost perfection . According to both the theory and practice of Congregationalism , the decisions of councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without their own consent . That the Scriptures warrant the assumption of no more than advisory powers by councils , ap-pears 1 . From // the fact that supreme authority , under Christ , in matters of discipline , js conferred upon the churches . Matt. xviii , 17 ; 1 Cor. x* , 5 , 13. 2 . The Apostles did not assume dominion over the faith , hut were only helpers of the joy of the churches . It may well be concluded that such dominion is denied to all subsequent and inferior ecclesiastical persons and bodies . It is their office to help the joy and further the peace and welfare of the churches , but not to rule over them . 3 . The result of the council already adverted to , Acts xv , authorizes this same conclusion . The form of their result is more like the delivery of an opinion than a mandate . And yet it is not mere advice , in the ordinary sense of that term . It does not stand in the same relation to the parties advised , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or accidental source. * It is counsel given in God 's appointed way , by those to whom lie has committed the office of expounding his word , and helping the churches to * The only seeming exception to this view of the power of councils is found in the Saybrook Articles . Art . V. declares , that the decision of the council " shall be a final issue , and all parties shall sit down and be determined thereby . " But while such is the letter of these Articles , the great principle of Congregationalism which we have declared , has for the most part ruled in practice , especially since the first half-century of the existence of the Platform . The churches of Connecticut have taken these Articles as the general basis of their system , without a strict observance of every clause . While consociations see that their decisions are not trifled with , and are almost uniformly successful in procuring the acquiescence of the churches in them , vet they no more than occasional councils compel the churches to accept them , against their conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such refusal , unless in those clear cases of persistence in antiebristiac heresy or malpractice , which would exscind from the fellowship of all Congregational churches . gain a knowledge of his will in such cases . As such , it is to be solemnly weighed and cordially welcomed , with a predisposition to abide by it , until it is proved to be unscriptural . The presumption is , that it is the voice of God , until the contrary is plainly proved . This being so , all doubts on the part of the churches turn in favor of the ascendency of the council 's advice . And since the very summoning of a council by a church implies some degree of doubt , the probability ever is , that the advice of the council will prevail . In questions of mere prudence or expediency , it ought always to be decisive . When conscientious objections to its advice are entertained , that advice may properly be rejected , till these scruples are removed , which is almost always accomplished . Hence , in theory and in practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rare exceptions as the friction arising from human depravity occasions under any system whatever . And this acquiescence of the churches is the more perfect , because it is voluntary , and not forced upon them , against their own conscientious convictions . While this system provides for general order and unity , of the most precious , because most cordial kind , it leaves the liberty and independence of the churches unimpaired . It does not compel them to do or sanction what their consciences condemn , what they believe to be clearly wrong , and forbidden by the word of God . Thus a great provision is made for Christian liberty and purity , which is the distinctive glory of our system , viz. that whenever a church deems the advice of a council clearly opposed to the law of God , it is left free to fall back upon that first principle of all religion , that WE OUGHT ro OBEY Gon , RATHER THAN NAN . Any ecclesiastical system which does not shape itself into harmony with this great principle , is essentially viciousi* // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are traced . 1 . Ample provision is made for the regulation of those matters of common interest which concern the churches at large , and of those affairs of particular churches , to the settlement of which they singly are inadequate . Councils are the organs through which the whole brotherhood of churches decl*ares its judgment to single churches , and the body of Christ guides its separate members in orderly and harmonious action . Although it stops short of lording it over the consciences of men , it is yet no less efficient than other systems of church polity , which wield this imperial authority . It is efficient , because it is God 's way , and is therefore made mighty through him . It is efficient , because it gains the conscientious , cordial , unforced consent of those who are thus guided , when the same decision , forced upon them by absolute authority , might provoke hostility and resistance . It is efficient , because it is " the judgment of the many , " regularly ascertained and formally expressed . It is efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with order , purity and peace , than the Congregational . 2 . It provides for liberty of conscience . Although the reader 's attention has already been called to * In confirmation of this view of the power and influence of councils , see Ratio Disciplince , pp. 182 , 183 . " It is an acknowledged principle in respect to councils , that they possess only advisory powers , in other words , their decisions are addressed to the understandings and consciences of men , and are enforced solely by moral obligations . * * * Their proper business is to GIVE LIGhT . Nevertheless , as those by whom they were called are supposed to have been sincere in their request , it is incumbent on them to examine the opinions or decisions given , with prayerful , honest and unprejudiced minds . When their temper is such , they will generally find good reason to agree with the council . " this great peculiarity , its importance warrants a further notice of it . At this point , as we think , our Congregational forefathers displayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity , than any who lived before them since apostolic times , and most who have lived after them . The conscience must be untrammeled , if we would have it unperverted and undefiled . It must be held in direct contact and communion with God , and be uncoerced , except as he coerces it . As it enters deeply into the purity and vigor of religion , so it has much to do with all freedom , manliness and dignity of character , in short , with the elevation of our whole nature . The extent to which liberty of conscience is preserved in various parts of Christendom , is a pretty exact index to the whole state of religion . The great mass of church politicians have deemed it impossible to secure this freedom , without opening the door for universal anarchy and intolerable confusion . It is the imperishable glory of our Puritan fathers , that they solved this great problem in a system of government which reconciles freedom of conscience with order and unity . 3 . If it reconciles the just liberties of particular churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less reconciles them with the just rights and liberties of individual church members . Suppose , for example , that a church member be excommunicated , and , as he deems , unjustly , %y the church to which he belongs : he may refer his case , by appeal , to a council of other churches and their pastors . If the council decides that the sentence against him ought to be revoked , the church will probably hear this advice , and act according ly . But should it be otherwise ,  - -  should they deem it a clear case , that they can not conscientiously restore the supposed offender to their fellowship , the decision of the council does not absolutely bind them : // for it is a cardinal principle , that councils , being human , are not infallible . But , although the aggrieved person should not be restored by this particular church , he has gained his redress . Any other church may lawfully , and without offense , receive him , on the ground of his acquittal by the council . Thus the mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this scheme of Divine Wisdom . 4 . This scheme of church polity duly combines and proportions all those ingredients which , in human governments , are found to produce the most salutary results . Through the delegates of the Christian people , the popular and representative element has its just influence , and must forever prevent any encroachments on the part of the ministry , and stifle in the germ every tendency towards uncontrolled hierarchical power . On the other hand , the ministry can guard their own office against all invasion of its just prerogatives . They form an intelligent , considerate and conservative body , who temper crude and ill-advised movements by their superior knowledge , and infuse into the whole assembly , wisdom , stability and dignity . So far as judicial action devolves upon councils , they comprise what all experience has shown to be the strongest bulwarks of rinht and justice , a body professionally learned in the law , and a jury of the people . Thus the analogy is complete between them and the best constituted human governments . OBJECTIONS ANSWERED . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , by its own confession , it is powerless . Repudiating all pretensions to authority , it gives mere advice , which all men are at liberty to give , and all are at liberty to reject . It , after all , leaves the unruly to do as they please . May not any man or company of men give advice , whether organized as an ecclesiastical council or not ? In reply , let us ask , has not any one power to expound the Scriptures , and press divine truth upon the conscience ? What advantage , then , has the preaching of the regular ministry over the harangues of unordained lecturers and exhorters ? Simply this , that the ministry is an ordinance of God for the " perfecting of the saints and the edifying of the body of Christ . " Being divinely instituted , it is divinely blest , and empowered to " commend the truth to every man 's conscience in the sight of God . " So of ecclesiastical councils . They are , as we have already shown , God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , and guiding them in the paths of heavenly wisdom . Therefore they enjoy his blessing , when rightly conducted , and , however frail in themselves , are armed with that excellency of power which is of God , far more potent than all the devices of human wisdom , all the mandates of lordly authority . So far as their workings are unmarred by human depravity , their counsels are not barren or impotent , but come to the churches , " not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Ghost , and in much assurance . " 1 Thess. i , 5 . Not only so , but all incidental influences concur to give them efficacy . They come with a kindly and winning , and not a forbidding or provoking aspect . It is the nature of a good man lo listen to a serious appeal to his reason and conscience , when he would revolt at a peremptory mandate which forestalls both . Moreover , the weight of a council 's decision with the public is such , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either showing strong and urgent reasons for its course , or forfeiting the confidence and favor of sister churches . Nor is this a merely theoretical view . It is but a history of the actual ordinary working of Congregationalism . The councils // of New England have generally obtained as much deference for their decisions as bishop or presbytery , and have been quite as successful in promoting order and unity , truth and godliness. 2 . It is alleged that this system affords no sufficient protection against the inroads of heresy and apostasy . It is said , that if any church or churches espouse fatal error , or uphold flagrant sin , the most vigorous remedy we can apply , is to advise them to abandon it ; that we are therefore in danger of nourishing the most pestilential heresies or sins in the very bosom of the church , with no effectual power to suppress or expel them . But the only foundation of this objection is ignorance . There is an ample remedy in noncommunion . If a church , after due labor for its recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the privilege and duty of other churches to withdraw fellowship from that church , and thus guard themselves against the contagion . They are to withdraw from every brother , and much more from every congregation of brethren , that walketh disorderly . This individual churches may do on their own motion , if they are conscience-bound . But it is usual , as it is more safe and becoming , to forbear , until they obtain the sanction and co-operation of other churches represented in council . Thus the orthodox churches of New England dealt with Socinianism , and purged out this old leaven , which threatened to leaven the whole lump . While Congregationalism has this remedy , it is the last and highest that can be had under any system whatever , which does not enforce spiritual by civil penalties , and sharpen their pangs with the trenchant thong of persecution . For this ghostly tyranny it is now too late to contend . But it may and doubtless will be qwq of conscience , which you have so ardently dwelt upon , as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not justly be called an invasion of the liberties or rights of any body of men , to refuse to own and treat them as a sound or pure church of Christ , when they furnish no evidence of being so , but plainly show themselves to be incorrigible apostates from the truth and holiness of the Gospel . But between this wholly antiebristian state and a condition of perfect soundness and purity , there lies a broad interspace , in which are various degrees of error and imperfection , blended with much truth and feeling ; so that the foundation remains firm , although the building has much that is crude and unsightly . Churches of this description are Christian churches , and so to be accounted and treated , and therefore to be welcomed among the brotherhood of churches , notwithstanding the hay , wood and stubble , which deface and partially hide the gold and silver and precious stones . Now this wide range of imperfection in churches , which , while it mars their beauty and hinders their prosperity , still falls short of subverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes under the discipline of higher ecclesiastical bodies , for its correction and removal . But if these councils come to the peccant church with an unconditional mandate , instead of an appeal to reason and conscience , does it not provoke resistance ? Suppose then it be disobeyed . Suppose the church say they can not in conscience comply with it . It is clear that , in this case , no alternative remains , hut to excommunicate the offending church from their fellowship , for a scandalous contempt of their authority . They are forced to this disastrous issue , no matter how trivial was the // a council is in its nature advisory , no such consequences are necessary , even if a church refuse compliance . No contempt is implied in such a refusal , because the advice was not imperative . Hence Congregationalism does not decapitate churches or ministers , or rend Christian communions , for those diversities of opinion which , in real Christians , are incident to this imperfect state , or for heresy in the bud , before there has been time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , that it is owing to this feature of our church polity , that the union of Congregational churches has survived the same causes of discord which rent the Presbyterian church into two hostile communions ; a disruption which , as truth and peace are now returning , most of our Presbyterian brethren fervently deplore . Thus also is demolished the last objection to Congregationalism , viz. that it is an insufficient bond of union . It unites churches not by chains of absolute power , which are easily snapped asunder , and if they can enforce uniformity , can never produce unity ; but by the most potent and enduring of all ties , even " charity which is the bond of perfectness . " Hence there is always the endeavor , and generally successful too , to " keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace . " Repellant inf1uences among them are the less violent and divisive , because they are not held in perilous contiguity , or sprung to their extremest tension by the strong hand of absolute authority . The embers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blown into a flame . Moreover , purely local and personal contentions can not spread beyond their own neighborhood , so as to convulse and perhaps divide the entire communion . An offending or heretical . minister is censured or deposed by his own association , or a council in the neighborhood . His case is at an end . He can not carry it up to an assembly , or conference , or convention representing the entire communion , and of course can not spread the agitation among them . We have no such extended bodies wielding supreme powers , and presenting an arena for the intrigues of ambition , and the pugilism of party . Hence in this tempestuous day , the Congregational churches are at peace , while of other communions , some have been already torn asunder ; and the great convocations of others , attract the earnest gaze of the world at their fierce contentions ; and show decided symptoms of their speedy dissolution. * OccAsIoNAL AND PERMANENT CouNcILs cOMPARED . By occasional councils we mean those which exist only for single cases . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite to meet in council on a given occasion . If these accept the invitation , they thus constitute the council , which expires with the occasion that called it into being . Thus when churches depend upon occasional councils for advice and assistance , a new council is formed for each new case , and so formed as to be the creature of the parties seeking its advice . Permanent councils , technically called consociations , are formed by a permanent confederation of churches in a given district . All the pastors of a circle of churches thus confederated , and such delegates as the churches may appoint , ( each church being entitled to one , ) constitute a consociation . And when the theory of this system is faithfully carried out , no other councils are known , but all " cases ecclesiastical " which are beyond the province of single churches , are brought be- * The reader 's attention is called to the recent division ofthe Presbyterian church , and that still later of the Methodists , and to the distracted and threatening condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a diversity of opinion among Congregationalists on this subject , some advocating permanent , and others occasional councils , we also will show our opinion . The advantages of the consociational system are claimed by its advocates to he 1 . That it affords increased security for impartiality and justice in its decisions . Occasional councils are avowedly the creatures of the parties consulting them . Such is the nature of man , that if he have the liberty of choosing his own judges , he will select those who are known to be favorable to his side , if he can find them . In all ordinary cases , in which contending parties appeal for the settlement of their dispute , or a church desires to carry a point however wrong , it will be neither impossible nor difficult to find ministers enough within a large communion , who agree with them , to form the council . In all contentions , therefore , if both parties agree in convoking a mutual council , it will be in danger of being equally divided , in which event the quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the council be ex parte , its decision of course will have little weight with the party that refused to concur in calling it . It is obvious that a tribunal created by the parties appealing to it , falls far below one constituted independent of them , before which they must litigate their disputes , if they litigate them at all , in the impartiality , justness , and weight of its decisions . So in another class of cases , which involve no contentions , the superiority of consociations is manifest . Suppose a church desires to obtain the sanction and aid of a council in settling an incompetent , irregular , or heretical minister . They may be able , by hunting over the land , to conjure up a council of congenial spirits who will install him in the sacred office , when an impartial council of neighboring churches would have unanimously discarded him . 2 . Hence it is obvious that fixed councils have the stronger tendency to preserve and promote soundness , purity and stability in the ministry and churches . They form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer avenues , through which grievous wolves can enter in to destroy them . 3 . It must he their own fault if they do not excel occasional councils , in dignity of character and accuracy of proceeding . A standing known body continuing from year to year , and from age to age , must obtain more respect and consideration among men , than an ephemeral organization , which is born to-day and dies to-morrbw . It can only divest itself of this superiority by gross misconduct . Withal , a permanent body gradually gains in skill , facility and accuracy in the transaction of business . By reason of use , its senses are exercised to discern both good and evil . With its usages , rules and precedents , furnished by long experience , it is in a great measure delivered from the danger of crude and rash decisions . 4 . It is a powerful bond of union , and medium of fellowship among the churches . This is too obvious to need enforcement . Indeed so palpable is the need of some such union among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated coNrzaENczs , * which are like them in bringing the churches together by their pastors and delegates for mutual quickening , consolation and admonition , the promotion of their own welfare , and the advancement of the cause of Christ . But they differ from consociations in abstaining from all those judicial and other offices which are devolved on councils . But surely if such a confederation of churches // is necessary as a medium of union and fellowship , will it not cement that union , and increase that fellowship , if this body is convened on every momentous occasion in the churches , and assists in all their more weighty and solemn concerns ? Does it not for example strengthen the bonds of love and fellowship on all sides , if this circle of ministers assemble at the ordination of every new minister among them , and perform the solemnities by which he is installed over his church , and introduced among themselves ? While these obvious advantages are admitted to belong to the consociational system , in theory and practice , certain objections are raised against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great objection urged against permanent councils , is the fear that they may gradually accurnulate a power which will jeopardize the liberties of the churches . This is the substance of all arguments that we have seen urged against them on the score of expediency . But this argument derives its whole support from the assumption that the decisions of consociations are of necessity mandatory and not advisory . This assumption is built upon the letter of the Saybrook Platform , and the unwarranted inference that there can be no permanent councils , which do not punctiliously follow the letter of these articles . But this is clearly a non sequitur . As we have already shown , the Connecticut consociations in practice advise , without commanding the churches . Not even the semblance of a germ remains , therefore , out of which the most prurient imagination can evolve this monster-gro*vth of hierarchical power . Moreover , the churches are not only guarded by their inherent power of refusing compliance with the decisions of these councils , but also in the composition of the councils themselves . The representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to outvote the ministry . The moderator is always taken from the clerical portion of the body , and while there is a delegate for every pastor , vacant churches without pastors , of which there are always some , also send delegates . This fact is enough to quell the apprehensions of the most jealous mind . Moreover , if the system involve these dangers , whether latent or palpable , why have not the baneful results already matured and disclosed themselves ? It has prevailed in Connecticut for more than a century , a period amply sufficient to develop its evils as well as its benefits , and while it has promoted the peace , purity , and stability of the churches it has in no way abridged their liberties . Indeed it was adopted there after a sad experience of the evils and dangers of occasional councils , for the express purpose of avoiding them . And it has in a good degree accomplished this happy result , with no weighty counterpoise of evil , at least since the principle has prevailed , that the powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other objection to consociations , is that they are not sanctioned by Scripture . It is said that the only council mentioned in the New Testament , Acts xv , was occasional and not permanent . To this we reply , that the same argument would overthrow permanent associations of ministers , which even its proposers will uphold . The truth on this subject , we suppose to be simply this . The Scripture shows s the nature and composition of these bodies , and the extent of their power . In these respects , the Bible must be strictly followed , and if it be thus followed , we gain all that is essential to their genuine and scriptural character . The minor circumstances and details of their organization are not defined in Scripture . They are wisely left , like many other unessential things , to be regulated // by Christian wisdom and prudence , adapting them to the various exigencies and necessities of the church . In this class , we rank such things as the duration of councils , and the times and places of their meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these matters we are fettered by no restrictions , except that we do all things decently , in order , to edification , and the glory of God , and do nothing which his law forbids . These views are commended to the candid consideration of those ministers and churches in New England , that are destitute of consociations , and to those Congregationalists elsewhere , that are now shaping their nascent ecclesiastical organizations . It is believed that the consociational system obviates many of the more plausible objections to Congregationalism , which have hitherto cramped its growth , and made it tributary to Presbyterianism , in the Middle and Western States. * MINIsrERIAL AssocIATIoNs . Besides councils composed of pastors and delegates of churches , Congregationalism has its associations , composed exclusively of ministers . These , like fixed councils , usually extend over a county , or a larger or smaller territory , if more convenient , and are designed to embrace all the ministers residing within their bounds . These bodies have no authority to take cognizance of the affairs of particular churches , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise precaution , to state , that the conductors of the New Englander are not unanimons in preferring standing councils or consociations to occasional councils . The dissentients from this opinion acknowledge , that the prevention of ex parte councils by the consociational system , is a point of great importance . But they are jealous of the gradual accumulation of power in the hands of permanent ecclesiastical courts . Should an argument , therefore , in direct variance with this appear in a future number of this work , we hope not to be thought inconsistent with ourselves-Ed. pose , because they are exclusively clerical , and contain no representation of the Christian people . They are designed to promote the fellowship and mutual improvement of ministers , as well as consultation and concert among them for furthering the common interests of the churches . To them also is assigned the work of examining and licensing candidates for the gospel ministry . No one is admitted to preach , even as a candidate , in our churches , who can not show his certificate of approval and licensure by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister denominations . Thus they guard the sacred office against unworthy intruders . Moreover , all ministers without charge , must belong to some association , unless in good standing in another denomination , and be able to show a certificate of good and regular standing in it , or they forfeit all character and standing as ministers , and will neither be recognized as such by the clergy , or employed by the churches . As means of preserving a sound and able ministry , these bodies are indispensable . They Iso accomplish another object of high importance . They become a medium of union and communion between all Congregational churches . Councils include only a small circle of churches and ministers . And it is not the policy of Congregationalisra to give a wider range to the agitations sometimes incident to the proceedings of ecclesiastical judicatories . Hence any organic union extending beyond small districts , is impossible , except through some union of associations . This is accomplished by means of a general association , composed of delegates from a considerable number of district associations , generally from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a year . It is also attended by delegates from most other general associations in the country , and from // various evangelical bodies not Congregational . Thus an active communion and sympathy are preserved among all the churches . However remote and scattered , they are combined in visible union , through this union of their pastors . And it is a blessed union , held fast by love , " the bond of perfectness , " not by manacles of arbitrary despotic power . Thus we have fulfilled our pur pose of showing that Congregationalism is the polity which best meets the wants of collective as well as single churches , whereby the whole " body fitly joined together , and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body , unto the edifying of itself IN LOVE .
