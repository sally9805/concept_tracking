txt " THERE is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth . " There is joy likewise among the redeemed on earth whenever one is rescued from the enslaved host of Satan and numbered among the free sons of God ; and their joy is great in proportion to the completeness and apparent hopelessness of his former thraldom . This truth was illustrated ahout two years since , when it became known to the Christian community in New England , that Matthew Hale Smith , who had been a popular preacher of Universalism at Hartford and Sn. lem , had renounced the destructive errors of that sect , and by divine grace had been led , as was hoped , to receive and obey the truth as it is in Jesus , and to devote himself to the upbuilding of that faith , which for twelve years he had destroyed . After the agitation in Mr. Smith 's mind incident to such an entire change in his views , and to the peculiar internal and external conflict which he had experienced , had subsided , his Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the influence of Universalism , would enable him most effectually to expose it , advised and requested him to deliver a series of lectures for that object . Accordingly he lectured in Hartford , New Haven , Boston , Salem , and many other places , to crowded and interested assemblies , and with great effect . We were among those who listened to those lectures , and our wishes , and doubtless the wishes of all the friends of evangelical truth , have been gratified by their publication . * LJniversalism Examined , Renounced , Exposed ; in a series of Lectures , embracing the experience ofthe author during a ministry of twelve years , and the testimony of Universalist ministers to the dread . fiil moral tendency of their faith ; by MATTHEW hALE SMITH . Boston 1842. l2mo. pp. 396 . From the moment of Mr. Smith 's decided renunciation of Universalism , he was made the object of bitter and unscrupulous hostility by his former associates and friends . His private character was assailed , his lectures interrupted by Universalist ministers and others , his person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul-mouthed organs of that abusive sect set upon him in full bay , and all sorts of reproacli and calumny were heaped upon him . He was pronounced a liar , a knave , and a madman . Taking advantage of an alienation of mind which he manifested when under the combined influence of disease and great mental anxiety and agitation , their most common charge was that he was insane . But he has given what , to them at least , should be convincing evidence of his sanity . He has written an exposure and refutation of their system of delusion and sophistry , which they can not answer , or evade , or withstand . These lectures are seven in number , with an address to Christians warning them against various artifices of Universalists . The style is perspicuous , and easy , and sometimes forcible , though somewhat diffuse and repetitious , owing probably to their being prepared for delivery to a popular audience , rather than for the press . Even in the most argumentative parts , the work partakes so largely of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected a sense both of his former bondage to error and of his emancipation by the truth-that the reader 's attention , kept alive by sympathy with the writer , rarely flags for a moment . The author thus announces his object : " The design of the present course of lectures , is to present the reasons which // have led me from Universalism , and induced me to leave a ministry to which I have devoted twelve years of the best part of my life . In doing this , I respond to the call of the defenders of Universalism , and perform a work which they have professed themselves earnestly desirous to have performed . They invite , nay , challenge inquiry . They are confident that Universalism is opposed because it is not understood ; they complain that their expositions of Scripture are unnoticed ; that their arguments in defense of Universalism are either not examined at all , or lightly passed over ; that doctrines are attributed to them , which they have never received , and which they disavow ; and that those who speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they affirm . " My acquaintance with Universalism enables me to speak advisedly in relation to its practical tendency . An experience of years with the system and its friends , a settlement over one of the largest congregations of Universalists in the country , and an extensive acquaintance with the preachers of the system in all parts of the cuuntry , fit me to bear an intelligent testimony as to that system , and to state what I know and have seen . " pp. 3 , 4 . The first lecture gives an account of the author 's religious experience , and of his life so far as is necessary to elucidate that experience . The second gives reasons for renouncing Universalism , arising from the difficulties that attend its defense ; such as the character of its doctrines , striking at the root of all Christian faith and piety ; the irreligious character of its ministers and their congregations ; the want of confidence , both of preachers and hearers , in their own system , and their public use of arguments the sophistry of which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reject and those who defend it ; its recent date ; and its want of sanctions wherewith to enforce the duties of life . The third gives reasons for renouncing Universalism , drawn from the threatenings of the Bihle . The fourth and fifth give reasons for renouncing the system , drawn from the entire insufficiency and fallacy of the arguments adduced for its support from the Bible , reason , and the light of nature . The sixth gives reasons for renouncing it drawn from its moral tendencies and results . The seventh gives the argument against Universalism , drawn from future judgment . We value the work chiefly for two reasons . The first , is its exhibition of the grace of God in reclaiming and converting one far gone in error , and of the means and process by which this was accomplished . The narrative of Mr. Smith 's religious experience ; the effect which the observation of the evil results of Universalism had upon his mindone of great natural sensibility ; his mental conflict  --  the conflict between attachment to his theory and his aversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine grace crowned that conflict , must affect the hearts of God 's people . We have read it with much emotion , even with tears . The second reason is , the testimony here given as to the dreadful moral influence and results of Universalism , by one who knows them from experience and thorough observation . We have always argued from the fixed principles of the depraved heart , that a system which takes off from that heart all restraint derived from the eternal world , which throws loose the reins on the neck of human passion , which cries to the conscience of the wicked " peace , peace , " which promises to men eternal happiness live in this world as they list , which , in short , abolishes the sanctions of God 's law and the whole influence of God 's government in their bearing on human conduct , must be most disastrous in its effects on moral character . We have seen also something of the results of Universalism on society . We have known that a large part of professed Universalists , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license to sin . We have occasionally seen a congregation of Universalists , and been struck with the apparent symptoms of moral degra // dation , and could not repress the thought that an answer to the question , " who hath redness of eyes ? " was very obvious . We have known something of the intimate connexion between their place of meeting and the grog-shop and bar-room . But here is a witness from the very center of the Universalist camp , who has seen all its stations from that center to its outposts , who has observed all the host from its leaders to its lowest subaltern , who reveals the whole of what we had seen but a part , and , testifying to the utter corruption and rottenness of the system , more than confirms our observation , and fully substantiates our reasonings from the nature of the case . Mr. Smith has taken us into the " chambers of imagery " of Universalism . He has shown to us the interior life of its ministry and their hearers . He has proved to us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whited and beautiful sepulcher , is surely " full of all uncleanness " within . His testimony is that of one who entered bn his ministerial office with enthusiasm , and performed its duties with great popularity , hut by the moral results of the faith , was disappointed , disgusted , shocked , till sensibility and conscience could endure no longer . We shall therefore , in our review of Mr. Smith 's work , dwell principally on these two points . It is a fact well worthy of our notice , that Mr. Smith did not become a Universalist in opposition to early religious instruction , to all those associations which cluster around the family altar , and to the sacred and undying influences which parental fidelity implants in the heart . Universal ism was the religion of his childhood . He says " I never enjoyed early religious instruction . In my father 's house there was no family altar ; no voice of prayer was there heard ; no reading of the Bible as an act of worship . I never enjoyed the benefit of Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one instructed me to lisp his name , or fear his law . I have no recollection of having ever passed a night in my life , till I was more than twenty years of age , in a house in which there was family prayer , or the reading of the Bible , as an act of religious worship . " My earliest recollections as to religion , are identified with Universalism . " " When I was six years of age , my father embraced the doctrine of Universalism , and became a preacher of the system . Nearly all that I heard upon the subject of religion , was favorable to Universalism ; nearly all my relatives were of that faith ; and almost all my acquaintances received the same sentiments . Very early I imbibed a hatred toward all systems that differed from this . So soon were the seeds of error planted in my heart . " pp. 7 , 8 . When he was sixteen years of age , his attention was turned to the subject of personal religion . A seriousness prevailed among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought his life was not what it should be , and that his heart was not right in the sight of God . His feelings were enlisted , and in some measure changed , so that he read the Bible with pleasure , and in some small meetings urged his fellow men to repentance . But unfortunately , being in a community far from evangelical , and falling in with teachers of Universalism , and being assured that Universalism and personal piety could harmonize , his religious interest was turned into that evil channel . He adopted the system of Universalism , began preparation for its ministry , and preached his first sermon in Medway , Mass. , when between seventeen and eighteen years of age . About a year after , in December , 1829 , he removed to Vermont , to take charge of two Universalist societies , one in Brattleboro ' and the other in Guilford . Having unbounded confidence in the system which he had adopted , he had no doubt that it would work a great moral change in society , and used every exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youth and all // the fervor of sincerity . Flow his expectations were answered , he thus informs us . " At the very outset , I was mortified at the results of my ministry , and pained with what I saw in those who were the loudest in their professions of regard for the blessed doctrine , ' as Universalism was usually called . I saw none of that reform which I expected would attend my preaching ; no moral reformation , though none needed it more than my personal friends ; no change for the better , though I saw many changes for the worse . " " I was praised in the barrooms , and my health drank in almost every tavern in tha county . On the Sabbath , my congregation came direct from the tavern to my meeting , and went as directly back to the tavern after the meeting . The intermission was usually passed in discussing the merits of the sermon , not always in the most decorous terms ; and in drinking my health , with their best wishes for my successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While those who attended upon my ministry were called the liberal party , I knew that most of them were profane men ; a large portion were open disbelievers in the inspiration of the Bible ; and nearly all had been peculiar for their habits of Sabbath violation , passing the day in business or in pleasure . In all things , save an attendance upon my preaching , they remained professedly and really the same . Men came together , but not to be made better . They seemed to desire that their hands might be strengthened in sin ; and thought the end of preaching to be , to prove that all retribution was limited to this life , and that all men would finally be saved . When occasionally I urged upon my hearers the duties of life , and lightly reproved their vices , I was told that such preaching was decidedly illiberal , and very much like the orthodox . Nor were profaneness , gambling , Sabbath-breaking , or infidelity , regarded as in any respect inconsistent with a profession of Universalism . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of going into the adjoining towns to hear me preach ; and I have known him repeatedly to pass nearly the whole Saturday night in gambling with young men at a tavern-young men whom he had invited to accompany him to meeting . And at the same time this individual was engaged in a controversy in a secular paper with a Methodist clergyman , upon the moral tendency of Universalism " One uniform tendency accompanied Universalism in all places . One class of men hailed the doctrine , and wished the preacher abundant success . " " Often have I been complimented with oaths ; heard the scoffer and the vile hope the good work would go on ; and been wished success in language too foul and offensive to be repeated . When I saw a mars in my congcegation of an intelligent appearance , I presumed him to be an infidel , and never in this respect was I mistaken . " pp. 10 , 11 , 12 . " Often , " he says , " in the solitude of my study , such questions as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend your preaching ? Do profaneness , Sabbath-breaking , intemperance , licentiousness , fly at the approach of your faith ? Do religious fear , godliness , holiness , distinguish its reception among men ? ' " These reflections , though they made him unhappy , did not yet shake his faith in his system . He consoled himself with the thought , that the fault was not in Universalism , but in its professors . In the year 1832 , he accepted an invitation to take charge of the Universalist society in Hartford . rfhere he attracted a large congregation , and was highly esteemed and well supported by his society . But no good moral results attended his ministry . The founders and chief supporters of the society , its clerk , a majority of its committee , and seven eighths of the pew-holders , were undisguised infidels . " But , " he says , " the absence of good moral results was not the only evil with which I was called to contend . I not only turned no sinner from the error of his ways ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I saw positive evils attending my labors . Many who attended my ministry were grossly immoral , and more were waxing worse and worse . " One fact that transpired among others , made me very unhappy . On Sabbath evenings my church was usually crowded with young men . Many of these would leave the bar-rooms and dram-shops in the vicinity of my meeting-house , attend my lecture , and then retire again , at its close , to those places of infamy , and there pass nearly the whole night . They would drink my health , and praise me and my sermons in the awful words of profaneness and blasphemy . " pp. 16 , 17 . Oppressed beyond measure by Jan. // these facts ; not willing to do his fellow men an injury , yet knowing that many could justly accuse him as the author of their ruin ; mortified and appalled at the contrast between the character and spirit of the orthodox community and that of his own community , and between the results of orthodox preaching and those of his own ; harassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , his health and reason gave way . During his mental alienation , his whole theme was Universalism , its tendency , and the insufficiency of the proof adduced for its support . On this subject he had conversations at that time with two of the pastors of that city , in which he revealed what was passing in his mind . After he had partially recovered his health , feeling that he could remain no longer in Hartford , he resigned his charge , resolved to seek another field of labor . Compelled to reject ultra Universalism , he adopted the doctrine of limited future punishrnent . Distressed at the immoralities of his denomination , he determined to preach less- against the faith of other sects , and more against the sins of his own society ; less upon the certainty of the salvation of all men , and more upon the duties of life . He was soon settled over a Universalist society in Salem . There his congregation was one of the largest in the city ; but the practical results of his ministry were the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which by an ascending step he had adopted , of limited future punishment . Its effect was much the same as that of ultra Universalism , and moreover he could find in the Bible no evidence of any limit to future punishment , and the same reasons by which he proved any punishment hereafter , demanded its perpetuity . Yet , unable to give up his faith in the ultimate salvation of all men , determined to cling to that , he was greatly distressed , and could find no peace unless by a great effort he banished the whole subject from his mind , and turned his attention to something else . He wrote and preached often under the influence of doubts almost overwhelming . Once in order to remove his doubts , he wrote a sermon in which he presented in the strongest form all the arguments he could think of in defense of Universalism . He preached the sermon but once , and though his people requested it for the press , he committed it to the flames . When he conversed with his ministerial associates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found them in deeper difficulty than himself . He resolved at length to dismiss the subject of man 's destiny altogether from his sermons , and to preach on moral subjects and the practical duties of life , without saying any thing in respect to the final salvation of all men . " Tbis change , " he says , " in the subjects of my sermons was soon noticed , and complained of . Some desired a little more doctrine . Others thought the youth ought to be indoctrinated , and that the minister ought to do it . From various sources , I would hear that strangers WlO enteresi my church could not tell what my views were ; and my society considered it a reproach , that men could hear a Unix'erealist. preach , and not know whether or not he believed that all men would he saved . While others , out of regard to my health and ease , desired me to preach some of my old sermons-the design being to obtain the doctrine which those sermons were known to contain . " p. 25 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rest . He had dismissed the subject of man 's final destiny from his preaching , but be could not dismiss it from his thoughts . And though he did not yet gtve up his faith in the ultimate s*tlvation of all men , he felt that as an honest man he could no longer represent a system which was plainly at war with the interests of his race . He therefore wrote a letter to the committee of the Uni // versalist society , in which among other things , he said : " If I could serve the society without acting in concert or being identified with the denomination of Universalists , I should be ready and happy so to do . " If , however , the society should insist upon such a concert of action , I shall hold myself ready , cheerfully , and with the kindest feelings , forthwith to tender my resignation of the office of pastor , and with it all the duties , trials , and responsibilities of that trust . " p. 30 . The committee to whom this letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it back-expressed their surprise-thought he was committing a suicidal act , and assured him that if he would take back the letter and continue his labors , they would pledge him their honors that no mortal should ever know that it had been written . He told them that the sentiments he bad expressed remained unchanged , and that he could not eat the bread of dishonesty-resigned his office , and from that hour has had no official connexion with Universalism . Impelled by his increasing doubts about the ultimate salvation of all men , he resolved thoroughly and faithfully to review and weigh all the arguments for and against that doctrine . The result of this review was his full conviction , " that Universalism is as false in theory as it is destructive in practice . " But the same gracious Spirit who had led him to reject that false system , still urged him on , and pressed the inquiry , " What is truth ? " For the system denominated orthodoxy he had by early association and long habit the most perfect contempt and abhorrence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal concern , and to consider the question , whether he had met with that change and formed that character which the Bible declares to be essential to salvation . " I felt , " says lie , " that there was a reality in religion , which I had never known , a power that I had never enjoy . ed . I longed for something that would take hold of my own heart , and allow me to speak to the hearts of my fellow men . I was now , in a measure , afloat . I had no settled opinions upon religion . On what si ( le soever I turned , I found difficulties ; and on all sides , the horizon was black indeed . " " I had no religious acquaintance , to whom I could unburden my mind . My sufferings were great ; my anguish more exquisite than language can paint . I did not know where to go , or to whom I could speak ; and it seemed to me literally , that no man cared for my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have found some friend to whom I could have unbosomed myself ; who would have said some kind thing , or bid me hope in God . But I did not dare trust even my own family . Though it seemed to me that every man I met read my feelings in my countenance , I kept them to myself till I was carried almost into my grave . " " A complaint which , from my childhood , has been the bane of my existence , and which in Hartford had led to temporary derangement , threatened to return . I was admonished that it was time to seek medical advice . " pp. 33 , 34 . Finding that he could not otherwise answer necessary questions , he unburdened his mind to his physician , who warmly sympathized with him , and urged him not to incur the great hazard of learing this state of feeling alone , but to seek assistance from some religious teacher . Unwilling to commit himself by seeking sympathy or instruction from those near him , with a trembling spirit and great anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some acquaintance , and communicated to him his difficulties . The answer , which was sent immediately , was such as might have been expected in such circumstances , from such a source . " A letter , " says Mr. S. , " so full of Christian sympathy I did not expect , and , I know not why , I was unmanned for a season , and unfitted for any duty . As soon as my feelings subsided , I resolved to be a Christian , if God would give me grace , to live in his service , and die in his cause . " But peace came not in an hour . A deep probing of my own soul took place . My sins were set in order before me , and unless help came from the cross , I felt that I must perish , and perish most justly . Against great light I had sinned , and // long and wilfully resisted the truth . I bad employed my strength in strengthening the hands of the wicked , and peopling the world of despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy ? what claim upon the grace of God ? I was encompassed with awful fears . My days were wretched-my nights were passed in anguish that drove sleep from my pillow . I was awfully tempted to leave this world unbidden , hut I dared not do it . I was certain , if I did , I should go to hell . My appetite was gone , my health declining , my strength almost exhausted . 0 , the wormwood and the gall of those dark and trying moments ! How vivid they stand out upon my memory ! How harrowing the recital ! I have barely firmness sufficient to pen these events . " But God at last heard my prayer , and gave me peace . pp. 40 , 41 . To his great surprise and joy , when , with much solicitude as to the result , he communicated his feelings to his wife , he found that she was prepared fully to sympathize with him . Her faith in Universalism was first shaken by the conduct and conversation of Universalist ministers who visited at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true nor profitable which had such advocates ; and several months before his conversion , she had found the Savior precious to her soul ; though from fear that a knowledge of her change would make him unhappy , she had not communicated it to him . " Could any one marvel , " he asks , " that our first family altar should be one of thanksgiving to that God who hadopened our eyes , touched our hearts , and enabled us to begin together a new life in Christ ? " But his long course of distress as to the moral results of his preaching , and of doubt as to its truth ; his subsequent unsettled state , his conviction of sin , and anxiety as to his own salvation , together with the hatred and calumny and varied persecution of his former associates and friends , which affected the public mind with suspicion and distrust ; the excitement of addressing in these circumstances an immense congregation on the subject of his change of views ; the anxiety attending an examination before an association of pastors for license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Salem for admission to its communion , added to repeated and exciting conversations and arguments with his Universalist acquaintance , were too much both for body and mind . The disease to which he was liable triumphed for several weeks , during which , under the influence of suggestions and objections urged by his former friends , his mind vacillated respecting the strict eternity of future punishment . Taking advantage of this , his enemies raised the shout that he had returned to Universalism . At this time , for the restoration of his health , and for advice and sympathy , he made a visit to Rev. Dr. Hawes . While in his family his health was improved , his mind became calm and decided , and his heart fixed . " It is but just to say , " he remarks , " that , If I shall ever be of any service in the ministry of Jesus Christ , it will be very much owing to the friendly attentions , the judicious instructions , and the Christian sympathy , which I received from Dr. lawes , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 . After this he spent a few months in New Haven , attending to theological study , where , on the last Sabbath in the year 1840 , " a year full of change , anxiety and suffering , " he , together with his wife , entered , on profession of their faith , into communion with the First church , in that city . During the next month he took license to preach , from the New Haven West Association , and since that time has been constantly , and we hardly need say successfully , employed in building up the faith which he once destroyed . He is now the regular pastor of a Congregational church in Nashua , N. H. It is a most interesting fact , that Mr. Smith is the child of a pious // mother , and that her dying prayer was offered for her infant son to Him who in his rich grace has said to his people , " I will be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee . " To this fact he thus alludes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Universalists . There is an exception to this remark ; and did I not name it , I should do injustice to the best friend I ever had . My own mother was not a Universalist . She was a religious woman . I have no remembrance of her ; for she died before my memory received any impressions of her words or looks . 1 can not recall any thing in relation to her . But those who knew her well , speak of her piety and love for the things of God . I was her youngest child ; and she wished to live to train* me up for God , and to guide me in the way of life . Very early in my life , I was made acquainted with her dying employment . As death approached , she called for me , and took me in her arms , and pressed me to her bosom with her dying embrace . Her last tears were shed for me ; her last breath was spent in prayer to God for my welfare and my salvation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impiety and sin , and become a useful Christian . That death-bed , and the last moments of my mother , have never left my mind , since first I was told of her dying hours . When far gone in error , this scene has spoken to me . When many have thought rue hardened , past feeling , arid past redemption , this has made my mind tender , and sometimes almost overwhelmed me. ' p. 51 . In closing the account of his religious experience , Mr. Smith with very appropriate feelings thus inquires . " How can I review my past life ? The retrospect is terrible beyond description . Twelve years of this short life wasted , and worse than wasted ! Employed in strengthening the hands of the wicked ; in removing the restraints of the Bible ; in preaching peace to the ungodly ; in assuring them that they would not die , though they disobeyed God ; in alluring men to destruction ; in turning men fiomn liPe to death ; and in speaking encouragement to those already in the road to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 0 , what a retrospect !

' 0 that I could recall the past ! 0 that I could wipe out the influence I have exerted , and make those twelve years a blank ! Could I do this , I would make any sacrifice . I would weep tears of blood , if I had them , to remove the impressions I have made upon the souls of men , while I was in the ministry of error . But this 1 can not do . All that remains for me is , to lift my voice in defense of truth , and tell men what great things God has done for my soul . " p. 53 . Such is the history of our author ; such his acquaintance with Universalism ; such his religious experience ; such his competence , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral results of that system . What is his testimony on this point ? In this testimony , as we have already intimated , lies the peculiar value of this book as a refutation of Universalism . Mr. Smith has indeed presented very well the arguments against the system , both from Scripture and reason . Yet this has often been well done before , and there are many who can do it well again . But there are few , very few , among the defenders of the truth , who have had equal opportunities for observing the effects of Universalism , and can give on that point such conclusive and overwhelming testimony . What then according to this testimony , whose credibility we have virtually considered , are the moral atmosphere and moral results of Universalism ? This we will endeavor to give in substance , and as briefly as possible . And here , by the way , we would remark , that we know of no better test of the truth or falsity of the system than this inquiry . Of systems of faith , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits . " Ye shall know them , " said our Savior , " by their fruits . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ? " If a man 's works are evil , his heart must be corrupt . If Ihe tendencies and well ascertained effects of any doctrinal system are de // structive to the best interests of man , that system is false , and has not , can not have , for its author , the true and benevolent God . One of the characteristics of error is , that its natural course is downward . This is. a characteristic of Universalism . It has itself gone down , down , that is , it has gone down in doctrine , till it can hardly go farther . It commenced with the rejection of one important article of faith , and has continued thi process of mutilation , till now it has not one of the distinguishing features of a revelation from God . " When Universalism was first introduced into the country in 1770 , " says Mr. Smith , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They rejected simply the eternity of future punishment . " Its first downward step was to deny the divinity and atonement of Christ . Its second , to reject the doctrine of any , even limited , future punishment . At the third step it boldly denied that sin is an evil under God 's government , and also the existence of hell , the being of the devil , the immortality of the soul , and the existence of angels . It then assailed the institutions of religion . It denied the divine institution of the Sabbath , and devoted it to secular purposes ; denied the binding nature and sacredness of the Lord 's supper , and virtually abolished the church . haying thus rejected all of the Bible but the name , it becomes in reality identified with infidelity . Accordingly it is found , that a large part-the most intelligent part-of Universalist societies , are openly infidel , and will not allow their ministers to preach against infidelity . We have already spoken of Mr. Smith 's testimony as to the infidelity of the great majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , being infidels , they supported Universalism , they replied that " They thought that superstition , as they used to call religion , should be checked ; that something must be done to keep their wives and children from being orthodox ; the world , they thought , was not yet quite prepared for a full advocacy of truth , and Universalism came so near their idea of truth , that it was the best thing the world at present would bear . " p. 16 . One of the most intelligent , a physician , answered to the same question thus : " I unite with the Universalists because *they are the nearest to nothing of any thing I know of . " There is entire sympathy between infidels and Universalists . Says our authorWhen Frances Wright gave her lectures in Boston , the Universalists were among her most ardent admirers . " The prominent ministers of Universalism were among her audiences , and were seated upon the stage with her at the Federal street theater . She visited them at their houses . And I heard Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Wright in the sentiments she advanced in her lectures , except in one thing ; what she called retigion , he should call superstition . " p. 245 . Infidels are freely admitted into Universalist meeting-houses to lecture in favor of infidelity , and constitute a large part of the subscribers to Universalist papers . Mr. 0 . A. Brownsoa says , of the two thousand five hundred subscribers to the paper which he conducted when a Universalist , he presumes " that more than half were skeptics , or at least skeptical . " Mr. Brownson adds , that " it was very common for the clergymen with whom he was acquainted , to speak of Universalism as a stepping-stone , ' as the best weapon to destroy the orthodox , do away the clergy , and prepare the way for something * and that " he has conversed with hundreds of professed Universalists , who would own to him that they support Universalism only because it was the most liberal sentiment they could find , and because it was better than deism to put down the orthodox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone through the Universalist and infidel camps into Atheism , says , // " that he , as an Atheist , has reached his position only by carrying out those principles of interpretation which , when a Universalist , he brought to the Bible . " p. 248 . Such is the downward tendency of this error . It began by denying simply the eternity of future punishment . It is now infidelity , almost without an attempt at disguise . Let us next consider the tendency and effects of Universalism , as manifest in the conduct and character of its advocates . On this point some testimony has already been offered , in giving an account of Mr. Smith 's experience as a minister of that sect . But his book is full of most appalling evidence , leading to the same conclusion . We will give a few specimens . And first , as to the character of the Universalist clergy . If piety exist in a sect , we expect to find it in its ministry . But whoever looks for it in the Universalist ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Mrs. Smith was led to reject Universalism , by the conduct and conversation of Universalist ministers in her family . Says Mr. Smith " Among no other body of men can be found , I presume , so muchill-will , jealousy , and bad feeling , as may be found among the advocates of Universalism . " " Although associated with them twelve years , I never heard the subject of personal religion introduced in a meeting of Universalist teachers as a theme of conversation , or any topic designed to imp rove the understanding or mend the heart . But impure and indecent jests , low and offensive stories , remarks that would rule a man out of any respectable drawing-room in the country , together with petty scandal , and criticism of no friendly character , upon some absent brother , make up the conyersation of Universalist preachers when in company with each other . " p. 65 . " A man may retail liquor by the glass , use profane language , and be an open infidel , and yet be a Universalist minister in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an assembled council of Universalist preachers , to have committed no crime against morality or religion . " p. 74 . Universalist ministers dislike and " restrain prayer ; " and there is no surer sign than this of the absence of piety . Says our author " No minister of the sect whom I ever knew , maintains family prayer . I have known many to ridicule the custom ; but no one to observe it . I have been often in the families of the principal advocates of Universalism , and passed the night . They have been at my house . I found no fttmily devotions at their dwellings . They expressed no surprise at not finding an altar at my fireside. " " 1 knev* one man who asked a blessing at his table . But he did this only when he had company ; and was led to the practice by the remark of a friend , who told him he thought it looked strange for a minister to have no blessing craved at his table . " So far as my own custom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor prayed with them . I did not feel it my duty to do so . I should as soon have thought it my duty to turn my parlor into a Mahometan mosque , and gather my family together to see me perfbrm those ablutions which the religion of Mahomet requires , as to have engaged with them in family worship . Nor is this a hard saying . The sect do not consider this thing as a blemish . " " A person of my acquaintance once said to me , after his conversion to Universalism , I wonder that the Universalist clergy do not pray in their families , if it were only to stop the mouths of the orthodox . ' He set up family prayer for this purpose ; but the flame soon went out upon his altar . lie gave up his devotions and ceased to wonder that his new brethren did not pray , even though it might have accomplished the great results anticipated , in stopping the mouths of the orthodox . Indeed , a tropical plant could sooner bloom in Nova Zembla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Universalismn. " pp. 227 , 22S , 229 . Indeed , Mr. Smith tells us , many Universalists deny that prayer is a duty , and argue that this ceaseless importunity is offensive to God ; that the editor of the Universalist paper in Hartford , announced through its columns , that for the future he should refuse to pray when he conducted public service , and said that such prayer was wrong , and a tribute to orthodoxy that he // was unwilling to pay ; that Mr. Grosh , the editor of one of the most widely circulated Universalist journals in the country , defended this course ; and that a large number of Universalist ministers assented to its correctness , but thought the community not sufficiently enlightened to bear it . Thus far as to the fruits of Universalism , as manifest in its ministry . In this connexion we can not refrain from quoting-though it is not in logical order-one paragraph as to the competency of the Universal1st clergy to explain and amend the common version of the Scriptures , and to impugn the faith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson River Association of Universalists , a fe*v years since , an attempt was made to establish a rule , requiring of candidates for ordination , the study of grammar , logic , and rhetoric , for the space of six months , under some Universalist preacher ; no theological study being demanded . The introduction of the resolution produced a commotion that , for a time , threatened the existence of the Association . It was declared to be absolutely useless to possess such qualifications . It was said to be one of the abominations of partialism . ' Some of the ablestministers threatened to leave the order , ' if the resolution were not withdrawn . But the excitement went beyond the bounds of the Association , and the periodicals expressed their indignation at the rule proposed . The editor of one of the most widely circulated Universalist papers says , in respect to grammar , We do consider this an absurd requisition for the candidate for the ministry , particularly when many of our ablest preachers could not even now pass the required examination . ' ( Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Andrews says , Many of our most pop*idar and useful preachers have no pretensions of that sort ; and are , in fact , unable to write a sermon correctly , that is , without gross violation of the most common principles of rhetoric and English grammar . ( Gospel .4ncI or , ii . p. 141. ) " p. 75 . Let us now consider the effects of Universalism on those who hear it . We do not usually expect to find a people better than their ministers . " Like priest , like people . " The preaching of Christ and his apostles , alarmed , reformed , and changed the hearts of men . None of these effects , says Mr. Smith , has Universalisin , but the very opposite . " Twelve years in its ministry have not brought one instance of reformation from that cause under my observation . I have never heard of an instance , nor have I ever seen a man who had been more favored than myself in this respect . " p. 223 . " In the congregations with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family that observed the reading of the Bible as an act of devotion , or had regular family worship . And I have never found settled religious principle among those calling themselves Universalists . Not only have I never found devout reverence springiug from the system , but none can live in it . I have observed it a fact invariably occurring , that , wh ( .n a Universalist becomes serious arid ihoughtful , he will at once leave the Universalist meeting . And when a pious man embraces that system , he will abandon his habits of devotion , in changing his faith . Men peculiar for their habits of private and family prayer , and fur a serious study of the Bible , if they embrace Universalism , become at once as peculiar for the neglect of these religious doties. " p.62 . " I have often been struck with the change in the characters of men , when coiiverted to Universalism . Before their conversion , they had a family altar ; afterwards , it was thrown down . Before , they would devote the Sabbath to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pleasure . Before , they were liberal in supporting not only the public worship of God , but the benevolent institutions of the church ; afterwards , the smallest sum was given with extreme reluctance . I was once instrumental in persuading a young man to embrace my system . He was an artist by profession . He had been religiously educated , was vcry moral , a strict observer of the Sabbath , and punctual in his attendance upon public worship . I had great difficulty in removing the many objections he urged against Universahism . At length he was satisfied to rest his hopes of heaven upon that foundation . In less than six months from the hour in which he embraced it , his moral sense was so impaired , that he used to work upon the Sabbath . " pp. 260 , 261 . " The class of persons , " says Mr. Smith , " usually collected together to hear a preacher of Universalism , is proof of its immoral tendency . " 45 // " In the year 1839 , I was invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sabbath was very pleasant , and a great concourse of people attended meeting . At the close of the morning service , we all went to the tavern . During the intermission , the bar-room was full , and the incessant sound of ' the toddy-stick announced to me that the waiter was constantly employed . The weather being warm , and the doors all open , I could hear the discussion of the merits of the sermon , and the commendations , mingled with oaths , which they bestowed upon the preacher . All were not thus employed . Some were trading horses ; some betting on the relative speed of their animals , and threatening to test the matter when meeting should be done . At the close of the meeting , a scene occurred that I can not represent . it seemed like the breakin* up of some military review . So much cursing and swearing , rude and vulgar jesting , horse-racing and running , that my pen can do little towards describing it . I turned from the whole spectacle sick at heart ; ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher of a doctrine which called such a collection and such characters together . " p. 270 . " I have repeatedly had my congregation follow me , upon the Sabbath , from the bar-room to the place of meeting , and then back again to the tavern . In the stage-coach , I have been extremely mortified , when defending Universalism , to have a profane , drinking , dissolute looking person signify to me that he thought my argument conclusive , and that he agreed with me exactly . " p. 264 . " Common observation must convince any man that the profane , the intemperate , the licentious , love this doctrine . They call it their own . They support it ; they defend it . " " When I was a settled Universalist preacher , all such bowed to me as their spiritual guide . When a man died of the delirium tre - rnens , was hanged or drowned by his own act , I was called , as a matter of course , to attend the funeral . " p. 263 . The object for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both their character and the character of their system . Says our author : " The great purpose of those who unite in Universalist societies , is not to make themselves better , and to throw around themselves new restraints ; not that men may be reformed , converted , and made holy ; but to put down orthodoxy . If a minister , in place of preaching against religion , preaches against the sins of his people , he is at once censured as having traveled out of the record . ' " p. 62 . " The great end of Universalist preaching is to prove that all men will be saved , to show that the doctrines of the orthodox are absurd , and that no retribution is to be found in the future world . As long as a minister attends to this , all will go well . " " But let a minister preach plainly and frequently against profanity , drunkenness , gaming , or any of the alarming sins of the day , and he will at once be reproved . No society , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Universalists give their ministers to understand distinctly that they do not come together for that purpose . They are united to put down orthodoxy ; and as for hearing their preacher often rebuke and reprove them , they are not disposed to it . J'hey can hear enough of such preaching at orthodox meetings . " During the latter part of my ministry as a Universalist , I was frequently censured , with oaths , because I did not preach IJniversahism enough ; but enforced too much the practical duties of life . In Salem , I once preached upon righteousness and temperance . Some of my principal men came to me , and threatened to nail up their pews , if I meddled with that subject again . Had I added judgment to come , ' I dare not anticipate what the result would have been . " pp. 275 , 276 . So manifest is the demoralizing influence of Universalism , that many confirmed Universalists fear to have it exercised on their families . Mr. Smith tells us that he is acquainted with parents , who are professedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this account , and give this reason for it , saytng ,  --  " Our children are old enough to understand , and we prefer to have them under a different influence . " This reminds us of a remark of a distinguished Unitarian , who , when asked why he sent his sons to an orthodox school , replied - " Orthodoxy is very good for boys . " Strange that men will trust their own eternal well-being on a foundation on which they fear to rest even the temporal welfare of their children . Jan. // " Universalism , " says Mr. S. , " leads to suicide . Its doctrines make it unnecessary and unwise for us to keep an existence which is so full of woe , and which is the only barrier to perfect and endless felicity . It must be folly and madness to continue in this life of disappointment and misery , when , by a self-inflicted death , a man may - end The heartache , and the thousand natural shocks That desh is heir to . ' " p. 322 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reasoning-reasoning entirely conclusive , from Universalist premises . Of these we will mention but one , and that partly because it is for other reasons notorious . " Jonathan Cilley , who was killed by Mr. Graves , of Kentucky , in a duel , was m conversation with a pious lady in Washington the night before he was shot . He confessed that , with the religious views that the lady entertained , he should be deterred from fighting the duel . But , as a Universalist , he had nothing to fear ; if he shot his antagonist , the world would justify him ; hut if he was killed , his soul would immediately ascend to heaven . " p. 325 . To this case we may add another of recent occurrence . J. C. Colt , the late murderer and suicide , evidently held the same opinions as to eternal retribution . In one of his letters written while in prison , we find the poor and common sophistry of Universalists , that " a finite sin can not receive an infinite punishment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so few , comparatively , commit suicide , is found in the fact that there are very few confirmed Universalists in the world . " Our author does not leave his testimony as to the moral results of Universalismn , to stand alone . He confirms his own by that of a large number , who , like him , have left the ministry of that system , on account of its demoralizing effects . ile mentions the names of thirtytwo , whose cases have come to his knowledge . Among these are 0 . A. Brownson , who has passed from the lowest point of any thing called religion , in an ascending series , and through several gradations , almost to orthodoxy ; Adin Ballou , and Charles Hudson , now a member of Congress from Worcester County , Mass. , whose testimony , especially that of the two latter , as quoted by our author , is very full and emphatic , and accords well with his own . Additional confirmation of his own testimony , as to the moral results of the system which he has renounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who still continue in the ministry of Universalism . Of these we will quote only one . " A Universalist preacher , who stands at the head of the denomination , was settled seventeen years in the vicinity of Boston . He had under his charge the largest and best Universalist society . He was very sick , and supposed to he in a consumption . He told me that the moral condition of his society , and the moral results of his preaching made him sick , and almost carried him to his grave . He felt that he had done no good ; that his ministry had been the source of much evil , besides wasting the long period of time that he had been settled . Nearly every man who was in the society when he was settled , died during his ministry . And nearly every one that died , was AN ATHEIST , A DEIST , as A DRUNKARD . He could not remain . He left his charge , and settled over a sin , 11 congre* ation , resolved to change his style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . Vain hope , while Universalism is preached p. 315 . It is cheering to the friends of truth to be informed , as they are by Mr. Smith , that " Universalism in this country is on the wane . " We o&amp;casionally hear from the or*ans of Universalism boastful accounts of the rapid spread of their system , and of the formation of great numbers of new societies . But by these statements , as we are told by our author , the community is greatly deceived . True , many new societies are formed ; but most of them die , and die in infancy . And the Universalist papers , while they tell us how many new societies have been organized , do not tell us how // many , during the same period , have come to an untimely end . They keep a record of ecclesiastical births , hut not of ecclesiastical deaths . " Many , " says Mr. S. , " are formed today and die to-morrow . They are composed of discordant materials which can not long bold together . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion in the town ; another , because the use of a church for a lecture bas been refused ; another , to keep women and children away from religious influence . Preaching is sustained awhile , till the fit of zeal has passed off ; and then the whole attempt is abandoned . in . New England alone , more than one hundred Universalist societies hujice run down since 1830. " p. 272 . " The character of these societies is so graphically described by one of the sect , that I will all ow him to speak for them . Iiosea Ballou , 2d , says , Here is a Universalist society that has perbaps gathered in a considerable number of mernhers , whose ability in worldly means is equal to that of any society in the town . Indeed , they sometimes congratulate themselves on their strength over a feebler society of another faith , which nevertheless manages to support constant preaching . They , on the other hand , feel that they can not afford to settle a pastor , nor indeed to procure the ministration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm season , possibly but half of the time even then , or only occasionally . But when they do have preaching , the thing is done up in the earthquake style . Notice is published all abroad , and when the day arrives , in *come the wagons and carriages , horsemen and footmen , from a dozen miles around , and fill the church to overflowing . Many a glance is cast forth at the smaller neighboring congregation-it is a wonderful triumph ; they have beaten their neighbors twofold , and this was what they meant to do . The matter is talked of ; perhaps they get it published ; and then-their church is shut again , till they can gather excitability enough for another convulsion fit , or rather till the apparatus is ready for galvanizing the dead body once more . " This is a most accurate description , given , not hy an enemy , but by a friend ; not fi-om report , but from actual knowledge ; and hy one , who , in company with myself , has assisted in galvanizin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 273 , 274 . " Take any place in which Universalism has existed six years , and draw a circle around it of ten miles , and you will find Universalism to he less flourishing than at its commencement . p. 326 . For the particulars which constitute the proof of the truth of this statement , we have not room . We must refer the reader who wishes to see them , to Mr. Smith 's book . Such is the sinking condition of Universalism in America : while in Europe , the land of its birth , where it began with James IRelly , in Eng . land , in the time of Whitefield , it has hardly an organized existence . In Liverpool there is a society consisting , says its minister , of " a few stragglers , amounting in all to some hundreds . " " In Scotland there are three small congregations , numbering less than one hundred souls each . But these are Trinitarians , and make the doctrine of the Trinity the test of fellowship . They do not reco6 nize the Universalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country have made many attempts to cultivate the acquaintance and gain the fellowship of those in Europe , whom they have supposed to be of the same faith with themselves . But these attempts have resulted only in mortification . They wrote to Professor Tholuck . He replied once , and then , having ascertained their belief and character , declined all farther correspondence . A box contuining a copy of each of their principal publications , sent to Mrs. Sherwood by some American ITniversalists , who thought they had reason to hope for fellowship with her , was returned unopened . Mr. C. J. Lefevre , a popular preacher of a Universalist society in the city of New York , went as delegate to " the liberal churches in Europe , " by appdintment of the General Convention of Universalists , with the high expectation of " lifting up his voice in defense of God 's universal and efficient grace in London , in Paris , in St. Petersburg , and if possible , in Rome . " He was invited by a Unitarian clergyman near London ; to preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , // " was the only time I ofticiated during my residence in Europe . It was the only opportunity that was afforded me . " In truth , " says Mr. S. , " there is no Universalisni in Europe , such as is thus called in America . THE 5Y5TEM OF AMERICAN UNIVERSALISM HAS NOT A SINGLE DEFENDER IN Euao* . " p. 344 . In reading this work of Mr. Smith , we have been pleased with the illustration which it furnishes , of the truth , that God brings good out of evil . By his experience in the ministry of a destructive error , he has been . peculiarly qualified for the exposuro and refutation of that error . While engaged in proclaiming a system which heals slightly the hurt of conscience , which says " to every one who walketh after the imagination of his own heart , no evil shall come upon you , " he has seen more extensively and thoroughly than he otherwise could , the baneful influence and appalling results of that system , and thus gained possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parried nor resisted ; and this weapon , thus placed in his hapd by the ministry of error , God by his grace has turned to the destruction of error . Winning over to his service one of the servants of Satan , he leads him on in an irresistible attack upon those strong holds of Satan , the weak points of which he had learned while employed in their defense . One of the very priests of the temple of impiety , he uses as an instrument to expose its corruption . We may learn also from this work a lesson of charity , in judging of those who are in great error . it teaches us-what we have believed hardly possible-that a Universalist minister may be in a sense honest in his work . Let us not be misunderstood . We say in a sense honest . We by no means agree with those who talk of the innocence of errorists . We do not belk*ve that God so consti Yol . I. 7 tutes men , that they necessarily do all that evil which results from error on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to believe the truth . We are confident that all false principles and opinions , on practical subjects , are criminal . If man does evil , he is guilty somewhere . If he does wrong , thinking that he is right , his guilt is at the point where he formed his wrong . opinion . God has given us faculties capable of doing good and avoiding evil , and if we do evil , we , at some point , abuse those faculties either by misuse or neglect . In the more enlarged meaning of the terms therefore , a man can not be honest or conscientious , in a course of evil or injurious conduct . He ' can not be honest or conscientious clear through , in all that goes to make up that course of conducthonest both in his action , and in forming the opinions and principles which led to that action . It is a libel on our Creator to say so . He ' has made us capable of doing the right and shunning the wrong , and that at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do right , then we thought wrong ; then we ' formed a wrong opinion on a practical subject , and whether we formed it yesterday , or twenty years since , we did it criminally . At that l ) oint , we knowingly negleeted , perverted , or resisted light , and truth , and evidence . At that point , conscience condemned us . And for our wilful ignorance , or prejudice , or obstinacy , or hatred of truth , at that point-for this , when we appear at God 's tribunal , we must be speechless . We may say , moreover , that he , who has formed false opinions and principles which lead him to a course of evil conduct can not have an entirely sound conscience . There is ever in his conscience a hollow spot , a misgiving , which , should he regard its indications , would lead him to the truth . When we say then , that a Univer. * // salist minister may be honest in a sense , we do not mean thoroughly honest-honest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We mean simply , that while preaching Universalism , he may really think that Universalism is true . This , as we before said , we have been slow to believe ; so palpable a contradiction to the Bible is that system . Mr. Smith testifies that he really believed Universalism to be true , and began to preach it with enthusiasm , thinking that it would accomplish good results . Early instruction , the counsel of father and kindred and acquaintance , led him to hate orthodoxy , and embrace the error of universal salvation . The growth of wrong principles , thus early implanted in his mind , was favored by circumstances ; and he became an earnest and public advocate of these principles , verily thinking that they were true ; just as Paul " verily thought " that he " ought to do many things contrary to Jesus of Nazareth . " We can even believe , that those who have received their early instruction in orthodox communities and families , may , sometimes , honestly in the sense explained , enter on the ministry of Universalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the philosophy and traditi6ns of men , which have often been mingled with orthodox expositions of the commandments and truths of God . This evidently was the case with Relly , the father of Universalism in England , who made out his scheme by uniting the plain doctrine of the Scriptures , that Christ died for all men , with commercial views of the atonement-with the idea , that the atonement pays the debt of all for whom it is made . This was the case with Murray , who , with his Antinomian views , could not justify the ways of God to men , except by the doctrine of universal restoration . Believing , that for an act committed not by themselves , but by their common progenitor , all mankind were placed under condemnation , he felt pressed to find , as he thought he did find in the Bible , the doctrine , that the whole race were united to Christ , and made partakers of the rewards of a full obedience rendered by him for all . Denying man 's free-will , and believing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , he felt pressed to admit , that those who perish thus by sins which are inevitable , would in some way be rescued by him who placed them in so hard a condition . Believing , that God in his perfect benevolence desires the salvation of all men , and that by sheer power he can sanctify all , he felt bound in logic to adopt the doctrine of the final salvation df all . So it was to a great extent with Winchester , who , like Murray and Relly , seems to have been honest in his opinions . Thus doubtless it has been with many others . So prone are men to make the Bible mean what they think it ought to mean , what they think it must mean , in order to , be vindicated . Mr. Smith tells us , that of the thirty two ministers whom he mentions as having renounced Universalism , shocked by its moral results , twenty five entered the ministry of that system from the ministry of another faith . We would not however , intimate that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense above explained . Facts oblige us to adopt the conclusion , that many of them preach error , knowing it to be error , and thus for gain destroy souls for whom Christ died . Still , the fact that any among them are honest , should teach us candor and charity in judging of all errorists . For if a preacher of Universalism may be honest in any sense in his error , who may not ? But we would add , and the experience of our author and his ac // count of the experience of others confirm the truth of the remark , that the limited measure of honesty which there is in the Universalist ministry can not remain there long . It is a deadly work , in which honesty will either expire or fly in terror ; in which conscience will either be seared or revolt . Men may follow their logic in theory , but when it lends them to disastrous results in practice , if honest , they will start back alarmed , and retreat . An honest physician may theorize wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves deadly in practice , he will not persevere . He will take it for granted that there is an error in his premises or process , and retrace his steps . He will not proceed , when he looks back on his path strown with the dead , and sees that his medicine is more destructive than disease . So a man , honest in a sense , may theorize himself into Universalism , and enter on its ministry , but when he sees , its he must see in its ministry , its disastrous results ; when he sees how piety can neither thrive nor live in that pestilential atmosphere , while impiety flourishes and exults in it as in its peculiar and chosen clime ; when he sees how it encourages sin in all its forms ; how its path is trod by the Sabbath breaker , the profane , the intemperate , the licentious , the disbeliever ; how it is abhorred by the good and loved by the wicked , deprecated in the prayers of the one and praised in the profaneness of the other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rottenness , he will be disappointed , shocked , ap* palled , and give up either his office , or his honesty . He must either leave its ministry as the ministry of spiritual death , or go on in that ministry with a seared conscience . The experience of our author , illustrates also our great responsibility in forming our opinions and adopting our principles . Licentiousness of opinion , where thought and expression are free , is very common . Men are fond of saying , " I 'll think as I please . " rJ ? hey should remember , that they think under responsibility to God for their opinions , and the results of their opinions ; that they think under the inevitable and solemn obligation to think right . Mr. Smith early imbibed a prejudice against the doctrines of the cross , and adopted the sentiments of Universalism . This prejudice , these sentiilcients , led him to labor twelve years in the ministry of ruin which Satan commenced in Eden-*  --  to devote twelve years of the best portion of his life to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of error , more fatal perhaps than any other to the souls of men . Gladly now , in his repentance , would he make any sacrifice to blot out the effects of those labors , and save the souls whom he has ruined . Yet all this time he verily thought that he was declaring the truth . Why ? Because blinded by false views and principles . Oh , it is a fearful thing , it involves fearful guilt , to have a perverted conscience , a conscience so distorted as to harmonize with error . In this distortion and perversion of conscience by false opinions and principles , is often concentrated in one dark point , the guilt of a long series of crimes , in the adoption of the wrong opinion , that he " ought to do many things contrary to Jesus of Nazareth " - an opinion adopted by obeying his Jewish pride and prejudice , by shutting his eyes against the clear light which revealed God manifest in the flesh , and the divine authority of the religion of Jesus-was concentered the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of violence , imprisonment , and murder , carried on against the saints . The awful guilt of the infidel  --  the guilt of a life of rebellion against the Son of God , denying his authority , rejecting // his mercy , and trampling on his blood-is concentered in his infidelity , in that false opinion as to the truth of the Bible , which he has so wilfully adopted , and which by necessity leads to , indeed involves , such a life , flow great then is our responsibility , in forming our opinions and adopting our principles ! How carefully should we attend to the truth , searching for it as for hid treasures ! How free should be our minds from prejudice , and pat*tiality , and obstinacy ! Yet how common are these faults among men , especially with respect to divine truth . The intimate connexion between falsehood in principle and criminality in action , should lead all to beware how they tamper and trifle with the truth , especially religious truth . But the most important lesson taught by this work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which especially we commend it to public attention  --  the bad moral tendency and results of Universalism . We think the volume fitted , on this account , to produce a salutary effect on those in the community , ( and they are more numerous than is of . ten thought , ) who are more or less skeptical on the subject of eternal punishment . We wish it might be read attentively by them all . We ask them to look at the nature of the two systems , of the one which denies , and of the one which affirms , future retribution , and at their comparative bearing on human virtue and happiness ; to consider , how the one lacks all adequate sanctions wherewith to enforce the duties of life , while the other brings the whole weight of two eternal worlds-a world of bliss and a world of woe  --  to press upon man during every hour and moment of his probation , to urge him on to holiness . We ask them to look at the actual results of the former system as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an eye-witness of them , and knows whereof he affirms , and then to say whether a system , which tends to produce , and does in fact produce , such fruits , can be from God , or can be true . We have occasionally met , with men , and men of by no means inferior intellect , who declared their belief that the system which denies eternal retribution is true , and the system which affirms eternal retribution is false , who yet acknowledged , that the latter is , and the former is not , " a good thing for the people . " But is not this a palpable inconsistency ? Does not the fact which they admit flatly contradict their belief ? Is it so , that falsehood is better " for the people " than truth ? Has God so formed the mind , that moral corruption and degradation follow the belief of the truth , and moral soundness and elevation the belief of error ? Must we believe a lie in order to be virtuous and happy ? These men acknowfedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success is obtained by , and in proportion to , conformity to truth . They can show no good reason why , in the department of ethics and religion , truth should not be as beneficent , and error as injurious , as in the departments of natural science and human industry . They must be compelled to admit as honest men , tInt truth is universally the friend , and error universally the foe of man ; and therefore , that that system of faith , which in the highest degree promotes human virtue and happiness , is *rue ; while those *. which are unfriendly to human virtue and happiness , are false . We doubt not , that the reader of this work who thus judges , will c9nclude that the doctrine of eternal retribution is " from above , " and its denial " from beneath ; " and that there is no declaration more true and important , than that the wicked " shall go away into everlasting punishment , hut the righteous into life eternal .
