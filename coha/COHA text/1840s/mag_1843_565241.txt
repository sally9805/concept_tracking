txt AFTER the close of his very long and studious life , the venerable theologian and preacher of Franklin , now appears before us , addressing us in these his collected works . We hear ; we judge ; and placed between the dead and the living , in faithfulness to both would we speak . Indiscriminate praise , indiscriminate censure , never true , ever betrays a prejudiced judge ; and will not receive approbation , either in the assembly of the departed just , or from the honest and conscientious among the living . What then shall we say of Emmons ? Where shall we place him among preachers and theologians ? Without entering into particular comparisons , not assigning ourselves the task of fixing precisely the elevation he holds among departed worthies , we will rather summon our readers before his works ; and as we pronounce on these testimonies our particular decisions , give them the opportunity to judge . Well , here are the works before us , in six volumes octavo ; neatly bound and lettered ; affording the best evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill in their preparation . We like this care and good taste in the style of getting up valuable books . A book we hold to be a little more readable , whatever its intrinsic contents , when the form and outward dress , the clear and open face of the page , the distinct and pure articulation of the print , represent the absent or the dead , while communicating to us their thoughts , in something of the vividness and beauty of the living and visible orator . A well executed editorial arrangement of matter too , has always the charm about it , and the cleverness , of an escape from a chaos into the regularity of a well ordered creation . The contents of any work , how* The Works of NATHANAEI . EMMONS , D. D. , late Pastor of the church in Frankun , Mass. , with a Memoir of his Life . Edited by Jacob Ide , U. D. Boston : published by Crocker &amp; Brewster , JS42. // ever , are the main things ; and if these are high in merit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will receive attention . They will not fade from the understanding . They will live , in their impress on the age . What shall we say , then , of the contents of these volumes ? Much of the matter , indeed , has already been spread before the public . The preachers and theologians , now on the stage of active life , have had access , from their youth , to many of these sermons ; and whether all have read them or not , their rays have been diffused , more or less directly , on all , who-excuse the illustration-have revolved , if not as primaries around the central body , as secondaries around the primaries . These volumes contain , beside the Sermons of Emmons and an Autobiography , a Memoir by the editor , and Reflections of a Visitor , by Prof. E. A. Park . The Memoir presents a very clever account of the peculiar character and habits of the man , the scholar , and divine ; and the few prominent occurrences of a personal , domestic , or parochial nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old age , was passed , with uniform regularity , in the study of one long cherished domicil , and in labor for one ever constant and beloved people . The Reflections of a Visitor , to be appreciated , must be read ; and when read , can not fail to be appreciated . And who can spend an hour more pleasantly or profitably , than to visit the study of a keeneyed , New England veteran in theology , long conversant with th' social , political , and religious world , and hear him give out , in brilliant apothems , the precepts of practical wisdom ; and see him smite , with the quick-sprting , pointed shafts of wit , the follies of his age or profession . The Autobiography , in its modesty and unpretending plainness , is truly worthy of a great mind ; and in those respects it may well put to the blush the high-wrought diaries of inward experience , which some , it is to be apprehended , substitute for more visible and tangible excellence , and by which too , we fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the pretext of celebrating the Divine goodness . The Sermons of Dr. Emmons are strikingly clear and instructive ; and the strictly logical method in which he ever advances in his reasonings , carries all , who concede to him his premises , unfailingly with him to his conclusions . If there are a few points in the statement of some doctrines which we can not adopt as true , yet these points are so obviously peculiar and hard to be digested , that we do not apprehend their becoming very current among the body of the faithful or their teachers ; while , on the other hand , there is in them so much of deep and permanent instruction , which is valuable to the Christian in his duties and trials , and awakening to the impenitent in their guilt and danger , that , we trust , they will live to instruct and impress other generations . " The audiences who heard Emmons , " said a sagacious critic , a quarter of a century ago , " have heard more truth , and are better instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heard Davies and Witherspoon ; and , " he adds , " I frankly declare , that I would as lief be thought the writer of the sermons of Emmons , as of Watts or Baxter , Hall or Fuller , Sherlock or Tillotson , Saurin or Claude , Bossuet or Bourdalue . " There are those indeed who , looking at his sermons as they would at specimens of the fine arts , affect to turn away in disgust from this one single and ever-repeated model of writing ; and demand more of the variety and freshness of the various // departments of the literary world , before they can accord to him the praise of good writing . Emmons , say they , wrote nothing hut sermons , and these , after one pattern only . Well , we commend him for sermon-making-for adhering to his proper business as a preacher , and not turning aside to the business of book-making and publishing . And whether there is as much of literary excellence in a sermon , well written , as in novels , history , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet we know that men are of different temperaments , and have different gifts ; and in order that each one may exercise his gifts in the church to edification , there must be diversity of operations . One may write his sermons after this pattern , and another after that , and a third still may have his own way ; yet among models and patterns , with their res1 ective excellences , one may be the more excellent way . We have chosen , however , in the present article , to look at Emmons as the theologian , rather than the preacher ; and to estimate his influence upon the theology of New England . We refer not to the number or weight of those persons who have imbibed nil his peculiar views , and who may be called , in a good sense , his paALans ; hut rather , to those traces which his firm and bold hand , guided by his clear and discriminating mind , has left on the theology of his times . The theology of the Congregationalists of New England has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , statement , and proof of divine truth , as a system ; a system , harmonious in its parts and in its relation to all truth ; a system , consonant with the dictates of reason and revelation ; a system , which furnishes the deep and immovable basis of all true knowledge , and right feeling and practice on the subject of religion It has not been biblical : at least in the sense of adopting only the forms of statement contained in the Bible ; yet who , in arranging the contents of the Bible into a connected and dependent system of truth , ever thought of expressing the whole in the words and phrases alone of the vernacular translation ? But that it has not diligently sought the contents of the Bible , or that it has not succeeded so far , at least , as to arrive at its great doctrines , we will not admit . Yet , in respect to the narration , fhe poetry , the epistolary correspondence , the forms of composition , the diversities of style , the nice shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the external history , which characterize the Bible as a book , it has not , we admit , been so studious , as thorough scholarship in Scriptural criticism and interpretation would demand ; as would enable the preacher to be the expert expositor of portions of Scripture , as well as the thorough handler of distinct topics of truth ; or as would best serve the theologian in gathering all , and exactly , the texts which give their attestation on any particular part of divine truth . Yet in the latter respect , in which alone the doctrinal is concerned , New EngThnd , for aught we see , stands , in us past history , on as high an elevation as her nearest kindred , her Presbyterian contemporaries , ( to say nothing of other denominations ; ) all alike having their proof-texts furnished to hand , in the confession of the Westminster Assembly . The fact is , the means of thorough biblical learning were not in the possession of our fathers . The private study and small library of the country minister , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atic questions of his teacher , his sole chart in theology . Yet in introducm a more thorough system of theological education into our country , the Co#igrcgationalists took the Jan. // lead ; and we can now point to one of the indomitable sons of New England who , thirty years since , first erected the standard of biblical studies on the hill of Andover , and who , boldly facing the prejudices of the times , succeeded to effect an entire change , and still lives to enjoy the wide-spread fruit of his labors , and receive the honor of two hemispheres . Nor has the theology of New England been historical . Her sons have ever been trained to minister at the altar , as the freemen of the Lord ; who were never in bondage to any man or set of men , and who , in their independence , stand respon*ible alone to their Master in heaven , and , subordinately to him , to the individual churches over which they labor ; never allowing to the traditional documents of men the weight of independent evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their theological writings , or in their preaching ; always , in assent , ing to formulas of doctrine , taking them for the substance rather than the expression , and employing them for symbols of fellowship , which mark the mere outlines of a common habitation in faith and polity , and not for complete summaries of all theological knowledge ; not as the Ultima Thule of discovery ; not as the eternal ocean barrier , staving off all further progress with the decree , Hucusque . The proofs are abundant in the unshackled freedom of debate , that has ever marked the discussions of our fathers in their assemblies , their published pamphlets and magazines . The theology of New England , as we said , has been distinguished as the systematic . We intend not , by this statement , that her preachers , when in the pulpit , confine themselves to the mere science of theology for it has been eminently true of them , as a class , that they have made the science subservient , not only to the instruction of their flocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practical religion . Indeed , in the invariable and necessary relation of doctrine *o right experience and practice , is to be found the true secret of the intense study of her orthodox theologians . They have earnestly sought the truth of God , as that which best serves them to minister , at the altar and in the sanctuary , unto edification ; to define the nature of gracious affections , and mark out the limits of practical duties ; to discriminate between the counterfeits and pretexts which sustain a false hope , and the marks and evidences which ascertain the true ; to separate , in their audiences , the believer from the unbeliever , the saint ' from the sinner , with a clearness to carry conviction to the conscience ; to urge the one class to turn instantly from their evil ways unto the Lord , and lead the other forward in the way of holiness and life , with all the appropriate motives that can be gathered from the boundless field of divine truth . Emmons , true to the principles of the fathers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever strenuous to maintain , that a systematical knowledge of the Gospel is as necessary in order to form a plain , practical , and profitable preacher , as to form a consistent , thorough , and deep divine . " And if any one would seek after the great object , which held the deeply logical and metaphysical theologians of New England intent on the study of divine truth , he will find it , in the power they thus secured to their instructions in the pulpit-in their increased ability to make their hearers understand , admit , and feel the force of that truth . Nor can a better view of the rationale of their practice in the pulpit be presented , than is given in the volnines before ns , in the sermons entitled the Wise Preacher and 1ational Preaching . // We are aware that the cry of met. aphysics and metaphysical preach . ing has been raised agaiQst Emmons and many of the Congregationalists ; as if their pastors and teachers , many of them at least , had , with mistaken views of their office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology , and as if they had substituted their own thoughts and reasonings in the j ) lace of revelation . True , as a body , they aimed to instruct as well as exhort and rebuke ; and deemed it important to be precise in stateroent and conclusive in reasoning , as well as vivid in description or fervid in appeal . For this cause they were often noted , like Emmons , for adhering to those principles of logic and metaphysics which lie at the basis of all sound instruction and doctrine . They were not content to criticise the language and settle the meaning of a text of Scripture merely , but considered the substance of the declaration , when ascertained , as a truth , which , unless a matter of pure revelation , like the Trinity , could be commended to the conscience both of believer and unbeliever as true ; and they handled it as such , by referring , not merely to a string of Scriptural declarations to show that by correct interpretation they assert or imply the same thing , hut also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or which revelation teaches , to show that the truth in question necessarily follows , as a logical consequence , from such premises , and that men can not escape from it and the Scriptural testimony which asserts it , without contradicting the dictates of their own reason and conscience . This is to hold the mind of others to the truth , i'n the only lawful or successful way ; whether in the pulpit or out of the pulpit , whether in addressing believers in revelation or unbelievers . To reproach this method as metaphysical , and as spinning arguments out of on*'sown head , is far more easy than to show what , in order to convince men , a religious teacher is to substitute in the place of conclusive argument ; or how , in using such argument , he is to proceed without tasking his own thinking powers . Paul before the heathen at Athens ; Paul before the Jews at Antioch ; Paul writing to Christian converts at Rome and Galatin , is the logical reasoner , the profound metaphysician , the close thinker ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divested of the apostolic office and the guidance of inspiration , would follow out the arguments he has left , or imitate his manner in stating and defending the system of divine truth , they are to reason closely and conclusively , and to think intently that they may so reason . But we are not pretending that the preacher should act merely as the teacher and defender of truth , nor is there any occasion to vindicate the Congregational preachers of New England from the charge * " Numbers there are who defcnd the doctrines of grace by a constant appeal to chapter and verse ; ' and they do well . At the same time it will not be pretended , that this is the only mode by which truth may be stated and defended . " " Science , falsely so called , ' has been a means of perverting the simple truths of the Gospel ; * * * * but it is also an undeniable fact , that false interpretations of Scripture have corrupted the school ' * of moral philosophy . " " To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure Gospel were in danger , isa weakness , to which a reflecting mind might be expected to rise superior . " - WILLIAMS 'S Essay on the Equity of Divine Government . " Many of the moderns have * * thrown abundance of contempt and raillery upon the very name of metaphysics ; but this science " **is so necessary to a just conception , solid judgment , and jest reasoning on many subjects , that sometimes it is introduced as a part of logic , and not without reason . And those who utterly despise and ridicule it , either betray their own ignorance , or will be supposed to make their wit and banter a refuge and excuse for their own laziness. " *-WA'rTs 's Logic . // of inculcating nothing but a mere belief in the system of divine truth . The elder and younger Edwards , Bellamy , Smalley , Strong , Dwight , though in their preaching powerful and expert , as reasoners , to establish truth , ever aimed to reach the hearts and lives of their hearers ; using God 's truth not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instruction in righteousness . Nor can this be denied of Hopkins , Spring , and Em mons , who , in some respects , advanced beyond the commonly received and admitted theology of the Congregationalists . Emmons , by far the clearest of all in statement , the most transparent and easy in style , the most sternly severe in logical order and method , is never content to lehve his position merely as true , and established as such by his reasonings : but at the close , standing behind the impregnable breastworks of the truth , he ever scads , with unerring aim , his pointed arrows to the conscience and the heart ; in other words , availing himself of such plain and necessary inferences from the established truth as serve to refute error , to reveal the state of men 's hearts to themselves , to alarm the careless and unbelieving , and comfort believers , and to urge the one to immediate repentance and the other to progress in the Christian life . But we must return to the science of theology which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been regarded and pursued as the deep and only effective source of all true religious experience and correct practice . The creed of the orthodox Congregational churches has ever been , for substance of doctrine , that which is expressed either in the Westminster or Savoy Confessions , or in the Articles of the Church of England ; embracing , on the great subject of divine grace , the doctrines which have been usually called the Calvinistic . In upholding and defending this system , in applying it to men for the purposes of redemption , the Calvinistic theologians were early called to encounter strenuous opposition , not only from unbeliev. ers but from other bodies of professed Christians ; and in their own history , have been called to witness some of the practical errors that have been engrafted on the system or arisen out of it . The independent spirit of the New England Pu . ritans ever led them to reject the authority of hierarchy in every form ; all her ministers at the altar , and all the members of her churches , bowing only to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking all truth , not from popes , councils , or the fathers , but , in the true spirit of Protestantism , from the Bible alone . They consented to dwell together in the old manor of Calvinism , not because it particularly pleased C&amp;lvin or was a model of his devising-for each of her ministers considered himself on a level with Calvin , having access , as he had , to the immediate sources of truth  --  but because they believed it to be constructed after the divine pattern and model , at least in all its grand compartments ; and that , in it , they could dwell together , in essential unity and fellowship , as the house of God . Yet the building of the sixteenth century , rapidly put up and in troublous times , it might be expected , the lapse of centuries or the constant inspection and trial of freeborn heirs would give occasion , if not to remodel and reconstruct , at least to repair and improve , in some of the materials found to be defective , or some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences of opinion whenever a change was proposed ; and some controversy might arise , in the house , between those , who would venerat.e the precise form of the old step-stone or architrave of the entrance , and those , who saw a change in them to be more conve // nient and symmetric*tl ; yet they generally consented to live together still in the mansion , as one resting on the right foundation , and built after the model of the truth . It was only those who wandered after a new site and a new foundation , and sought to change the model of the superstructure , who ventured to erect for themselves the cold and shelterless abode of Unitarianism , or the sin-licensed house of Universalism , that were stricken from the communion of the body . The system of the orthodox faith embraces , as its strong and clear outlines , the doctrine of the total depravity and the condemnation of all who are in Adam ; that of justification only through the righteousness of Christ the iRedeemer ; that of renovation and sanctification and preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of the purposes of God as to all his works and all their results in time and eternity . In upholding and defending these great and essential outlines of the system of divine truth and grace , it is easy to see that subordinate and minor statements , made in the Institutes of Calvin , or in the extended formula of the Westminster Assembly , might be imperfect and defective ; that statements made in one aspect of truth , when considered in other relations , might be not so precise and guarded as is necessary to the complete harmony of all tru'th ; and that time and trial-either by means of practical errors which should be found to shelter themselves under any of these statements , or through the light which continued and increasing investigation into every department of knowledge , should throw on the whole connected system of truth-might lead to improvement by the substitution of statements more discriminating , more precise , and more obviously in harmony with universal truth . Were we now to survey the broad field of Protestant Christendom since the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversies , many errors , and many advances in science and knowledge which have had an influence , under the providence of the Head of the Church , in advancing on the whole , the science of all sciences , that of the system of theology in the precise statement and arrangement of its various parts . Yet we look rather to the field of New England , that soil of the Puritansthe men of clear and piercing intellects and of honest and indomitable will-where devoted attachment to the cause of Christ and his church , and deep reverence for God and his truth , if any where , have marked those who minister at the altar , and who act as the defenders and teach* ers of divine truth . Here , the theologian , like Edwards , and Bellamy , and Emmons , is not the mere reader of other men 's statements on the subjects of theology ; not the committer , by rote , of human formulas , nor the beggarly wearer of the second-hand and cast-off clothing of human predecessors . He is the disciple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own powers to the work of investigation , and going with those powers to the right sources of knowledge ; seeking after the teaching of God in his word and in his works , and , before this high authority , searching and testing all the teachings of his fellow servants . He is the disciple , learning the truth of God from God ; and from such thorough discipleship in the investigation of divine truth at its high sources , qualified to teach that truth to others , in the clear statements and on the firm grounds which characterize his own faith , and constitute it a living faith in God . Two errors have been found to take shelter under the statements of Calvin , the discussion of which has led the theologians of New England , // a we believe , to advance the orthodox system of theology to a better state , or to a more precise conformity with truth . The Calvinistic statements were taken as a shelter for the erroneous doctrine of such an utter passivity of human nature , as to divest man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all capacity for it , and also as to throw the whole concern of redemption in its accomplishment in the individual , upon the simple efficiency and activity of God . Here then , with no responsibleness on the part of the individual , as to belief in God , repentance of sin , or faith in the Mediator , a division was s*ruck at once between those who resQlved to do something in the matter , and those who would do nothing . The Arminian hyper-Calvinist sought , by a circuitous route , to lay himself as a mere passive recipient , by the pool of ordinances , and wait , in his sleeping and waking hours , for some strange operation and efficacy to be instilled into the means ; and thus was exposed to linger ever as a careless or a fitful seeker , and never rise up to do the will of God heart . ily , as his servant in the earth . The Antinomian hyper-Calvinist , on the other hand , would not offer such a bait to his own pride and sense of merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort , to do any thing ; but , simply and passively , acquiesce in seeing himself the inactive material on which grace alone was to work , and get to itself all the glory . Now though either error had some important truth incorporated with it , there was wanting an element of truth , which the Calvinistic system in its particular statements did not supply , or , at least , bring forward in that clearness and with that just relation to the main truths , which has been done by the theologians of New England . Nor do we doubt that they who at once forsook the whole system , the Unitarians-after all due allowance is made for the natural hatred of men towards unwelcome truth-owe half their revolt to the seen and felt untruthfulness of the triangular rock of hyperCalvinism , and of each of the courses taken by the parties who separated and filed off at its base . Edwards , in his attempt to show the freedom of the will to be consistent with that necessity which is predicated of it in the Calvinistic scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man and the universal obligation of the law of God ; Bellamy , in storming the citadel of Antinomianism , and entering it triumphantly with the broad banner of no evangelical faith without holiness , or hearty obedience to the law of God ; the younger Edwards , in presenting the atonement as a moral means in distinction from redemption as the final result , and in giving it , ns a means , that universal relation to man which involves his obligation to accept of it at once , with penitence and humble gratitude , as a free gift : these all have done something for theology , which every discriminating and pious pastor , as well as studious and independent theolo5ian , can not but regard as improvement , and as adding that truthfulness to the parts of the system which he would never consent to throw overboard or exchange for the previous state of things  --  the status ante belium . What , then , shall we say of Emmons ? Harmonizing , in his philosophy , with the Cartesian  --  the denier of finite substance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the sole immediate source of each thought , act , event , quality ; and presents the x *orkings of Providence as effecting alike , by immediate efficiency , the hatred of the malicious and the love of the benevolent , the impenitence of sinners and the holiness of Christians , the blasphemy of the fiend and the ecstasy of the seraph . It is a high // and a fearful philosophy , that so annihilates and swallows up all being in God , as that , did we not by consciousness necessarily rely on ourselves as existent beings , we might sound in vain amid its depths , to find any footing for ourselves , our duties and responsibilities , or our hopes . Yet this theologian , put into the immediate hands of God the constitution of all things , in the general laws which he believed the Deity to have affixed to himself in his own operations ; and therefore he did not in fact deny that constitution of created things on which knowledge , appeal , obligation , and moral duty and responsibility are founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the theologians of New England : but few individuals being found to follow him fully into the scheme of immediate efficiency . They have as a body , admitted the existence of a constitution in created things , which constitution , as apparent in the starry heavens and the globe , and in the mineral , vegetable , animal , and moral kingdoms , is a reality and the cause , ground , or occasion , under the providence of the Creator , of the events which take place in all , except in cases of miracle or of special Divine agency in regeneration . Yet Emmons , in connection with his philosophy , has brought forward the scheme of responsibility for voluntary exercises only , or , " the exercise scheme , " with such force and clearness , as forever to have established this point in theology-that all holiness and sin in the creation , lies in the voluntary action of moral beings . If he admitted nothing to exist in such beings but intellectual and voluntary actions , and therefore could not on his own scheme place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring evidence he ever holds before us of the truth of his position , so meets all the demands of reason and conscience and reve lation as to force us to admit its truth ; and , also , to acknowledge that , if there is an existent constitu. * tion of being in man , that constitution itself , by whatever causes affected , or whatever it may itself affect as a cause , is not to be ever accounted the substance or matter of holiness or sin . More than this . In passing over the field of theology with this principle , he has shown that the sin of Adam could not be directly imputed to his posterity as theirs , or be made the immediate ground of their condemnation . If he were then asked why the sin of Adam entailed depravity on his posterity , he answered , not on the g*ound of any law imposed on him in Eden , which directly inflicted death on them for his sin , but simply on the ground of the divine constitution , that if Adam sinned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . Here too they who , rejecting the immediate efficiency scheme , believe in the created physical , mental , and moral constitution of man , can point to the constitution of Adam , as a thing e*ristent prior to the imposition of the law in Eden ; that constitution of man , as male and female , which placed Adam at the head of a race , which were to be affected in their constitution by the laws of descent , by which natural laws-as we have since learned from the resultswhen he sinned against the moral and positive law of Eden , and thus vitiated his own natural and moral constitution , he inflicted , by consequence , evil on that of his posterity . This original donation to Adam of being the natural head of a race , like the donation of physical strength , or like that of moral influence through the faculty of speech or the exhibition of example , was a trust , lodged with him for good or evil to others according to his voluntary course of conduct : on the plain principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no such thing as responsibil-. // ity , or good or evil conduct , and that the increase of a trust only extends the sphere of responsibility and the power of doing good or evil . Yet , what result , precisely , physical , mental , or moral , would arise to his posterity from his conduct , through the natural and original laws of propagation and descent , could be learned only in the sequel , by deduction from the facts , unless made known beforehand by immediate revelation . Dr. Emmons justly contends that the revelation made to Adam of the consequences to arise from transgression is confined , so far as we have any reason to assert , simply to personal death for the personal violation of the moral and positive law under which he and his partner were put upon trial , to test their own fidelity . It is true , the natural laws , already established in the constitution of created things , and , of course , in that of these heads of the race , unless suspended by miracle or annihilated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . But did the law , published to Adam in Eden , originate them ? or did it , even , reveal what would be their re-sults ? Did that law promise the pair , that if they continued holy during any particular period of time , they would ever after be confirmed in holiness and happiness ; or did it leave them simply under law , without gratuitous covenant respecting the future  --  the engagement of law , that while obedient , and while continuing to do the things contained in the law , and on that simple tenure alone , they should go on to enjoy peace ane life in God 's kingdom ? Did it state whether , if all their immediate children were horn while they continued holy , these children should be holy at the first ; or , what is more remote , that they should ever continue holy , and transmit again the same inheritance to their immediate descendants , and these again to theirs , and so perpetually ? Did it state what consequences would arise , if they should continue holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin before the other half were begotten ? Did it state whether , if Adam should transgress at the first , the evil consequences would go beyond himself ? Or does the fact , which has been since learned , that the sin of his whole posterity is a consequence of his transgression , show at all that sin might not have broken out somewhere in his race and gone forward with its de . structive consequences , even if he had not sinned ? Are any of these things revealed in the positive precept and penalty given in Eden ? Or have we any ground to assert that Adam had any direct revelation , of consequences to arise from his holiness or sin , before the enaction of that law , or aside from its publication ? If not , then , not that positive law , but the natural laws already and previously affixed to the constitution of Adam and Eve , are those by which the Creator gave them the station of heads of the race-heads who incur no immediate good or ill desert upon their children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come after them , to what extent , as is true of every instance in which entrusted power is employed to its right end or is abused , the sequel only is to show . They were held to the right use of their own trustto secure whatever good consequences to others were to result from their continuing obedient-under the bonds and penalties of their own eternal death in case of failure . Here was the protection of law thrown over the interests entrusted with these persons ; here was a trial made of their own character ; here , the righteous exaction of justice ; here , personal duty and personal responsibility laid on the only existent beings : and that was enough . But they sin ; and the sequel-. 1843.1 119 // what is it ? Not only are they condemned by the Judge , but the race which springs from Adam are seen to be vitiated in their constitution so as to render sure their own sin and condemnation , as the experience of all ages and the word of revelation attest : and the respite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present life before the execution of punishment , is made the occasion of a new dispensation , better than law-of a covenant by promise , through the Redeemer , of deliverance and life to the penitent and believing . Now in tracing out this broad field of depravity and redemption through Christ , Dr. Emmons carries the principle most convincingly of the voluntary and active nature of all sin and holiness . And nothing is wanting , in our view , to complete forever the harmony of the principle with all the facts , but the simple admission of an agent constituted to act in a holy or sinful manner , and whose constitution may be so affected by the laws of descent , or by special influences from God , as to become the ground or occasion of the certainty of-as the case may be-either sinful action or holy . The theologians of New England have generally admitted an existent constitution of being in man ; but , until the time of Emmons and the clear exposition he gave of his principle , they were confounding constituti*nal tendency with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both were included in the matter of sin or holiness , and in the desert of praise or blame . In the collision of the two clashing parties , they who held to an existing constitution in man as furnishing a ground or occasion of the certainty of action , or as being a subject of deterioration or improvement in the course of action , had clearly the advantage of Emmons , who could look to no created forces in operation , but saw only the divine hand ; and to no laws impressed on created forces , but to a pattern secreted in the Di* vine mind . They , when speaking of the grounds of human sinfulness , of the adaptation of revelation to the nature of man , of the immediate agency of God in miracles , of the peculiar influence of the Holy Spirit as distinct from creation or miracle , of the imperfection and internal conflicts of the saints-had most clearly the advantage . The material was present in their sys. tem which gave consistency and harmony to these facts . But when these same theologians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category of holiness or sin , desert of reward or blame , they introduced an item into the account which the logical acumen of Emmons has succeeded , we trust , forever to efface . With his princi ? ple-nothing but voluntary action , holiness or sin  --  and the clear fount dations of the principle exposed in the divine requirements , and the truth and justice of placing respon* sibleness only within such limits , he shows that they are introducing an item into their systems at war with these plain and glaring facts of the holy and righteous moral government of God . Nothing remained , therefore , at this posture of the subject , to give clearness and harmony to all the parts of theology , but for the theo* logian to admit a basis and footing for natural ability of right action , and for a certainty of either right or wrong action as external or internal causes might operate , in the nature and constitutio of man ; and , at the same time , to consider the sin and holiness of man as consisting alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or life . Now the way was clear to consider as existent in man , and in all moral beings in the universe , a reality-in distinct tion from a mere plan in the mind of God as to his own efficient ope* rations  --  a constitution of inherent // powers of intelligence , feeling , and will ; which powers , though fitted for right action , might be variously affected from diverse causes ; might be weakened and impaired , or strengthened and improved ; might be more or less depraved in their tendency to wrong action , or more or less corrected in their tendency to right ; from causes , too , without the being himself , as well as from his own course of voluntary actions ; from causes for which he is not responsible , as well as from those for which he is . With this clear distinction drawn between the powers of the being on the one hand , and his voluntary course of action on the other , the way was clear to harinonize the two grand facts of dependence on God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great departments of the providential government of God and his moral ; to represent the certain futurition of all events in the moral kingdom of God , as arising from the wisest arrangement of means on his part to secure the greatest amount of holiness and blessedness , in full consistency with his own sincerity , righteousness , and holiness , and with the good or ill desert of his subjects ; to set forth the great facts , stated in the system of grace now in operation over man-of the fall of Adam , the original and total depravity of the race , their insufficiency to recover themselves , the atonement of Jesus , the call of the Gospel , the influence of the Spirit employed as the means of recovery , the renovation and sanctification of the people foreknown and chosen in this eternal plan of operations , the hardness and destruction of the rest-as consistent , throughout , with the grand close of the drama  --  the summoning of the whole race before God the Judge at the last day , and his awarding to each a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deeds in this life while in the body . We trust , therefore , that Emmons , whose pure , intellectual ray was so long shining above our horizon , and who has left , in the volumes before us , so many interesting records of that piercing intellect in its researches in the wide field of theology , has performed , during his stay among us , some service for the science ; to give clearness to the views of its teachers who minister to the instruction and hopes of their Christian brethren at the sacred altar . His mission has not been in vain , were it marked only with this one deep trace on the theology of the times . Many a servant oC Christ has thereby felt his way clear to apostolic simplicity , in calling on sinners to repent and turn in their hearts unto God at once , unshackled by doctrinal hindrances and perplexities . The tide has , long since , set that way ; and great is the company of the preachers , and wider and wider is the circle becoming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in bestowing salvation , and his demand on every sinner immediately to repent , with a sincere and understanding hcart , and with a free and unfaltering tongue . The stickler for old technics and the pugnacious defender of every word and comma of an ancient formula may , for a while , scare the weak , by crying out heresy and brandishing the knife of excision ; but even he and his servile followers are destined to give way before the clear shining of truth , and the swelling current of holy love that is bearing onward the free in Christ , to hastemi the world 's redemption.
