txt OF all the manifold devices supplied by the ingenuity of men to promote the progress of civilization , the idea of a National Post Office stands in the foremost ranks of importance . The social want which it proposes to supply is so obvious and apparently so inseparable from a state even in the least degree advanced beyond that of a primitive and pastoral people , that we might naturally seek for the date of its first realization among the earliest annals of nations . Its existence , even in an imperfect and incipient form , is nevertheless assignable to a comparatively late epoch , nor did it attain any development commensurate to its importance , until the last half century . Indeed , it is only in these , our own times , that its full capabilities seem likely to be manifested . One cause , perhaps the principal one , of the slow progress of this great social institution towards maturity , has been its intimate dependence on other arts of life , and intermediately on the mechanical discoveries and inventions by which these arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transcendently the most important of these , was the art of transportation by land and water ; an art which continued in a state of relative imperfection until the genius of Watt , Fulton , Trevithick and Stephenson created the Steam Engine , and bade that omnipotent machine to carry the ship in triumph over the wide waste of waters , laughing to scorn the opposing elements ; to transport the barge against the streams of the gigantic Mississippi and its interminable tributaries , of the Rhine , the Thames and the Ganges , and to give wings to the chariot and waft it with the speed of the wind over paths where lately the Red man alone roamed , and the beast of the forest had its lair . So curiously dove-tailed is the artificial system of human society , so complex is the reticulation by which the wants and wishes of our race are supplied and gratified , that scarcely any branch of art can be seriously affected in its progress without producing a sensible influence among a multitude of others , immediately or remotely connected with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common velocity , and however admirable the theory of the Post Office , and however craving those social wants which it was designed to supply might have been , it could not be fully realized until the cognate arts had had attained correlative maturity . Correspondence by letter is a speech at a distance . It is conversation carried on between individuals separated by a space exceeding the limit of the range of the voice and the ear . Social machinery for the easy , expeditious and cheap transmission of letters is to the ear what the telescope is to the eye , with this difference : that while the one shows only the image of what is desired to be approached , the other brings to us the thing itself ; and while the one is confined in its application to physical objects , the other bears upon the social , the intellectual , the political and the commercial .

It is a penalty on commerce ; an amerceinent on the diffusion of knowledge , and a drag on the progress of civilization . It has been well said by eminent commercial authorities , that " you might as well tax words spoken upon the Royal Exchange , as the communications of various persons living at Manchester , Liverpool , and London , " and that " if there be any one subject which ought not to be selected as a subject of taxation , it is that of inter-communication by post ; and if there be any one thing which the government ought , consistently with is great duties to the public , to do gratuitously , it is the carriage of letters .

" Such are the deliberate opinions and sentiments , not of professed philanthropists , not of speculative philosophers , but of plain , practical men of business , merchants and bankers , who , from long and extensive experience , know what they speak of. * And this has been applied to a country circumscribed within limits not exceeding those of a single State of this Union , **27;1186;TOOLONG routes for the rapid and cheap intercourse of its crowded population .

Among such a people , correspondence , so desirable to all , becomes a want of imperious urgency . Now , in England , the people have risen , and with one consentaneous voice uttered their will in accents neither to be mistaken nor resisted , and extorted from an unwilling legislature and reluctant government , the most stupendous official reform of which the annals of any civilized nation can afford an example . They have , in the teeth of an obstinate resistance on the part of the Post Office department-of the aristocracy who enjoyed exemption from the burthen of postage by the franking privilege ,  --  of the press upon which the projected plan was expected to operate disadvantageously ,  - -  of the House of Commons , whose privilege was threatened to be swept away ,  - -  established a Post Office system which has multiplied , in an infinite proportion , the social advantages of the nation , which has offered a model to other countries , and which will descend to future ages as a monument of what may be effected by the spirit of a free and intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom can now transmit a packet weighing half an ounce , to any other individual , no matter how remote his position within the country , at the cost of TWO cENTs ! and by executing this service at this rate of charge , the Post Office department , after defraying all its various and heavy charges , is enabled to transfer annually to the National Treasury a regularly augmenting net revenue , the present amount of which exceeds three millions of dollars The condition of things which led to this grand reform in England , and which ultimately elicited from the people that expression of their will , which when unanimous is as irresistible under the monarchy of Britain as under our own republican institutions , was exactly similar to that which now prevails in this country . The reports and remonstrances of the Post Office department were identical even to minute particulars with those which are now issued here . The same necessity for some change was admitted , and the same resistance to a really efficient change was offered . The same enormous abuses of the franking privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expresses , the same decline of the Post Office revenue , the same abuses in the free transmission of printed papers , were all and severally the topics of vain declamation and fruitless complaint . The sympathy of the public was not on the side of the established laws , and they were , as they always will be in such cases , violated with impunity , and , as here at present , set at open defiance , Their breach was unattended with punishment , their evasion visited with no discredit . It was proved that for one * See evidence of Lord Ashburton and of Mr. Samuel Jones Lloyd , before the Postage Committee of the English House of Commons . // letter sent through the post office , ten were transmitted through cheaper hut illegal channels . Merchants and bankers of the first rank , wealth and respectability voluntarily came forward and declared that they systematically defrauded the Post Office ! that they themselves sent their letters by regular private expresses ! * In short the practice of evasion was admittcd as it is here daily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expedients of evasion were thus enumerated : - lst . By carriers or private expresses openly carrying letters . 2d . In booksellers ' parcels . 3d . In warehousemen s bales and parcels . 4th . In stagecoach parcels . 5th . In weavers ' baos in the neighborhood of the manufacturing towns . 6th . In private boxes . 7th . Under parliamentary and official franks , by parties not entitled to their use . But some devices for evasion evinced such ingenuity that they merit more especial notice . A letter in a franked envelope is sent from London to Dublin , so wafered or sealed as to be opened without tearing the cover . The individual receiving it writes another , enclosing it in the same envelope with the same address , but altering the place to some other town or city , Edinburgh for example , as though the party to whom it was addressed had departed from Dublin , thence . Being received at Edinburgh , the same envelope is again made to serve a like purpose . In this way we have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between different places . The free transmission of newspapers afforded too obvious a means of cheap and rapid communication to escape the ingenuity of the British trader . Some curious evidence on the abuse of this right was produced before the committees of parliament . It appeared that it was a common practice with commercial houses to transmit newspapers , the mode of addressing which served the purposes of the usual business communications . In such cases a system of signals was agreed upon between the correspondents , determined by the form of address inscribed on the journals which were thus used as the instruments of communication . Let us suppose for example that William Smith Jones of 516 Mark Lane , London , were the party addressed . A great variety of forms of address might be used on different occasions , such as the following William Smith Jones , 516 Mark Lane , London . William Smith Jones , Mark Lane , London . William Smith Jones , London . Win . Smith Jones , 516 Mark Lane , London . Win . Smith Jones , Mark Lane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Jones , 516 Mark Lane , London . W. S. Jones , Mark Lane , London . W. S. Jones , London . William S. Jones , 516 Mark Lane , London , William S. Jones , Mark Lane , London . William S. Jones , London . W. Smith Jones , 516 Mark Lane , London . W. Smith Jones , Mark Lane , London . W. Smith Jones , London . William Smith Jones , Esq. , 516 Mark Lane , London . &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c . Thus a simple address assumed a hundred different forms , and these forms were entered in a page of the merchant 's memorandum book , with a key , which gave them a signification , by which a corresponding variety of the most usual commercial communications were effected by their means . To inform him of the state of the market , the arrival or transmission of goods , all that was necessary was to send a newspaper with one of the above varieties of form of address , from which , by a preconcerted plan , this communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtaxed people were driven to satisfy the social and commercial wants which a healthy Post Office system should have supplied . The average postage payable at that time , on single letters , was sixpence , or twelve cents , the same which is now chargeable by the United States Post Office , nod to resist and evade which the public have resorted to like shifts and expedients . The grievances of the postage system then prevalent in England , and still pressing on the people of this country , consisted in the intolerable amount of the charge in proportion to the service performed , and in the vexatious and humiliating system of espionage to which the method of rating by single and double letters gave rise . The injustice of apportioning the amount of charge by the distance to * The I-louse of Baring &amp; Co. acknowledged before the parliamentary committee that they sent a box weekly to Liverpool , containing 200 letters , to evade the postage . // which the letters were transmitted was not perceived , and therefore formed no ground of complaint . In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developing a project for elkcting a vast Post Office revolution . It professed to demonstrate that letters might be conveyed through the Post , from one extremity of the country to the other , at the uniform rate of charging a penny per half ounce ; and that such a system would , nevertheless , yield to the state a large revenue . A project so novel and so bold , affecting a department of the public administration which party politics did not reach , would , it might be thought , have needed some great reputation to force it into notice . Had its author already been known to fame , as a statist or financier , or had he been patronized by those in high places , more or less public attention might have been expected to have been attracted towards it . But such was not the case . Its author was an unknown , obscure schoolmaster , without personal weight , consideration , or influence . " The boldness of the plan , " says a writer of that day , " was therefore likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population like that of Great Britain , whose curiosity has been palled by the fallacious hopes of advantages which have been so constantly obtruded on the public attention . No scheme , therefore , was ever promulgated with less probability of success , from adventitious causes ; and yet no scheme ever made its way in so short a time to the convictions of mankind , not only in England , but wherever a post office is to be found . In two years and a half , the theory of a private individual became the law of the land ; and France , Germany , and other countries , have since directed their efforts to avail themselves of the same principles in their own system . " The postage system of Mr. Rowland Hill , is based upon a fact first ascertained by him , which ought to be regarded as a statistical discovery of the first order , although , like many other great discove ries , when once explained , it appears so self-evident , that we are astonished at its not having . been perceived sooner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers which developed it . This important fact is , that the expense attending the dispatch and delivery of letters , by the Post Office , is practically independent of the distance to which they are transmitted , or , in other words , that the cost is the same , whether these distances are great or small . When this principle was first announced , it sounded so like paradox , not to say absurdity , that even acute minds could scarcely be prevailed on to give it serious considera. tion , and after it had been explained and demonstrated again and again , a large portion of those who were called on to act upon it , could not be got either to comprehend or to credit it . Let us see whether we can not make it intelligible . The various items into which the cost of transmitting a letter to its destination , may be resolved , consist of its reception at one post office-its sorting , stamping , and packing in the mail-bag-its transportation to the post office of the place of its address-its reception there-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed . It is also chargeable with its share of the expense of the general superintendence and management of the Post Office . Now it is evident that all those items , the cost of transportation alone being excepted , are independent of the distance to which the letter is sent , and are , therefore , the same for letters transmitted to all distances . It becomes , then , a question of the highest importance , in this inquiry , to ascertain what is the actual proportion which this cost of transportation bears to the other expenses . It appears from the published returns of the British revenue , that for the year ending 5th January , 1842 , the gross revenue of the Post Office amounted to $7,178,592 , and that the net revenue for the same year was $2,675,380 Hence we have the means of finding the total average cost of each single letter . From the gross revenue 7,1 ' 18,592 . Subtract the net revenue 2,675,380 . Remainder being the gross Post Office expenses , . . . . . 4,503,212 . Proportion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Th // distances , it follows that the actual cost of each letter to the Post Office , must have 450 been * or twenty-three thirty-sixths of a penny , very nearly . Now it was ascertained by Mr. Hill , and not disputed after full investigation , that the actual average cost of transmission per half ounce , for a distance of four hundred miles , was one thirty-sixth part of a penny . lt follows , therefore , that for letters sent to that distance , the item of transportation is one twenty-third part of the whole cost of the letter to the Post Office . Suppose then , that it be required to tax letters sent to different distances , in an equitable proportion , depending on the different expenses produced by the difference of ( distance , let us see what the result would be , Let one , A , be sent to a distance of one hundred miles , and the other , B , to a distance of four hundred miles . Cost of .11 36ths of a penny . For expenses of internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mail 04 Total cost , . . . 224 Cost of B. For expense of internal management of Post Office , For transportation by mail 22 1 23 if a revenue tax be added , it will , of course , he the same for both , so that the difference of charge which could be equitably made in favor of the letter A , to the shorter distance , would amount to three-fourths of the thirty-sixth part of a penny , or to the forty eighth part of a penny , or twenty-fourth part of a cent , precisely . It was therefore demonstrated that the only item of postage which varied in the ratio of the distance , was one of an amount so small as not to be capable of being changed in any current coin , and so minute a fraction of a farthing , as to be of no practical value to the parties ( lispatching or receiving letters . It was thus established , that no difference of charge could be fairly made for letters sent to different distances , and it was conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all letters of the same weight should be charged with the same postage . Are all letters of equal weight then , it will be asked , attended with the same expense of dispatch and delivery ? And if not , what circumstances produce the difference of expense , and how can the rates of postage be accommodated to such difference of expense ? To this , it may be replied , that the cost of the transmission of letters is governed by the same law that prevails in the cost of production of all other commodities . It is , in short , diminished in a rapid proportion with the increase of the number of letters to be conveyed . Thus , suppose that a thousand letters have to be conveyed to one city , and only one hundred to the other , the large items of internal management will have to be , in the one case , divided among a thousand , and in the other case , among a hundred letters ; and , as these items are very little affected in their gross amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the smaller mail will be greater than the cost per letter of the larger mail . If this principle were adopted , and strictly equitable rates based upon it , we should have high rates of postage to all small towns , and low rates to all great cities . Not to mention other impractibilities attending the application of such a principle of rating , it would be subject to continual variation with the varying population and commerce of each place ; but , indeed , it is sufficiently obvious , that no system , based on such a principle , could work with any good or useful effect . But the plain , practical answer to all attempts at an equitable adjustment of varying rates of postage is , that the utmost cost of transmission of letters of the weight of half an ounce is so small that no variation of it is needed , and the practical advantages of one uniform rate , for all places , are so many and great as to render it at once , easy simple , and economical to the administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of ascertaining bow far these data , respecting the mere expense of the transmission of letters , apart from the other charges of Post Office management , would he applicable to this country , we have ascertained the rates at which a parcel of the weight of one hundred pounds , would he sent by the Express Companies , to different parts of the States , with the same dispatch as the mails , and the results are as follows From .

Pittsburgh , - Buffalo , Cleveland , - St. Louis , - Mean , Cost of sending a parcel weighing 100 lbs . . $100 . 100 . 150 . 300 . 400 . 450 . . . 800 . . 500 . . . 40C . . 300 . . . 400 . . 600 . $375 Rate per half ounce .

This is double the expense of transmission in England , but it is still so minute , and bears so insignificant a proportion to the whole amount of postage which , under aay system , would be exacted , that it may be safely inferred that the rates of postage here , as in Great Britain , ought to be independent of the distance . The British system of postage , which has been established in conformity with the project of Mr. Rowland Hill , and which , with certain modifications sugrested by local circumstances , we think is destined to spread throughout the world , and , before all other countries , in our own , is characterized by the following general features 1 . A fixed rate of postage is charged by weight , independently of the distances to which the letters are transmitted . 2 . This postage is pre-paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued by the Government to the public , and affixed to the letter , such stamp having the virtue of a frank . 3 . The rate of postage is fixed so low as to destroy the abuses of evasion , &amp;c. 4 . The franking privilege is totally abolished , and with it are removed the endless abuses incidental to it . In these conditions are comprised those general features of the plan , which are indispensable to ensure such a successful result , in any country , as its advocates promise . In England , the more particular details observed in carrying it out may be stated as follows The rate fixed upon by the Legislature , for all distances within the precincts of the United Kingdom , is a penny per half-ounce , all fractions of an ounce being counted as a full letter weighing above an ounce . Thus , all letters under half an ounce weight pay one penny ; all letters above half an ounce , and not exceeding an ounce , pay twopence ; all letters above an ounce , and not exceeding two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Penny stamps are issued by the Stamp Office , coated with adhesive matter at the back , by which they are readily and permanently attached to the letter . These are sold at thirteen-and-a-half pence the dozen . The writer , however , has the option of paying the postage , according to the above rates , when the letter is delivered at the Post Office . The use of the stamp , according to these conditions , adds about thirteen per cent . to the postage , the consequence of which is , that it is not used for more than half the number of letters posted , and its omission entailg on the Post Office the salaries of the necessary number of receiving clerks . Letters may be posted without prepayment , but they are , in that case , subjected to double the above rates of postage , which are exacted on their delivery . By surrendering to this extent 204 Feb. , // the principle of pre-payment , the Administration have retained in the Post Office a part of that complexity and expensive management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) roject to remove ; and , if proof were wanting how little this contributes to the public convenience , it is found in the fact that not above five or six per cent . of all the letters posted are unpaid . Still , however small the proportion may he , machinery must he provided for its management within the Post Office . The abolition of the parliamentary franking privilege was readily acquiesced in , the low rates of the new postage rendering it valueless . The correspondence and dispatches of the various govern*nent offices pass through the Post Office , suhject to postage , which is charged to the respective accounts of these offices . The law requires all newspapers to hear a penny stamp , and this stamp carries them free through the Post Office , and may he regarded as representing their postage . All other printed papers are subject to the same rate of postage as letters . The reformed system thus organized , came into operation on the 10th of January , 1840 , and has , therefore , now been four years in operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that period , has not only defrayed all the expenses of its management , hut has yielded a gradually augmenting revenue to the State . The net amount of this revenue for the year ending 5th of January , 1841 , was , $2,322,370 ; and the net amount for the year ending 5th January , 1842 , was $2,675,380 . The average annual number of letters passing through the Post Office before the reform , was eighty-three millions . The annual number since the reform , estimated in 1841 , is one hundred and ninety-three millions , hung an increase on the former amount of 150 per cent . which increase has taken place before any full development of the new system . Considering the gradual annual increase of net revenue , and the corresponding increase of the number of letters posted , it is computed by the best British authorities that the Post Office revenue , under the penny system , will ultimately reach and even exceed its amount under the system of exorbitant rates obsolete in England , but still continued in this country . The principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modified form brought into operation in England , with the practical results ensuing , being thus before us , it remains to be considered to what extent , or with what modifications , if any , the same system can be advan'La , , eonsly adopted in this country . The United States Post Office is , in fact , an inheritance from the Government of the mother country . It has retained all its characteristic marks , and has , with a tenacity almost anomalous in the administration of this country , adhered even to the most absurd of its oldest regulations , and continued to adhere to them , after the English public , enslaved as they are to the spirit of prescription and the prestige of antiquity , has abandoned them as being out of all keeping with the spirit of the age , and inconsistent with all the principles of political economy and statistics . It is , we presume , a point so universally conceded , that a reform of a sweeping character in the organization of a * ational Post Office in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while here to discuss it . When we contemplate the transactions of the past year , in reference to the business of the Post Office , and compare them with the epoch which preceded the great reform of 1840 in the United Kingdom , we can not fail , even without further or more elaborate inquiry , to be struck with the similarity of the prognostics of disease and symptoms of unsoundness in the two institutions , and to be impressed with the persuasion that the application of the same remedies will be attended with the same beneficial results . We find here the same complaints of the enormous abuses of the franking privilege , both congressional and official-the same audacious and unblushing defiance of the laws of the land in the establishment of private enterprises for the despatch and delivery of letters  --  the same extensive evasions of the law by private individuals , adopting every conceivable device to obtain a cheaper transmission of their correspondence than the Government mail affords  --  the same absence of that rebuke from public opinion , with which the evasion , and much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these laws are of a healthy character , and in harmony with the spirit of the times . A reform is then inevitable , and the evil has been allowed to attain such a head , that half measures will be // of no avail . The public voice demands a thorough and radical cure of the grievance of the present system of postage . Other and older nations have gone before us in the path of improvement , and if the Legislature falter , it requires no extraordinary spirit of vaticination to declare , that the people will make themselves heard within the walls of the Capitol in a tone and spirit which will teach its occupants that delay or hesitation is no longer admissible . The necessity of a radical reform being then conceded , it is for the General Government and the Legislature to consider whether it be more consistent with policy and wisdom , to adopt , with suitable modifications , the system which has produced results so satisfactory to the public in Great Britain , or to adopt a new system . We can have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British people against official prejudice and legislative inertia , will be accepted and acted upon ; and , that a system , better than the British , inasmnuch as it will embrace the consistent design which , to allay the fears of some , and mitigate the opposition of others , was garbled and compromised in England , will he finally adopted in this country , and will be productive of results in the highest degree advantageous to thepublic . The first indispensable condition , which must on no account be yielded or coinpromised , is the adoption of one uniform rate within the precincts of the Union . For what reason should this great principle be surrendered ? On what rational grounds will a varying rate be established ? Not surely after what has been demonstrated by varying distance . It is proved incontestably , that the cost of dispatch and delivery , has not in practice , any variation dependent on the distance . With what justice then , should a letter from New York to New Orleans , be charged with ten cents , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five cents ? If the variation of charge be , as it ought to be if admitted at all , in proportion to the cost of the service , then certainly the charges should be exactly reversed , and the letter to Trenton should be charged ten cents , and the letter to New Orleans five cents ; the number of letters to New Orleans being greatly more than twice the number to Trenton , and the cost of dispatch and delivery , being more nearly in the inverse ratio , of the number of letters dis patched and delivered , than any other proportion . The most just variation of the postage , would be that which would press more heavily per letter on the smaller mail ; but as no one we presume , will advocate the practical application of this principle , and as no other condition of a varying rate would bear even the remotest relation to the varying cost , the principle of one uniform rate throughout the States , is recommended at once , for its simplicity , its convenience , its economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an uniform rate , the important question remains to be settled , what should be the amount of that rate . In England , as we have stated , a rate of two cents per half ounce has been found to cover all the expenses of the Post Office administration , and to yield an increasing annual revenue of above three millions of dollars ; hut it is to be considered that the inland correspondence of the United Kingdom is much greater than that of the United States , and the magnitude of the correspondence is , to a certain extent , the inverse exponent of the amount of a prudent and equitable rate ; it seems , therefore , just and expedient , that a higher standard of charge be adopted in this country . It will probably he generally admitted , that an addition of one hundred per cent . to the English rate , that is , four cents per letter , would afford us a safe standard ; but in order to allay the fears of the timid , and inspire confidence in the distrustful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would adapt itself conveniently to our silver currency , and be sufficiently large to enable the Government to include the expense of stamps , under the postage , without adding thirteen per cent . for them , as is injuriously and inconveniently practiced in Enodan we should * d . In fine , then propose , that all letters to all distances throughout the States , should be charged with postage by weight , at the rate of five cents per half ounce-fractions of a half ounce being charged as a complete half ounce . There appears to be no object in restricting the weight of letters or packets sent through the Post Office . Under this system , the charge of a dollar and sixty cents per pound , for heavy parcels , abundantly paying for their transmission ; and , indeed , the heavier the parcels , the more profitable they will be to the Post Office . A pound weight of sin0le half // ounce letters will involve thirty-two times more official labor , both in the reception and in the delivery , than a single packet would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both would he the same . The absurdity of the old established custom of charging postage , not by weight or bulk , but by the number of separate pieces of paper into which it may suit the convenience of the writer to divide his letter , is so very apparent , that we should not have thought it worth while to appropriate a single line to notice it were it not that we know that weighing less than seven grains , was written on thin paper and sent by post to the principal members of the legislature . It consisted of a piece of paper of less than three-and-a-half grains weight , enclosed in an envelope of a similar weight and size , the contents of the letter were as follows : Postage charges in 1838 . This paper , four inches by two-and-a-half , and its cover of similar size , weighs seven grains , or under the sixtieth part of an ounce weight , and is charged double postage , whilst the accompanying sheet , thirty five inches long and twenty three inches wide , weighing just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lilliputian letter of seven grains , was charged one shilling , while the large sheet of double demy having a surface of writing equal to thirty-two of the pages which the reader now holds in his hand , was charged only sixpence . This is surely the climax of absurdity , and it is scarcely necessary to add that the only nation in the world which ever practiced it besides ourselves , was the mother from whom we inherited it . She , however , even in her senility has abandoned the folly . We , without the excuse of age , without the apology of any particular respect for prescription or reverence for established usages , still obstinately cling to it . The intrinsic absurdity of this regulation is far from being the only or the strongest objection to it . It has led to some persons , and among them the Post Office officials , are wedded to it . Under this system , a letter written on a single sheet of paper , provided it be not torn in two , is chargeable only with single postage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two half sheets , the same letter consisting of the same paper , with the same writing upon it , is chargeable with double postage . When the reform of the English Post Office was in agitati*n , the absurdity of this method of rating was practically illustrated in the following manner . A double letler of the exact magnitude , when folded , of this diagram , practices as bad as those which disgrace the Post Offices of the Austrian and Italian States . Espionage in them is conducted under at least the semblance of secrecy . Here it is an imperious duty . Is it not the duty of every post master and his subordnates throughout the States to see that the letters are properly . taxed ? To do this he must see what they contain . He must spy into thempoke them open-present them to a strong light , and endeavor to see through them . If , by ingenious folding , he can not detect the suspected enclosure , he must then exercise his ingenuity to read and interpret some portion of the contents . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays on without hesitation the double tax , and if that tax be paid before the letter leaves the office , or if the letter be opened out of the presence of the postmaster , the double rate must be paid whether the letter be double or single . The process is still more insulting and outrageous if any citizen take a letter to the Office to pre-pay the postage . He presents the letter which is single , with a single postage . Hisword , however , is in this case , worthless . A clerk takes up the letter , feels it and eyes it . He presses it edgewise between his fingers , closing one eye and directing the axis of the other between its folds . If he feel zealous in his vocation , it is not beyond the limits of his discretion to insert a pencil or penholder to open the DOUBLE LETTER . // space between its leaves , and all these polite evolutions are executed in the presence and under the eye of a gentleman who has just passed him his word that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-citizens to digest this process . Next in importance to an uniform rate in proportion to weight , is the principle of pre-payment by stamp or other convenient syn*ol attached to the envelope of the letter . By this expedient every letterwriter franks his own letter . It is much more convenient than pre-paying at the post office . If you take the letter yourself , it saves the time and trouble of payment , of obtaining change , etc . If you send the letter by a servant , it protects you from their possible dishonesty in retaining the postage instead of pre-paying it . But these advantages are insignificant , compared with those which it produces in the internal arrangements of the Post Office . Tbat establishment is at once stripped altogether of its financial character , its functions being limited to the mere mechanical transmission and delivery of letters . Better evidence can not be afforded of the practical ad*rantages to be expected in the organization and operations of the Post Office itself , than by referring to the testimony of Sit Edward Lees , the secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , throughout his life , a Post Office functionary under the old system , would certainly not he likely to be subject to any extraordinary bias in favor of change , unless the change presented a certainty of great amelioration . He admitted that the system of pre-payment by stamp would necessarily be attended with " considerable saving of time in the delivery of letters ; the expenses in almost every branch of the department , but principally.in the inland and letter-carrier offices , would be much reduced ; the complex accounts of the bye and dead-letter offices greatly simplified , and the expenses greatly diminished ; and the system of accounts between the postmasters and deputy postmasters throughout the country , which presented so many opportunities , ti*cilities , and temptations for combination and fraud , would altogether disappear ; the labor and responsibility of surveyors would be curtailed by the principle of an uniform rate ; a system of complex and intricate duty , inseparable from the nature of the local and provincial post office , under the old syatem , would give way to one of simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post Office would be changed in its character , greatly contributing to the security , comfort , and advantage of the community , in its connection with the public corresliondence . " Such were the sentiments of an old and experienced Post Office functionary on the advantages of Hill 's system of postage , and the results of the experience of the last three years have abundantly proved the soundness of his judgment . A variety of devices have been suggested for facibtating the pre-payment of postage , among which may be mentioned the manufacture of a particular species of paper  --  a monoply of which is proposed to be given to the Government , under proper restrictions of price ; it is proposed , that letters written on , or enclosed in this paper go free  --  the postage being included in the price paid for the paper . These are matters of detail , however , which need not be dwelt upon here , being such as may be best adjusted in the practical organization of the system . The only branch of the Post Office business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception and delivery of letters arriving from foreign countries . These must , of course , be forwarded to their destinations , subject to the collection of postage from those to whom they are addressed , and for the reasons already explained , and on account of the labor and expense consequent on them , we should suggest , that , a double rate of inland postage be levied on them-that is to say , that they should be rated at ten cents per half ounce , independently of distance . In the management of the delivery department of the English Post Office , the postage charged upon the letter , whether pre-paid or not , has always included , both under the old and new system  --  the delivery of the letter , by the letter-carrier , at the address of the party for whom it is destined ; in this country it has been generally the practice for residents to keep boxes at the post office ; or , to apply at the delivery office for their letters . In cases where the letters are delivered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional charge of two cents has been made upon them ; a part of which is understood to constitute the salary of the letter-carrier . It may , however , be reasonably expected if in // England , a rate of two cents per half ounce pays the salaries of letter-carriers , as well as other expenses , leaving a large surplus revenue , that , in this country , a rate of five cents per half ounce , ought , in time , to entitle the public to the delivery of letters at all dwellings within the usual precincts of cities , towns , and villages , without further expense . The total abolition of the franking system is a condition indispensable to any efficient system of Post Office reform . Such a system is subject to inevitable abuses , whether it be confined to public offices or extended to members of Congress . It may , perhaps , be contended that the daily stipend allowed to members of Congress was based upon the supposition that they were to be exempt from postage on their correspondence . We answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part was an advantage not altogether unqualified ; it doubtless exposed them to much frivolous and impertinent correspondence , as well as to inconvenient solicitation and importunity for franked covers for the conveyance of the letters of parties whose correspondence should legitimately be subject to postage . Such was proved to be extensively the case before the parliamentary committee in London , and there is no good reason to suppose it otherwise in this country . The pre-paying system will exempt all members of Congress from postage on the letters they receive ; and if it be thought expedient , a fair augmentation of their daily stipend may be allowed by law to cover the probable amount of postage of the letters on public business which they may transmit . At a five cent rate , a dollar per day wouldcover the average number of twenty single letters . The correspondence of the public offices will be transmitted , as it now is , subject to the same charge as other packets , except only that its postage may stand as a matter of account between these offices respectively and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of charge , the correspondence and documents of the public offices , and yet to make the Post Office pay its own expenses , is tantamount to paying the expenses of the postage of the state by a tax levied in the shape of a postage on the correspondence of private individuals . The postage like the oiher expenses of the state , can only with justice be paid out of the treasury ; to levy it as a tax on correspondence is doing what the legislature never contemplated . In all countries sufficiently advanced in civilization to realize the idea of a National Post Office , a sufficient sense of the advantages of the diffusion of knowledge has prevailed , to lead to the partial exemption of the postage duties on journals , pamphlets , and other printed papers ; but it must be distinctly understood , in considering this with reference to the organization of the United States Post Office , that although in other countries such printed matter is transmitted through the Post Office at a cost which is small comparatively with the general postage duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sufficient to pay the expense of their transport ; and it is necessary also to remember , that in all those countries the Post Office is not merely a public institution for the cheap , rapid , and safe transmission of correspondence , but also a direct source of revenue . In the liberal form of government established in this country , it seems to be conceded that the gross revenue of the Post Office ought not to exceed its expenses ; in other words , that it should be an institution for mere public convenience , and that correspondence is not an eligible object of taxation . It ought not , therefore , on the one hand , to be expected that journals or other printed matter should be carried by the Post Office at a less rate than would cover their expenses fairly estimated ; for it is admitted here that it would be unjust to make up the deficiency by a tax on other correspondence , and there is no other source out of which it could be made good . It would , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate upon these than upon written correspondence . Hitherto all journals , without regard to their size or weight , have been transmitted at a certain rate per single copy , varying under certain limitations in proportion to the distance . This is attended with inconveniences and objections nearly similar to those which prevail against the single and double system of letter postage . One journal will spread over a quantity of paper ten times that of and other , will have ten times the weight , and be attended with ten times the expense of transportation , yet the postage of the two will be the same . By late inventions and improvements in the manufacture of paper , single sheets can be made of any size that is required , and there is consequently no other limitation to the size of a single printed sheet , ex // cept the magnitude of the printing press on which it is worked . There is , therefore , ample scope for the abuse of the privilege of transmission of printed papers at reduced rates under the present system . In accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to letters , it would follow that printed papers should equally be liable to postage by weight , and prepayment by stamps . All the reasoning which establishes. the advantage of these principles as applied to letters , are equally applicable to printed papers ; but as the latter are transmitted in packets of greater bulk and weight than letters , and therefore the labor and expense chargeable per individual packet upon them will be proportionably less than letters , it is equitable that they should be charged at a less rate by weight . It would be difficult , perhaps impracticable , to ascertain the exact expense of their transmission and delivery through the Post Office ; but if that expense could be ascertained , it should regulate the rate of their postage . In the absence of such an estimate , a uniform rate of two cents per ounce for all distances might be adopted subject to such future modification as experience might suggest . With a view to ascertain the practical effect of such a rate , we have ascertained the weights of the principal daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other periodical publications to which this regulation would be applicable . These are given in the subjoined table together with the rates of postage which would be chargeable upon them . Cost of Weight Postage ( av'ge ) Stamps Journals * Periodicals . ounces . per 100 .

No practical difficulty is found in this proceeding , which has been for several years in operation in England . Each stamp has the name of the journal to which it belongs , engraved upon it , so that the stamp of one journal can not be used for another . The practical arrangement of a system of pre-payment on newspapers and periodicals , may at first produce some little inconvenience , but this will be temporary - those who desire to have newspapers or periodicals forwarded to them by post , must pay a subscription which will include the postage . The mode of stamping the papers , adopted in England , is the simple and obvious expedient of putting a stamp on the paper on which the journal or periodical is printed , which stamp carries it free through the Post Office to any part of the country . The same object may be accomplished , though not with the same facility , by enclosing the papers in stamped bands , each band carrying a stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the adhesive stamp might be easily affixed to the papers themselves , as they are to letters . It is evidently equitable that printed matter should be chargeable by weight , and in reference to this principle , we have ascertained a fact which is worthy of attention . When newspapers are wet , as they are always when fresh from the press , they are twenty-five per cent . heavier than when dry ; but as they are put up for the Post Office wet , it follows that the public is put to the needless expense of transporting through the country many tons of water under the name of newspapers and periodicals . For every four tons of printed paper thus carried , there is one ton of water ; - journals and periodicals should , therefore , be dried before they are sent to the Post Office , otherwise their proprietors can not justly complain of being charged twentyfive per cent . extra for their transmission . It would be important to the objects of // this inquiry to obtain , by reference to the business done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the gross revenue to be expected under a reformed system . The published reports of the Post Office department afford , however , no sufficient data on which to found such a calculation . We are therefore compelled to use for our purpose the data afforded by the reports of the Post Office department of Great Britain . It is a principle established by universal experience , that the consumption or use of any commodity increases rapidly in proportion as its cost is lessened , and this increase is generally in a much higher ratio than that of the reduction of price . The following example of the practical operation of this law will illustrate it . They are selected from various parliamentary returns and reports published in Great Britain and ascertained generally by reference to the register of customs and duties . When soap fell oneeighth in price , its consumption was increased one-third ; when sixteen per cent . was taken from the price of tea , its consumption was doubled . After 1823 the price of silks fell twenty per cent. , and twice the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell about twentyfive per cent. , and the quantity used was tripled . Within the twenty years preceding 1837 cotton goods fell about fifty per cent. , and their consumption was increased four hundred per cent . When the reduction of the stamp duty upon newspapers took place in England , their price was reduced by one-third , yet the actual sum expended on them by the public was augmented . The same result ensued when the duty on advertisements was reduced . A curious example of the effect of the reduction of price in the case of an object of mere personal gratification , is afforded in the example of the Tc*wer ; the fee of admission to see which , being previous to 1837 three shillings , was reduced successively , first to one shilling , and then to sixpence . In the six months ending November , 1837 , 7,533 persons were admitted to see it , at three shillings per head . In the six months ending November , 1838 , 31,333 persons were admitted , at one shilling per head ; and in the six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at sixpence per head . During the three years ending 1783 the average price of tea was six shillings per pound , the quantity consumed in that time by the public cost ? 5,221,352 . In 1784 , the duty was reduced , and the average price became four shillings per pound , during which the quantity consumed cost ? 9,417,699 . Thus a reduction of 33 per cent . in this article , produced an increased return in money of one hundred per cent. , and threefold consumption of the commodity . To the increased consumption of the article , by diminution of price , there is no practical limit , but there is a limit which it is the business of the financier , the statist , and the economist , to ascertain , at which the greatest return in money is obtained by reduction of price . There is a certain point in the price of an article , at which either an increase or diminution of price will produce a diminished return , and in cases where profit alone is concerned , this is the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the postage , where no revenue is sought for , the problem presents itself under somewhat modified conditions . There the object is to ascertain that price which will create the greatest possible amount of intercommunication , giving a return which will not fall short of the gross expenses of the establishment . In the case of the English postage system , it was a matter of dispute , when the reform was agitated , whether the Post Office should be continued as a source of revenue at all ; and parliament appears , accordingly , to have faltered on that point , by giving to the government an hypothetical pledge , that if the establishment of the new system should cause a deficit in the general revenue of the kingdom , by reason of the diminished amount supplied by the Post Office , they would make such deficit good by other means . It is clear , therefore , that it was expected , at least by some who favored the new system , that the net revenue of the Post Office would fall off  --  but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lapse of a reasonable time . The results , so far as they are yet known to us , are in accordance both with these apprehensions and expectations . The annual amount of the net revenue of the Post Office , immediately before the reduction of postage , was $7,842,067 , and it had been declining in amount from former years . The net revenue of the first year , under the new system , was $2,322,370 , and that of the second year , $2,675,380 . Subsequent to this period , we do not possess the // official returns , but it is understood that there is an annual increase , which , in about five years from the establishment of the new system , will restore the revenue to its former amount . The estimated annual number of letters transmitted through the Post Office , in the years 1839 and 1840 , the last of the old and the first of the new system , showed an immediate increase of a hundred per cent . The next year , 1841 , showed a farther increase of 40 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of the total correspondence of the kingdom , accoxding to the latest returns , has been in the ratio of about three to one . These data , imperfect and insufficient as they must be admitted to be , nevertheless tend to sustain the prevalence of the general law of reduction of price , in its application to postage . When it is considered that the rate which we have suggested is two-and-a-half times higher than that which yields a large revenue in England , no revenue being desired to be raised by postage here , there can not be any reasonable grounds for doubt that the gross returns will cover the Post Office expenses . In addition to the large increase of correspondence , which the reduction of postage must itself produce , the abolition of the franking privilege will add largely to the revenue . That which is now executed at the cost of those who write chargeable letters , will be hereafter executed , as it ought to be , at the proper cost of the writers . The effect of a diminished rate of postage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total revenue accruing to the Post Office , is illustrated in a striking manner by the following table , which exhibits the correspondence of a single week of four towns in Great Britain . They are at very different distances from the capital , but it must be remembered that this difference of distance , however great , produces no appreciable effect upon the Post Office expenses of each letter Chargeable letters dispatched to London in the week beginning 15th January , 1838 .

It is true that the proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the amount of correspondence , but not to any extent sufficient to account for the great difference in the amount of the gross revenue shown in the above table . ft has been frequently urged in favor of maintaining a high rate of postage in this country , that numerous post offices have been established in districts so sparsely peopled , that the whole amount of the correspondence , whatever rate may he fixed on , would not pay the expenses of the individual post office . To this it may be answered , that the discretionary power vested in the Government , for the establishment of local offices , must obviously be exercised within reasonable limitations , and that it would be in the highest degree unjust , and indeed an insufferable abuse of official power , to spread post offices over such thinly peopled districts that the business of transmission and delivery could only be executed at a loss greatly exceeding the correspondent amount of the postage . The overplus must either be defrayed by an excessive charge , levied on the correspondence with more populous places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if such post offices , which can not pay their own expenses , be established at all , their existence can only be defended by their tendency to the general welfare of the country , and although on such grounds they might be justly maintained by the Treasury of the General Government , it would be an outrage upon all principle5 of justice and right to levy a fund for their support exclusively upon the letterwriters // of New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , New Orleans , and Boston . * In the printed reports of the Post Office department very just and reasonable remonstrances have been made against the exorbitant charges made by Railway Companies , and in some cases by Steamboats , for the conveyance of the mails . It has been truly observed that railways from their very nature are monopolies , and that in many instances competition between steamboats is insufficient to protect the Post Office from injurious and fraudulent combinations , the effect of which is to extort from the General Government a rate of freight many times greater than that which is charged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put down by the supreme power of the law , and it is happily one in the suppression of which the whole body of the enlightened public will zealously concur . The rate at which private individuals and companies can carry freight upon railways and in steamboats is generally known , and it is within the legitimate power of the general government , aided and countenanced by Congress , to exact from all public carriers the transport of the mails at equally reasonable rates . To maintain that such parties may with impunity exercise an arbitrary power of fixing one tariff for the government mails and another for private freight , so as to set at defiance the power of the general legislature , would involve an admission of a degree of feebleness in the Constitution which would render it unfit to promote the wellbeing of the nation for which it was framed . The observation which has been made in one of the Post Master General 's reports , that certain companies seize the pretext of the mails being required to be dispatched at particular hours , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really so puerile that it hardly deserves to be seriously considered . The Post Office service , in England , is executed upon the railways , at a greater cost than was ever incurred on any main lines of common roads , but the nature of this service , and its superior efficiency , amply compensates the public for the increased expense . These great lines of internal communication are vast channels of social and commercial intercourse , into which smaller tributaries , in the form of branch railways and common roads , pour their streams in countless number and unbounded quantity . Each main line thus drains an entire Province ; the quantity of Post Office business , therefore , transacted upon it is greater , incomparably , than ever was executed on any common road ; but it is even more remarkable for the superior efficiency of its execution than for its increased quantity . A house of considerable dimensions , constituting a locomotive Post Office , is actually erected on wheels and transported over the railway at the rate of thirty miles an hour . In this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Post Office functionaries ; at the stations , as they pass , the letter-bags are received and delivered ; the processes of sortation , weighing , stamping , and bagging are executed in this moving mansion between station and station , so that no inconsiderable part of the entire business of the Post Office is here performed while the letters are in the very act of being transported . But ingenuity is not exhausted even here . Post Offices are established at small and thinly peopled stations , where the flying mail could not afford to pause in its rapid course . In such cases , an apparatus is attached to the locomotive office , on which the letter-cariier or guard hangs the bag to be delivered as the train approaches the station . The bag to be received , is , in like manner , suspended to an arm , projecting from a post erected on the side of the railway , awaiting the expected ar * The establishment of local Post Offices , if left to the discretion of the Post Office department , is subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country place , that they may have the advantage of a good coach-road between them and some desirable market  --  and contractors , that they may make the road  --  and small officeseekers , that they may pocket postage perquisites-all make loud requisitions on the department for th' establishment of a post office , when there is not the shadow of a chance that it will pay expenses . In such cases the expenses are paid for , not by the people who enjoy the privileges , nor by the public treasury , but by the letter writers of the larger towns . This is manifestly a gross abuse , and we know no way of correcting it better than to limit the power of the Postmaster General . If letters be carried to distant out-of-the-way places , let post-riders be paid , like our city carriers , a cent or two additional . If they must have roads for coaches , they should make them , without looking for unnecessary mail-contracts to cover the cost . // rival of the train . As the office rushes past with the celerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left upon the post , and the bag suspended on the post is taken up and carried off by the office , by this simple , self-acting contrivance , without even the slightest retardation of the speed of the train . One of the arrangements in detail adopted in the English system , which , having been productive of great public convenience , seems well worthy of adoption , is the Money Order Office . This is the more worthy of attention , inasmuch as it adds nothing to the expense of the Post Office administration , while it affords at once a source of advantage to the public and perquisites to the postmasters . By means of this official arrangement every postmaster is placed in correspondence with others throughout the kingdom , so that he can draw at sight for cash to a limited amount . Small remittances are made without the transmission either of bill or specie , by the party who desires to remit , depositing at his local post office the sum to be remitted , together with a small commission . The order is given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the remittance is made , and the whole expense is covered by the postage and commission together . In England , the commission charged for remitting five pounds , ( equal to 25 dollars , ) was fixed in 1840 at twelve cents , and for all sums under two pounds , or ten dollars , six cents . Thus the smallest class of remittances can be made with perfect security against loss for eight cents , and large sums may be sent for fourteen cents . It has been found that every reduction which has been made in the commission for money sent through the English Post Office , has hitherto caused an increased amount of profit to the Post Office . We are convinced from close attention to the working of the old Post Office system , that no franking privilege can be devised which will not be the source of extensive and insufferable abuse . It was found so in England and has been found so here . But if high rates of postage be attempted to be maintained , the franking privilege can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a privilege for which any class will contend . in Engiand it was surrendered without a murmur ; indeed , any claim to its retention under a penny rate would be eminently absurd . As , however , it might be inexpedient to establish so low a rate in this country until population thickens and commerce becomes more extended , the more convenient and equitable course may be to allow all officials , who may be supposed to have correspondence on public business , to transmit through the Post Office a reasonable increase of their salary as a commutation for their privile*e such increase to be diminished with every future reduction of postage . It has been our desire , with a sincere view to the public good , to urge on those who possess the power , and on whom the duty of regulating the postage laws devolves , the advantages which appear to us to be derivable from an extensive reform in our Post Office , embracing the best features of the improved English system , and realizing the project of Mr. Hill , even more fully than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsiderately urged the application of that system without giving due weight to the geographical and statistical differences , which exist between our extensive territory and the crowded country where the system has been successfully tried , will , we trust , be manifest . These circumstances can not affect the broad principle of the system . No element of it can be modified by them except the amount of the uniform rate which it may be expedient to charge . Now it is true that our sparse population and limited amount of correspondence are good reasons in favor of a higher rate . But , on the other hand , no revenue to the state is sought for here , and no more is expected from the finances of the Post Office than the liquidation of its own expenseswhereas , in the United Kingdom , a revenue of many millions of dollars is looked for from it . This is pro taato a reason in favor of a reduced rate here as compared with England . We have , however , from a desire to keep within a safe limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate two and a half times greater than the English postage . VXThether this vast improvement is destined to confer lustre on the present legislature and administration , we will not venture to affirm , but we hesitate not to pronounce that no force of prejudice , or official or administrative opposition , can long deprive this great commercial country of the advantages of a system which are now shared by a population much more averse to change than that of the United States . // 215 CRITICAL N OTICES .
