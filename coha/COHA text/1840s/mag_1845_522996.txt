txt THE history of the Constitution of the United States remains to be written . In interest and importance it is a subject second to none in the circle of human transactions ; and this interest increases constantly as we recede from the era of the founding of the Republic . It is understood that aman of consu*nmate genius , ability , and great acquirements , * who has studied profoundly the origin of the government , and traced the sources of all the powers conferred upon it , is bestowing some part of the little leisure allowed by his manifold public duties , to the preparation of that history . We trust that it is so . In no other way can he confer a more abiding and beneficial obligation upon his countrymen , than by instructing them and their posterity in a clear knowledge of the formation and objects of that government , whose principles he has done so much to illustrate and- to unfold . The foundations of the National Constitution were laid at a time of the greatest anxiety-in a crisis when the fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in despair of the establishment of a united government , or indeed of any government of an independent and republican form-when they had begun to feel that they had labored inrough the war of the revolution in vain , and wasted their counsels and spent their strength for nought-when discontents were rife throughout the whole country , and in some parts of it , as in Massachusetts , insurrection was with difficulty repressed by armed force-when the Confederation , always weak and inefficient , and only sustained by the pressure from without of enemies and of war , was very rapidly falling to pieces after the removal of that pressure , its recommendations slighted , its ordinances contemned , and several of the States acting as independent sovereignties , as if no Conflideration existedwhen , in short , the whole country appeared to be on the verge of irretrievable anarchy , and its enemies and the enemies of liberty were already congratulating themselves in anticipation of the speedy failure of the experiment of republican institutions and of man 's capacity for self-government . It was only owing to this critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prospects , that many of the wisest and ablest of those men who assembled at Philadelphia , in the memoruble Convention of 1787 , had been induced to leave their respective stations of retirement , or of public or private duty , and to risk well-earned and hard-earned fame in essaying , what hitherto in the history of the world had never been accomplished , the striking out and modeling at a heat a constitution and form of government acceptable to a free people , and adapted as well to their present condition as to their changing circjimstances and increasing numbers through succeeding ages . They felt that the last hope of their country depended on the result of that meeting ; and at her summons they came up to mingle in its deliberations . Washington , covered with glory-whose name filled all lands-who had acquired and deserved the title of Father of his Country-Washington was led by the new and surprising perils of his country , to abandon home and needful repose after an exhausting war , and sacrifice his peace of mind , and stake his spotless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Franklin-the philosopher , diplomatist , statesman-the Patriot Sage , " Who drew the lightning from the o'errushing cloud , And dashed its beauteous terrors at his feet " - full of years and full of honors , then at his very advanced period of life , acting as President of Pennsylvania  --  a just tribute of respect from his adopted State to her most renowned citizeh-Franklin , too , came forward with his counsels and his admonitions , and gave character and dignity to the proceedings . There , also , were Sherman , and Wythe , and Rutledge , and the Pinckneys , Madison , Hamilton , Robert and Gouverneur Morris , and Strong , and King , and Gerry , and Ellsworth , and other not inferior names . In all the States the selection of Delegates to the Convention had been singularly judicious-perhaps we should say pre*mi * Mr. Webster . // nently fortunate . Men of tried and competent abilities-men experienced alike in the inflexible tyranny of kings , and in the vicious caprices of the populacemen who , while they loved , as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected hy a just apprehension of the terrors and calamities of anarchy , and would not forget to restrain and repress license while framing safeguards for liberty . Such were the men who composed the majority of that august body of legislators . If there were some too sensitive to the rude breath of popular clamor , from the relaxation of the laws and a license of the times under the Confederacy , and who were hence disposed to give the government too much of the monarchical cast , their influence was restrained and counteracted by that of others of ultra-democratical tendencies . They met in the same hall in which , eleven years before , the Declaration of ndependence had been pronounced . That independence had been achieved , gloriously-but the fruits of it were likely to be lost , unless a system of government effective and uniform over the whole country , could be planned at this time , and by this Convention . Deeply impressed by the magnitude and great difficulties of the undertaking , with no piactical models to guide them , with a deepseated apprehension that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when promulgated , be rejected by the States or the People-. - oppressed by these sentiments , fears , and responsibilities , the Delegates entered upon their duties . The first act of the Convention was to elect Washington to preside over its deliberations . He had guided the armies of the country successfully through the war -- -it was quite appropriate that he should preside over this great council of peace . After framing rules to govern the proceedings-rules which provided , as well for the regular , methodical and expeditious , yet deliberate conduct of business , as for the most . full and free expression of the sentiments of the members on all the important topics there to discussed , by imposing the strictest secresy upon all , they proceeded at once to the consideration and discussion , in committee of the whole , of the great fundamental principles which it was proposed should form the basis of the new Constitution , leaving the details to be drawn up afterwards in subordinate committees . The problem before them was , to provide a remedy for the existing and the threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Articles of Confederation . All agreed that something must be done-that the Government must be remodeled and reformed ; but whether this should be effected by engrafting improvements upon those Articles , as some wished , and as the credentials of many of the members indicated-or whether , as the sentiment of the majority from the first seemed to be , rejecting the confederacy altogether , as incurably defective , they should create a new and stronger government-one which should originate from , and act directly upon , the people as individuals , and contain within itself the principles of life and preservation . This was the great and diffi. cult question . The basis of their deliberations was a series of resolutions , introduced by Mr. Randolph of Virginia , in conformity with the opinions of the delegation from that State-as containing some of the leading principles which that delegation were willing to see engrafted into the Constitution . And these resolutions , after undergoing very great changes and inodifications-so great , indeed , that Mr. finndolph , the mover of them , refu'ud to assent to the l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the Constitution as it now exists . It was readily and generally conceded , in Convention , that the Government to be formed-whether national , that is , springrng from and acting upon the people-or federal , that is , acting on the States as political bodies-must be supreme and have the power , in some way , of coercing obedience to its enactments . The radical defect of the old Confederation had been the want of this coercive power . The States had obeyed , or disobeyed , its requirements , as suited their convenience , or the caprices of the parties dominant in them respectively . This was to be remedied . The distribution of the powers of the new government , it was also readily settled , in accordance with the established maxims of political science in modern times , should be into legislative , executive , and judiciary departments . As to the structure , power , and ditties of these several departments , there was by no means the same concurrence of opinions . Some debate arose on the question , whether the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or branches . // Notes on the Adoption of the Constitution . 1845 . A portion of the delegates holding that it was more conformable to republican ideas , to have no senate or second branch ; that as such was the structure of the Congress of the Confederacy , this form would be more familiar and acceptable to the country ; that the example of the House of Lords in England , which had been referred to , was no model for us , inasmuch as that House represented a distinct estate in the realm-which estnte , happily , did not exist here . Others contended , and this was greatly the prevailing sentiment , that two distinct houses or branches were necessary , as a check upon each other , and to prevent hasty and inconsiderate legislation ; that the people were accustomed to this form in many of the State legislatures ; also , that a senate would be needed as a counsel in some cases , to advise , and perhaps control , the Executive . To make the senate the representative of the States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards , in the course of the discussions as to the relative shares and influence which the respective States were to have in the new government . But the question that first excited considerable debate in the Convention , had reference to the mode of electing the members of the first branch of the Legislature-the House of Representatives . Whether the election should be directly by the people , or by the State Legislatures , or in some other indirect mode . On this question , men of leading minds , and of undoubted adherence to republican principles , were divided in opinion . Sherman and Gerry , and Butler , ( of South Carolina , ) advocated an election by the State Legislatures . Mr. Sherman thought " the people immediately should have *s little to do , as may be , about the Government . They want information , and are constantly liable to be misled . " Gerry said , " the evils we experience , flow from the excess of democracy . The people do not want virtue , but are the dupes of pretended patriots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction of salaries , and the attack made on that of the Governor , though secured by the constitution itself . " On the other hand , Madison and Mason* of Virginia , and Wilson , of Pennsylvania , argued strongly for an election of the larger branch of the National Legislature by the people . Mason said " it oueht to know and sympathize with every part of the commu nity ; he admitted that we had been too democratic , but was afraid we should incautiously run into the opposite extreme . " Mr. Wilson " was for raising the Federal Pyramid to a considerable altitude  --  and for that reason , wished to give it as broad a base as possible . " Mr. Madison " considered the popular election of one branch of the National Legislature as essential to every plan of free government . " He was an advocate for the policy of refining the popular appointments by successive filtrations , but thought it might be pushed too far . He wished the expedient resorted to , only in the appointment of the second branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the government . The mode of electing , the powers , the duration of office , and the reëligibility , of the Executive , were questions which , - as was to be expected , as well from the importance of the office , as the state of feeling in the Convention and in the country , at that period of jealousy of concentrated power-excited great debates . It was , indeed , discussed with animation , whether the Executive should not consist of more persons than one . Mr Randolph , for instance , " strenuousYy opposed an unity in the Executive magistracy . He regarded it as the fretus of monarchy . " While Mr. Sherman " considered the Executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the legislature into effect ; and that the person or persons ought to be appointed by , and accountable to , the legislature only , which was the depository of the supreme will of the society . He wished the number might not be fixed , but that the legislature should be at liberty to appoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other members , also , were strenuous against a single executive , as having too much the semblance of monarchy . But the majority were of a different opinion ; and the Convention soon settled down upon one , as the number of which the Executive should consist . In respect of the duration ef the office of the Executive , the members were at first divided in opinion between the terms of three and of seven years . And those who advocated the longer term , were opposed to a re*higihility in the Executive . Of those who opposed the longer term , Mr. Bedford , ( of Delaware , ) " begged // the committee to consider what the situation of the country would be , in case the first magistrate should be saddled on it for such a period ; and it should be found , on trial , that he did not possess the qualifications ascribed to him , or should lose them after his appointment . An impeachment , " he said , " would be no cure for this evil ; as an impeachment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven years was at first fixed upon ; but at a later period of the session of the Convention , the period as at present established , was agreed to . The mode of appointment of the Executive , was a subject of no less difficult** . The prevailin* sentiment in the Convention at first seemed to be , that the election sh'uld be made in some other mode than directly by the people ; either by the National Le0islature , or by the House of Representatives alone , or by the Executives of the several States . One or two only of the members advocated an election by the people  --  and that with great diffidence . Mr. Wilson , ( of Pennsylvania , ) said " he was almost unwilling to declare the mode which he wished to take place , being apprehensive that it might appear chimerical . He would say , however , at least , that in theory he was for an election by the people . " Mr. Mason was also in favor of the idea , " but he thought it impracticable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially adopted , of the people voting for electors , and these to choose the Executive . This mode , however , was at the time of its suggestion , rejected , and an election by the National Legislature agreed upon ; and it was not till late in the session that the other mode was finally adopted . Another question , much debated in this stage of the proceedings of the Convention , was as to the power of removing the Executive in case of ascertained unfitness for the station . It seemed to be generally felt , that this power ought to reside somewhere . " Some mode , " said Mr. Mason , " of displacing an unfit magistrate , is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose , as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen . " But , whether this power should be given to the National Legislature-wholly and directly without the process of impeachment , or to the National Legislature on the request of the legislatures of a majority of the States , was made a matter of dis August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeachment might be inadequate in the case of an incompetent or corrupt magistrate . But , on the other hand , it was considered that the Executive ought to have considerable power , and that he ought to be independent of the legislature , which he could not be , if he were liable to be removed by a simple vote or address . On the whole , it was agreed that impeachment and conviction should be the only ground of removal . The right and power of the Veto , next became the subject of discussion . Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hamilton , were in favor of giving the Executive an absolute negative on the laws . There was no danger , they thought , of such a power being too much exercised ; and it was mentioned , that the King of Great Britain had not exerted his negative since the Revolution of 1688 . But , Mr. Gerry did not think it necessary to give so great control over the legislature , as the best men in the country would be in the two branches of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the will of the whole . No man could be found so far above all the rest iii wisdom . He thought we ought to avail ourselves of his wisdom in revising the laws , but not permit him to overrule the decided and cool opinions of the legislature . " Dr. Franklin , said " he had had some experience of this check under the proprietary government of Pennsylvania . The negative of the Governor was constantly made use of to extort money . No good law whatever could be passed , without a private bargain with him-this was a mischievous sort of check . It was true the King of Great Britain , as had been said , had not exerted his negative since the Revolution : but that matter was easily explained . The bribes and emoluments now given to members of parliament rendered it unnecessary , everything being done according to the will of the ministers . He was afraid if a negative should be given as proposed , that more power and money would be demanded , till at last enough would be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the will of the Executive . The first man put at the helm. will be a good one-nobody knows what sort may come afterwards . The Executive will be always increasing here as elsewhere , till it ends in monarchy . " Mr. Bedford , " was opposed to every check on the legislature . He thought it would be sufficient to mark // out in the Constitution , the boundaries to the legislative authority , which would give all the requisite security to the rights of the other departments . The representatives of the people were the best judges of what was for their interest , and ought to be under no external control whatever . The two branches would produce a suflicient control within the legislature itself . " Other members were of the same opinion . But Mr. Madison " supposed that if a proper proportion of each branch should be required to overrule the objections of the Executive , it would answer the same purpose as an absolute negative . " Mr. Mason said , " will it not be enough , to enable the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised , and the objections to them overruled by a greater majority than was required in the first instance . " To these suggestions , the reply of Mr. Wilson was , that " the requiring a large proportion of each house to overrule the Executive check , might do in peaceable times ; but there might be tempestuous moments , in which animosities may run high between the Executive and legislative branches , and in which the former flught to be able to defend itself . " The proposition to give the Executive an absolute negative was rejected by a vote of all the States represented in the Convention , and it was then agreed to give him a provisionary check , subject to be overruled by a vote of twothirds of each branch of the legislature . On the subject of the reëligibility of the Executive , there was much difference of opinion . On the one side , Mr. Guoverneur Morris argued , that to make the Executive ineligible after one term of service , would " destroy the great incitement to merit public esteem , by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may , " said he , " give a dangerous turn to one of the strongest passions in the human breast . The love of fame is the great spring to noble and illustrious actions . Shut the civil road to glory , and he may be compelled to seek it by the sword . in the second place , it will tempt him to make the most of the short space of time allotted him to accumulate wealth and provide for his friends . in the third place , it will produce violations of the very constitution it meant to secure . in moments of pressing danger , the tried abilities , *nd established character of a favorite magistrate will prevail over respect for the forms of the Constitution . " Mr. Morris 's idea , was to have the Executive elected for ashort term , say two years , and re*ligible-believing that , as long as he behaved himself well , he would be continued in office . Mr. King and Mr. Sherman on the same side , thought " that he who had proved himself most fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution from holding it . " On the contrary , Mr. Randolph and Mr. Luther Martin , contended for the ineligibility of the Executive after the first term , on the general ground , that " he should not be left under a temptation to court a reappointment . " In answer to the argument , that a Constitutional bar to reappointment would inspire unconstitutional endeavors to perpetuate himself , it was said that such endeavors could have no effect , unless the people became so corrupt as to render all precautions hopeless . As to compensation of the Executive , Dr. Franklin moved " that necessary expenses should be defrayed ; but , they should receive no salary , stipend , fee or reward whatever for their services . " This proposition the venerable mover supported by a speech , in which , among other things , he said , " Sir , there are two passions which have a powerful inIluence on the affairs of men . These are ambition and avarice  --  the love of power and the love of money . Separately , each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when united in view of the same object , they have , in many minds , the most violent effects . Place before the eyes of such men a post of honor , that shall be at the same time a place of profit , and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it . And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable preéminence , through all the hustle of cab*d , the heat of contention , the infinite mutual abuse of parties , tearing to pieces the best of characters ? it will not be the wise and moderate , the lovers of peace and good order , the men fittest for the trust . It will be the bold and the violent , the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in their selfish pursuits . These will thrust themselves forward and be your rulers . " In answer to the objection which would be made to this proposition , that men could not be found to serve in the Executive department , without being well paid for their services-after citing some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and serving their country , and the respect such conduct entitles them to , are sufficient motives with some minds to give up a great portion of their time to the public , // without the mere inducement of pecuniary satisfaction , " - he alluded with delicacy and great pertinency to the distinguished example of Washington , then presiding in the Convention , and said : " To bring the matter nearer home , have we not seen the great and most important of our offices , that of General of our armies , executed for eight years together , without the smallest salary , by a Patriot whom I will not now offend by any other praise ;  --  and this , through fatigues and distresses , in common with the other brave men , his military friends and companions , and the constant anxieties peculiar to his station ? And shall we doubt finding three or four men in all the United States , with public spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful council , for perhaps an equal term , merely to preside over our civil concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have a better opinion of our country . " This proposition , though received with respect in consideration of the mover and the weight of his opinions , was not favored by the Convention , and was not again called up for discussion . Another question much discussed in the Convention was , whether members of the National Legislature should be eligible to office during the term for which they should be elected . On one side it was said , that allowing such appointments would lead to intrigue and corruption in the Legislature , and a spirit of favoritism towards their own members ; and the example of Great Britain was appealed to , where men get into Parliament that they may get offices and appointments for themselves or their friends , in reply , it was said , that the idea of preventing intrigue and solicitation of offices was chimerical-that if a member were restrained from soliciting an appointment for himself , he would still make use of the a ( lVantages of his position to obtain lucrative posts for his friends and relatives . " Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disqualifying its own members ; candidates for office would hover round the seat of government , or be found among the residents there , and practice all the means of courting the favor of the members . " Besides , such an exclusion would tend to deter the best minds from accepting a place in Congress , if in that situation they would he ineligible to the higher offices of the government . In a subsequent stage of the proceedings the provision as it now stands in the Consti tution was adopted , though against the strenuous opposition of the advocates of an entire exclusion , who contended that it would be quite easy to evade this provision , by appointing to the new-created office an incumbent of one already existing , and then appointing a member of Congress to the prepared vacancy-that thus the provision amounted to nothing , and the door was left open for all the evils , the corruption , the intrigue , and the influence of the appointing power over the members of the Legislature which they thought it necessary to guard against . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the opinions of the several members of the Convention , seem not to have been essentially diverse . It was fully contemplated by all , that several new States would be formed within the then limits of the United States , and it was agreed that provision ought to be made for their ultimate adoption into the Union . The only question debated , had ret*rence to the terms on which such new States should be received-whether they should come in on an equal footing , and having an equal vote and influence in the National Legislature with the old States , or be in any degree restricted in these particulars . It was even then foreseen that the Western territory would be tilled up with a population outnumbering that of the Atlantic States , and it was urged by some of the members that they might have a different interest , and if they acquired power , they would , like all men , abuse it-that they would oppress commerce , and drain the wealth into the Western States . " There is , " said Mr. Gerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western country , and I do not wish those remaining behind to be at the mercy of the emigrants . " He was in favor of admitting them on liberal terms , but not for putting the control into their hands . But Mr. Sherman on the contrary said , " We are providing for our posterity , for our children , and our grandchildren , who would be as likely to he citizens of the new Western States as of the old States . " Mr. Mason also remarked , that " strong objection had been drawn from the danger to the Atlantic interests from new Western States . If the Western States are to be admitted into the Union , as they arise , they must be treated as equals , and subjected to no degrading discriminations . They will have the same pride , and other passions , which we have ; and will // either not unite with , or will speedily revolt from , the Union , if they are not in all respects placed on an equal footing with their brethren ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to have been in the contemplation of the members of the Convention , that the new States for whose future admission to the Union they were thus providing , were to be formed from any other territory than that which then belonged to the United States . Among the original resolutions introduced at the beginning of the session by Mr. Randolph , which formed the basis of the proceedings of the Convention , and to the development and modification of which the Constitution may be traced , was one to the effect , " that provision ought to be made for the admission of States lawfully arisino* within the limits of the United States , whether from a voluntary junction of government or otherwise . " And this expression , " within the limits of the United States , " was preserved in the report of the Committee of the Whole , and also in that of the Committee of Detail , as it was called , and wherever this subject came up for consideiation ; and the clause seems to have been dropped without remark in the final engrossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered , that in the Articles of Confederation Canada was to he admitted into the Union on her joining in the measures of the United States  --  but that no provision was made in those Articles for the case of new States arising within the territory of the then United States , and , in consequence of this omission , the Congress of the Confederation had been led into assumptions of power which it was thought necessary to provide against in the Consitution ; and this was the provision introduced for the purpose-while Canada had ceased to be expected to join the Union . Among other questions of interest more or less discussed in the Convention , was that with reference to giving to Congress the power to make regulalions , or to alter regulations which any State should make concerning the times , places and maimer of holding elections for representatives . On this subject , Mr. Madison said , " The policy of referring the appointment of the House of Representatives to the people , and not to the Legislatures of the States , supposes that the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question seems to decide that the Legislatures of the States ought not to have the uncontrolled right of regulating the times , places and manner of holding elections . These were words of great latitude . It was impossible to foresee all the abuses that might be made of the discretionary power . Whether the electors should vote by ballott or viva voce ; should assemble at this place or that place ; should be divided into districts , or all meet at one place ; should all vote for all the Representatives , or all in a district vote for a number allotted to the district-these and many other points would depend on the Legislatures , and might materially effect the appointments . Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry , they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed . It seemed as improper in principle , though it might be less inconvenient in practice , to give to the State Legislatures this great authority over the election of the Representatives of the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latter a like power over the election of their representatives in the State Legislature . " As conrtant jealousy was manifested of an encroachment by the National Legislature on the powers and prerogatives of the State Legislatures it was thought best to leave the provision as it stands in the Constitution , requiring the State Legislatures to prescribe the times , places and manner of holding the elections , but giving power to Congress in case the States or any of them should omit to do so , and thus he unrepresented ,  --  a contingency that had happened under the Confederation , and might happen a0ain  --  or should make improper ones to make or alter such regulations at any time . On the subject of duties for the purpose of protecting domestic manufactures , the following observations are worthy of notice . The power to lay duties on exports being under discussion , Mr. Gouverneur Morris remarked , among other things , " The state of the country also will change , and render duties on exports ,  - -  as skins , beaver , andother peculiar raw materials -- politic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Madison said , " a proper regulation of exports may , and probably will be , necessary hereafter , and for the same purposes as the regulation of imports , viz. : for revenue , domestic manufactures , and procuring equitable regulations from other nations . " Neither of these gentlemert // seems to have doubted , that the encouraging domestic manufactures was a legitimate subject for the National Legislature to have power to act upon ; nor did they doubt , that in giving power to Congress to lay import duties , they were givin0 the power to do so for the purpose of such encouragement . Mr. Fitzsirnmons " would be against a tax on exports , to be laid immediately ; but was for giving a power of laying the tax when a proper time may call for it . This would certainly be the case when America should become a manufacturing country . " Mr. Clymer introduced an amendment to the proposed article , givi ng power to lay an export duty , by inserting the words " for the purpose of revenue . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings had reference to duties upon exports ; while the discussions in Congress and throughout the country , for the last few years , have been in relation to duties upon articles imported . But the principle involved , so far as it affects the question of the Constitutionality of a law adjusting a scale of duties , so as to afford encoura0 ernent to domestic manufactures , is obviously the same in either case . And the debate shows , that the subject of affording such encouragement entered into the contemplations of members of the Convention . But the great and most difficult question before the Convention-that which more than all others during the whole session agitated and divided the minds of the members , and came near , on more than one occasion , to breaking it up , and sending home the delegates in despair of a*reeing upon any plan of government had reference , not so much to the particular organization of the departments of the General Government and the distribution of its powers , as to the shares and parts the respective States were to to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ; in other words , the question of " State rights . " This question arose early , and it was renewed and debated again and again in different forms , and on a variety of motions and propositions , until the general outline of the system as it now exists was finally settled . Whether the proposed General Government was to act only upon the States as political bodies , or to act directly upon the people -- whether the State Governments were to be preserved as independ ent sovereignties , or to be made mere municipal corporations under the National Legislature , consolidated into one empire ; or if preserved , whether the small states were to retain their power and votes , as coequal sovereignties , with the large States , or whether the representation and votes should be proportioned to the number of people or the wealth of the State respectively -- these were some of the forms in which this difficult and troublesome subject presented itself to the minds of the Convention . It was in the midst of an agitating debate on this question , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a stand , and the Convention itself break up , in the hopelessness of reconciling the conflicting views of members , that Franklin introduced his memorable proposition that they should , in this their extremity , ask counsel of the Great Governor of the universe . He prefaced the motion with the following speech , which deserves to be imprinted , in durable characters , on the hearts of all legislators . " . Afr . President : The small progress we have made , after four or five weeks close attendance and continual reasonings with each other-our different sentiments on almost every question , several of the last producing almost as many noes as yeasis , methinks , a melancholy proof of the irnperfectioii of the human understanding . We seem to feel our own want of political wisdom , since we have been running in search of it . We have gone back to ancient history for models of government , and examined the different forms of those republics , which , having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution , now no longer exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but find none of their constitutions suitable to our circumstances . In this situation of this Assembly-groping , as it were , in the dark to find political truth , and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to ushow has it happened , sir , that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights , to illuminate our understandings . In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain , when we were sensible of danger , we had daily prayer in this room for the divine protection . Our prayers , sir , were heard  --  and they were graciously answered . Alt of us who were engaged in the struggle , must have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence in our favor . To that kind Providence , we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity . And have we now // forgotten that powerful friend ! Or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance ! I have lived , sir , a long time : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see of this truth-that God governs in the affairs of men . And if a sparrow can not fall to the ground without his notice , is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid ? We have been assured , sir , in the sacred writings , that except the Lord build the house , they labor in vain who build it . ' I firmly believe this ; and I also believe that without his concurring aid , we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel . We shall be divided by our little partial local interests , our projects will be confounded , and we ourselves shall become a reproach and by-word down to future ages . And what is worse , mankind may hereafter , from this unfortunate instance , despair of establishing governments by human wisdom , and leave it to chance , war , and conquest . " A portion of the members of the Convention were hostile to the idea of a consolidated national government , one acting upon the people directly , and not upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederation , adding a few new powers to Congress to give it efficacy . Of this sentiment were the delegation from Connecticut , a majority of that from New York , and some others . Mr. Sherman thought " the objects of the Union were few : first , defence against foreign danger ; secondly , against internal disputes , and a resort to force ; thirdly , treaties with foreign nations ; fourthly , regulating foreign commerce , and drawing revenue from it . These , and perhaps a few lesser objects , alone rendered a confederation of the States necessary . All other matters , civil and criminal , would be much better in the hands of the people . " And he thought these objects could be obtained by ingrafting amendments of a federal nature into the Articles of Con .. federation . So also Mr. Lansing of New York , who observed " that the true question was whether the Convention would adhere to , or depart from , the foundation of the present confederacy ; " and he was of opinion that the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having for their basis the Confederacy in being . " The acts of Congress , the tenor of the acts of the States , the commissions produced by the several deputations , all proved this . And this limitation of the power to an amendment of the Confederacy , marked the opinion of the States that it was unneces sary and improper to go further . He was sure that this was the case with his State . New York would never have concurred in sending deputies to the Convention , if she had supposed the deliberations were to turn on a consolidation of the States and a national government . " Mr. Patterson , of New Jersey , and Mr. Luther Martin , also argued strenuously on the same side . They contended that the idea of a national government , as cotitradistinguished from a federal one , had never entered into the mind of any of the States . On the contrary , MiK Read of Delaware favored a strong and consolidated government . " Too much attachment , " said he , " is betrayed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A national government must soon of necessity swallow them all up . They will soon be reduced to the mere office of electing the national Senate . He was against patching up the old federal system ; he hoped the idea would be dismissed . " Mr. Hamilton also was strenuously opposed to the idea of attempting to amend the old Confederation . He was " fully convinced , that no amendment of the Confederation , , leaving the States in possession of their sovereignty , could possibly answer the purpose . The great question , " be observed , " is , what provision shall we make for the happiness of the country ? " He then proceeded to enumerate and illustrate some of the great essential principles which he thought necessary for the support of government . He mentioned , first , an active and constant interest in supporting it ; secondly , the love of power ; thirdly , an habitual attachment of the people ; fourthly , force , by which may be understood a coercion of laws or coercion of arms ; flftlily , influence- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those regular honors and emoluments which produce an attachment to the government : " that " almost all the weight of these is on the side of the States , and must continue so as long as the States continue to exist . All the passions , then , " he continued , " of avarice , ambition , interest , which govern most individuals and all public bodies , fall into the current of the States , and do not flow into the stream of the general government . The former , therefore , will generally be an overmatch for the general government , and render any confederacy in its very nature precarious . " In proof and illustration of this position , he referred to the example of the Amphictyonic Council , the German Confederacy , and the Swiss // Cantons . After commenting on the difficulties of accomplishing the just purposes of government by means of a mere confederation of states , and the still greater dangers from two sovereignties coexisting within the same limits , remarking " that the general power , if it preserves itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be swallowed up by them , " he proceeded to say , " What then is to be done ? Here he was embarrassed . The extent of the country to be governed discouraged him . The expense of a general government was also formidable , unless there was such a diminution of the expense of the State governments as the case would admit . If they were extinguished , he was persuaded that great economy might be obtained by instituting a general government . He did not mean , however , to shock the public opinion by proposing such a measure . On the other hand , he saw no other necessity for declining it . They are not necessary for any of the great purposes of commerce , revenue , or agriculture . Subordinate authorities , he was aware , would be necessary . These must be distinct tribunals and corporations for local purposes . But cui bono the vast and expensive apparatus now pertaining to the States ? " And he introduced a plan of government conformable to his ideas . Other members , and a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from either of the foregoing-advocating a middle course , to wit , the establishment of a national government which should neither absorb and abolish the State governments on the one hand , nor , on the other , leave with them so great power and freedom from control as they had under the Confederation . Mr. Dickinson , of New Jersey , " was for a strong national government , but for leaving the States a considerable agency in the system . " He considered " the combination of the State governments with the national government as politic as it was unavoidable . " Mr. Madison " differed from the member from Connecticut ( Mr. Sherman ) , in thinking the objects mentioned to he all the principal ones that required a national government . Those were certainly important and necessary objects ; but he combined with them the necessity of providing more effectually for the security of private rights , and the steady dispensation of justice . Interference with these were evils which had more , perhaps , than anything else , produced this Convention . " He regarded an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely necessary to a perfect system-that is , that the national government must be supreme . And he thought " there was less danger of encroachment from the general government than the State governments ; and also , that the mischiefs from encroachments would be less fatal if made by the former than if made by the latter . " General Pinckney " wished to have a good national government , and at the same time to leave a considerable share of power in the States . " So , also , Mr. Wilson " saw no incompatibility between the national and State governments , provided the latter were restrained to certain local purposes-nor any probability of their being devoured by the former ; " on the contrary , he wished to keep them from devouring the national government . Mr. Mason said : - " Whatever power may be necessary for the national government , a certain portion must necessarily be left with the States . It is impossible for one power to pervade the extreme parts of the United States , so as to carry equal justice with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defending themselves against encroachments of the national government . " Other members expressed similar opinions ; while Mr. Bedford thought " there was no middle course between a perfect consolidation and a mere confederation of the States ; that the first was out of the question , and in the latter they must continue , if not perfectly , yet equally , sovereign . " The particular practical question which oftener than any other brought out these expressions of opinion , was the difficult one concerning the rule of representation and of voting in the national Congress . The conflict here was mainly between the large and the small States , the former contending that the representation should be proportioned to the number of the population or the quotas of contribution among the States respectively-that this was the only fair and rational mode of representation-that the allowing each State to have an equal vote under the Confederacy was no precedent for them to follow , it having been adopted and submitted to on the part of the great States only from necessity-that it was unreasonable that a State with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the national councils // 1845 . Note8 on the Adoption of the Con3tilution. than a small and poor State-that the vote of an individual man living in a large State ought to have as much influence as that of one living in a small State , which would not he the case unless there were a proportional representation . On the contrary , it was insisted with great zeal and earnestness on the part of the smaller States , that the States were all alike independent sovereignties , and were therefore all equal , and entitled to an equal vote in the general Congress ; that this was just , and according to the principles of international law -- that this principle was adopted into the Confederacy , not from necessity , as had been said , but from a sense of its inherent justice , the same reason which had established it among the elements of the law of nations -- that " there was no more reason that a great individual State , contributing much , should have more votes than a small one , contributing little , than that a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - that if the large States contributed more to the general government , so they had more to he protected by it , than the small States -- that if the large States were allowed an influence in proportion to their magnitude , they would control the affairs of the whole country , appoint the officers , and destroy and defeat the independence of the small States - that the small States " would sooner submit to a foreign power , than submit to he deprived , in both branches of the Legislature , of an equality of suffrage , and therehy be thrown under the dominion of the larger States . " On this matter Doctor Franklin remarked characteristically : " The diversity of opinions turns on two points , if a proportional representation takes place , the small States contend that their liberties will be in danger . If an equality of votes is to be put in its place , the larger States say their money will be in danger . When a board table is to be made , and the edges of plank do not fit , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In like manner here , both sides must part with some of their demands , in order that they may join in some accommodating prop ? sitiOiL " He then suggested a compromise . A compromise , as is well known , was afterwards agreed upon , by which the States were to retain an equality of representation in one branch of the national Legislature , while the representation was to be proportioned to the number of people in the States respectively in the other . Thus in these great questions of the shares which the respective States were to have in the general government , and the relation they were to stand in to itwhich so much agitated and divided the minds of the members , and threatened at times to defeat the whole plan of a national government-  --  the Convention happily hit upon and pursued a just middle way , unattempted before in the history of nations . They proposed to themselves and solved the great problem of a Republic , embracing a vast extent of territory , reconciling an effective , self-sustaining national governments with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the form of the constitution had been agreed upon , and it was ascertained that no further material amendments or modifications could he carried , it became an object to have those members who dissented from its provisions , sign the Constitution , in order that it might go forth to the country bearing on its face the unanimous approval of the Convention . Those members who finally objected to it , and who expressed their objections as insuperable* wished , nevertheless , that another Convention might be called , fresh from the people , with ample powers , thinking that , in that mode a government might be formed more acceptable and more beneficial to the country , than was to be obtained from the present Convention . But the majority thought otherwise ; they believed that if a Constitution was not now formed , it never could be , and that the one before them , though not the precise plan which any one member would have preferred in all its parts , was , nevertheless , as a plan of compromises , the best that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beneficial form of united government for the country . Various arguments and persuasions were addressed to the dissentient members , to prevail on them to accept and recommend to their respective constituencies the proposed form , trusting to time and future amendments for such alterations as they might desire . Dr. Franklin confessed there were several parts of the Constitution he did not then approve , but he was not sure he never should approve them-for in his long life , he had experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration , to change his opinions on important subjects . " In these sentiments , he agreed to the Constitution , with all its faults , if they were faults , because // he thought a general government necessary for us , and there is no form of government , but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered ; and he believed further , that this was likely to be well administered for a course of years , and could only end in despotism , as other forms have done before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need despotic government , being incapable of any other . " After saying that he " consented to this Constitution , because he expected no better , and because he was not sure it was not the best , " he concluded by urging " every member who still had any objections to it , with him on that occasion , to doubt a little of his own infallibility , and to make manifest their unanimity by putting his name to the instrument . " Mr. Gouverneur Morris said , " that he too had objections ; but considering the present plan the best that was ti be attained , he should take it with all its faults . The majority had determined in it*s favor , and by that determination he should abide . The moment this plan goes forth , all other considerations will be laid aside , and the great question will be , shall there be a national govern ment or not ? and this must take place , or a general anarchy will be the alternative . " Mr. Hamilton " expressed his anxiety that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by opposing or even refusing to sign the Constitution , might do infinite mischief , by building the latent sparks that lurk under an enthusiasm in favor of the Convention , which may soon subside . No man 's ideas were more remote from the plan than his were known to be ; but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and convulsion on one side , and the chance of good to he expected from the plan on the other . " Other members urged similar considerations to persuade to unanimity , but without avail . The dissentient members found their objections insurmountable . These members were Mr. Randolph , the mover of the original resolutions , Mr. Mason and Mr. Gerry-two of the delegates from New York , Messrs . Lansing and Yates , having previously withdrawn from the Convention . Mr. Randolph " admitted that in refusing to sign , he took a step , which might be the most awful of his life ; but it was dictated by his conscience , and it was not possible for him to hesitate , much less to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan , with a final alternative to the people of accepting or re jecting it in toto , would really produce the anarchy and civil convulsions , which were apprehended from the refusal of individuals to sign it . " Mr. Gerry described the painful feelings of his situation , but was obliged " to declare on this occasion , his fears that a civil war might result from the present crisis of the United States . In Massachusetts , particularly , he saw the danger of this calamitous event , in that State , there are two parties , one devoted to democracy , the worst , he thought , of all political evils ; the other , as violent in the opposite extreme . From the collision of these , in opposing and resisting the Constitution , confusion was greatly to be feared . " After the Constitution had been signed by all the members who yielded it their assent , it was resolved , that the journals and other papers of the Convention should be deposited in the hands of its President , and " that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever formed under the Constitution , " and the Conventi6n then ( lissolved itself by an adjournment sine die . Madison relates , that " whilst the last members were signing , Dr. Franklin , looking towards the President 's chair , at the back of which a rising sun happened to be painted , observed to a few members near him , that painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun . 1 have , said he , often and often in the course of the session , and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue , looked at that behind the President , without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting : but now at length , I have the happiness to know , that it is a rising and not a setting sun . " Thus closed the labors of the most important and memorable assembly of lawmakers , that has been convened in any country at any time . They gave to their country a Constitution , which , notwithstanding the fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has worked admirably , and has become a model to nations . Its faults , so far as an experiment of upwards of half a century has developed them , are fewer and less important , and its excellences and the blessings it has conferred upon the increasing millions who live and thrive under its ample protection , are infinitely greater than any of its framers anticipated . That it may continue to bless and protect forever the generations who live under it , should be the morning and the evening prayer of every American heart . // CRITICAL NOTICES . Popular Lectures on Science and Art , delivered in the cities and towns of the United States . By DIoNi-slus LARDNER , Doctor of Civil Law , Fellow of the Royal Societies of London , of the Royal irish Academy , Member of the principal European Societies for the advancement of Science , and formerly Professor of Astronomy and Natural Philosophy in the University of London . New York Greely &amp; McElrath , Trihune Buildings . These Lectures , of which we have received six numbers , are unquestionably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . The usual hooks on Science and Art are altogether unsuited to impress the mass , even of intelligent people . We do not ask that a scientific work shall amuse ; but certainly , if.a book does not interest , it can make no impression on the general reader . The best treatises , however , that we have been accustomed to see on these suhjects-those really freighted with knowledge-have commonly been set forth so much in abstract and technical terms , as to render them readable , often understandable , only by the few ; while those apparently designed for very popular use-saying as much , indeed , on their covers-have been as commonly found quite free , from abstractions not only , but in truth , of any information . It is the singular merit of these essays-for they now , in fact , appear under that form-that they really present , not in general the processes , but the whole immense results of all science and practical art , from the ages of the intellectual old Greek philosophers down to the amazing discoveries of modern times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail to make them both intelligible and deeply interesting to any class of readers . Dr. Lardner 's style for such subjects is incomparable . We do not , at least , conceive it to be surpassed by that of any other English writer . It is wonderfully concise and exact , yet so flowin* and luminous as of itself to lead the reader 's mind through many pages before he becomes aware of it-an excellence to which the original presentation of the subjects in public lectures has , no doubt , greatly contributed . Besides this remarkable merit , there is a constant employment of illustration , by anecdotes and references to distinguished inventors and scientific men in different ages , that adds exceedingly to the attractiveness of the work . Though the series will consist of fifteen or sixteen numbers , containing each about eighty pa0es , the variety , importance , and popular interest of the topics treated of , would hardly be suspected , withotit enumeration . The first six numbers comprise the " Plurality of Worlds , " " The Sun , " " Eclipses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Minor Planets , " " Weather Almanacs , " " Halley 's Comet , " " The New Planets , " " The Atmosphere , " " The Tides , " " Light , " " The Major Planets , " " Reflection of Light , " " The Atlantic Steam Question , " " The Barometer , " " The Moon , " " Heat , " " Galvanism , " " The Moon and the Weather , " " Periodic Comets , " " Radiation of Heat , " " Meteoric Stones and Shooting Stars , " " The Earth , " " Lunar Influences , " " Physical Constitution of Comets . " We earnestly recommend to the " young men and maidens , " and even staid elderly people-intellectual faces , many of them - who are seen in every steamboat and railcar devouring trashy novels by the hour , to make a substitute of these , or works like them , with a reasonable prospect of getting some benefit.                @ @ @ @ @
