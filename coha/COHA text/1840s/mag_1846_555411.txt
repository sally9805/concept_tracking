txt IN returning through South Carolina , a few years since , from a . long journey in the Southern States , after some adventures by flood and field that might make a book , if we were disposed to write travels , our early associations and happy recollections of college life were suddenly roused by the appearance of the author of the book before us on the opposite side of the dinner-table at a hotel . Although five-and-twenty years had passed away , since we looked up to him as one of an advanced class at Cambridge , distinguished by his rar* , k as a scholar , and equally so by his readiness at all manly exercises , his fresh and vigorous appearance brought to memory the remark of John Randolph of Roa // noke , when , late in life , he revisited the scenes of his collegiate course . He said that every thing appeared to him much as it used to do , except that two elm-trees on the college green seemed not quite so large as he remembered them to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Elliott looked quite as old as he appeared formerly to us , when at Cambridge . He was too far our senior for personal acquaintance in those days . But that was not necessary to fix a lasting impression of him . A very learned person lately remarked , that the wisdom of man had never appeared so imposing to him as it did in the class that was senior when he entered college ; and many people , like ourselves , could probably , from their own experience , apply a similar remark to all human greatness and glory . Reminiscences of this nature , to he sure , are by no means reciprocal in character . When looking back on those who have followed in our rear , the exclamation most natural is that of wonder that the unformed freshman should ever have grown up to wear the grizzled head and furrows of advancing years . However , be all that as it may , we were highly pleased at the incident ; and knowing that we must be mutually acquainted with many estimable and accomplished people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The advance was cordially met ; and among a deal of agreeable talk that followed , Mr. Elliott gave an interesting account of an adventure in which he had shortly before been engaged , having taken the lead in an encounter with a seamonster tL ) at had been supposed to be almost fabulous , and one quite as deserving of wonder as a sea-serpent would be , if we were sure that there were more like him in the ocean . We opened this book with eagerness , in hopes of finding the same story in it . It is related at length ; and the reader shall have it in the author 's own words , though we may be obliged to curtail the language a little to leave room for some other extracts . It seems that Mr. Elliott has amused himself by furnishing from his experience as a sportsman descriptions of this sort for newspapers and magazines , and the articles from his pen have been brought together for publication in the present form . A part of the first one will serve as an introduction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am an hereditary sportsman , and inherit the tastes of my grandfather , as well as his lands . Whoever has seen the beauti // ful bay on which they are seated ( known on the map as Port Royal Sound ) with its transparent waters stocked with a variety of sea-fish , while the islands that gird it in abound in deer and other game , will confess that it is a position well calculated to draw out sporting propensities . " There is a fish , which annually visits this bay from May till August , - described by Linna3us as of the genus Ray , species Diodon . It is called by Dr. Mitchell ( not without reason , from the bat-like structure of its flaps or wings ) the Vampire of the Ocean . ' It is known with us as the Devil-fish . ' Its structure indicates great muscular power . It has long , angular wings and a capacious mouth ; but the greatest singularity of its formation consists in its arms ( or horns , as they are called ) , which extend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its size , with us , is from fourteen to twenty-five feet , measured across the back transversely . Its longitudinal measurement is less . Valliant describes this fish as reaching the size of fifty feet on the coast of Africa ; but Valliant was a traveller ! I am a sportsman merely , and claim no charter to exceed the truth . I must own , then , that the largest I have seen and measured was but eighteen feet across the back , from three to four feet thick as it lay on the ground , had horns , or feeders , three feet in length , curiously articulated at the ends so as to resemble the fingers of the human hand when clenched , and enjoyed an amplitude of mouth sufficient to admit of its receiving two aldermen abreast , had it relished such a quintessence of turtle . " It is the habit of this fish to ply these arms rapidly before its mouth while it swims , and to clasp with the utmost closeness and obstinacy whatever body it has once inclosed . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their moorings and overset , by the Devil-fish having laid hold of the grapnel . It was in obeying this peculiarity of their nature , that a shoal of these fish , as they swept by in front of my grandfather*s residence , would sometimes , at flood tide , approach so near to the shore as to come in contact with the water fence- the firm posts of which they would clasp and struggle to uptear , till they lashed the water into a foam with their powerful wings . This bold invasion of his landmarks my grandfather determined to resent . " - pp. 7 -9 . How he had his revenge we shall not stop to tell , because that , it seems , is matter only of tradition ; and we pass to the account of what the author did himself . Modern sportsmen , far from attacking , had been , it seems , " content to be let alone by the Devil-fish. " // " It was during the month of August , 1837 , that , attended by my children , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of sea-bathing , I made an excursion to Bay Point , a small summer settlement , situated at the northeastern outlet of Port Royal Sound . There , for the first time , I witnessed the sporting of these sea-monsters on the surface , and conceived the idea of taking them with the harpoon . " In crossing from Bay Point to Hilton Head , on a visit , I saw eight Devil-fish , one directly in the track of my boat as I spanked away under a press of sail . He thrust up both wings a foot above the surface and kept them steadily erect , as if to act for sails . I liked not the cradle thus offered me , and veered the boat so as just to miss him . He never budged , and I passed so near as easily to have harpooned him , if the implements had been at hand . " The Devil-fish ( in numbers thus unusual ) had doubtless run into the inlet to escape the gales ; for , from repeated observations , I am persuaded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forewarned of convulsions in their proper element . " The sight of these fish disturbed my rest , and I felt uncomfortable , until I found myself planning an attack , and providing myself with the needful apparatus . A harpoon two inches wide in the barb , between two and three feet in the shank ( a regular whaler ) , was turned out from the work-shop . Forty fathoms of half-inch rope were purchased and stretched . To one end the harpoon was firmly attached ; the other , passing through a hole cut in the bottom of a tub in which the rope was carefully coiled , was to be fastened to the forecastle . An eight-oared boat was inspected , new thwarted and new thole-pinned ; and a clete nailed firmly on the forecastle to support the right foot of the harpooner . A day was fixed , and friends and sportsmen were invited to repair to the field of action ; but the weather was unpropitious , and but two boats appeared . " At six o'clock , on the 16th of August , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my boat , manned by six oarsmen and a steersman , I was accompanied by my son , a youth under eighteen . In the second boat were G. P. E. and W. C. , Esqrs. , with a crew of four men . The armament of the larger consisted , besides the harpoon , of a lance , hatchet , and rifle ; that of the smaller boat was two bayonets fixed in long staves ( the line for a second harpoon having been swept away by the tide ) . We stretched ' away before a fresh northeaster , for the Bay gall on Hilton Head , and then struck sail and made all snug for action . " We rowed slowly along between the Bay gall breaker and the shore , on the early ebb , expecting to meet the Devil-fish on their // return from Skull Creek , the scene of their high-water gambols . The smaller boat , with outspread sails , stretched off and on , traversing the same region , but on different lines . No fish were seen . The ebb was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed on the beach at Hilton Head , yet kept the boat afloat and two hands on the look-out . Before a quarter of an hour had elapsed , There ! ' cried our look-out man . I followed the direction of his hand , - it pointed to Skull Creek channel , and I saw the wing of the fish two feet above water . There was no mistaking it , - it was a Devil-fish . One shout summons the crew to their posts , - the oarsmen spring to their oars , - the red flag is raised to signal our consort , - and we went roaring on in the direction in which we had seen him . Once again , before we had accomplished the distance , he appeared a moment on the surface . " The place of harpooner I had not the generosity to yield to any one ; so I planted myself on the forecastle , my left leg advanced , my right supported by the clete , my harpoon poised , and three fathoms of rope lying loose on the thwart behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart throbbed audibly , and I scarce breathed while expecting him to emerge from the spot yet rippled by his wake . The water was ten fathoms deep , but so turbid that you could not see six inches beneath the surface . We had small chance of striking him while his visits to the surface were so sudden and brief . There he is behind us ! ' Our oarsmen backed with all their might . Before we reached the spot he was gone ; but soon reappeared on our right , whisking around us with great velocity , and with a movement singularly eccentric . He crossed the bow , - his wing only is visible , - on which side is his body ? I hurled down my harpoon with all my force . The staff came bounding up from below , to show me that I had missed . In the twinkling of an eye , the fish flung himself on his back , darted under the boat , and showed himself at the stern , belly up . We dashed at him wherever he appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always too late . Suddenly his broad black back was lifted above the water directly before our bow . Forward ! ' the oarsmen bend to the stroke , but before we could gain our distance , his tail flies up and he is plunging downward for his depths . I could not resist , - I pitched my harpoon from the distance of full thirty feet . It went whizzing through the air , and cleaved the water just beneath the spot where the fish had disappeared . My companions in our consort ( who had now approached within fifty yards ) observed the staff quiver for a second , before it disappeared beneath the water . This was unobserved by myself , and I was drawing in my line to prepare for a new throw , when , ho ! the line stopped short ! // Is it possible ? I have him , - the Devil-fish is struck ! ' Out flies the line from the bow , - a joyful shout bursts from our crew , - our consort is lashed to our stern , - E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by this most diabolical of locomotives . " Thirty fathoms are run out , and 1 venture a turn round the stem . The harpoon holds , and he leads gallantly off for Middle Bank , - the two boats in tow . He pushed dead in the eye of a stiff northeaster . His motion is not so rapid as we expected , but regular and business-like , - reminding one of the motion of a canal-boat drawn by a team of stout horses . We drew upon the line , that we might force him to the surface and spear him . I found that was no fun . Behold me now reclined on the stern seat , taking breath after my pull , and lifting my umbrella to repel the heat of the sun . It was very pleasant to see the woods of Hilton Head recede , and the hammocks of Paris Island grow into distinctness as we moved along under this novel , and yet unpatented , impelling power ! " A lance is plunged into him , but " it is flung out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spearsman , by the convulsive muscular effort of the fish . When drawn up , the iron is found bent like a reaping-hook , and the staff broken in the socket . " He seems to gather velocity as he goes ; he gets used to his harness ; a bayonet is plunged into his body ; another shudder of the fish , and the bayonet snaps short off at the eye , - the blade remaining buried in his body . A second is driven in , and that is snapped off in the blade . At every blow we had dealt him , his power seemed to have increased , and he now swept down for Egg Bank , with a speed that looked ominous . The tide was now flood , the wind , still fresh , had shifted to the east ; six oars were put out and pulled lustily against him , yet he carried us rapidly seaward , against all these impeding forces . He seemed to suck in fresh vigor from the ocean water . Egg Bank was now but one hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rrhe Devilfish refused , and drew the whole concern in the opposite direction . Force him , then , to the surface . ' He popt up unexpectedly under the bow , lifted one wing four feet in the air , and , bringing it suddenly down , swept off every oar from the starboard side of the boat ; they were not broken , but wrenched out of the hands of the oarsmen as by an electric shock . One man was knocked beneath the thwarts by the rebound of an oar , and was laid almost speechless on the platform , - quite hors de combat . Fresh hands are brought from the smaller boat ; the fish now leads off with thirty fathoms of rope , - he steers for Joyner 's Bank . Bay Point recedes , Egg Bank disappears , Chaplin 's Island lies behind us , and Hilton Head again approaches ; . but it is the eastern face 28 * // of the island that now presents itself . The breakers of the Gaskin Bank begin to loom in our horizon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A doubt of capturing the fish began now to steal over our minds , and show itself in our faces ; our means of assailing so powerful an antagonist were too inadequate ; nothing remained but to bowse on him once more , and endeavour to despatch him with the weapons that remained to us . Three fresh hands took the rope , and , after giving him a long run to weary him to the uttermost , we succeeded in drawing him to the surface . He lay on his back without motion , - and we looked on victory as certain . The socket of the harpoon appeared sticking out from the belly of the fish ; the whole shank was buried in his body . We saw neither tail , nor head , nor horns , nor wings , - nothing but an unsightly white mass , undistinguished by member or feature . After a moment 's pause , to single out some spot for a mortal blow , I plunged the lance , socket and all , into the centre of this white mass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turn round the gunwale , to prevent its slipping . The boat lurched with the swell of the sea , - and the moment the dead weight of the fish , unsupported by the water , was felt , the harpoon tore out ! An instant before , I saw it driven to the socket in the body of the fish ; the next , it was held up in air , in the hands of the negro , bent like a scythe . There was time , if there had been presence of mind , to plunge it anew into the fish , which floated a second or two on the surface . The moment was lost ! I will not attempt to describe the bitter disappointment that pervaded the party . For a moment only , a faint hope revived ; my lance , secured by a cord , was still in his body , - it might hold him ! Clear my line , boys ! ' Alas ! the weight of the fish is too much for my tackle , - the line flies through my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lance is drawn through the orifice by which it entered , - and the fish is gone ! We spoke not a word , but set our sails , and returned to the beach at Bay Point . We felt like mariners who , after a hard conflict , had sunk a gallant adversary at sea , yet saved not a single trophy from the wreck to serve as a memorial of their exploit . " Yet , keenly as we felt our disappointment , there is not one of us who would willingly have been elsewhere , - and the pleasurable excitement of our three hours ' run will be remembered to the end of our lives . " - pp. 13-20 . The account is closed with a threat of another attempt , which was soon carried into execution . On the day appointed , " three boats appeared at the rendezvous at Bay // Point , fully equipped for the sport , and commenced a cruise full of exciting incident and eminently successful . " The whole was planned and conducted under the auspices of Mr. Elliott ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spoken of as Piscator , was written by another of the party . " We were now moving leisurely along the Hilton Head shore , looking out for our foe in one of his old haunts , about a large trunk , which rose , black with age and barnacles , some ten or fifteen feet above water . Not a sign of him was discovered . We looked in the direction of Skull Creek , but he was obviously not there , for the surface was as quiet as if he had never ruffled it . A glance towards the sea at our backs gave us as little satisfaction . In the mean time , it was evident , from the water.marks on our left , that the flood was far advanced , and that the bank would soon be too deep to reach him , if he came fishing upon it . Impatience was visible in every countenance . " The day is fine enough , ' said P. ; they ought to be hereabouts , for the boys saw them only yesterday . ' " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing the rogues tell us , especially if a Devil.fish is in the matter . You know their superstition . ' " Ah ! gentlemen , ' exclaimed a third , rising from his seat , and gaping with ennui , this comes of taking things too late ; you should have followed my advice , and have come out earlier . As it is , I see we shall have no sport . ' " Look on your right ! ' shouted a voice from the other boat . " The whole party were , in an instant , on their feet . There they were , to be sure . One , two , three ; only a few hundred yards from us , rioting and tumbling fantastically over each other 's wakes . " Where is the harpoon ? ' - the rifle ! - the rifle ! ' exclaimed several voices at once . " Gentlemen , do be quiet , ' said P. , as he leaped on the forecastle , catching up , at the same time , the harpoon , which lay on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of this service before ; pray go aft , and let me have a clear swing . ' " A few brisk strokes brought us in the midst of the playground of the Devil-fish , over a bank two or three fathoms deep . No part of their bodies was , however , to be seen ; nothing but their broad , dingy flaps , their coppered edges glancing to the sun , as they rose and sunk in graceful parabolas through the turbid brine . All besides was dark : it was not possible to know where to strike . Their motions , too , were so rapid and disorderly , and withal transiently perceptible , that it required our utmost efforts to // shift our boat into available positions . But our facile princeps - the master-spirit of fishermen - was at the bow . An opportunity at last offered , and away went the harpoon , and , in a twinkling , the smallest fish disappeared : he had felt the touch of its keen edge , and instantly took fright . Another followed his example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed concerned only to show how swiftly and nimbly he could acquit himself . Instead of emerging , as before , at intervals of a few yards , he took reaches of twenty or thirty at a time , - not one of them on the same line with another , - gyrating , as he went , into the most fantastic attitudes . At last , the surface was all quiet : every one held his breath . A heavy whirl appeared at the head of the boat , - what did it mean ? But Piscator knew , and the harpoon once more took flight , and , descending five or six feet into the water , stood quivering there for a moment , and then van . ished , with the velocity of light . " Habet ! ' shouted a sort of linguist ( who was always boring us with his scrap Latin , to make amends , it was supposed , for his bad English ) , as he grasped the line , and huzzaed , until the shore resounded with the music of his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after his other frolics , had vaulted entirely on his back , and came floating on the tide stomach upwards ; his white form reflected along the surface for several yards . A mark so palpable could hardly escape the stroke of our weapon : it entered his abdomen about the middle , and cut its way right down nearly three feet into his vitals . The line was clear for him to the extent of thirty fathoms ; but , after running fifteen or twenty , he went plumb to the bottom , defying every effort at removal . At length he gave way , and , after much tugging , rose loggishly to the top , - but daylight inspired him with new strength , and he bounded off again at the height of his speed . Our man of particles was now in a sore dilemma . This learned Theban ' had been rude enough to throw the line so carelessly about his feet , that there was every prospect of his being speedily caught in its flying tangles , and ducked soundly for his pains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenward showed that would not answer ; so , clearing the forecastle at a bound , he lit in the body of the boat , with no other harm done than some commotion among the rigging , a cry of wonderment from the oarsmen , and sundry ejaculations of thanksgiving to Providence from himself . The line now slacked , and the Devil-fish was obviously giving out . He yielded freely to the hand , and , as the last scene in the drama approached , the boats gathered around to witness his expiring struggles . The line swayed , and up he rose , his huge goggles peering out upon us , while his antenam dangled heavily about , in // token of the extremest exhaustion . One more effort at escape followed : but it was too late , - the lances were ready , and soon consummated the work of death ; after which , we all joined in merry procession towards the shore . We drew the Devil-fish on the sands , and found him , on measurement , to be fifteen feet in width . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the Devil-fish . After striking another , which finally escaped , Piscator with his party went at a late hour to the assistance of their consort , then made fast by the harpoon to a third of great power , which had defeated all attempts at capture . " We threw ourselves on the course of the other boat , some forty or fifty yards ahead . " Where is the Devil-fish ? ' shouted P. " A sign with the hand directed us some distance beyond , where we saw indistinctly the wings of the Devil-fish , shooting alternately out to the height of a foot or more . We were soon over him ; but , with all his skill , P. could not reach his body . Stroke after stroke failed . The rocking of the boat , and the exhaustion of the oarsmen , under their constant exertions to keep up with him , made things still worse . Was he to escape from us , after all ? Strike , Sir , for the black side of his wing ' ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in him . As before , the Devil.fish now went directly for the bottom ; but we were in the channel , and that resource could not avail him . He played about for some time , but we finally succeeded in bringing him up within six feet of us , where we pierced him with our lances until life was gone . But no force could lift him higher . By this time another boat had come from the Point to our aid , which , with the two we had already , it was thought , would be quite sufficient to take our fish ashore . The sails were set , and the oars put out to the number of eighteen ; the wind , too , was as fair as could be wished , - still there was no headway . The Devil.fish was , indeed , unmanageable ; and but for the force of the wind counteracting the outward tendencies of the tide , we must have been inevitably swept to sea , or have cut him loose to save ourselves . Darkness , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing , and we were yet almost stationary . Our friends on shore , alarmed at our situation , set up lights for us , which , owing to their dispersion , did more to confound than guide us . The stars came out ; but nothing seemed to break the general darkness , except the agitation of the oars in the water , and the rolling of the Devil.fish , as he now and then emerged on a bed of fire to the surface . At nine o'clock , we ran aground upon a // shoal , which proved to be Egg Bank . We were now at a stand , and a council was called . It was impossible to get the Devil-fish over the bank , for the tide was not high enough ; and the roar of the breakers behind us , added to the rising of the wind , informed us too plainly that we could not safely remain where we were . Perhaps the Devil-fish might be anchored : but no anchor was to be had ; no buoy , - not even a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The resource left us was a hard one ; but there was no choice , - we must abandon him , - we could do no more . Before taking leave of him , however , we drew him up into three feet water . Jacet ingens littore truncus ,  --  et sine nomine corpus . ' There he lay , extending twenty feet by the wings , and his other parts in proportion ; and the waves rippling in pearly heaps around his black form , which stood eight feet in diameter above the water . We cut out our harpoons , pushed our boats through a neighbouring swash , and , in a few moments , found ourselves surrounded by the welcoming eyes of beauty . " It is not to be inferred , from the concluding passage of the narrative just quoted , that the fish was eight feet in depth , - but merely that , grounding in three feet water , such was his depth that a portion of his back , equal to eight feet in diameter , was still left above water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikingly picturesque than the appearance of the Devil-fish just before he stranded . The night was dark , - the sea brilliantly luminous , - the breakers were roaring a short distance from us , and the ground-swell , that at intervals lifted us up , admonished us that we were in shoal water . Looking behind us , we beheld the Devil-fish , which we had in tow , mounted up on the crest of an advancing wave . His wings outspread , his dark outline distinctly marked , and separated from the surrounding waters by a starry belt ' of phosphoric fire , - he seemed to our excited imaginations like some monster Vampire , hovering above our heads , and threatening to crush us beneath his wings ! There was scarcely time for apprehension before he grounded , and that in water sufficiefitly deep to keep our boats afloat . " To leap into the sea ,  --  to mount his back in triumph , and shout a wild huzza ! were impulses that we all felt and obeyed . Our next thought was to secure our retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the wind was rising , - the tide falling . If we grounded , and were caught in that situation by the next flood , our boats would be beaten to pieces , and we should have but small chance for our lives ! The manner of our extrication has been already told . " - pp. 32 - 34. // Dr. De Kay says " The Sea Devil , or Oceanic Vampire , as it has been not inaptly named , is known to seize the cables of small vessels at anchor , and draw them for several miles with great velocity . Aa instance of this kind was related to me , by a credible eyewitness , as having occurred in the harbour of Charleston . A schooner , lying at anchor , was suddenly seen moving across the harbour with great rapidity , impelled by some unknown and mysterious power . Upon approaching the opposite shore , its course was changed so suddenly as nearly to capsize the vessel , when it again crossed the harbour with its former velocity , and the same scene was repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbour were repeated several times , in the presence of hundreds of spectators , and suddenly ceased . " - p.57 . Mr. Elliott adds - " The same thing happened about fifteen years ago , in one of the inlets on the coast of Georgia . A trading-vessel lay at anchor , and , while her crew were on shore , one of these fish seized the cable and dragged her off , anchor and all , to the consternation of the sailors , who pursued their retreating hark for some miles in their boat , and regained her , when the Devil-fish had contrived , or seen fit , to disengage himself from his prize . " - p. 58 . These animated descriptions are followed by one of " Drum-fishing . " These fish derive their name " from the noise they make , resembling the tap of a drum , which is so loud , that , in calm weather , and in the afternoon , which is their favorite time for drumming , it may be heard at the distance of several hundred yards from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish in America . It measures ordinarily three feet in length , and weighs from thirty to forty pounds . It is beautifully marked on the sides , hy broad , dark , transverse stripes , alternating with silver , - or else exhibits an uniform bright gold color , which fades , soon after it is taken , into the hues already described . I give you the medium weight and size of the fish , not the extreme . I have taken one which measured four feet six inches in length , and weighed eighty-five pounds . Out of twenty taken by me on a particular day , during the present season ( April ) , there were three weighing from sixty-five to seventy pounds each . The smaller-sized fish are excellent for table use , - their roes , especially , are a great delicacy ; the larger are only valuable when salted and cured like codfish , from // which when dressed they are scarcely distinguishable in flavor . The planters of this vicinity are skilful fishermen and much devoted to the sport . They succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand of these fish : and when I add , that , except the small number consumed in their families , the remainder were salted and distributed among their slaves , not in lieu of , but in addition to , their ordinary subsistence , you will perceive that this is a case wherein the love of sport and the practice of charity are singularly coincident. " - p. 62 . " The unpractised sportsman , who supposes that their bite will he in proportion to their size and strength , will draw up many a naked hook , before he draws a fish . They approach cautiously , and almost as if they expected a snare . As soon as you feel him certainly at your hook , jerk with your utmost strength , and draw quickly upon him , until you have fixed the hook in his jaws . The instant he feels the smart , he dashes off with all his force : and this is the critical moment , - for if you resist him too forcibly , he breaks your tackle , or tears out your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he darts towards you , and shakes the hook out of his mouth . A just medium ( as Sterne says ) prevents all conclusions . ' In medio tutissimus ibis . You must give him play , keeping your line tight , yet not overstrained , preserving an equable pressure , - managing your line with one hand , and keeping the other in reserve , either to draw in rapidly when the run is towards you , or to regulate the velocity when the run is against you and severe . By degrees , the efforts of the fish relax , and he is drawn to the surface . At sight of the sun , he makes a final effort to escape , and plunges till he has reached the bottom . The fatal hook still adheres to his jaws , and when he reappears exhausted , on the surface of the water , it is only to turn on his back , and resign himself to his fate . A barbed iron , fastened to a wooden staff , is then struck into him , and you lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are occupied five minutes in taking a fish : but if the tide be strong , and the fish large , your sport may last fifteen . " There is great uncertainty attending this sport ; the patience of the fisherman may be severely tested : sometimes you have the mortification to hear them drumming beneath your boat , while they stubbornly refuse to be taken , - rejecting untasted the most tempting baits you can offer : at other times they are in better humor . As a general rule , with five lines in your boat , you may count on fifteen or twenty fish as the result of a day 's sport . Occasionally , you have memorable luck ; - sixty-three were taken during the present season by a boat with seven lines , and I once knew a boat with ten lines to take as many as ninety-six ; the // best success I have met with , personally , was to take forty , to three lines ; - eighteen fish fell to my share of the sport ; my two oarsmen took the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain ; - her gunwale was but a few inches above the water , and we slung the ten ( which were de trop ) along-side , by a rope . In this situation we were attacked by sharks . These grim companions ' would range up along-side , and make a rush at them to cut them off : and we were compelled to beat them off with boat-hooks . A little more boldness in their attack , and we must have fallen victims ; for a single blow from their tails would have filled our overloaded boat , - as it happened we were unattended by any other boat which could have rendered assistance , and were full three miles from shore . In the sport of this day , my gloves were torn into shreds by the friction of the line , and my fingers so blistered by the severity of the play , that I was incapable of renewing my sport for several days . " - pp. 62- 65 . The account of Bass-fishing is particularly agreeable for the graceful touches , which disclose a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indicate the kindness of good-fellowship in sport . It is important , it seems , for the fisherman to " take his drop " with great accuracy , where the action of the water has left irregular masses on the rocky bed , " amidst whose crags and crannies the sea-weeds grow and shell-fish congregate , " and where " the larger fish repair for subsistence . " Mr. Elliott gives his instructions with a precision worthy of the chief topographical engineer among fishermen . " Let him row over from Bay Point towards the Hilton Head shore , - putting the last hammock ( an umbrella-shaped cedar now marks the spot ) , on the south-western end of Edings ' island , in line with the most northwardly point of the same island ; and extend the chord of this arc , until he opens the first woods of Chaplin 's island , beyond the Bay Point beach . Dropping his anchor at the precise intersection of these two lines , he has the best ground , probably , in the whole Southern country ; where he may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass , and drum in abundance , and , occasionally , all of them on the same day . " - p. 67 . Here follows a graphic sketch of the residence of a distinguished statesman and gentleman of the old school . " A third line was formerly drawn in confirmation of the above : it was by placing the last pines on Hilton Head beach in // range with the mansion-house of Gen. C. C. Pinckney , on Pinckney island . But this mansion no longer exists : it was swept away in one of the fearful hurricanes that vex our coast ! To this spot that sterling patriot and lion-hearted soldier retired from the arena of political life , to spend the evening of his days in social enjoyment and literary relaxation . On a small island , attached to the larger one , which hears his name , and which , jutting out into the bay , afforded a delightful view of the ocean , he fixed his residence . There , in the midst of forests of oak , laurel , and palmetto , the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory , with its apparatus for chemical experiments , - the library , stored with works of science in various tongues ; there bloomed the nursery for exotics ; and there was found each other appliance with which taste and intelligence surround the abodes of wealth . It is melancholy to reflect on the utter destruction that followed , even before the venerable prpprietor had been gathered to his fathers ! The ocean swallowed up every thing : and it is literally true , that the sea-monster now flaps his wings over the very spot where his hearthstone was placed , where the rites of an elegant hospitality were so Unstintedly dispensed , and where the delighted guest listened to many an instructive anecdote and unrecorded yet significant incident of the revolutionary period , as they flowed from the cheerful lips of the patriot . " - pp. 67- 68 . Vhile the ocean has swallowed up that beautiful abode , and the head of that magnificent old man who adorned its hall has been laid low , the advance of time , with the irresistible changes it has brought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The memory of that order of men who were reared in it still rises in the thought of the South Carolinian , and he occasionally drops an expression of regret , that the colony , to which he owes his birth as an American , should ever have taken part in that contest ( for the rights of others , as he thinks , rather than her own ) which made her one of these States . As he believes , she had no grievances that called very urgently for redress . It was from friendly regard , he thinks , and sympathy for her sister colonies , that she took part in the dispute . And what , he asks , has she gained by it ? We do not know or suppose that Mr. Elliott entertains any such views ; but that they have found favor in South Carolina during the excitements of the last twenty years , we have good reason to believe . The change , by the way , is // not altogether peculiar to any part of this country ; for we hear regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the modes of life . But it is worth a moment 's reflection to imagine what would probably have been the result , - especially in reference to one subject , to which allusion is so directly made in this book that we ought to take some notice of it , - if South Carolina had decided on a different course , and had kept clear of the struggle for independence . Let us suppose her leading men to have foreseen something of what has followed that her aristocracy of gentlemen was to disappear with the laws of primogeniture ; that the favored colony of England , after the contest should be over , was to become one of a cluster of States who would , in her view , get the advantage of her , and that her graceful performance of the duties of loyalty was to be exchanged for what they would then have considered as vulgar squabbles about the nullification of laws that she deemed to be unjust ; that , concluding it likely to be a bad bargain for them , even in case of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this - " We can not take arms against our neighbours and friends , but we make no complaints . Suffer us to be passive spectators only of the approaching contest , and we are content to remain as we are . Deal with the other colonies as you please ; but do not require us to fight them . " We may easily believe that the ministry would have agreed to this , and have answered , - " Be it so . Remain quiet and obedient , and we will manage the fight without your aid . " The revolutionary war would have proceeded . The result would probably have been the same as it proved to be , without the aid of South Carolina , efficient as that was ; and she would have remained in the enjoyment of all her privileges as a loyal colony , under the direction and care of a governor by royal appointment ; while the States that were formed about her would have managed their own concerns . Affairs would have gone on accordingly , to the entire satisfaction , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown throughout this province of South Carolina , until that period , some fifteen years since , when the government " at home " must have spoken very nearly as it did to the colonies of the West Indies - " You have among you a certain in // stitution ' which is offensive to the age . It is imputed as a disgrace to the British name , and we so regard it . We must rid ourselves of the stigma that is attached to it . If you require laborers of African blood for the cultivation of any part of your grounds , hire them and pay them . But that peculiar institution must be abolished . Here are twenty millions of pounds sterling , which we appropriate to compensate for its abolition . Your share of it is ready . You may take it or leave it . But complaints are idle , and we will have no words . Whatever may be said of the wise and patriarchal use of slavery , its abuses are intolerable to humanity . This must be the end of it among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the South to be important to the prosperity of that region , for reasons that are hinted at by the author , an imperial edict of this character would probably have been thought to place the colony on a footing of great disadvantage in comparison with the States in that neighbourhood . Without favoring in any way the supposed designs of abolitionists , we think differently as to the comparative advantage that would ensue in any community from the extinction or continuance of the system of slave labor . But , however that may he , abolition , come how it might , would appear to the present leaders of South Carolina as an event earnestly to be deprecated . And while they are disposed somewhat to disparage the value of the Union , it is as well to present for consideration the inevitable consequences of the only alternative that would have remained to her , if she had not become one of us . In the case supposed , she would probably have stood , in the end , an humble applicant for " annexation " to this Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let us turn from these surmises of difference on grave matters to more attractive subjects . The book contains spirited sketches of the wild-cat hunt , the deer hunt , and other sports of the woods , from which we should be glad to make extracts ; but we have hardly room to do more than to thank Mr. Elliott for the interesting account which he has given of Southern sports in the forest . Veteran as he is becoming now , may he still live to share in the excitement of his favorite recreations as long as he desires ; and when Hilton Head and the waters of Port Royal sound shall cease to know him , may some descendant , worthy of // such parentage , survive to recount his exploits , and especially that which follows here . We commend it to the cautious consideration of all those who are inclined to wade into an investigation of the habits of sharks . " I used to push over from Bay Point at early flood , - land as the inner side of the bank , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat , walk over to the sea-side of the bank , with a servant or two to carry bait and lines ,  --  and , wading out into the surf waist-deep , toss my line into the breakers in quest of bass . I was usually armed with a light spear ; for as the clear , transparent wave came rolling in from the deep , - and as the pearly fragments of sea-shell passed glittering by you with the flux and reflux of the tide , - objects were occasionally encountered , as brilliant , perhaps , but by no means as pleasant to look upon : the eyes and jagged spines of immense stingrays , buried in the sand , and lying in wait for their prey ! One incautious step , and your leg may be transfixed by the yenomed weapon ! Sometimes , indeed , the bass would approach close to your feet , in couples , and gaze upon you , seemingly , with curiosity and alarm ! You might perceive their pectoral fins in rapid play , as if they panted ; while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear , they vanished in an instant , and left your weapon buried innocently in the sand . On one delightful day , I was tempted to wade deeper than usual into the sea , which was beautifully clear . I passed along the narrow ridge of a reef , which extended eastwardly to a considerable distance from the main bank , while a swash of some depth lay close with in . I had unsconsciously remained , until the advancing tide had covered the highest parts of the ridge full waist-deep . Behind me stood my servant Cain , ' with my spear and a wicker-basket of bait . An exclamation of terror from him made me turn , - when I beheld , but a few yards distant , between us and the shore , and intercepting our retreat , a large shark , close on the side of the ridge , head on for us , and waving his tail backwards and forward , with a deliberate sculling motion ! My spear , ' said I , - keep close to me , and shout when I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes almost starting from their sockets , ) another one ! * I looked , and saw , not one , but two other sharks , lying behind the first , all in line , and in the same attitude ! Doubtless the bait in the wicker-basket had attracted them , - the advancing tide had carried them the scent , and these grim pointers had paused to reconnoitre , before they rushed on their prey ! If they attacked us , we were gone ! Not a moment was to be lost ! It was one of those frequent cases in which we find 29* // safety in audacity . Repeating my order to Cain , and grasping my spear in both hands , I rushed upon the leading shark , and struck it down violently across his nose , - shouting at the same time at the top of my voice , - while Cain , in a perfect agony of fear , gave a loud yell and fell at full length in the water ! The manouvre succeeded ; the sharks ran off for deep water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back , until we had accomplished the one hundred and fifty yards over which we had to wade before we regained the bank ! " To be devoured by sharks is one of the last deaths that I should choose . At this distance of time , I do not think of the adventure without a shudder . The sea is still as transparent as on that day , - the sea-shells still as bright , - the graceful bass still pants , as he glides doubtingly by , - but these things tempt me not to renew my sport . My mind reverts to other objects : the jagged barb of the stingray , lying in wait for his prey , - and the outstretched jaws of the all-devouring shark , in which I had so narrowly escaped being engulfed ! Who can endure the thought of being sepulchred in the maw and gulf of the ravening salt-sea shark ' ? Not I ! - I speak it in all sincerity . This was my last essay , - and I henceforth leave to younger and more adventurous sportsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
