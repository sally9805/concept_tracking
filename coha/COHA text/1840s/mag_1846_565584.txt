txt AccoRDING to the enumeration made in August , 1845 , there were in Connecticut 85,275 children , between the ages of four and sixteen years . These are very unequally distributed through 1644 school districts . The average number to each district is fifty one ; but there are forty one districts with an average of less than five ; while there are ninety six districts with an average of more than two hundred and forty . Several of the latter , however , are in our principal cities , in which a single district contains several schools . The capital of the School Fund is $2,070,055 ; producing an annual dividend of $119,384 . This divided among 85,275 children , gives to each $ 1,40 . This dividend is designed to be distributed impartially ; yet the distribution is attended , in the different districts , with very different advantages . For in the smaller districts with an average of only five children , the amount received is only $7,00 ;  --  a sum too small to be of any practical benefit : while in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 ; a sum sufficient to sustain a school for three fourths of the year . It may well be submitted to the wisdom of our legislators , whether there ought not to be some protection extended to the scattered families who consent to cultivate the rugged hillsides , and the deep ravines of our mountains , or the less fertile plains . If some $40 or $50 were appropriated to each district , without regard to the number of children ; and the balance of the dividend were distributed , according to the present system ; we are confident that greater benefits would be secured . We would also suggest , that the distribution of this balance should be made according to the amount of actual attendance at school ; and that the first named appropriation should in no case be made , unless a school had been sustained in the district , for a specified portion of the preceding year . The Report before us , in addition to its valuable statistical tables , contains many plans and suggestions , from the visitors of the various school societies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is also appended an excellent essay " On the necessity and means of improving the common schools of Connecticut , " from the able pen of Rev. N. Porter , Jr. , to which a premium of $100 had been previously adjudged . We regard it as ominous of good , that the attention of the public is so extensively awakened to this subject . The suggestions , from so many important sources , concerning the evils in our common school system , which evils prevent , in a great degree , a realization of the benefits of that system , will not have been made to the intelligence of the State , without producing good results . The valuable historical facts contained in the essay , should be well pondered . The plans for improvements , contained both in that and in the reports of the school visitors , should secure thorough consideration and efficient action ; until our noble school fund shall be made to accomplish the full amount of its benevolent design , and our schools become all that the people can and will make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities and importance of the subject . We awaited the appearance of this Report , and especially of the Essay , with interest . But we regret to say , that what we are assured is * Annual Report of the Superintendent of Common Schools of Connecticut , to the General Assembly , May , 1846. // the most important evil in our common school operations , has not been pointed out , and exposed with that particularity which its importance demands . And it is chiefly for the purpose , of calling the attention of our readers to this , that we have taken up the subject . It is to little purpose indeed , that we bestow our corrective appliances to the lesser evils that lie on the surface , while there is a greater evil that is inherent in the system . Not that we design to overlook the lesser evils , for we regard them as important . They shall have our notice in their appropriate place . But we should feel that we were writing to little purpose , if we did not first effectually expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others would be more easily abated . For though all else in the system be perfect , yet that system can never accomplish more than a half-way measure of good , while this important defect remains . We allude to the want of proper class*/ication ;  --  the placing in the same school , and under the same teacher , pupils of every age and of every variety of attainments . You may go into almost any school in the State for an illustration of the evil . You will find collected , from thirty to fifty children , of all ages , from four years to sixteen . You may also find the teacher charged with the care of some others too young to receive any other benefit from their attendance than the needfiil attentions which their mothers found it inconvenient to give them at home . The collection will probably be found to be still further enlarged and diversified , by the attendance of a few , who have ad vanced beyond the proper age of attending ; and who , feeling their incapacity for the business of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain that modicum of knowledge which they failed to acquire in the appropriate season . Here , then , you find a company of forty or fifty , perhaps , from two to twenty years of age . Scarcely any two of them are of the same age , or have the same attainments . Probably no half dozen of them can be advantageo usly put in the same class and under one regimen . Now consider , for a moment , how the time of the teacher must be employed . First in the list of exercises , there are some six or eight that must be called up separately , to learn the alphabet , or to spell words of two or three letters . Then two or three classes , of two , three or four each , for spelling and readino ; and probably two other classes , of the more advanced pupils , in each of these exercises . Next there will be two or three classes in geography ; and as many in grammar ; - one or two , also , in philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seldom attempted , and the teacher must give individual and separate assistance to as many as may chance to be pursuing the study . the same is true of the exercise of writing . In addition to all this , there will be one or two of the pupils , of more ambition than knowledge , asking to he initiated into the mysteries of the " art " of navigation or of surveying ; and one or two others waiting to be instructed in the art of book-keeping - perhaps in the fine arts , also , and plain and fancy needle-work . We need not extend the enumeration . Now it is plain , that the time must be so divided among this multiplicity of exercises , that no one of them can receive any proper attention . If any scholar can receive the aid of the teacher from two to five niinutes , he has his full proportion . It should be remembered , too , that this trifling amount of aid is imparted , while the mind is distracted with the care of the school ; - while here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions are two or three more , watch . ing their opportunities , while the teacher is employed , to carry for . // ward their stealthy recreations : and as many others , in different parts of the room , addressing the teacher , or making significant signs to engage his attention , that they may propose some inquiries for assistance , or beg for some indispensable indulgence . Now , what , in these circumstances , can be accomplished in the way of imparting , or of receiving instruction ? Bedlam itself is scarcely less fitted for any clear and well directed mental effort . The teacher puts in requisition all his energies ; but nothing is done to any good purpose . Distracted and exhausted , he feels , at the close of the day , that very little good has be en accomplished . The pupil , too , who is desirous of making any important acquisitions , feels assured that his chief attainments must be made in his evening hours , by the family fire-side , rather than in the school-room . He finds that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multiplicity of exercises going on around him , and in every variety of tone that is ludicrous and diverting , and interspersed with the more disquieting exercises of a needful discipline , most effectually prevent any five successive minutes of undiverted application . We are not drawing a caricature . Every one who has seen a Connecticut school , has seen the living original . If some schools exhibit a better appearance , in some respects , than is here described , there are others where the evils greatly transcend this description . Such , essentially , is the condition of the public schools of the state . Arid the public attention should he directed to the cause of this . It should not be permitted to be diverted from this single cause , until it is understood and appreciated ; nor until the disposition and deterraination are awakened for its removal . The public should see and believe that no greater attainments are ordinarily made in our schools , than might , under proper arrangements , be made at the age of ten years ; and that the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed , to give our youth as good an education for the ordinary duties of life , as is attained at a college . At so great an expense of time they should be thoroughly educated men and women . And what is of scarcely less importance , they should have intellectual habits that would qualify them for successful intellectual inquiry ever after . Whereas , they leave school with very little knowledge ; and with less of the habit or disposition to know any thing more . And our schools must remain essentially in their present condition , while this system of mal-organization continues . They are not susceptible of any very important improvement under the present organization . We feel assured that we have specified the most important , and comparatively , the only important evil . The remedy is obvious . It is simple ; economical ; efficacious . It does not , however , admit of being extensively applied , among a scattered population . But in the cities and villages every thing facilitates the application . And the population of our State , by the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in villages , and furnishing increased facilities for applying the remedy we have to propose . That remedy has been already suggested . It is the introduction of a perfect system of classification ; - so that all the pupils of any school shall constitute but one class , and all pursue the same studies . By this arrangement the whole time of the teacher would be devoted to one class , and essem. tially to each scholar . For , whether the class consist of twenty or thirty or fifty , his labor is not essentially changed . Whatever be does for the whole school , is done for each pupil . Each is personally interested in every thing that is said or done in the school ; and each is as essen // tiallv benefitted by whatever is said or done , as though it had exclusive reference to himself . The labors of the teacher , instead of being distributed among forty pupils , are concentrated upon forty ; and the entire effect reaches each individual . Let a competent committee , appointed by legislative authority , elaborate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school instruction , with as much definiteness as is given to a course of collegiate education ; having the studies of each successive year prescribed , and the books to be used in each stage of the progress particularly specified . Suppose the time fixed for completing the course to be eight years ; and the course adopted to be somewhat after the following order . The qualification for entering the first class should be simply , the requisite age of four years . The exercises of this class during the year , would be essentially those of an infant school . No great mental progress should be either expected or attem pted . Important progress , however , would be made in learning the elementary characters and sounds of the language . Many little exercises would be performed for improving the n*ind and the heart ; and much would he done in forming habits of school subordination . The second class should consist excluthe of those , who , coming from infant school , or from home , are prepared to be united into a class of reading and spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by committing useful tables ; together with some simple mental calculations for improving the reasoning powers . The school of the third class , taking the pupils from the second , and continuing the exercises of reading and spelling , should carry them into the studies of geography and history and mental arithmetic . The fourth , should be occupied with history , ancient geography , writing , and practical arithmetic ; and , perhaps , with botany or some other department of natural history . The exercises of the fifth class should carry the pupils through arithmetic and English grammar , and make further advances in civil and natural history . The sixth should be employed in natural philosophy , chemistry , physiology and rhetoric . The seventh , in algebra , geometry and natural history and science . The eighth , in trigonometry and its application to navigation and surveying , and in mental and moral science and astronomy . Let such a course of eight years be passed through , and our children would be educated ,  --  - infinitely better educated than at present : for children do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of one half the subjects of this course . It is not supposed , that at a very early age they would gain a complete mastery of these sciences . But with text-books suited to their capacities , and with teachers devoted exclusively to the subjects of their respective departments , and with abundant time and facilities for varied and minute illustration , the pupils could not fail to acquire a good understanding of the elementary principles of these subjects . And what is perhaps of quite equal importance , the child will not have gone through with this course , without acquiring habits of application , which will ensure his future intellectual progress . He will have laid a foundation , deep and broad , that will sustain a superstructure , which it will be his pastime , amid the severer avocations of future life , to rear . Though devoted to the business of the farm , or the shop , or the ware-house , he will be really an educated man . For such of our youth as are designed for college , let a classical department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English department , and carrying them through a course of three suc* // cessive classes , extending through as many years . Now there are 16,000 children in the State , in districts containing from 200 to 450 and more ;  --  a number large enough to form eight schools , with an average of forty pupils to each . And if there are enough for eight schools , within the ordinary limits of a school district , what good reason can be assigned why the pupils should not be divided into as many different grades or classes , and each class assigned to a teacher ? Why should there be this entire want of system and regularity and efficiency , when these elements are so completely at command , and their good effects may be so eminently realized ? We ask confidently with regard to these 16,000 , or about one fifth of our children , why the old helter-skelter system should not be forthwith expl.oded , and the benefits of the proposed one begin to be felt ? The buildings occupied according to the new arrangement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is convenient , some expense would be saved by having the eight several departments in as many rooms in one building . Or they might be in two buildings ; or four ; or all entirely separate . The expense of buildings could in no case be any more than under the present arrangement , and in many cases it would be greatly diminished . This is also true of the expense of teachers . For one teacher can successfully manage as many as can be conveniently assembled . The increase of the number of the class , does not increase his labors . The only restriction that need be put upon the number in any class , is to keep it down to a limit that shall not allow any slothful scholar to find a refuge for his slothfulness , in not being daily and repeatedly called upon for recitations . Besides , the lower departments might be filled with teachers of moderate acquirements , who would be satisfied with corresponding salaries . And the duties of all the departments would be rendered so comfortable and desirable , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries as ought to be offered , would be sufficient to command a supply . In the article of books , as we shall hereafter show , the expenses would be greatly abridged . Let us now see the application of this system to other conditions of society . We find by the Report , that there are 19,000 children , in districts containing from seventy to two hundred each . If these should be divided into four schools , their number would vary from eighteen to fifty , or there would be an average of thirty-four . What , in these circumstances , shall be done ? The best thing to be done , especially with regard to the most populous of these , would be to adhere to the system as already exp ) ained . Divide them into eight smaller schools , and give them to as many teachers , and let them go through with the course regularly and thoroughly . If , however , an unwillingness to incur any additional present expense , prevent the adoption of the best plan , why , adopt it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove all the evils of the old system , we must be content in being rid of a part . Let then , the plan be adopted , with this modification . Let there be four separate rooms , either in the same building , or in separate buildings as is most convenient ; with a teacher for each : and let the pupils that we have before put into the schools of the first and second grades , be here put into one ; those of the third and fourth , into the second ; those of the fifth and sixth , into the third ; and those of the seventh and eighth , into the fourth . According to this arrangement , each school would have two departments ; and two sets of exercises would be daily carried forward . At the end of each ) Thar , the upper division of each school // would be advanced to the next higher school ; one department would be graduated from the highest school , and another received into the lowest . By this arrangement we lose some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the present method . If we must have two sets ef exercises going forward in the same school , each embarassing the other , let us submit , with as much composure as possible , to the inconvenience . The teacher who has had experience under the present system , would have much consolation in his submission , by considering that one additional set of exercises is only a seventh part as bad as seven such additions . We find , again , in the report that there are 47,000 children in districts , varying from twenty to seventy each . With regard to this large class of districts , comprising more than one half the children of the State , the evil of the present system admits of much alleviation . Let there be in these schools , at least one division . In many of the larger ones , there may be two or more divisions with advantage . Let there be at least one . And let the division be made according to the necessities of the pupils ; giving to the lower department two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the higher department . If nothing better can be done , let there be a division of the house by a partition , and let some two or three of the younger classes be put under the charge of an older pupil , or of several pupils successively , with such general supervision as the teacher may be able to give . One teacher can not attend to twenty different exercises and do any thing to the purpose . And those parents who have been acting upon such a theory , ought before this to have discovered its impolicy . They do not employ any other agency at so immense disadvantage . And until they adopt a different policy here , they must continue to experience the pain of seeing season after season pass away , and their childrea making a scarcely perceptible progress in intellectual improvement . It were better for their children , in the case before us , if one teacher must have the whole , that he take each division by itself on alternate days . More would be accomplished ; and with greater comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 219 districts , varying in number from two to twenty ; and with an average of about fourteen to each district . With regard to these , there can be no division . But an advantage would be gained , even in these cases , by following the prescribed course of study . A teacher , with so limited a number , may attend to the exercises of the several classes , and secure considerable progress to the pupils . We are confident that we have pointed out the PRINCIPAL evil of the present system of our public schools , and that we have specified the ONLY remedy : - an evil which has stood in the way of the realization of full two thirds of the appropriate benefits of our schools ;  --  a remedy , that commends itself , we are persuaded , to every man 's judgment . None of the business of life is ever done at so great disadvantage , as the business of instruction . In none of the business of life , do so imperfect results follow , from the same expenditure of the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter so important , be satisfied with results so imperfect . We should not , especially , when the remedy is so accessible , and so easy of application . For 16,000 at least , of our children , the plan may be adopted in its greatest simplicity . For 19,000 more , it may be adopted , with the first named // years of valuable time to the pupils . For 47,000 , comprising nearly all of the remainder , the plan may be so far adopted as to realize very important advantages ; - attended for the current time , with only trifling additional expense , for which there will be most ample remuneration in the saving of time to the pupils . The other evils of the system , though intrinsically important , and demanding our consideration , are of little importance compared with the one now brought to view . Make the system , in every other respect , perfect as we may , yet so long as this evil is inherent , our schools will yield but a moiety , at best , of the benefits they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is burdened and distracted with twenty things at a time , he can never do any thing effectively . So long as the pupil remains under existing disadvantages , either for making personal effort , or for receiving aid from his teacher , we must be content to keep our children in school until they have grown up to manhood , and then to have them come away with an education that but poorly qualifies them for the duties of the period at which they have arrived . If the good people of Connecticut apply themselves to this subject with their accustomed shrewdness , they will not fail to perceive the evil , and to apply the remedy . in passing to consider the evils of a secondary character pertaining to our public schools , we notice as the most important , the multiplication of school books . This evil should be abated , whatever system of classification be adopted ; or whether , as at present , there be no classification . In the quality of school books there has been a great improvement . The speculations of authors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last twenty years , and which have multiplied books without number , should be tolerated with as much patience as possible , considering the benefit resulting from the improvement of their quality . But there is a limit to our endurance ; and in some of the departments it seems scarcely a virtue to submit longer to this process of multiplication . Our own familiarity with school operations had made us acquainted with the fact of the multiplicity of books in many of the departments , but the Report discloses other facts on this subject which have surprised us , and which the public will not fail to consider . The Report tells us of ten kinds of spellin*.books ; ninety-two reading* books ; fourteen grammars ; eighteen geographies ; thirty arithmetics ; nineteen histories ; and some five or six books of philosophy , astronomy and algebra . The total number , in all the departments , is two hundred and eighteen ! Two hundred and eighteen ! - while the eighteen would be a. full supply . And this process of multiplication is continually going on . Every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipse every preceding one . The editors and their publishers and agents , are busy in commending their respective works to our consideration , and in urging their claims upon our patronage ; and their endeavors are severally attended with success . Every teacher and cvery visitor has his favorite author . And the new teacher or visitor takes the responsibility of displacing books previously used , for any book which , in his estimation , is greatly superior . This process of changing is so frequently repeated , and has been so long continued , that some scholars , under the present slow method of proceeding , will not have finished any particular subject , before they will have been required to furnish themselves with the whole catalogue of books mentioned . This changing of books is attended with burdensome expense . It is felt to be peculiarly bur-. densome , because it is believed to be unnecessary . It is exceedingly vexing // to a parent to be called upon for a new book in any department , when he has already purchased some two or three or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the one now demanded , if not better . It is disadvantageous to the pupil . It were better for him to become familiar with the statements of the principles , and with the illustrations of one author , than to have his mind confused with the different statements and illustrations of many . It prevents the teacher from bringing his pupils into classes , and carrying forward the exercises in regular recitations . For some will have one book ; and some another ; and others still a third and a fourth ; and the difficulty of securing uniformity will prevent classification ; and each student will be suffered to plod his way alone . If the father 's purse and disposition correspond to the demand for books , the desk of his boy will be lumbered with them . And if the boy deem the books worth the trouble of transporting home , when his education is finished , his back will be more burdened than his head . XVe rejoice that for this evil , there is a remedy ; - one which is most effective , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saving of some dollars to every one who has a child to educate . Let there be a Board of three competent men , chosen by a committee of the legislature , whose business it should be to decide what books shall be used . Certainly a Board may be constituted that shall be able to decide this matter intelligently ; and do it better than one in fifty of the visitors or teachers , to whose indiscretion the matter is now left . It would be a tribunal not to be imposed upon by interested publishers and agents , with their mercenary puffs and partial testimonials . Nor would it preprevent the competition of authorship ; for it would powerfully elicit a better competition . As the mat Vol . IV . 67 ter now is , the success of an author depends very much upon his enlisting some powerful publishing-house in his favor ; and by means of devices , not always the most honorable or honest . And many a man of superior qualifications for authorship , is prevented from thus employing his talents , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If such a Board were constituted , to which the productions of an author were to be referred , and by which their merits were to be decided upon , that author would have confidence to make the trial . Under such an arrangernent also , he would have all the stimulus which the hope of pecuniary gain could impart . For if successful with the Board , his success with the public is ensured . What possible objection is there to applying this efficient remedy for this important evil ? The expense of such a commission , divided among the supporters of schools in the State , would not be one cent on the dollar , of what is now paid , and needlessly , to supply children with books . After a year or two , when the selection should have been made and adopted , the expense of this commission would be very trifling . What objection , we ask again , to the application of this remedy to this important evil ? The incompetency of teachers has been much descanted upon ; but we believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long session , makes but a scarcely perceptible progress in improvement , the fault should not be attributed , as a matter of course , to the teacher . The school may have been of an uncommonly heterogeneous composition . The most perhaps that the teacher could do , from day to day , was to maintain a tolerable subordination , and to hurry from one exercise to another , so as to complete the circuit , and give a moment or two to each pupil . The teacher may be // conscious of the utmost fidelity , and yet sadly conscious that he is doing but little good . In a majority of cases , the fault is not in the teacher ; and should not be charged to him . There are , however , many incompetent teachers . Some , who have not a thorough knowledge of the various branches which they undertake to teach . More , perhaps , who have so little versatility of mind , that they are incompetent to communicate what they know . They may have the light in them , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is darkness . They communicate no intelligence . They in. spire no enthusiasm . Others , again , may have knowledge , and know how to impart it ; but they may lack common sense , and their schools may be places of disorder and disprofit , through their indiscretions . The evil of incompetent teachers is generally self.inflicted ; arid , of course , generally admits of a remedy . It is to be traced , in a great measure , to the parsimony of the supporters of schools . They usually come together , in their dis . trict meeting , and decide , as well as they can , whom they would like for a teacher . In coming to this decision , a very important inquiry relates to the comparative expense of the different candidates . And too often is it the case that the district committee is instructed to engage one of doubtful qualifications , because of the moderate terms upon which he may be employed . The committee , though possessed of the power to employ whom it pleases , generally carries out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls in with the inclination of each member of that body . For each is alike interested . The candidate is presented to the examining committee . And although these persons are really independent of such caprices and partialities , and should act independently , and license only such as they believe to be qualified , yet while human nature remains such as it is , they will be in danger of being influenced in their decision , by the known wishes of those who have sent them the candidate . The friends of the candidate are their neighbors ; and they would be glad to oblige them : they are , especially , unwilling to offend them . Or the rejection of the candidate will be imputed to some sectarian prejudice , or some other partisan or local or personal feeling . Affected like other men by such influences , they are strongly tempted to decide that the candidate is qualified . They endeavor to satisfy themselves , that , in the existing circumstances , it is advisable , on the whole , to permit the examination to pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better sustained . The adoption of something like the following plan would prevent most of the evils arising from this source . Let there be a school in each of the counties , for the especial purpose of qualifying teachers ; and let every candidate for teaching be required to spend so much time at such an institution , as should be necessary to obtain the diploma which it should be authorized to confer . Such an institution would afford invaluable instruction to every candidate for teaching . There would be much useful information imparted , concerning the discipline and management of a school , and also upon the methods of teaching the various branches . This diploma , awarded by those thus familiarly acquainted with the candidate , would be his license to teach in any district where his services were solicited ; and the formality of an examination by the usual board might be dispensed with . The trustees and instructors of the institution , awarding the diploma , would not be liable to any of the suspicions which are raised against the present boards of examination . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement , on the ground of expense to the candidate who is obliged to pass this ordeal . *rhe time employed would be far from lost , if he should never use his diploma , or even obtain one . Three , or six , or even twelve months of his life would be spent most profitably . Those who are disposed to make teaching their profession , would feel no objection to this expense of preparation . There would be no want of teachers with this requirement . And it would put an end to the practice of employing as teachers persons who have no expectation of continuing in the business ; but who , for the want of any thing more profitable , are willing to spend a season or two in this employment . We will confine what we have further to say , to the brief notice of one other evil ; - we refer to the incompetency of the Examining and Visiting committees . If the reformations we have suggested were carried out , there would be little need of this office . If the schools were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books were selected and appropriated by the committee we have recommended ; and if the teachers came from the county school with their diplomas ; the present duties of the Examining and Visiting committee would he in a great measure useless . It might be desirable , however , that such a board be appointed , for a somewhat different purpose . It might be their duty to see that the schools of various grades were going through their respective courses of exercises ; and using the books appropriated . They should , also , hold an examination of the pupils , to decide who , at the close of the year , were prepared to advance to a higher grade . But supposing things to remain as at present , the board of examiners are often incompetent to their duties . Not unfrequently , all but one are understood to sustain the relation only nominally . They are present to give their approval or dissent , as that one shall decide a matter which they do not understand . We wish it could in truth be said , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there should be a legislative requisition that certain important duties shall be done , and yet the performance be entrusted to those who have no fitness for the duties . There are few societies , perhaps , that do not furnish appropriate materials for this office . But it would seem invidious to appoint only those that are qualified . If the same persons were appointed continuously , from year to year , it would be quite equal to saying , that they only are qualified . In these days of rotation in office , so unrepublican a practice as adhering to the same candidates , must not be tolerated . For one cause or another , the office is often a nullity ; the duties of it a mere formality . Instances have occurred , where the visiting of a school for the first time during a session , was deferred until the last day . And after the absence of an hour the visit was repeated , and the farce a second time enacted . Thus do visitors sometimes prepare themselves to certify that the schools under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine specimen of morality , it may be said , to be c*-hibited to the children :  --  a lesson which they would be more likely to remember and reduce to practice , than any thing more honorable , which they may have learned from the visits of the honorable committee . Such a violation of the law should not fail to be visited with the penalty . Nor should it fall upon the district that has been thus imposed upon ; but upon those who have practised the imposition . The remedy for these evils is with the people . If they will not apply it , the children must suffer for the sins of the fathers . As // their guardians , let them see that their best interests are protected . Let men be appointed to this office who are competent to the duties ; and who will faithfully perform them . We might extend this enumeration of evils in the system of public education . It may be a matter of surprise to some , that we do not advert to our school-houses ; and animadvert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we have sometimes passed some wretched shelter , designated by the name of school , standing , it may be , in the middle of a sand plain , without even a shrub to protect it from the scorching rays of summer , or the pelting storms of winter ; and have imagined the uncomfortable appearance within , and the pillory-like seats from which the limbs of many an urchin must dangle through the livelong day ; we have felt a sort of indignation ,  --  ri ghteous , we believe ,  - -  at the parsimony , or want of taste , or want of compassion , which could permit such a positive nuisance to go unabated . But , happily for the rising generation , such cases are becoming more rare . The public attention has not been called to the subject in vain . Many of the modern structures are well located ; and are convenient and tasteful . And we feel confident , that those unsightly objects of a former generation , will soon pass away . But our chief fear in extending the enumeration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted Westville. from those which are more important . The first mentioned evil , we regard as more important Than all others combined . Could we see a proper system of class*flcation adopted , and rigidly adhered to , we should have little fear of any other evil . This would not only correct the one it was specially designed to remedy , but would extend its corrective influence to every other . A degree of interest would thereby be awakened in the cause of education , that would not permit any obstacle to obstruct its onward progress . Our teachers are now , many of them , excellent- There are school books , in most of the departments , that do not admit of any great improvement . Many of our school examiners and visitors , are competent and faithful ; and our school houses , though sometimes inconvenient , are not any very important hindrance to the improvement of the pupils . There are many districts , also , where the whole apparatus , and the entire agency , are essentially perfect ; and where very much is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet but little is accomplished . And but little can be accomplished , for the system is not susceptible of any very great improvement . The evil is inherent . And any attempt at improvement which does not reach and remove this , will be like the application of external remedies to the corporeal system , while the very seat of life is diseased.
