txt THESE very talented men were the most active and successful advocates of infidelity during the last century ; and a concise , impartial , and authentic account of their lives , and their assaults upon Christianity , is deemed worthy of a place in this journal . H U ME . DAVID HUME , Esq. , was born at Edinburgh , April 26th , 1711 , and was of a good family , but not opulent . his father died while he was an infant , and his education devolved on his mother . After the usual preparation , his friends wished him to pursue the study of law ; but he was displeased with that pursuit , preferring poets and orators before the dry and thorny jurists . He next tried merchandise , but found that also irksome . In 1734 he removed to France , in order to pursue his favorite studies with less expense . At Rheims and at La Fleche in Anjou , he spent three years very agreeably . Returning to London , in 1737 , he the next year published his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fell dead-born from the press , " or attracted no notice . In 1742 he published the first part of his Essays , which was favorably received . In 1745 he spent a year in the family of the Marquis of Annaudale ; afterwards , during two years , he was private secretary to General St. Clair , on the coast of France , and at the courts of Vienna and Turin . While at Turin he rewrote his Treatise of Human Nature , and had it published at London in 1749 , with the new title , an Inquiry concerning Human Understanding . But it was not much better received than before . The same year , he retired to the family estate in Scotland , and there composed the second part of his Essays , which he entitled Political Discourses . His works now began to receive attention , and to afford him a good income . In 1751 he removed to Edinburgh , and the next year he published his Political Discourses . He also published the same year , at London , his Inquiry concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of all his works , " but which was little noticed by the public . In 1752 , he became librarian to the Advocates ' Library at Edinburgh , and commenced writing his History of England , which was published 1754-176 1 . It was but indifferently received , in consequence of its partiality to the Stuart dynasty , and some other defects . He also published during this period , his Natural History of Religion , and some smaller pieces . In 1763 , he went to France as secretary of embassy to the Earl of Hertford ; was much caressed at Paris , was Charge d'Affaires at that court in 1765 ; and returned to Edinburgh in 1766 . The next year he was made undersecretary under General Conway ; but in 1769 he returned again to Edinburgh , with a fortune of *f 1000 a year . In 1775 , he was attacked with a bowel-complaint ; and , after languishing a year and a half , he expired on the 25th of August , 1776 . According to his autobiography and the eulogy of Dr. Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and met the event with stoic indifference . Amusing himself a few days before his death with reading Lucian 's Dialogues , and , with jests , about passing the Styx , he described the dialogue he might hold with Charon , the infernal ferryman . After his death were published his Dialogue on Natural Religion , and his Essay on Suicide ; the former in 1778 , and the latter in 1783. // Mr. Hume was a decided infidel , or a disbeliever in revealed religion ; and he held that the evidence for natural religion has no scientific basis , but is derived merely from our instinctive apprehensions . In moral and mental philosophy , he held to what he calls mitigated skepticism ; that is , he believed it impossible to prove , by metaphysical or speculative reasoning , the existence of a material world around us , of a God , a providence , a future state of rewards and punishments , &amp;c . He did not deny the truth of these important facts ; but he held that the truth of them rests upon probable grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence which is scientific and demonstrative . In his Inquiry concerning Human Understanding , ( sec. xii , p. 173 , 174 , ) he says : " It seems to me , that the only objects of the abstract sciences or of demonstration , are quantity and number ; and that all attempts to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds , are mere sophistry and illusion . " - " All other inquiries of man regard only matter of fact and existence ; and these are evidently incapable of demonstration . " - " The existence therefore of any being , can only be proved by arguments from its cause or its effect ; and these arguments are founded entirely on experience . " - " It is only experience which teaches us the nature and bounds of cause and effect , and enables us to infer the existence of one object from another . Such is the foundation of moral reasoning , which forms the greater part of human knowledge , and is the source of all human action and behavior . " In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) he says : " Here lies the justest and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics , that they are not properly a science . " Mr. Hume has- been taxed with denying , altogether , the connection between cause and effect , and consequently , the validity of all our reasoning from such connection . But this is a false charge . He only denied the solidity of all metaphysical proofs of such connection , not the reality of the connection . In the work above cited , ( sec. iv , p. 38 , ) he declares expressly : " None but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience , or to reject that great guide of human life . " And in closing his argument on the subject , he says , ( sec. v , p. 50 , ) " What then is the conclusion of the whole matter ? A simple one ; though it must be confessed , pretty remote from the common theories of philosophy . All belief of matter of fact or real existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory or senses , and a customary conjunction between that and some other object . " - " This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such circumstances . It is an operation of the soul , when we are so situated , as unavoidable , as to feel the passion of love when we receive benefits , or hatred when we meet with injuries . All these operations are a species of natural instincts , which no reasoning or process of thought and understanding is able either to PRODUCE , or to PREVENT . " Mr. Hume 's skepticism , therefore , did not call in question the conclusions we derive from experience and common sense , but merely the validity of all metaphysical or philosophical reasoning in regard to matters of fact and real existence in the natural and the spiritual worlds . In the work already named , ( sec. xi , p. 144 , &amp;c. ) where he introduces a disputant defending Epicurus 's idea , ( viz. that we have no evidence of a particular providence , or of a future state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that by reasoning from effects to their cause , we may indeed prove the existence of an intelligent Cre // ator of the world ; but we can not ascribe to him any attributes or perfections beyond what he has visibly displayed , for we can only infer a first cause adequate to produce the world before us . And on this ground , we can not infer that God has any other and ulterior designs in regard to men , than what we now see . To this reasoning of his friend , Mr. flume makes the objection , that when we see an unfinished building surrounded with materials , we infer that the building is to be completed , and is to become a very different thing from what it now is ; and why may we not argue in a similar manner with regard to the world , as being God 's unfinished building ? The friend replies : We can not do so , for this reason , that men are a class of beings with whom we are acquainted , so that we can judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; but that God is a solitary being in the universe , whom we know only from his works , and therefore we can never argue from his known character or attnkites , what he is about to do , because we do not know him to possess any other attributes than he has already displayed . To this , Mr. flume rejoins , that he doubts whether God is so unlike to all other rational beings , men , for example , as to forbid our reasoning from analogy , that , as a rational being , he must have such and such designs . He moreover says , that his friend 's principles are injurious to society , because the belief of a future state of retribution has a salutary influence on human conduct ; so that , allowing Epicureans to be good reasoners , they can not be regarded as good citizens and politicians . In regard to natural theology , Mr. flume 's mitigated skepticism consisted in denying the validity and certainty of all philosophical reasoning in this department of knowledge , and generally throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain and scientific knowledge of causation , or of the necessary connection between cause and effect . But in regard to revealed religion , or the religion of the Bible , Mr. flume was not a mere skeptic ; he was a decided infidel or disbeliever in supernatural revelation . In his Inquiry , so often quoted , ( sec. x , of Miracles , p. 118 , ) he tells us , that he flattered himself he had discovered an argument , which would forever silence all reasoning from miracles in support of any religion . The argument is this . Experience is our only guide in judging of all matters of fact . We give credit to testimony , because we have found it generally to accord with facts ; and we estimate the credibility of alleged facts , by their accordance or disagreement with the experience of mankind . The incredibility of a fact , may be such as to invalidate any testimony . And in all cases of doubt or uncertainty , we weigh the probabilities on both sides , strike a balance , and then yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After these preliminary remarks , he proceeds thus ,  --  ( p. 12*2 , 1*23 , ) " Let us suppose , that the fact which the witnesses affirm , instead of being only marvellous , is really miraculous ; and suppose also , that the testimony , considered apart and in itself , amounts to an entire proof ; in that case there is proof against proof , of which the strongest must prevail , but with a diminution of its force , in proportion to that of its antagonist . A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature ; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws , the proof against a miracle , from the very nature of the fact , is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined . " - " The plain consequence is , ( and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention , ) that no testimony is sufficient to estab // lish a miracle , unless the testimony be of such a kind , that its falsehood would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and even in that case , there is a mutual destruction of arguments , and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force which remains after deducting the inferior . " The fallacy of this argument appears to consist in confounding two things which have not the least connection . The argument supposes the uniform experience of mankind respecting the mere course of nature , to be a uniform experience against the occurrence of miracles . Whereas the objects of experience , in the two cases , are altogether different . In the one case , the experience relates to the mere course of nature , or to those events which occur under and in obedience to the laws of nature ; but in the other case , it relates to supernatural events , to occurrences altogether out of the course of nature , events produced immediately by the almighty power of God ; for it is in this sense , and in this sense only , that " a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature . " Now it is admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as it has gone , has ever found nature to be uniform in her operations , or to work according to permanent and unchangeable laws . But what has this to do with miracles ? The regular operations of nature , and the supernatural works of God , are totally distinct things ; and , of course , human experience in regard to the former , has no bearing whatever on the credibility or incredibility of the latter . The vaunted argument , in reality , amounts only to this A miracle in the course of nature , is contrary to all human experience . And therefore , a miracle out of the course of nature , is contrary to all human experience . Such reasoning is what logicians call sop hisma a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter ; or , assuming that what is true , in some special cases , must be true in all possible cases , or be simply and universally true . That this is a fair statement of Mr. flume 's sophistical argument , will perhaps appear more evident , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary explanations of ambiguous terms , thus : " A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature , ( or an event entirely out of the course of nature , and not produced by her laws , ) and as a fixed and unalterable experience has established ( the uniformity of ) these laws , ( throughout the course of nature , ) the proof against a miracle , from the very nature of the fact , ( that a miracle is out of the course of nature , ) is as entire , as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined . " But , although this appears to be the true import of Mr. flume 's argument , provided we give any consistent meaning to his language , yet when read cursorily and superficially , the argument seems to be simply this : " The uniform experience of the world , is directly opposed to all occurrence of miracles ; and therefore , their occurrence is utterly incredible . " To this form of the argument the obvious reply is , that the voice of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For history , both sacred and profane , testifies that vast numbers of persons , in different ages and countries , have witnessed , or at least , have believed that they witnessed the occurrence of miracles ; and it must first be proved , that all these persons were deceived , that not a single one of them ever witnessed what they all say they witnessed . Until this is proved satisfactorily , the broad assertion , that the expe* rience of the world is opposed to // all occurrence of miracles , is an unwarrantable assumption ; it is a manifest petitio principii , a direct begging of the question . Mr. Hume himself could not but feel the necessity of rebutting the abundant testimony of history as to the occurrence of miracles . He therefore goes on to say , ( p. 124 , ) " In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed , that the testimony upon which a miracle is founded may possibly amount to an entire proof , and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal too liberal in our concessions , and that there never was a miraculous event established on so full an evidence . For , I. There is not to be found in all history , any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men , . of such unquestioned good sense , education , and learning , as to secure us against all delusion in themselves ; of such undoubted integrity , as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others ; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind , as to have a great deal to lose in case of being detected in any falsehood ; and at the same time , attesting facts , performed in a public manner , and in so celebrated a part of the world , as to render the detection unavoidable : all which circumstances are requisite to give a full assurance in the testimony of men . " II . Most people too readily give credit to miracles . III . Miracles are found to be most abundant among ignorant and barbarous nations . IV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular religions claim to have the support of miracles , and it is impossible that God should have set his seal to religions so diverse. - These are only the common arguments of infidel writers against miracles ; and they are all critically examined and answered by those writers who have undertaken to substantiate the miracles of th' Bible ; e. g . Sherlock , West , Lyttleton , Campbell , Leland , Paley , &amp;c . The 1st of Mr. flume 's objections , is denied altogether . The 2d only shows , that we should guard against deception , and should examine well the witnesses . The 3d is of no force against the miracles of the Bible , unless it can be shown that the Egyptian sages , the whole Jewish nation , all the early Christians , and great numbers of learned Greeks and Romans , were too ignorant and barbarous to give us credible testimony respecting things which they saw with their own eyes . The 4th is no argument against the miracles of the Holy Scriptures , unless the existence of counterfeits proves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fortify his main argument , Mr. Hume arrives at the following conclusion , ( p. 135 , 136 , ) " Upon the whole , then , it appears , that no testimony for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability , much less to a proof ; and that , even supposing it amounted to a proof , it would be opposed by another proof , derived from the very nature of the fact which it endeavored to establish , " and of sufficient force to annihilate it . " And therefore we may establish it as a maxim , that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle , and make it a just foundation for any system of religion . I beg the limitations here made may be remarked , when I say , that a miracle can never be proved , so as to be the foundation of a system of religion . For I own , that otherwise , there may possibly be miracles , or violations of the usual course of nature , of such a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , it will be impossible to find any such in all the records of history . " So then , after all , human testimony may be good evidence of the actual occurrence of miracles , provided // those miracles are not appealed to , in support of any system of religion ! What inconsistency ! According to Mr. flume , a miracle , from the very nature of the fact it involves , can not be proved by human testimony ; and yet he allows , that it can be thus proved , provided it does not go to confirm the truth of any religion ! But what is there in the nature of religious miracles , to make them exceptions to the general rule of all miracles ? Why , nothing at all : the ground for making them exceptions , is of quite another sort , and is wholly foreign from their nature , as being miraculous facts . It arises from the stupidity and credulity of men ! For Mr. flume says , ( p. 137 , ) " Men , in all ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind , that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat , and sufficient , with all men of sense , not only to make them reject the fact , but even reject it without farther examination . " Mr. flume was aware of the fact , that on this point most men judge very differently from him . They think it far more probable , that God should work miracles in confirmation of a religion which he approves , than for any other object whatever . And to obviate this formidable objection to his views , Mr. flume finds it necessary to assert , that a miracle in support of religion , can not be rendered a whit more probable , by any arguments drawn from the character and designs of the Almighty , " since it is impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a Being , otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions in the usual course of nature . " According to this mode of reasoning , ( which Mr. flume himself declared to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disprove a future state , ) we must never believe , that God can or will work a miracle for any purpose , until we have experience of their occurrence among " his productions in the usual course of nature ; " that is , until miracles cease to be miracles , and become a part of the usual course of nature . Complacently reviewing his mode of reasoning against miracles , Mr. flume observes , ( p. 138 , 139 , ) " I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here delivered , as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguised enemies of the Christian religion , who have undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason . Our most holy religion is founded on faith , not on reason ; and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is , by no means , fitted to endure . " fie then sketches a frightful picture both of the miracles and the historic narrations in the Pentateuch ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) " What we have said of miracles may be applied , without any variation , to prophecies ; and indeed , all prophecies are real miracles , and as such only , can be admitted as proofs of any revelation . If it did not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretell future events , it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven . So that , upon the whole , we may conclude , that the Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles , but even at this day can not be believed by any reasonable person without one . Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity ; and whoever is moved by faith to assent to it , is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person , which subverts all the principles of his understanding , and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience . " Such is the vain attempt at wit , which crowns the arrant sophistry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disingenuousness and the bitterness of his hostility to Christianity , Mr. Hume , it is said , sustained a fair moral character . His principles , however , tended to the subversion of the foundations of morality . For he held that necessity governs all human conduct ; and he maintains that all men admit the fact , though all are not aware that they do so . Necessity , he tells us , is nothing but " constant conjunction of similar objects . " And as men of the same character , if placed in the same circumstances , always act in the same manner , there is here the same necessity which we observe in the material world , namely , constant conjunction of similar things . " Thus it appears , not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause and effect in any part of nature , but also , that this regular conjunction has been universally acknowledged among mankind , and has never been the subject of dispute , either in philosophy or common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viii , p. 94 . ) This necessity , he maintains , is not inconsistent with human liberty , ( ibid. p. 100 . ) " For , what is meant by liberty , when applied to voluntary actions ? We can not surely mean , that actions have so little connection with motives , inclinations , and circumstances , that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other , and that one affords no inference by which we can conclude the existence of the other . For these are plain and acknowledged matters of fact . By liberty , then , we can only mean a power of acting or not acting , according to the determinatinus of the will . " . . - . " Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains . Here then is no subject of dispute . " The doctrine of necessity , he thinks , does not destroy morality , but rather es tablishes it . Because it shows , that vicious conduct is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the perpetrator . To the objection that his doctrine makes the author of nature the real author of all the evil committed ; whence it must follow that he delights in vicious conduct , and also , that he alone is responsible for it , Mr. Hume replies , in answer to the first consequence , that God ordained evil as being the necessary means of the greatest good ; and in answer to the second , that he can find no satisfactory reply , and can therefore only say , that the doctrine of God 's prescience brings along with it the same insolvable difficulty . In his Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals , which Mr. Hume esteemed to be his best work , he makes virtue to be whatever is either useful or agreeable , to the person himself , or to others . He admits that there is a distinction in nature between what is virtuous and what is vicious ; and he makes it the province of reason in part , and in part the province of feeling or the moral sense , to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a religious nature ; that is , it leaves entirely out of view all our relations , duties , and obligations to the Divine Being . At the same time , it classes many natural endowments , both intellectual and corporeal , among our moral qualities . In his treatise , entitled the Natural History of Religion , he says : " The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent Author ; and no rational inquirer can , after serious reflection , suspend his belief a moment , with regard to the primary principles of genuine theism and religion . " Although he regards the origin of religion among mankind as involved in obscurity , yet he ventures to assert , that " polytheism was the primary religion of man . " This hypothesis he endeavors to prove from history ; nearly all the world were // polytheists until about seventeen hundred years ago , and from reason ; men would naturally , as they began to look abroad , first conceive of a different God for every thing they saw , then , reasoning further , they would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighten the cares of the Deity , and to add to his grandeur , they would suppose him to have many ministers or demigods ; and thus they would come back to a species of polytheism . Not long before his death , and in full view of that event , Mr. Hume composed a concise history of his own life , which he calls a funeral oration of himself . This autobiography , together with a letter of Dr. Adam Smith , eulogistic of his character , and describing the closing scenes of his life , may be found prefixed to Mr. Hume 's History of England . The philosophical skepticism of Mr. Hume was vigorously assailed by Dr. Thomas Reid , ( in his Enquiry into the Human Mind , Edinburgh , 1764 , 8vo ; in his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man , Edinburgh , 1785 , 4to ; and in his Essays on the Active Powers , Edinburgh , 1788 , 4to ; ) by Dr. James Beattie , ( in his Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth , Edinburgh , 1770 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in his Appeal to Common Sense in behalf of Religion , Edinburgh , 1766-72 , 2 vols . Svo . ) His assaults on Christianity , especially in regard to miracles , were repelled by Dr. William Adams , ( in an Essay in answer to Mr. Hume 's Essay on Miracles , London , 1752 ; ) by Dr. John Leland , ( in his View of Deistical Writers , Vol . I , Letters 16-21 ; ) and especially , by Dr. George Campbell , ( in his Dissertation on Miracles , 3d edition , Edinburgh , 1797 , 2 vols. 8vo . ) VOLTAIRE . FRANcIs-MARY AROIJET DE VOLTAIRE , the great apostle of infidelity in France , was born at Chatenai , near Paris , A.D. 1694 , and was educated by Jesuits in the college of Louis le Grand . He displayed great precocity of genius , and such a propensity to treat sacred things with ridicule , that one of his preceptors early predicted " that he would one day become the corypheus of deism . " Dissatisfied with the law , a profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole attention to poetry ; and being early admitted into a society of wits and epicures about the court of Louis XIV , his devotion to the muses became invincible . His first compositions were licentious tales and letters , both in verse and prose , addressed to persons of pleasure . Early in life he began to scoff at religion ; and he continued to do so , with increasing recklessness and acrimony , as long as he lived . His epistle to Mine . G. in the year 1716 or 1717-his tragedy of *IEdipus in 1718 , and his epistle to Urania about the same time , show him to have been a witty libertine , with no reverence whatever for religion . A satire on Louis XIV , caused him to be sent to the Bastile in 1717 ; but the next year , he was released by the prince regent . In 1725 , he quarreled with the Chevalier de Rohan , and sent him a challenge . For this offense he was again lodged in the Bastile ; but was soon released on condition of leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1726 ; where he was treated with much attention , notwithstanding the licentiousness of his conversation , and where he completed and published his celebrated poem entitled La Henriade . Here also he renewed his intimacy with Lord Bolingbroke , which commenced several years before at Paris . He is likewise said to have been on familiar terms with the other English infidels , Collins , Woolston , Morgan and Chubb ; and it is apparent that the writings of these deists , especially those of Boling // broke , afforded him most of the arguments with which he afterwards assailed Christianity . In England , he acquired more knowledge of philosophy , and of the principles of civil liberty . When permitted to return to France , in 1728 , he was full of the praiscs of English liberty , English licentiousness , and English infidelity . At this period , notwithstanding the sale of his books afforded him a handsome income , his avarice led him to engage eagerly in commercial speculation , by which he became very rich . At the same time he devoted himself much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon attained the highest rank as a dramatist , and as a brilliant prose writer . His infidel biographer , Condorcet , says that Voltaire at this time " felt himself called to overthrow prejudices of every kind , to which his country was enslaved . And he conceived that it was possible to succeed in the enterprise , by a happy mixture of audacity and suppleness ; by sometimes yielding to the pressure of the times , and then profiting by favorable occasions , or producing them , by employing by turns address , argument , wit , the charms of poetry , and the influence of the theater ; and in fine , by rendering argument so simple as to be popular , so plausible as not to shock ordinary minds , and so pungent as to become fashionable . This project inflamed the soul of Voltaire , and roused all his energies . He vowed to devote his whole life to it , and he kept his word . " It was in fulfillment of such a vow or purpose , that he published his twenty-five Lettres Philosophiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned to the flames in 1734 , by the parliament of Paris . At that time Voltaire had to conceal himself awhile ; but his pen was not idle , nor his pernicious designs abandoned . lie however found it necessary to proceed more cautiously . Hay Vol . I. 23 mg made his peace with the court , he was appointed gentleman of the chamber in ordinary , and historiographer of France . During the next ten years , he produced some historical works , and several other of his least exceptionable writings . Being a private correspondent of Frederic II . of Prussia , he was sent with dispatches to that monarch in 1740 ; and in the year 1746 , he had the address to secure an election into the French Academy . In this full tide of prosperity , Voltaire , always ambitious and restless , and more admired than beloved , became discontented in his own country ; and therefore , in 1750 , he accepted an invitation from the King of Prussia to come and reside at his court . There he spent three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salary of 20,000 livres . Two hours in each day he was employed with the King , correcting his compositions and instructing him in philosophy . Unfortunately , however , he took too great liberties at this court , and falling into contention with his countryman , Maupertuis , who was at the head of the Berlin Academy , he was obliged to leave Prussia in disgrace . He now wished to return to Paris ; but the publication of a very licentious poem , entitled La Pucelle d'Orleans , having rendered him odious there to many , he spent one year at Colwar , and then took residence in the Genevan territory . Here he mingled in the controversies among the citizens , became dissatisfied , and removed to the neighboring castle of Ferney , in the Pays de Gex , within the boundaries of France . In this retired spot , he invited colonists to settle around him , formed a considerable town , built a church , and lived like a petty sovereign among his vassals . From this retreat , he kept up an active correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferney was much visited by strangers , paying their de'voires to the // monarch of taste and fashionable literature , and the high-priest of infidelity . His chief efforts were directed to the overthrow of Christianity . For this end he not only inundated Europe with his own infidel publications , but he took upon him to direct all the operations of the enemies of revelation . Says Condorcet , his biographer , " A multitude of works , in which he employed , by turns , eloquence , argument , and especially ridicule , were spread over all Europe . His zeal against religion seemed to increase his activity and his energy . I am weary ( said he one day ) of hearing you repeat , that twelve men were able to establish Christianity ; and I intend to prove to you , that only one is necessary to destroy it . ' Freethinkers multiplied at his voice , in all the classes of society , and in all countries ; and these persons , having learned their own numbers and strength , ventured to show themselves openly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the soul . " The following extracts from his private correspondence , will indicate the spirit that actuated him . To D'Alembert he wrote in 1757 , " Only five or six philosophers , who are agreed , are necessary to overthrow the Colossus . " The next year , he wrote , " If you would keep yourselves united , you would give law . All the Cacouacs a cant name for assailants of Christianity should compose one pack . " Herault said to him one day , " You will never destroy the Christian religion . " He replied , " That is yet to be seen . " In a letter to a friend , he said , " After this deluge of jibes and sarcasms , I wish to see some serious work , ( yet one that will be popular , ) which shall fully vindicate the philosophers , and confound the infamous " - l'inf a cant term , much used by Voltaire , to denote the Christian religion . " I would have the philosophers form a body of initiated . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great point . " In 1761 , he says , " Let the real philosophers make up one fraternity , like the Free Masons ; let them hold meetings ; let them sustain each other ; let them be faithful to the fraternity : and then I will burn myself for them . This secret academy would be more efficient than the academy of Athens , or than all those of Paris . But now every one thinks only of himself , and forgets that first of duties , which is , to annihilate the infamous . Confound the infamous to the utmost of your power . " In 1763 , he writes , " I am always afraid you will not be zealous enough . You bury your talents . You are contented with despising a monster , which you ought to abhor and to destroy . Why can you not crush it in four pages , and yet be so modest , as to leave it ignorant by whose hand it is slain ? Strike : but conceal the hand . Do me some day this slight pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , in 1761 , " Rush , one and all , skillfully , upon the infamous . What interests me , is the propagation of the faith , the truth  --  the progress of philosophy , and the abasement of the infamous . " To Saurin he writes , the same year , " The brethren united must crush the rascals . I always come to this , delenda est Carthago . " To Damilaville , in 1762 , he writes , " Engage all my brethren to pursue the infamous , with the living voice , and with writings , without allowing it a moment 's rest . " Similar demands he makes upon the Count D'Argental , Helvetius , Marmontel , and others . At length , after twenty-eight years ' absence from Paris , Voltaire wished to show himself again in that capital . Accordingly , in the month of February , 1778 , he arrived there , and was received in the most flattering manner . Crowds assembled under his windows to do him honor , and his friends were in constant attendance , and paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater to receive public adulation . There one of his own plays was acted , and was applauded much beyond its merits ; and there his bust was crowned with a poet 's wreath , by one of the actresses , amidst the plaudits of the whole theater . At the close of the play he was conducted in triumph to his lodgings , amidst acclamations from every quarter . But the excitement and the fatigue were too great for his feeble frame . He was seized with a violent hemoptysis : the Abb6 Gauthier , chaplain of the Incurahies , was called in ; and on the 2d of March , Voltaire signed a formal declaration , that he had confessed himself to the Abb6 , and that he wished to die in the Catholic religion ; adding also , that if he had formerly scandalized the church , he now asked the forgiveness both of God and the church . Condorcet says , " This novelty scandalized enlightened people , more than it edified the devout . " After languishing for several weeks , near the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Sulpice was sent for , but was not admitted into his chamber . The curate sent him several notes , but received only evasive answers . Voltaire was surrounded by his infidel friends , who prevented all access to him ; and in their arms he diedwith the firmness and intrepidity of a philosopher , say some ; but according to others , amidst the ravings of hopeless despair . The latter statement rests very much on the testimony of the Mar6chal de Richelieu and iihe physician Tronchin , who say , that they retired from his chamber absolutely frightened at his ravings . His friends wished to procure him a Christian burial , which both the curate of St. Sulpice and the Cordeliers refused . But at length the Abb6 Mignot , a nephew of Voltaire , conveyed his remains to Scellieres in Champagne , and buried them privately in his own abbey ; whence they were removed , in 1791 , by order of the National Assembly , and deposited in the Pantheon , or church of St. Genevieve , at Paris . During his lifetime , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution among his friends . his works , dramatic , epic , historic , philosophic and epistolary , are very numerous , and most of them are well spiced with infidelity , full of wit and brilliant coruscations of thought , but not distinguished for either profound or even plausible reasoning . They were collected , after his death , in two principal editions . The most correct is said to be that of Geneva , in 30 vols. 4to ; but the most copious is that of Basle , in 71 vois. 8vo . Four biographies of him have been published by his friends , neither of which is fully satisfactory . Those of the Marquis de Villette and of Condorcet , are said to offend by the violence of their language , and those of the Marquis de Luchet and of Duvernet , by their continued strain of labored panegyric . ROUSSEAU . JOHN JAMES RoussEAu , the son of a watchmaker of Geneva , like his celebrated countrywoman , Maria Huber , discarded the peculiar doctrines of Christianity , but was at the same time a decided theist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished for the purity and religious consistency of his life . His character was a strange compound of almost indescribable excellences and very glaring defects . His imagination was vivid , his passions strong , bis sensibility extreme , and his intellectual powers of a high order , while his mind was so ill balanced , that he often seemed to lack common sense . His life was of as variegated a tissue as his character . His birth , which was in 1712 , cost the life of his mother ; and his sickly infancy was nurtured most indulgently by his fond father *nd // very kind aunt . Early taught to read , he , when seven years old , read novels to his father in the workshop , and sometimes sat up the whole night with him to enjoy such reading . After devouring all the novels they could obtain , they read Plutarch 's Lives , Tacitus , &amp;c . At the age of nine , he was sent to study Latin with a country clergyman , who treated him with much indulgence . At the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engraver , who was a severe master . The next year he ran away , wandered in Savoy , and was taken into the family of a Madam Warens of Annecy , who had abandoned her family in the Pays de Vaud , turned Catholic , and now enjoyed a small pension from the King of Sardinia . This lady gave young Rousseau some advantages for education , and treated him as a son till she made him her lover . After various unsuccessful attempts to establish him in some useful husiness , music seemed to suit his fancy best , and he spent several years as a teacher of music . In 1742 , he became secretary to the French emhassador at Venice ; hut , falling out with his employer , he was dismissed at the end of a year and a half , and returned to Paris with a more extended knowledge of men and things . For a time , he was clerk to a farmer general of the revenue ; hut being weary of this employment , he resorted to the transcribing of music for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took an illiterate but kind-hearted girl , named Therese le Vasseur , for his mistress and housekeeper . By her he had five children , all of whom he sent to the foundling hospital , without retaining any means of knowing what became of them . After twenty-five years , he married this woman , who was a faithful and affectionate wife . In 1748 , he was attacked with the gravel , a complaint which attended him all his subsequent life , and caused him great bodily sufferings . Rousseau first acquired reputation as an author , in 1750 , by his prize essay in answer to the question proposed by the Academy of Dijon , Whether the advancement of science and the arts has contributed to corrupt , or to improve , the moral condition of men . Rousseau maintained the former ; and he depicted in glowing colors the purity , the simplicity , and the happiness of savage life . His own judgment of the merits of this performance , he afterwards stated thus , " It is full of fire and energy , but absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings , it is the most feeble in argument , and the most defective in harmony of style . " Nevertheless , in that age of extravagant opinions , it procured him great applause . In 1752 , he produced a comedy , and likewise a musical drama of considerable merit ; and not long after , he wrote his celebrated letter on French music , in which he maintained that the French have no good vocal music , and can not have , on account of the defects in their language . This letter gave great offense to the French dilettanti ; and in 1754 , Rousseau retirea for a time to Geneva , where he renounced the Romish religion , and was readmitted to citizenship in his native city . He next went into Savoy , and there he composed his essay on the Inequality among Mankind ; in which he traces almost all human ills to the artificial restraints of civilized life , and descrihes savage life as tending to the perfection of man 's nature . Returning to France , he took up a solitary residence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French infidel philosophers . In 1758 , he wrote his letter to D'Alembert against theaters , demonstrating that Geneva was far better without any theater , than it would be with one . This letter is supposed to // have completed the alienation of Voltaire from him , who could never forgive a man that had depreciated theaters . In 1760 , he published his popular but dangerous novel , entitled , Lettres de Deux Amans , or as it is usually called , Julie , ou la Nouvelle Heloise ; and soon after , his Contr&amp;t Social , ou Principes du Droit Politique , in which he makes the consent of the governed the only foundation of all legitimate civil government , and asserts the right of the people to sit in judgment on their rulers , and to call them to account when they please . This last work was in high estimation among the French revolutionists ; and it has been called their catechism , and the Pharos of their legislation . We now come to the most famous of all his works , which was entitled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1762 . LIis fundamental principle , in regard to education , is , that the youthful mind should be suffered to develop itself spontaneously , or without being preoccupied and constrained by any artificial means . In particular , he would have no religious creed inculcated upon the young , until they are able to understand and judge for themselves . His own religious faith is very fully stated in the Profession de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard , in the 4th book of this work . He there declares himself a sincere and devout believer in all the principles of natural religion ; but as to revealed religion , he is full of doubts and uncertainty . He can see clear and unequivocal marks of divinity in the Bible ; and at the same time , unanswerable arguments against its inspiration . The whole is an inexplicable mystery to him , and he can form no satisfactory opinion about it . He expresses himself in the following manner . " In regard to revelation , if I were a better reasoner , or were better instructed , perhaps I might discern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happiness to believe in it ; but while I see proofs in favor of it which I can not answer , I also see objections to it which I can not resolve . There are so many solid reasons both for it and against it , that , being unable to come to a decision , I neither reject it nor admit it : I only reject the obligation to believe it , because this supposed obligation would be incompatible with the justice of God , who , far from removing the obstacles to salvation by such a requisition , would multiply them and render them insurmountable to the majority of mankind . Nevertheless , I remain in respectful doubt on this point . I have not the presumption to suppose myself infallible : other persons may be able to decide , what appears to me undecided ; I reason only for myself , and not for them ; I neither blame them , nor imitate them : their judgment may be better than mine , but it is not my fault that their judgment is not mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an argument which speaks to my heart , and I should regret to find any good answer to it . Look at the books of the philosophers with all their pomp : how little they appear by the side of this ! Can it be , that a book at once so sublime and so simple , should be the work of men ? Can it be , that the person whose history it relates , was a mere man ? Is such the manner of an enthusiast or an ambitious sectarian ? What sweetness , what purity in his deportment ! what touching kindness in his instructions ! what sublimity in his maxims ! what profound wisdom in his discourses ! what promptness , what ingenuity , and what pertinence in his replies ! what entire command of his passions ! Where is the man-where the sage , who can act , suffer , and die , without weakness and without ostentation ? " Then comparing the Socrates of Plato with Jesus Christ , // and affirming the immeasurable superiority of the latter , he proceeds , " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sage , the life and the death of Jesus are those of a God . Shall we say that the evangelical history is a pleasing fiction ? My friend , men never produce such fictions ; and the facts related of Socrates , concerning which no one has any doubt , are less attested than those of Jesus Christ . In effect , this is only pushing the difficulty out of sight , without destroying it ; for it would be more inconceivable that several men should agree to fabricate such a book , than that a single person should have furnished the subject of it . Never did Jewish writers hit upon such a style and such morality ; and the Gospel bears marks of truth so great , so obvious , so perfectly inimitable , that its inventor would be a more astonishing character than its hero . After all , this same Gospel is full of incredible things , things repugnant to reason , things which it is impossible for any considerate man to conceive of , or to believe . What is to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my child : respect in silence , that , which can neither be rejected nor comprehended ; and be humble before that great Being who alone knows what is true . Such is the involuntary skepticism in which I abide . Yet this skepticism is not painful to me , because it does not extend to points essential in practice , and I am well satisfied on all the principles of religious duties . I serve God in the simplicity of my heart ; and I seek to know only what concerns my conduct . As to dogmas which have no influence on actions and morals , about which so many disquiet themselves , I give myself no trouble about them . I regard all the various religions as so many salutary institutions prescribing a uniform manner of honoring God in each country by a public worship , and which may all have their reasons in the climate , the government , the genius of the people , or in some other local cause which renders one preferable to another , according to times and places . I believe them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worship which is essential , is that of the heart . God never rejects any homage , provided it is sincere , under whatever form it may be offered . " ( See Rousseau 's Emile , book iv , tome ii , pp. 229-233 , ed . Paris , 1822 , in 3 vols. l2mo . ) Under what circumstances the ill balanced mind of Rousseau was led to adopt this singular creed , he has himself informed us in his posthumous work , entitled Reveries of a Solitary Wanderer , which is a sort of journal of the latter part of his life . He there says , ( Promenade III , ) " I lived among the modern philosophers , who bear little resemblance to the ancient . They , instead of clearing up my doubts and removing my indecisions , unsettled all the certainties which I thought I had gained on points the most important to be known . For those impious dogmatists and hot-brained missionaries of atheism were enraged if any one dared to think differently from them on any point whatever . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike of disputes , or a want of talents for conducting them ; yet I never adopted their sickening doctrines ; and this resistance to men so intolerant , and who had also their private ends , was not the least of the causes which drew forth their animosity . They could never persuade me . Their arguments stumbled , but never convinced me ; when I could find no good answer , I yet felt that there must be one . I taxed myself not so much with error as with ignorance , and my heart answered them better than my head . At length I said , shall I be always the sport of sophists who can out-talk me , while // I am by no means sure that themselves believe the very opinions which they preach and labor to make others adopt ? Their passions which shape their doctrines , and their interest to make this and that opinion current , render it impossible to discover their real sentiments . Can any man expect good faith from the leaders of a party ? I acknowledge that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties which embarrassed me , and with which the philosophers were so often filling my ears . But being at length resolved to come to a decision on subjects of which human reason is so little the master , and finding impenetrable mysteries and insolvable objections on all sides , I adopted on each question that opinion which appeared to me the best founded and the most worthy of credit , without poring over objections which I could not solve , but which are rebutted by other objections in the opposing system no less strong . The result of my painful researches was pretty much what I have described in the Profession de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard . " This heautifully written creed , the result of Rousseau 's maturest deliberations , and which he seems to have thought the most free from objections , and of course the most worthy of universal acceptance , was at once rejected by all parties . The philosophers could not approve of it , because it was too religious ; the friends of revelation rejected it , because it conceded too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shocked to find nothing in it but natural religion . Hence the book was condemned by all parties ; and the parliament of Paris ordered the arrest of the author , that they might treat him with the utmost rigor of the law . But he made his escape out of the kingdom , wending his way towards Switzerland . The Genevans refused to open their gates to him . Bern would not long harbor him , and he took refu* , e in Neufchatel . There he attended the Protestant church , and partook of its sacraments , until his enemies in France and Geneva found means to excite the populace against him . Though protected by the King of Prussia , who was sovereign of the country , he found his situation unsafe in Neufehatel , and again he sought refuge in Bern ; but he was driven from that canton by force in the winter of 1765 . He then fled to Strasburg , and thence to Paris , where he met with the celebrated David Hume , who conducted him safely to England . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing all the minute events of his life prior to the year 1765 . He however soon became dissatisfied with England , and having fallen out with his friend Hume , he returned to Paris in 1767 , and from that time onward he received protection from various individuals in France . After several years spent in compara* tive tranquillity , he died suddenly at Ermenonville , the country seat of the Marquis de Girardin , in the year 1778 , aged sixty six . His remains were removed from Ermenonville in 1791 , by order of the National Assembly of France , and were deposited with those of Voltaire in the Pantheon at Paris . The works of this fascinating writer , which have been published collectively , in ten , in twenty seven , in thirty three , and in thirty eight volumes , according to th' different editions , were much read during the latter half of the eighteenth century ; and they probably contrihuted more than the writings of any other man to spread among the higher classes of society all over Europe that species of adulterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accounts all religious creeds as of little importance , and considers morality , with some deference for the Deity , as all that is essential in religion.
