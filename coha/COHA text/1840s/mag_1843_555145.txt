txt MILITARY education has been regarded by all nations , whether barbarous or civilized , as an important measure of national policy . Although science in the management of armies and the conduct of battles was displayed by the great generals of antiquity , whether leading hordes from the desert or at the head of disciplined soldiers , yet the camp was the only school where the elements of military knowledge were taught . Early education was directed rather to the development of ' physical power and the cultivation of patriotic sentiments , than to the acquisition of scientific principles which could be afterwards practically used . But when liberty was destroyed by the lust of conquest , when mercenaries were employed by the state , and citizenship ceased to be required of a soldier , when the ranks of the army were recruited from the refuse of the people , and war , although " improved into an art , was degraded into a trade , " patriotism was no longer an essential element of military education . The invention of gunpowder , by revolutionizing war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Physical strength was of little avail against invisible messengers of death . Armor encumbered , instead of defending , the wearer . Battles were gained more by skill and less by // courage . Strategy took the place of personal daring . Science , brought to the attack of a fortified place , calculates to a day the period of its reduction , and renders a parallel to the siege of Troy , of Veii , or of Numantia , impossible in modern times . Positions are more important than numbers ; and although the larger will always overcome the smaller force where the disparity is great , yet the campaigns of the mighty captain , who " chained to his biography the history of Europe , " demonstrate that the power of mind , whether original as the inspiration of genius , or acquired through the instrumentality of education , does more for the success of military operations , than the magnitude of an army , the perfection of its appointments , or the valor of the troops . The superiority of science was amply shown during the seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exploits of Marlborough in the commencement , and the achievements of Frederic in the middle , of the eighteenth century ; and war was even then elevated from the rank of an art to the dignity of a science . The necessity of early scientific education was not , however , fully comprehended . Although George the Second , in 1741 , had founded the Royal Military College at Woolwich , and elementary schools existed also in France , Russia , and Austria , they had acquired no practical importance . The subject did not receive the attention it deserved until the French Revolution had desolated Europe , - until nations began to tremble for their independent existence , and the propagandisin of France shook to its base every throne on the continent . During that period , the Polytechnic School was erected , military colleges were founded in England , and this country , urged by the recommendations of its great men and the experience of its Revolution , established the national institution at West Point . This institution has lately been the object of much censure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its character is misunderstood . We believe the existence of this Academy to be essential to the national safety and honor , and that it deserves the cordial support of the American people . Believing , also , that opposition will cease when accurate information concerning it shall be generally diffused , we propose to give a statement of its interior organization and management , in greater detail than has hitherto appeared in print . // A Cadet is a warrant officer of the army , holding a rank intermediate , between the highest class of non-commissioned officers and the lowest class of subalterns . The students at the Military Academy are , therefore , a corps of United States officers , subject to the orders of the President , like other members of the army . The engineers are stationed at West Point , which is a military post , and , together with certain professors and teachers appointed by law , they constitute the Academy . The Cadets are a part of the Engineer Corps , the commandant of which is the Inspector of the School . The Superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the inspector , can command at the post but as his subordinate . The Military Academy is not merely a college , from which , as from other institutions , a student can withdraw at his option . It is a military post , to which warrant officers are ordered at the discretion of the President , to receive practical and scientific military instruction . The Cadets may , at any period , be detached from this post to perform services of any other nature , at any other place . Like all officers or soldiers , they are bound to perform the duty required of them so long as the President chooses to require it . Upon entering the army as Cadets , they sign an enlistment and take the oath of allegiance like common soldiers , their period of enlistment being eight years instead of five . They receive a pay of twenty-eight dollars per month , and are subjected to the Army Regulations , to the Rules and Articles of War , and to trial and punishment by a garrison or general court-martial . When dismissed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , " and , upon graduating , they are promoted to a higher rank . Although resignations are seldom refused , neither a Cadet nor a commissioned officer has any absolute right to be discharged . The engagement of the former to serve for eight years , therefore , imposes upon him no greater obligation to remain in the service , than if be had received a commission instead of a warrant . It may , however , deter those from joining the Academy , who do not intend to adopt the profession of arms , and , by rendering discreditable an attempt to violate their original contract , cause them to remain in the service longer than was formerly the case . The number of Cadets is limited by a late law to one for // each Congressional District and Territory , and ten to be taken at large , making about two hundred and forty in all . Warrants are conferred by the President , on nomination by the Secretary of War . Candidates are presented to the Secretary by the members of Congress , who make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own principles . Those nominated at large are appointed without reference to their place of residence , and thus the sons of persons who , being in the employment of the government , have no fixed domicile , are enabled to enjoy the benefits of the Academy . Candidates are ordered to repair to West Point and report themselves to the Superintendent , between the 1st and 20th of June in each year . They are there quartered in the barracks , instructed in the school of the soldier , and those branches of knowledge required for admission , which are very few , being only the rudiments of an indifferent English education . They must be at least sixteen years old , and not over twenty-one , not less than five feet high , and must not be deformed , nor afflicted with any disease or infirmity which would render them unfit for military service . Any boy of three years ' standing in any public school of Massachusetts is qualified , in point of information , to enter the Military Academy . Though some individuals from the Atlantic States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet the character of the institution is so popular and democratic , that instances are not infrequent , where the necessary arithmetical knowledge is almost wholly gained in the two or three weeks of preliminary instruction . Some of the brightest ornaments of the Academy were rejected upon their first attempts to enter , and finally succeeded only by close application , during the time of encampment , in qualifying themselves to pass an examination in September , which is sometimes allowed . The organization of the corps is two-fold , having separate objects in view . In reference to instruction , the Cadets are divided into four classes . The class corresponding to the freshmen in a college is called the Fourth ; the graduating members , corresponding to the seniors , form the First class . Each class is divided into a convenient number of sections , according to the ascertained order of their merit , the divisions being distinct for different subjects of study . // The military character of the corps is that of an infantry battalion of four companies . A commissioned officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by four Lieutenants , is charged with the internal police and discipline of the corps . Each company has its complement of officers permanently appointed from the Cadets themselves . These appointments are conferred by the Superintendent upon those who have been most active and soldierlike in the performance of their duties , and most exemplary in their deportment , but without reference to merit in studies . The Captains and Lieutenants are usually selected from the First , the Sergeants from the Second , and the Corporals from the Third class . The Fourth , and those of the other classes who have not received appointments , constitute the rank and file . Strict military etiquette is observed towards these officers by the other Cadets on duty , and they exercise an important influence in the discipline of the school . Upon all occasions , when the corps , or a portion of it , is under arms , the officers perform the usual military services . The Captains and Lieutenants serve their tours of guard according to the Army Regulations . The officer of the day has the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parades and roll-calls for military purposes during his tour , and takes the names of absentees , and is responsible for public property deposited in the guard-room . Each company and its quarters are under the instruction of an Assistant Instructer of Tactics , being divided into subdivisions intrusted to the immediate care of a Cadet officer , who is at all times responsible for the preservation of good order . Each room is in charge of one of its inmates , styled the " orderly , " who is answerable to the superintendent of his subdivision . For the purposes of meals , the battalion is arranged into squads corresponding to the number of tables . The " squad marcher " is generally a Cadet officer , who acts as carver , and is charged with the preservation of order at his particular table . The highest Cadet Captain , assisted by one or more subordinates , is superintendent of the mess hall . He conducts the battalion to and from meals , preserves order in the hall , and enforces observance of the mess regulations . Upon the faithfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degree of faithfulness is proportioned // to the military spirit of the corps . Their duties are strictly defined ; and undue exercise of authority , or a captious , domineering manner , is restrained by what may be termed the public opinion of the corps . But in so large a body of young men , there will always be some who can not appreciate the necessity of observing minute regulations , and others who continually violate them from carelessness or design . The Cadet officers are , therefore , necessarily brought at times into collision with their companions , and compelled by occasional violations of prescribed rules , or accidental departures from established etiquette , to neglect their duty , or to report a friend or a messmate . These effects of the system have induced some to think that one Cadet should not be required to inform against another . The Board of Visiters , whose report at the June examination of the last year will be found amongst the documents placed at the bead of this article , in reference to this subject use the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of equals and associates is at once difficult and invidious ; and were it possible to hope that youthful virtue would not sometimes yield to the pressing temptations which must beset it , there might still be reason to doubt , whether the most exact and rigorous fulfilment of such a duty can be favorable to the character , either of him who reports , or of those who are reported . " That some plausible objections may be urged against the system is not denied . The experience of more than thirty years , however , has proved it , on the whole , to be highly advantageous . The organization of the corps as a battalion could not otherwise be maintained , nor could the students acquire a practical knowledge of discipline ; by which is understood method and order in performing whatever is required of a soldier . The system also offers great inducements to correct deportment , and raises to a high standard the military spirit of the corps . The Cadet officers never act as spies . Treacherous information would be despised , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on duty , there is no distinction between the officers and the other Cadets ; at other times , the distinction is well understood and properly maintained . The studies pursued at the Academy are , for the most // part , scientific . General literature , the languages , except French , belles lettres , and the classics form no part of the course . Some misapprehension has existed on this subject , and a detailed account may therefore be interesting . The course may be considered under three heads ; the first relating to military affairs , the second to scientific , and the third to miscellaneous subjects . The first division comprehends infantry tactics and military police , artillery tactics , the theory and practice of gunnery , pyrotechny , including the actual manufacture of all the different fireworks and combustible materials used in war , fencing , and horsemanship . The second division comprehends mathematics , including algebra , geometry , trigonometry , mensuration , descriptive geometry and the applications of it , analytical geometry , and the differential and integral calculus . It also embraces chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including statics , dynamics , hydrostatics , hydrodynamics , the phenomena of magnetism , electro-magnetism , and light , with the construction and use of the instruments necessary to illustrate their principles , and a very minute course of astronomy . Engineering and the science of war are taught , comprehending such a course of civil engineering as to form an admirable basis for the education of a professional man in constructing common roads railroads , canals , bridges , and harbours . Permanent and field fortification , the composition and organization of armies , castrametation , and the principles of strategy , are also thoroughly taught . The third division includes instruction in the French language , drawing , English grammar , rhetoric , logic , geography , modern and ancient history , moral philosophy , and political science . This extensive course is well learned by every graduate . The time allotted for study and recitation is never more than ten , nor less than nine , hours every day from September to June . Some individuals , wishing by any sacrifice to meet the demands of the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroaching even upon the period assigned for sleep . This severe application occasionally injures the health ; but methodical habits , temperate living , and regular exercise generally remedy the evil . The method of instruction adopted at the Academy is peculiar and well calculated to make the students familiar // with the whole course . In those subjects relating to military affairs , the instruction is almost entirely practical . Immediately after the annual June examination , the Cadets go into camp , where they remain until the 28th of August . The camp is a school of practice , there being no recitations during its continuance , except upon a few military subjects by the first class . From the 15th of March to the 1st of November of every year , there is one drill , and during the time of encampment there are several drills , every day . Recitations in tactics are confined to the first class , but the continual performance of maneuvres renders each Cadet so well acquainted with them , that long before he graduates he is competent to instruct a battalion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of his life , as the evolutions and words of command of infantry tactics . The Academic year is divided into two terms , the first extending from September to January , the second from January to June . During these two periods , the Cadets study the subjects named under the second and third heads . In mathematics , philosophy , and engineering , the instruction is proportioned to the capacity of the students in the different sections , the more profound and difficult investigations being reserved for the higher sections . Each department has its chief , who is charged with the general direction of the class in that department . Every instructer keeps a daily memorandum of the progress of his pupils and of their relative merit . At the end of the week , he makes a report to the head of his department , who returns it , with that of the section under his immediate care , to the Superinteiident . From the weekly class-reports a consolidated report of progress during the month is made up and forwarded to the Inspector , who transmits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each Cadet . The weekly reports show the character of every recitation during the week . Each Cadet is required to give such explanations at the black-board as to satisfy the instructer that the lesson is understood , as well as committed to memory . A number indicating the merit of the recitation is affixed to the pupil 's name according to a designated scale . The sum of his marks determines his comparative and absolute standing for the week . Should he fall below the required standard , he is transferred to a lower section ; and should he rise // above it , he is promoted to a higher one ; but no transfers are made from class to class , except in regular progression , or by turning those who appear deficient into the class below . At the end of each term , there is an examination , at which the attainments of every Cadet undergo an elaborate , searching , and severe investigation . From his appearance upon these occasions , connected with the recorded results of his daily recitations , his relative merit is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first January examination after the new Cadets enter , their probation terminates . Those who pass it satisfactorily receive their warrants . Those who have failed to make due proficiency , or whose general conduct is unsatisfactory , are recommended for discharge . If a Cadet fail to pass a good examination in June , he is " found deficient* ' and not permitted to proceed with his class . If his deficiency be attributable to incapacity or inattention , he is discharged ; otherwise , he is alloxved to make a second attempt in the class which overtakes him . A second failure insures his discharge . At this examination , the names of the Cadets are arranged in the order of " aggregate merit , " as determined for each from his merit in the various subjects of study . This roll is published , and the names of the first five of each class are reported to the Department of War for insertion in the Army Register , with a statement of the studies in which they excel . At the end of the course , the graduating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names are presented to the Secretary of War , with recommendations for commissions in the army . In reference to their promotion , the class is divided into three sections . Those in the first , only , are deemed competent to perform the duties of military engineers , and are recommended for any corps they may select . Those in the second division may select any corps , except that of the military engineers ; and those in the third , are confined to the infantry and dragoons . The relative rank of the graduates corresponds with their standing on the merit roll . Should there be no vacancy in the corps selected , they are attached to it with brevets of second lieutenants . To the method of instruction , uniting the schemes of the school and of the university , the success of the Academy is chiefly owing . It is the great fault of most colleges , that the // students individually receive but slight attention . Explanations directed to produce a perfect comprehension of the lesson , and adapted to the capacity of each individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a course are often slighted , and such a superficial knowledge acquired of the subjects , as to render a diploma no certain criterion of knowledge . At West Point , the reputation of each instructer depends upon the success of his section . Each pupil undergoes a daily examination , and does not go through a merely formal recitation . Great pains are bestowed to make him understand , as well as recollect , what he studies . Every Cadet who passes from one class to another has sufficiently proved that he is acquainted with the course . A diploma from the Military Academy affords conclusive evidence , that the owner of it , when he graduated , had a thorough knowledge of every thing taught in the institution . During term time , only about two hours a day , with Saturday afternoon , are allowed for recreation . In camp , nearly all the time not occupied with military duties is thus employed . The class about commencing their third year are allowed furloughs from the end of the examination to the last of August , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hotel , which is freely visited on obtaining leave , affords the principal source of amusement . Fifteen years since , West Point having no public house was a place of comparatively little resort , and the corps resided there in almost total seclusion . The hotel has produced a great and beneficial change upon the character of the Cadets , by affording them the advantage of cultivated and refined female society . This intercourse relieves the monotony of military duty , and has changed the summer from a period of wearisome idleness to one of rational amusement . It has improved the manners , enlarged the ideas , and elevated the morale of the students very perceptibly to those whose experience , twenty years since , enables them to judge of the effects of the opposite system , which then prevailed . Recreation , however , is never suffered to interfere with the punctilious performance of duties . A young lady is not unfrequently surprised to see her partner abruptly quit her side , and hasten , at the beat of drum , to answer to his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of punishments , not // severe , but rigidly enforced . They consist of privation of recreation , extra tours of guard , reprimands , arrests , or confinement to room or tent , which are inflicted by the Superintendent or with his approbation ; confinement in the light or dark prison , inflicted by the sentence of a garrison courtmartial ; and disinission , with the privilege of resigning , or public dismission , by sentence of a general court-martial . Besides the less severe punishments , every offence brings with it consequences , which , like the pangs of remorse , are felt by the offender through his future life , - its effects upon his final standing in his class . This subject has been entirely misunderstood , and justice to the Academy requires that it should be minutely explained . Every offence against standing regulations , occasional orders , or what may be called the military common law , such as violations of etiquette or unsoldierly behaviour , is reported to the Commandant . If the offender can not satisfactorily excuse himself , the report is registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one comprehending those of equal magnitude and represented by a number . In the first year , ten stands for the highest and one for the lowest degree of " criminality . " For each succeeding year , the rate is increased by adding one-sixth for the second , onethird for the third , and one-half for the fourth year . The total demerit is indicated by " the sum of the products of the number of offences of each class , by the number which expresses the criminality of one offence of that class . " If this sum is more than 200 , the offender is deficient in conduct and is recommended for discharge . At the June examination , the demerit of each graduate , during his whole Academic term , connected with his merit in the different subjects of study , is considered in determining his standing . Thorough knowledge of the course , alone , does not secure to a Cadet the highest rank in his*class . His general behaviour sensibly affects his final success . He is urged by its great and permanent influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scrupulous obedience which is the basis of a military character . The conduct roll has been appealed to by the enemies of the Academy , as proving the conduct of the corps to be very bad . A little reflection will show that the accusation is entirely unjust . The offences registered on this roll im // ply no moral delinquency . Carelessness and inattention , which elsewhere are considered as unimportant , are faults in the Military Academy . Literal , implicit , unhesitating obedience is inculcated as the first obligation of a soldier , and such strict regard is required to every demand of discipline , that , if it were exacted in a college , it would raise a rebellion . The Cadet who appears in slovenly costume on military duty commits a breach of military propriety . Habitual negligence in small matters of a similar nature , indicated by a demerit of 200 , shows him to be unfit for a service which requires attention to the minutiai of discipline , and freedom from the disgrace of immorality . Yet his conduct might exhibit no serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities . The conduct roll is the index principally of small offences . It shows not " criminality , " which is far too strong a term , but delinquency . It registers not mala in se , but mala prohibita . The young man whose conduct is of the worst description is generally free from those vices which characterize some institutions . He is punished for faults unnoticed in a college , but properly censurable in a military school . The report of an offence is thus , in itself , a serious punishment , which no other penalty inflicted on the offender is allowed to mitigate . He always undergoes a double , and sometimes a treble penalty for one transgression . Of this system the board observe : " A benignant influence would be applied to the minds of these young men , if they could be made to feel , when they have once offended , that contrition and amendment will secure oblivion for the past , and that their ultimate standing , when they leave the Academy and enter on life , will not be fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more inexperienced years . " " It is believed , that a system of moral and even military training will prove salutary and powerful , in proportion as the more generous sentiments of our nature are enlisted in its support , and the animating influence of hope and love substituted for the chilling effects of fear . " In this opinion we concur . The system of punishments is altogether too severe . One penalty for a fault is everywhere else considered sufficient . If a specific punishment is inflicted , the offence ought not to affect the future standing of the offender . Only those gross violations of military discipline , which indicate a radical defect in military spirit , // ought to carry with them such lasting consequences . If , however , experience has proved that such a punishment is the most effectual in maintaining subordination , then specific penalties ought never to be inflicted , except in extreme cases , to produce reformation . To sentence a young man to half a dozen extra tours of guard in camp , where he is obliged to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every five days , in the ordinary performance of his duty , and , after proclaiming his bad conduct first to his parents , and then to the world , to degrade him in his class beside , is pursuing small offences with a degree of severity unheard-of in any other civil or military code . A general view of the discipline presents many features peculiar to this Academy , arising from its military character . Its severity is apparent from the foregoing account . In whatever situation a Cadet is placed , he is observed by some superior . If he is on military duty , he is watched by military officers , from the colonel to the corporal ; if at meals , the supervision extends from the commandant of the mess hall to the carver at the table ; if in his room , from the Superintendent to a sentinel , from the officer of the day to the orderly ; if at recitation , from the Professor to the section marcher . Under such close inspection , every violation of orders must be known to some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every where required , it insensibly becomes a fixed habit ; and strict attention to regulations is enforced by the certain consequences of detected delinquencies . The most remarkable effect of the system appears in the natural emulation which it excites . A commission in the Engineers is the greatest reward which the Academy offers , because the duties of this corps are the most scientific , and a member of it is qualified for one of the best professions in the country . The energies of the ablest students , in each class , are therefore exerted to the utmost to secure it . The Engineers consist of only forty-three officers , all but one having graduated at West Point with the first honors . Although the higher officers left the Academy many years since , when the course of instruction was far less extensive , and the standard of merit much lower , than at present , they have established an enviable reputation for theoretical and practical acquirements . The more recent graduates were // commissioned after four years of assiduous and successful application to an extensive course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught , and a remarkable aptitude for making further acquisitions under the direction of their distinguished superiors . It seldom happens that more than one out of a class receives a commission in this corps , and the most distinguished student is sometimes endowed with a rare union of intellect and industry , which enables him to place competition at defiance . But , generally , the difference in the capacities of the first five is small , and they strive for superiority with their whole mental and physical power . The desire of standing high upon the published roll is more or less operative upon the rest of the class , according to personal ambition . Those who are lowest strain every nerve to attain the prescribed minimum of merit , that they may not be overtaken by the class below them ; for it is a peculiar feature in the government of the Academy , that no one is allowed to proceed with his class , who has not attained a certain standard of merit . The army requires not only those who are willing , but those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As several are annually dropped from the roll , every Cadet is thus compelled to put forth his whole strength , not merely to save his distance , but to obtain the best standing which his abilities permit ; for he foresees its important influence on his future life . These incentives produce such extreme anxiety , that at the June examination , when the standing for the year is determined , students have been known to faint . The repeated scrutiny to which each class is subjected secures to the army an annual accession of able men , whose merit has been tested . Every graduate possesses an intimate knowledge of the required studies , and has acquired a habit of application and perseverance highly valuable , whatever may be his future occupations . Severe intellectual labor sometimes depresses the youthful spirit , but permanent injury is never produced . The strength of constitution , the habits of thought , and general character , there acquired , are ample compensation for temporary inconvenience , and place this school much above any other in the country . Such is the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of instruction , and the thoroughness // with which it is pursued , it surpasses the English military institutions , and at least equals , if it does not excel , the Polytechnic School at Paris . The slight requisitions for admission , in a country where education is so generally diffused , place it within the reach of the humblest applicant , and form a contrast with the exclusiveness of the French institution , which requires of candidates a large amount of mathematical knowledge . The objections against the Academy are not formidable , when candidly considered . We shall briefly allude to the most prominent , especially noticing those advanced in NewEngland . It has been said , that the Military Academy is unnecessary ; but a little reflection will show that this assertion is founded in error . The efficiency of an army depends upon the ability of its officers . Mere courage , though patriotism may elevate it to enthusiasm , can seldom , in modern times , win a battle or reduce a fort . War has become a science of much detail , requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successfully conducted . Even the small army on the peace establishment of the United States is divided into several corps , each having its own arrangement and charged with its own duties . The single arm of Military Engineering demands an amount of information , which it is the labor of a life to acquire . A knowledge of the French and German languages is required , that the engineer may have ready access to the great repositories of military learning . The large and elaborate drawings of the various works on our seacoast show the necessity of mathematical acquirements . Chemistry , mineralogy , and geology are employed in the selection , preservation , and manufacture of materials ; while the science and skill required advantageously to choose the site and determine the form of the structure , the number , power , and position of its arms , are not appreciated by those who perceive in a fortification only a mass of irregular stone-walls , with a multitude of heavy guns frowning from their summits , and a labyrinth of curious arches , which any mason appears competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same for all branches of military service but every department demands , both in peace and war , a kind of learning peculiar to itself . The point of separation is where theory ceases and practice begins . Unless this // country shall become non-combatant in principle , as well as peaceful in policy , and therefore discharge its troops and raze its fortifications , it must always maintain some armed force , so organized , that , on sudden emergencies , it may be quickly and effectively increased . Officers educated for the service , with information and practical skill beyond the power of civilians to attain , must be ready , when circumstances require , to discipline citizens into soldiers , to direct and execute combined operations , and to perform the numberless practical details devolving upon the various corps of a large and active force . Experience has amply demonstrated , that militia can not be relied upon against a disciplined enemy . The histories of the Revolution and the Late War show , that this force is wasteful and insubordinate in quarters , timorous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the country are , it is true , for the most part , well armed and drilled . They present , on occasional parades , such a martial appearance , their equipments are so perfect , and their spirit so abundant , that we are apt to imagine that such well-trained corps would be as formidable in war as they are magnificent in peace . The commanders , generally , understand perfectly the school of the soldier , of the company , and even of the battalion but their daily habits do not permit them to acquire further knowledge . A company is seldom manomvred by itself , and even less frequently in connexion with others . Infantry , cavalry , and artillery are never exercised together , nor is the relation of these different arms to each other in the " real business of fighting " practically taught . Acquaintance with evolutions is only a small part of what an officer requires in actual service . The knowledge needed can be obtained only by long study and continued application . The design of the Military Academy is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform all the duties of its several arms . Such is the sole end of the course of studies . Nothing is taught unconnected with that object . Graduates occasionally become civil engineers , or professors in colleges . Their education qualifies them honorably and usefully to fill such stations ; but these are merely incidental results . The Academy is maintained only to insure the efficiency of the army in the ability of its officers . If it be conceded , that military education is re // quired for military men ,  --  and so plain a proposition can hardly be denied , - some institution , where such education may be had , is essential to the country , while the possibility of foreign war exists . When private seminaries shall afford the necessary instruction , it will be time to canvass the expediency of destroying the national school . Other opponents of the Academy , admitting the necessity of such an institution , assert that its original design is wholly perverted , because very few graduates enter the service . The nation , they say , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That many resign their commissions after leaving the Academy is not denied ; but the number of these is somewhat exaggerated . The catalogue , up to July 1st , 1842 , registers 1167 graduates , of whom 168 died , and 24 were killed in service ; up to January 1st , 1843 , 421 had resigned . Of these , 92 had served from ten to twenty-two years , and 229 from two to nine years , before leaving the army . The Florida war , by ruining their health , forced probably more than one hundred officers to abandon the service . Under all these circumstances , less than one half of the graduates have resigned in the forty years during which the Academy has existed . If this proportion be too large , the fault is chargeable to the President , who accepts or refuses resignations according to his views of the interests of the army . The only fair argument to be drawn from the frequency of resignations is , that the Academy furnishes more graduates than are required , an objection easily obviated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this frequency of resignations is no evil , but an important advantage . The country does not Jose the money it has expended , nor a return for the education it has bestowed , although every graduate does not retain his commission . The true policy of a nation , which depends for defence on troops whose greatest merit is their patriotism , is to diffuse widely a knowledge of military science . This , to some extent , is done , by annually sending from West Point a large number of young men , well grounded in all the knowledge which an officer requires . For these reasons , Congress has been repeatedly urged to increase the number of military schools . President Madison , in his annual message to the first session of the four " // teentli Congress , recommended the enlargement of the institution at West Point , and the establishment of others in different sections of the country . At the next session , a hill creating three other schools was introduced and rejected . In 1817 , it was proposed to establish one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third at Newport , Kentucky . In 1820 , a motion was made in the House of Representatives , that a National Armory and Military School be established somewhere in the valley of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers , and the preamble to the motion assigned as a reason for it , that the North had an Academy where " a proper number of her sons are taught the mifltary art , " and that the disbursement of money for similar purposes would benefit the West . Had these attempts succeeded , perhaps the opposition to the Academy , which commenced in the Western and Southern States , would cease to exist . The Western people are not generally enemies of the Academy . Declamatory speeches are occasionally made against it by members of Congress coming from that quarter ; but the bitterness manifested by them arises , in many cases , from their jealousy of the North , and , in several instances , can be distinctly traced to personal motives . He would commit a great mistake , who should suppose that these speeches indicated the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unfrequently urged . It is said , that too many graduates enter the service ; that the Academy monopolizes the army ; that no one can receive a commission unless he has passed through its ordeal . This objection savors somewhat of that advanced by the French Jacobins against the Polytechnic School , - that republican equality was infringed , by appointing to the public service men qualified to perform the duties . But the fact asserted is not true . Should any citizen elsewhere obtain the knowledge required for becoming an officer , no law prevents him from being commissioned . It is true , that most of the officers are graduates ; out of 733 on the last Army Register , 554 were Cadets . But the Academy can not be said to monopolize appointments in the army , until they have been refused to individuals as well qualified as the graduates . Lieutenants are occasionally commissioned , who have had no preliminary military education ; a course which the public interest demands should be of infrequent occurrence . // An objection of another character has been repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut passed a resolve , that the Academy was " aristocratic and anti-republican , " and ought to be abolished , because " a very large portion of the Cadets " " are the sons of wealthy and influential men , who , by the interposition of members of Congress , obtain situations in that institution , to the almost total exclusion of poor and less influential men , regardless alike of qualifications and merit . " In January last , a convention of militia officers advocated the destruction of the Academy for similar reasons , their hostility being excited , probably , by a comparison of the army with the militia officers . Maine recently followed the lead of Connecticut , and , during the last winter , a memorial against the Academy , founded on the same misapprehension of its character , was presented to the legislature of Massachusetts . These movements , indicating an organized opposition , are in imitation of the example set by Tennessee and Ohio , the former having attacked the Academy , on the same grounds , in 1833 , and the latter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged facts . If all that is asserted is true , we admit the conclusion . The question is , therefore , entirely one of fact , to be decided by evidence . That every young man , who receives an appointment , receives it by the " interposition of a member of Congress , " can not be denied . Such is the mode of selecting candidates ; whether good or bad , it is the law , and can be altered when its operation is shown to be injurious . The last clause of the charge is mere declamation . No " qualifications " are required for admission to West Point , except the mere rudiments of an education . It would be difficult to find in New England a boy sixteen years old , whether the son of a rich or a poor man , who does not possess them . It will not be said , that no young men but those ignorant of these rudiments receive appointments yet if that be not the case , this part of the charge amounts to nothing ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power has a right to regard , are those required by law . The allegations to be proved by the opponents of the Academy are reduced , then , to the following ; that the sons of rich and influential men almost totally exclude the sons of poor and less influential persons . // We will not stop to ask , whether this accusation is founded on inquiry , or whether it is preferred at random , to excite hostility against the institution in the minds of those who follow their leaders , without troubling themselves to investigate the truth . Nor will we pause to conjecture , whether party fervor may not somewhat have distorted facts , or obscured the judgment , or whether individual disappointment may not lurk at the bottom of these resolutions , and influence be deprecated in one instance , because in another it failed of its object . The Board of Visiters , whose report we have quoted , completely refute this stale charge , by publishing the facts as ascertained by them after official investigation . They observe , " That apprehensions have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of the wealthy and powerful , than to those of all classes of our citizens . Their personal observations , however , and the inquiries they have made as a Board , satisfy them that this impression is without foundation . They have met more than one hundred young men from all parts of the country , who have received appointments within the last year , and who are now awaiting their examination . No person can see them without feeling that they are the sons , in most cases , of the farmers and working men of the country ; and several of them are known to the visiters as orphans without property , or as members of families in the humblest circumstances . In order , however , to possess themselves more of the facts which pertain to this question , the board requested detailed information from the Superintendent , in regard to the parentage and pecuniary condition of the present members of the Academy . " Of the whole number of Cadets , it was ascertained , that 56 were the sons of farmers , S of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn keepers , 12 of physicians , 27 of lawyers or judges , 19 of officers in the army , navy , or other public employments , 4 of clergymen , and 18 of merchants 20 had no parents living , and 22 were fatherless . Of these , 182 " are represented as being in indigent , reduced , or moderate circumstances " ; and " the families of 144 reside in the country . " Many plans have been suggested to remedy admitted evils in the mode of selection , but none are satisfactory . It may sometimes happen , that young men receive warrants by the // influence of political management . Were this universally the case , we perceive in it no just reason for destroying the Academy . The vast patronage of government in all its departments is more or less devoted to political purposes . This great evil , debasing individual morality , and destroying the national character , demands immediate correction ; but it affords no argument against the custom-house , the postoffice , or the navy , nor against the existence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks of life , instead of coming from the Academy , the same corrupt influences might control the appointments . The mode of selection has its benefits as well as its evils . Members of Congress can select candidates with more regard to circumstances , than if the choice were vested , as formerly , in a central power removed from immediate connexion with the people . The facts given above show that this is a practical advantage . It is said by many , who think a Military Academy useful and even necessary , that the institution at West Point is a mere engine of political influence . They affirm , that many more appointments are annually conferred than the service requires ; and therefore each class must be reduced during its Academic term , to prevent an undue number from graduating . To effect the reduction , the discipline is made inordinately severe , and the standard of excellence placed at a point unattainable , except by extraordinary talents . It is more than intimated , that this standard varies for different classes , according to their size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificed for political causes . They receive appointments under the delusive hope , that industry and attention will enable them to graduate ; when it is well known , that one half must be turned away under any circumstances , and thus disgraced for no fault but that of failing to reach a fanciful perfection . This charge is supposed to derive support from the fact , that less than one half of those who are appointed Cadets receive commissions as lieutenants . The class which entered in 1837 numbered 82 on its first roll in 1838 , of whom 52 graduated . Six of these were turned back from the preceding class , and thus only 46 of the original class were commissioned . That which entered in 1838 numbered 85 on its first roll in 1839 , of whom 56 graduated ; two entered in 1837 , leaving // 54 of the original class . These reductions are alleged to be the predetermined effects of appointing many more than necessity requires . We have never seen this charge supported by evidence , and can answer it only by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain , although high , is fixed . It is not arbitrarily altered to reduce a graduating class to the usual average . During the six years ending in June , 1842 , the proportion discharged varied from 21 to 45 per cent . The class of 1841 furnished twenty-six , and that of 1842 thirty-nine , supernumerary lieutenants , or that number more than the service required when they graduated . These facts , with the uniformity of the average of discharges , remarkable when the character of the entering members is considered , tend strongly to prove , that the standard of merit is kept as near the same mark , for each year , as can reasonably be expected . We can not admit , that the standard is unreasonably high . Every Cadet knows , when he enters , that he has before him a task of no small magnitude , in order to meet the requisitions of the Academy . If his friends have overrated his abilities , they can only blame themselves . All that he has a right to demand is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , the experience of every one connected with it , and many interesting facts which we must omit from want of space , prove conclusively , that neither political nor personal influence , neither station , birth , nor wealth , has any power to elevate or degrade him ; but that capacity and good conduct are the only requisites for success , and are sure to obtain it . All public education , as a measure of policy , has in view the public , and not individual , advantage for its first object ; and the Military Academy is specially intended to raise the character and maintain the efficiency of an essential branch of the national service . The institution is supported entirely at the public expense . No young man is asked to receive a warrant ; on the contrary , the applications for appointments , each year , are many more than can be granted . The Government offers to every graduate a provision for life in an honorable profession , and is therefore fully justified in exacting remarkable ability and attainments ; for , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for it . The greatest ability which the // country can produce is reasonably to be expected from each graduating class ; and we should rather increase than diminish the appointments , preserving the same average number of graduates , so that , by offering a wider field of choice , the qualifications of those who are annually commissioned in the army may be rendered greater than they now are . Whether the advantages of the Academy , as some suppose , are purchased at too high a cost , depends upon the value attached to military education . The appropriation for 1842 was $ 133,641 . From this amount , $ 26,382 must be deducted , being the sum paid to officers on duty at West Point , to which they are entitled , independently of the School . If the whole appropriation was used , the expense for 1842 was $ 107,259 , or about $ 427 for each Cadet . Of this sum , $ 338 are for his pay and subsistence , $ 12 for his proportion of incidental charges , and $ 77 for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughness with which it is learned , and the object of the Academy , the cost is insignificant . In a fit of economy , the last Congress withheld the customary appropriation of $ 2,000 for the Board of Visiters , which is hereafter to be discontinued , unless specially ordered . This Board has had , for more than twenty years , the character of a popular committee . It has consisted of gentlemen of all occupations and professions , from every part of the country , annually invited by the Secretary of War to make " a full and free investigation of the military and scientific instruction of the Cadets , and of the internal police , discipline , and fiscal concerns of the institution ; " for which purpose every facility is afforded by the superintendent . They are requested to " communicate the result of their observations , with any suggestions for the improvement of the Academy , " to the Department of War . Their annual reports have been very useful , in furnishing the only authentic and official account of the institution ever published , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information respecting its affairs . It is true , that the " suggestions for improvement " have been very various , and often whimsical ; but generally the recommendations were valuable , and received attention . The greatest benefit resulting from this annual committee is the individual influence // of its members in dispelling much unfounded prejudice . They were usually men of ability and consideration , and they acquired , in the course of their investigations , a minute acquaintance with the details of the school . The information thus gained was widely disseminated , and did much to " disarm the assaults of the ignorant . " We regret the discontinuance of the Board , and concur with that last appointed , in believing , that nothing " can be a more effectual means of guarding the institution from abuse , and retaining public support , than the method now pursued of throwing it open annually to the most rigid inspection , and of inviting suggestions in regard to its welfare and improvement . " * We intended to say a few words upon the constitutional objections to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zealously urged . The account of the institution which we have given shows , we think , that such objections have no solid basis . Any one , desirous of learning what they are , will find them mentioned , and completely refuted , in an able article on the Military Academy , published in the American Quarterly Review , for September , 1837 . We will only observe , in conclusion , that if the people of the United States desire for their army educated officers ; if they would not again , as in the war of the Revolution , depend upon foreign assistance , or , as in the Last War , rush into conflict without preparation ; if they would employ their countrymen , instead of foreigners , to plan and construct their forts ; if they have pride in the scientific as well as the literary reputation of the country , they will cherish with affectionate regard the only scientific institution the country affords , - an institution which Washington repeatedly recommended , which Adams founded , which was encouraged by Jefferson , enlarged by Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from destruction ; which has demonstrated its value by its practical results , and which derives such support from authority , character , and experience , as should commend it to the cordial regard of every patriotic American . At the last session of Congress , $ 40,000 were appropriated for the purpose of erecting new barracks ; those formerly in use having become more uncomfortable than the cells of most State priaons.
