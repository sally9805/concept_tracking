STEREOTYPERS ........ T. K. &; P. G. COLLINS , PRINTERS . INTRODUCTION . The great degree of favour with which a series of Sketches , similar to those embraced in the present volume , was received by the public and the press last year , has induced the publishers to add another volume of the same character and style to their " Library of American Humorous Writers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other Tales , " which were more especially intended to illustrate character and incident in the south and south-west , appear to have been unusually popular , the Editor trusts that the present volume , which includes a wider range of the peculiarities and characteristics of " the Universal Yankee Nation , " will not be deemed less entertaining by the public generally . The different Sketches in this volume have nearly all appeared in the columns of the New York " Spirit of the Times , " where most of them were published originally . If they afford as much satisfaction in their present shape as when first given to the world , the Editor will enjoy the consciousness of having been the means of alleviating the dulness and ennui of many a weary hour , and of having added his mite in contributing to the amusement and gratification of " the million .

We wish we were at liberty to disclose the name and habitation of the writer of the incident annexed , for then we are assured his friends would insist upon his becoming a more regular correspondent of the " Spirit of the Times , " in the columns of which he made his debut . You may talk of your bar hunts , Mister Porter , and your deer hunts , and knottin tigers ' tails thru the bungholes of barrels , an cock fitin , and all that , but if a regular bilt frolick in the Nobs of " Old Knox , " do n't beat ' em all blind for fun , then I 'm no judge of fun , that 's all ! I said fun , and I say it agin , from a kiss that cracks like a wagin-whip up to a fite that rouses up all out-doors  --  and as to laffin , why they invented laffin , and the last laff will be hearn at a Nob dance about three in the morning ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made at one at Jo Spraggins 's a few days ago . I 'll try and tell you who Jo Spraggins is . He 's a squire , a school comishoner , overlooker of a mile of Nob road that leads towards Roody 's still-house  --  a fiddler , a judge of a hoss , and a hoss himself ! He can belt six shillins worth of corn-juice at still-house rates and travel  --  can out-shute and out-lie any feller from the Smoky Mounting to Noxville , and , if they 'll bar one feller in Nox , I 'll say to the old Kaintuck Line ! ( I 'm sorter feared of him , for they say that he lied a jackass to death in two hours ! )  --  can make more spinin-wheels , kiss more spinners , thrash more wheat an more men than any one-eyed man I know on . He hates a circuit rider , a nigger , and a shot gun  --  loves a woman , old sledge , and sin in eny shape . He lives in a log hous about ten yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom an one at the top of the ladder  --  has all out ove doors fur a yard , and all the South fur its occupants at times . He gives a frolick onst in three weeks in plowin time , and one every Saturday-nite the balance of the year , and only axes a " fip " for a reel , and two " bits " fur what corn-juice you suck ; he throws the galls in , and a bed too in the hay , if you git too hot to locomote . The supper is made up by the fellers ; every one fetches sumthin ; sum a lick of meal , sum a middlin of bacon , sum a hen , sum a possum , sum a punkin , sum a grab of taters , or a pocket full of peas , or dried apples , an sum only fetches a good appetite and a skin chock full of particular devilry , and if thars been a shutin match for beef the day before , why a leg finds its way to Jo 's sure , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives Jim Smith ( the store-keeper over Bay 's Mounting ) warnin to fetch a skane of silk fur fiddle strings , and sum " Orleans " for sweetnin , or not to fetch himself ; the silk and sagar has never failed to be thar yet . Jo then mounts Punkinslinger bar backed , about three hours afore sun down , and gives all the galls item . He does this a lettle of the slickest  --  jist rides past in a peart rack , singin , " Oh , I met a frog , with a fiddle on his back , A axin his way to the fro-l-i-c-k ? Wha-a-he ! wha he ! wha he ! wha ke he-ke-he ! " That 's enuf ! The galls nows that ai nt a jackass , so by sun-down they come pourin out of the woods like pissants out of an old log when other end 's afire , jest " as fine as silk " and full of fun , fixed out in all sorts of fancy doins , from the broad-striped homespun to the sunflower calico , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a silk gown she 'd be too smart to wear it to Jo Spraggins 's , fur if she did she 'd go home in hir petticote-tale sartin , for the homespun wud tare it off of hir quicker nor winkin , and if the sunflowers dident help the homespuns , they woud n't do the silk eny good , so you see that silk is never ratlin about your ears at a Nob dance . The sun had about sot afore I got the things fed an had Barkmill saddled , ( you 'll larn directly why I call my poney Barkmill , ) but an owl couldent have cotch a rat afore I was in site of Jo 's with my gall , Jule Sawyers , up behind me . She hugged me mity tite she was " so feerd of fallin off that drated poney . " She said she did n't mind a fall , but it mought break hir leg an then good bye frolicks  --  she 'd be fit fur nuthin but to nuss brats ollers arterwards . I now hearn the fiddle ting-tong-dingdomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall fine-lookin galls was standin in the door , face to face , holdin up the door posts with their backs , laffin , an castin sly looks into the house , an now an then kickin each other with their knees , an then the one kicked wud bow so perlite , and quick at that , and then they 'd laff agin an turn red . Jo was a standin in the hous helpin the galls to hold the facins up , an when they 'd kick each other he 'd wink at the fellers in the yard an grin . Jule , she bounced off just like a bag of wool-rolls , and I hitched my bark-machine up to a saplin that war n't skinned , so he 'd git a craw-full of good fresh bark afore mornin . I giv Jule a kiss to sorter molify my natur an put her in heart like , and in we walked . " Hey ! hurray ! " said the boys ; " My gracious ! " said the galls , " if here ai nt Dick an Jule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Saturday nite . " Well , I know we 'll have reel now ! " " Hurraw !  --  Go it while you'r young ! " " Hurraw for the brimstone kiln  --  every man praise his country ! " " Clar the ring ! " " Misses Spraggins , drive out these dratted two-headed brats of your'n  --  give room ! " " Who-oo-whoop ! whar 's the crock of bald-face , and that gourd of honey ? Jim Smith , hand over that spoon , an quit a lickin it like " sank in a bean-pot . " " You , Jake Snyder , do n't holler so ! " says the old ' oman  --  " why you are worse nor a painter . " " Holler ! why I was jist whispering to that gall on the bed  --  who-a-whoopee ! now I 'm beginning to holler ! Did you hear that , Misses Spraggins , and be darned to your bar legs ? You 'd make a nice hemp-brake , you would . " " Come here , Suse Thompson , and let me pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze on a white oak ! " " My buck ai n't nuffin to you , Mister Smarty ! " " Bill Jones , quit a smashin that ar cat 's tail ! " " Well let hir keep hir tail clar of my ant killers ! " " Het Goins , stop tumblin that bed an tie your sock ! " " Thankee , marm , its a longer stockin than you 've got  --  look at it ! " " Jim Clark has gone to the woods for fat pine , and Peggy Willet is along to take a lite for him  --  they 've been gone a coon 's age . Oh , here comes the lost babes in the wood , ' and no lite ! " " Whar 's that lite ! whar 's that torch ! I say , Peggy , whar is that bundle of lite wood ? " " Why , I fell over a log an lost it , and we hunted clar to the foot of the holler for it , and never found it . It 's no account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares ? " " Hello , thar , gin us Forked Deer , " old fiddle-teazer , or I 'll give you forked litnin ! Ar you a goin to tum-tum all nite on that pot-gutted old pine box of a fiddle , say ? " " Give him a soak at the crock and a lick at the patent bee-hive  --  it 'll ile his elbows . " " Misses Spraggins , you 're a hoss ! cook on , do n't mind me  --  I dident aim to slap you ; it was Suze Winters I wanted to hit ; but you stooped so fair  --  " " Yes , and it 's well for your good looks that you did n't hit to hurt me , old feller ! " " Turn over them rashes of bacon , they 're a burnin ! " " Mind your own business , Bob Proffit , I 've cooked for frolicks afore you shed your petticotes  --  so jist hush an talk to Marth Giffin ! See ! she is beckonin to you ! " " That 's a lie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjint his dratted neck ! No sech fool that when a gall puts hir arm round his neck will break and run , shall look at me , that 's flat ! Go an try Bet Holden ! " " Thankee , marm , I do n't take your leavins , " says Bet , hir face lookin like a full cross between a gridiron and a steel-trap . " Whoop ! hurraw ! Gether your galls for a break down ! Give us Forked Deer ! " ' " No , give us Natchez-under-the-hill ! " ' " Oh , Shucks ! give us Rocky Mounting , ' or Misses McCloud ! " ' " Misses McCloud ' be darned , and Rocky Mounting ' too ! jist give us " She woudent , and she coudent , and she dident come at all ! " " Thar ! that 's it ! Now make a brake ! Tang ! Thar is a brake  --  a string 's gone ! " " Thar 'll be a head broke afore long ! " " Giv him goss  --  no giv him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nar another string ' ill brake to nite . Tink-tong ! all rite ! Now go it ! " and if I know what goin it is , we did go it . About midnite , Misses Spraggins sung out " stop that ar dancin and come and get your supper ! " It was sot in the yard on a table made of forks stuck in the ground and plank of the stable loft , with sheets for table cloths . We had danced , kissed , and drank ourselves into a perfect thrashin-machine apetite , and the vittals hid themselves in a way quite alarmin to tavern-keepers . Jo sung out " Nives is sease , so give what thar is to the galls an let the balance use thar paws  --  they was invented afore nives , eney how . Now , Gents , jist walk into the fat of this land . I 'm sorter feerd the honey wont last till day break , but the liquor will , I think , so you men when you drink your'n , run an kiss the galls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to them , naturaly ! "  --  " Hurraw , my Jo ! You know how to do things rite ! " " Well , I rayther think I do ; I never was rong but onst in my life an then I mistook a camp meetin for a political speechifyin , so I rid up an axed the speaker how much Tarrif there was on rot-gut ? ' and he said about here , there appeared to be none ! ' That rayther sot me , as I was right smartly smoked , myself , jist at that time . I had enough liquor plump in me to swim a skunk , so I come agin at him . I axed him Who was the bigest fool the Bible told of ? ' an he said Noah for he 'd get tite ? ' I thought , mind , I only thought he might be a pokin his dead cat at somebody what lives in this holler ; I felt my bristles a raisin my jacket-back up like a tent cloth , so I axed him if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had seen a grocery walk , and he expected to see one rot down from its totterin looks , purty soon ! ' Thinks I , Jo , you 're beat at your own game ; I sorter felt mean , so I spurr 'd and sot old Punkinslinger to cavortin like he was skeered , an I wheeled and twisted out of that crowd , an when I did git out of site the way I did sail was a caution to turtles and all the other slow varmints . " Well , we danced , and hurrawed without eny thing of very perticular interest to happen , till about three o'clock , when the darndest muss was kicked up you ever did see . Jim Smith sot down on the bed alongside of Bet Holden ( the steel-trap gall , ) and jist fell to huggin of hir bar fashion . She tuck it very kind till she seed Sam Henry a looking on from behind about a dozen galls , then she fell to kickin an a hollerin , an a screetchin like all rath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ! Jim told him to go to a far off countrie whar they give away brimestone and throw in the fire to burn it . Sam hit him strate atween the eyes , an after a few licks the fitin started . Oh hush ! It makes my mouth water now to think what a beautiful row we had . One feller from Cady 's Cove , nocked a hole in the bottom of a fryin-pan over Dan Turner 's head , and left it a hangin round his neck , the handle flyin about like a long que , ane thar it hung till Jabe Thurman cut it off with a cold chissel next day ! That was his share , fur that nite , sure . Another feller got nocked into a meal-barrel : he was as mealy as an Irish tater and as hot as hoss-radish ; when he bursted the hoops and cum out he rared a few . Two fellers fit out of the door , down the hill , and into the creek , and thar ended it , in a quiet way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a wipe with a pair of windin blades : he made kindlin-wood of them , an I lit on him . We had it head-and-tails fur a very long time , all over the house , but the truth must come and shame my kin , he warped me nice , so , jist to save his time I hollered ! The lickin he give me made me sorter oneasy and hostile like ; it wakened my wolf wide awake , so I begin to look about for a man I could lick and no mistake ! The little fiddler come a scrougin past , holdin his fiddle up over his head to keep it in tune , for the fitin was gettin tolerable brisk . You 're the one , thinks I , and I jist grabbed the doughtray and split it plumb open over his head ! He rotted down , right thar , and I paddled his ' tother end with one of the pieces !  --  while I was a molifyin my feelings in that way his gall slip 'd up behind me and fetcht 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thar , and jist anexed to her rite off , and a mity nice fite it was . Jule carried enuf har from hir hed to make a sifter , and striped and checked her face nice , like a partridge-net hung on a white fence . She hollered fur hir fiddler , but oh , shaw ! he coudent do hir a bit of good ; he was too buisy a rubbin first his broken head and then his blistered extremities , so when I thought Jule had given her a plenty I pulled hir off and put hir in a good humour by given hir about as many kisses as would cover a barn door . Well , I thought at last , if I had a drink I 'd be about done , so I started for the creek ; and the first thing I saw was more stars with my eyes shut than I ever did with them open . I looked round , and it was the little fiddler 's big brother ! I knowed what it meant , so we locked horns without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit an hour . At last some fellers hearn the jolts at the house , and they cum and dug us out , for we had fit into a hole whar a big pine stump had burnt out , and thar we was , up to our girths a peggin away , face to face , and no dodgin ! Well , it is now sixteen days since that fite , and last nite Jule picked gravels out of my knees as big as squirell shot . Luck rayther run agin me that nite , fur I dident lick eny body but the fiddler , and had three fites  --  but Jule licked her gall , that 's some comfort , and I suppose a feller cant always win ! Arter my fite in the ground we made friends all round , ( except the fiddler  --  he 's hot yet , ) and danced and liquored at the tail of every Reel till sun up , when them that was sober enuff went home , and them that was wounded staid whar they fell . I was in the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark-mill had n't ground off the saplin and gone home without a parting word ; so Dick and Jule had to ride " Shanks ' mar , " and a rite peart four-leged nag she is . She was weak in two of hir legs , but ' tother two  --  oh , my stars and possum dogs ! they make a man swaller to-backer jist to look at ' em , and feel sorter like a June bug was crawlin up his trowses and the waistband too tite for it to git out . I 'm agoin to marry Jule , I swar I am , and sich a cross ! Think of a locomotive and a cotton gin ! Who ! whoopee ! Back matter
