txt last published letter to the Secretary of War : " The apparent determination of the Department to place me in an attitude antagonistical to the Government , has an apt illustration in the well-known fable of *iEsop . But I ask no favor , and shrink from no responsibility . While intrusted with the command in this quarter , I shall continue to devote all my energies to the public good , looking for my reward to the consciousness of pure motives , and the final verdict of impartial history . " What a pregnant sketch is this-what a graphic limning of the character of the Administration , in two lines ! Here is an old soldier of the Republic , covered all over with the glory of his achievements and victories , who is forced to declare , in substance , that at the end of his arduous and eminent services , the Administration has turned upon him with a deliberate purpose of fastening on him a groundless quarrel . But it is our purpose to devote this article to some exposition-such as our limits will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the Administration . Nothing more unjustifiable , and , to say truly what we think and feel , nothing more atrocious , in the same line , ever marked the conduct of any government . General Scott was a m*4rked character in this country before the Mexican war . He had rendered great and distinguished services to the country . He had shown the truest devotion to its great interests , its honor , and its renown , and he had served the country with very striking ability , both in civil and military employment . And now in this Mexican war , in a single campaign , he has placed his name on the same roll of immortal fame with the highest military geniuses of the world ; inferior to none in those grand qualities which constitute a great Commander so far as he has had opportunity to display these qualities , and superior to most , if not to all , in the grander virtues of a considerate , humane and Christian Warrior . The truly great men of a country are the best property it possesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their fame is its fame . In the names of its great men the country lives , and becomes known and honored in the world . At this day , in every quarter of the globe , when our own beloved country is spoken of , and designed to be named with distinguished honor , it is called TEE COUNTRY OF WASHINGTON . Without its great names no country is great , or even respectable . Greece , and Rome , and Italy , are immortal on account of the immortal names that lived in those countries and illustrated their history . Among the names of real and undying renown-comparatively few in number as yet-belonging to this country to be mentioned with respect and admiration wherever we are known , and wherever we shall be known ' in coming times , is undoubtedly that of WINFIELD SCOTT . We do not think it too much to say that no living American citizen , now that the campaign of 1 84*1 in Mexico is closed , has done as much to give lustre and worldwide renown to the name of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done much , and other eminent citizens have had their share in different ways , in illustrating its history . Among the most eminent of these is HENRY CLAY . And there is one citizen in particular , whose name , in a sphere less dazzling and brilliant than that of Scott , but of quite as much solid worth and advantage , more than those of all our other living statesmen together , ( as Burke said of Chatham , in reference to England , ) " keeps the name of this country respectable in every other on the globe . " We refer , of course , to DANIEL WEEsTER . By the side of Webster , we place Scott , though mainly distinguished in another field of glory , as one who , from this time forward , is to keep the name of his country respectable , and give it lustre and renown , wherever its name is or shall be known in the world . His fame is the property and birthright of his countrymen , and is and will be dear to every American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this man whose characterthe men of the present Ad ministration have shown themselves incapable of appreciating , and whose fame-.  --  the rich property of the country-has only attracted their attention to make him the object of their jealousy and their malevolence . This is the Eagle hawked at by the mousing owls . After a long course of sinister and unmanly dealings with him , their rage has finally broken over all bounds of 554 June , // prudence , and vented itself in an open and undisguised effort to crush him at a blow . Personally absent from the country , a state prisoner at large in the proud capital of Mexico , conquered and captured under his lead , the Secretary of War takes this occasion to draw the well-earned reputation of the brave and gallant soldier within his rough embrace , to see if he can not , after the manner in which the relentless Bruin treats his victim , at one rude hug , squeeze the vital breath out of it . Under the plausible pretence and pretext of defending himself and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their neglects and unmerited rebukes , and their failure to give him their sympathy and support , he enters on an elaborate essay , running through nine columns of closely printed matter in a newspaper , to show that Scott not only wants the qualities of an able and even a safe Commander , but lacks also those of a just and honest man . This is the real object and scope of his communication . To say that this essay is ingenious and able , is only to give Governor Marcy credit for the talent he is known to possess . To say that it is wholly destitute of generosity , candor , fair dealing , manliness , and regard for the truth of history and for justice , is only to characterize it as it deserves . That it may temporarily mar the brightness of General Scott 's fame , as it was designed to do , until the public can be put in possession of all the facts , is not at all unlikely ; but we have no fears for his eventual renown . Mr. Polk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the only man of real ability in his cabinet-may be his chief executioner ; but they will find there are some things which their official tyranny is not potent enough to reach . They may soil and smirch the reputation of General Scott , but they can not permanently injure or obscure it . They may make Socrates drink poison , but he will be immortal in his fame in spite of them . It is impossible for us , in a single article , to review in ' detail the long and labored Letter of the Secretary of War of the 21st of April , to which we have referred ; - though we hope to be able , before we are through , to examine some portions of its contents , from which the character of the whole may be inferred . What we pur pose chiefly to undertake in this article , is to bring to the notice of our readers the conduct of the Administration-false , insincere , jesuitical , hollow and heartless as it has been-towards General Scott , from the commencement of the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conduct is once known to the country , the Secretary 's Letter will then be read with no fear of danger to anybody 's reputation beyond the circle of the Administration . When this war broke out , General Scott was Major-general commanding in chief the army of the United States , having his head-quarters at Washington . After the war had been carried on for six months , according to the President 's ideas of prosecuting a war with vigor , and no peace or prospect of peace was secured , General Scott was called to the field . He carried the war to the capital of the enemy 's country , by a series of achievements amidst difficulties and discouragements , never surpassed in any campaign in the whole history of human wars ; and a treaty of peace was made-wanting , however , as vet the ratification of the Mexican Government . When all this was done , General Scott was dismissed from the service of the country as commander of the army still in the field , in very exact accordance with his own prediction recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25th of July last . Detained still in Mexico by the order of the Government , he employed an early moment of leisure " to recall some of the neglects , disappointments , injuries and rebukes " which he had suffered from the Administration . This was his letter of the 24th of February , and which has been made the occasion of the Secretary 's assault upon his character and fame in his elaborate paper of the 21st of April-a paper more replete with ill-disguised bitterness , with unfounded accusations , and . slanderous imputations , than ever liefore emanated from an Executive Department of this government . General Scott 's letter brought no new complaints , or none of any importance , against the Administration . The same complaints had been made before , in successive communications to th' Department of War , as the events had occurred , and to which answers , and explanations , and argumentations had been 1848. 555 // offered in reply  --  or such explanations and argumentations ( apologies and excuses in reality ) had accompanied the offensive acts . The General 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were brought together , and placed on record , for more easy reference . And we make bold to say , in the face of all the ingenious plausibilities of the Secretary 's reply , that there is not one of these complaints that has not a substantial foundation in truth , and so it will be made to appear when the facts shall be brought to light . The Secretary 's Letter in reply had not so much for its object to defend the Administration over again against these complaints , as to attempt a justification before the country , in the absence of the General , for its contemptuous dismissal of him from the command of the army in the field , by this assault on his character and conduct . We shall undertake to show how much credit for candor and honesty is due to the Administration in this attempt . The substance of the complaints of General Scott , leaving all specifications out of the case , as these complaints are clearly gathered from his recent and previous communications , was this That the confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Executive Government , had not been extended to him , as had been solemnly promised when he took the field , but on the contrary , he had been subjected to neglects , mortifications , disappointments , injuries and rebukes from the Government ; and that the War Department , from which he had expected better things , so far from coming to his rescue or relief in the trying circumstances in which he had been placed , had wholly failed to give him its support , or even its sympathy . This we say is the substance of the complaints preferred by General Scott , and we are prepared to maintain and show that it is true to the letter , and that much more than this is true ; though it has suited the purpose of the Secretary of War , in his defence , to talk as if he was really surprised that such notions should have found a lodgment in the General 's mind , and to speak of the whole thing as " a delusion , " " a fondlycherished chimera , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wonder a little that the Secretary should have dared to venture on so bold a tone of defence as this , in the face of notorious facts , familiar to him certainly , and not less so to all intelligent and observing persons in the country , and which , wherever they are known , do not fail to convict the Executive Government , not only of having sent General Scott to the field without giving him its confidence , its candid support , or its sympathy , but of having acted towards him in bad faith , and entertaining towards him feelings of opposition and enmity , and a false disposition and design to betray him , . and cast him off at the earliest moment at which it might be practicable or safe to do so . The treacherous , insincere and jesuitical conduct of the Executive Government towards General Scott can not be fully exhibited and understood , without going back to the beginning of this war . When hostilities began , there had been no preparatory augmentation of our forces in the field . An Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was on the frontier towards Mexico , under the command of Taylor , then a Colonel in the line , but holding a brevet commission of Brigadier . It does not admit of a doubt that the President at that period was deluding himself with the notion , that a show of force on the Rio Grande , with perhaps an unimportant brush or two with any small amount of Mexican forces gathered there , would scare the Mexican Government into almost any terms of accommodation with the powerful Republic of the North which he might see fit to dictate . For such a little war , Brevet Brigadier-general Taylor , who was known already to be a judicious and brave officer , was regarded as being quite competent and sufficient . When , however , it became suddenly known at Washington that Mexico had assumed an attitude of determined resistance , and had already , by overwhelming numbers , placed Taylor and his little army in a condition of imminent hazard , a corresponding alarm was felt , and an immediate call was made upon Congress to adopt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large force for the field . The act for this purpose was passed and approved on the 13th of May , 1846 ; and on the same day , General Scott , commanding the army in chief , by his com 556 June , // mission , whether that army should be great or small , was satisfied that he would be called on to take the field in person , and to hold himself in ' readiness accordingly . Scott was not a man to loiter over a work like this , though he knew his business too well to rush on such ak enterprise as that of a war of invasion , to be carried into a far-distant country , without some intelligent plan of operations , and some corresponding preparations . It suited the objects of the Executive Government9 which had at heart the permanent conquest and acquisition of the northern and western provinces of Mexico , to lay its plans of a campaign for the invasion of these provinces by a grand army of 30,000 men , divided into three columns , and thus striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scott was to command the whole , taking the immediate bead of the most formidable column , that which should enter the enemy 's country by way of the lower Rio Grande . In repeated interviews between him and the President and Secretary of War , this plan of operations was discussed and adopted . Let it be carefully observed that it was to the command of a new army in the field of 30,000 men , to be employed in a definite campaign , according to a definite plan of operations , that General Scott was to be assigned . The President and Secretary both knew that he would hold it to be ungenerous and unjust to Taylor to supersede him in his command of the small force with which he had entered the field . When a new army was raised , and a regular campaign was to be entered upon , Scott was ready to take the field . All this was very particularly explained to General Taylor. , in a letter from General Scott , dated the 18th of May , which passed twice under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it was dispatched . And two things are to be particularly noted in this letter , as showing how exactly the main points in the arrangement between the General and the Executive Government were understood and agreed upon . One of these points was the time when the new ' army , or the principal column , could be placed on the Rio Grande ; the other was the time when General Scott should appear there to supersede Taylor by assuming the command . On the first point , the letter held this very precise language " I fear that we shall not be able to put on the Rio Grande , with our utmost ' efforts , more than ten or fifteen thousand volunteers by the first of September  --  the best period , we learn here , for the commencement of operations beyond , with a view to the conquest of a peace . " On the other point the letter held lang*age not less explicit and precise , to this effect " I do not now expect to reach the Rio Grande much ahead of the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command in that quarter before my arrival . " On the 18th of May , then , it was perfectly understood by the President and Secretary , that the new army for the Rio Grande could not probably be placed there , organized and ready for operations , before the 1st of September , and that it was not , worth the while for General Scott to be there to assume the command much in ad* vance of the new army . In the mean time , they knew very well that he was not idle or unemployed , and that his proper position , the place where he could be most efficient , as Commander-in-chief , in setting on foot and urging forward the necessary preparations and operations for the coming campaign , was his head-quarters at Washington . This is referred to , and briefly sketched , in one of his letters " From that moment when he was told to hold himself in readiness for this service I have occupied myself incessantly with the vast preliminary arrangements , which can only be made advantageously at this place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adjutant General , Quartermaster General , Commissary General of Subsistence , Chief of Ordnance , and Surgeon General . I have been much occupied also in the distribution of the quotas of volunteers needed among the several States ; in apportioning the horse to the foot ; in the study of the routes of march and water conveyances for the several bodies of troops to the best points on the frontiers of Mexico ; in the study of the northern , interior , and the southern routes of that Republic ; in looking at the means of transportation on the Rio Grande , and to and beyond that river ; in determining the d*p*ts of supplies of all sorts on this side , &amp;c. &amp;c . As these matters are respective1848. 557 // ly settled , orders and instructions have been , and will be , given to the Chiefs of the general staff at this place , and the routes of march and water conveyances , together with the d*p&amp;s of supplies of every description , are finally to be communicated to the unknown commanders of volunteers whose services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , though very imperfectly and faintly , how General Scott was occupied at Washington , and how necessary it was that he should continue on the spot until all these preliminary arrangements were completed , and the necessary orders under them given ; and both the fact of his incessant occupation , and the necessity of his continued presence at Washington , was as well known to the President and Secretary , as to the General himself . Their interviews and discussions had been frequent , frank , and so far as he was concerned , without reserve . Everything in fact , at Washington , in reference to the projected movement and campaign , was going dn under his immediate counsel and direction . Neither Mr. Polk , though the constitutional head of the army , nor the Secretary of War , knew the first letters of the alphabet of military science . Neither of them had the slightest acquaintance with the first necessary practical steps , in detail , to be taken to bring the new army into the field , with the necessary supplies of all descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the real Commander-in-chief , and who was on the spot for suggestions and advice in every material step that was to be taken . The labors in which he was actually engaged , with their knowledge and approbation , show conclusively that he was the soul and the centre of all the preliminary arrangements , and practically , of everything that was projected and done to set this campaign in motion . In this state of things , it may well he supposed that it created not a little sur prise on the part of General Scott , when he was told on the evening of the 20th of May , by the Secretary of War , that much impatience was felt at his occupations and delay at Washington . He understood , and it has never been denied , that this impatience was felt , or pretended to be felt , both by the President and the Secretary . We have seen what occurred on the 18th , only two days before , when a record was made of the facts , perfectly well understood , and acquiesced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be placed on the Rio Grande in force before about the 1st of September , and that the General was not to be there much in advance of th' troops . Personal interviews had been held in the mean time , and it was perfectly well known how effectively and indispensably General Scott was employed at Washington . What , then , was the meani*g of this sudden notification of the displeasure of the President and Secretary , because he had not already taken his departure for the Mexican frontier ? It was significant certainly , and indicated a great deal more than was expressed . The circumstances and the manner in which the notification was conve*d to the General , made it a rebuke , and it was intended that he should receive and feel it as such . It was saying to General Scott , We , your superiors , have come to the conclusion , that you are committing a fault by delaying to take the field . They knew very well in their souls , at the same time , that he was committing no fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own express approval , the best service , in the best place , and in the best way ; and they knew that he could not fail to feel this charge as an indignity and an insult . They expected one of two things to happen from it-for we have not a doubt that the next resolution of the President , already taken when this rebuke was prepared for General Scott , svas to withdraw upon some pretext or other , if he could safely do so , his offer and promise to send him to the field : they expected , either that he would promptly and peremptorily decline this service after such a proof of the treatment he might expect to receive from them when in the field , or that , with the frankness of a soldier , apt to he " sudden and quick in quarrel , " giving utterance td his honest indignation at a gross insult and injury , he would commit himself to some expressions , of which , by the aid of the cool , calculating ingenuity of the Secretary , the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purpose in regard to the command of the army . The plot succeededbeing exactly such a one as suited the low , characteristic cunning of the President . Early the next morning , the 2 1st , the 558 June , // General addressed a letter to the Secretary , which in due time , though not immediately , was seized upon as affording a sufficient pretext for the treachery which the President had been meditating . The foregone design of the President in this matter is too plain to admit of question , and the active part taken by the Secretary does not leave us at liberty to believe , as we should have been glad to do , that he was not cognizant from the beginning of that design . We proceed with our exposition of the case . At the very outset of this business , on the 15th of May , an understanding was had between the President , the Secretary , and General Scott , that General Wool should be called on to take the command of one of the three columns destined for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by the Secretary . He arrived in Washington on the 17th , and was informed by General Scott of the s*rvice designed for him . A day or two afterwards , probably on the 19th , hewas told by the Secretary that his ultimate assignment to such command was doubtful , inasmuch as it was probable that " other generals might be authorized and appointed for the army , and called into service from the States . " On that day , ( the 19th , ) a Bill was introduced into the Senate at the special instance of the Secretary of War , if not directly drawn by him , to provide for the appointment of two new Major-generals , and four Brigadiers , for the regular army , and , in addition , authorizing the President to select State Generals for the comtnand of the volunteers . Here , then , was a disclosure altogether unmistakable in its import . No increase of the regular army had been authorized , or was then contemplated , beyond the filling up of the ranks as it then existed and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four Brigadiers-not for the volunteers-it was proposed that the President should select Generals for them from the States-not for the volunteers , but for the regular army . Nobody can doubt , who considers the pelitical character of the Administration , that the design at that time was to make these appointments chiefly , if not wholly , from civil and political life , and to give such new-made officers the conduct of the war . For what purpose else were they to be created ? Not certainly to be kept at home , and out of employment . And after providing Major-generals and Brigadiers , in full complement , from the States , for the command of all the volunteers , it was not certainly intended to place all the Major-generals and Brigadiers of the regular service in the field-numbering , as they then would , three of the former ( to say nothing of Brevets ) and six of the latter , to command a body of not more than 7000 men-for that was all the regular force , as the law then stood , which would be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , were to be left at home , and nobody can be stupid enough to believe that they would be the new-made Generals . The Secretary told General Wool , that if this project of a law , concocted and urged by him , was passed , it was doubtful if lie would be employed as it had been proposed he should be ; and we have not a doubt that he might have said the same thing to General Scott with equal , if not greater truth . It was General Scott , no doubt , at whom the plan was mainly aimed . As soon as it became known in Washington in the political circles of the President 's partisans and confidential friends , that he had it in contemplation to send the General-in-chief to the field , a clamor is well known to have been raised against the policy of such a procedure . This clamor , so far as it came to the General 's ears , took the direction of a complaint against him for his delay and stay in Washington . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President understood very well , that he was committing a great error in proposing to give General Scott an opportunity , in some brilliant actions , of " conquering a peace " in this Mexican business , who would then , it might be , with the prestige of his victories and exploits , turn round and push him , and his party , from their stools . Even the remote hazard of such a con*ummation was to be devoutly avoided . Mr. Polk was of this opinion , and hence , beyond all question , his sudden change of front . Hence this Bill thrown into the Senate , and dry-nursed by the Secretary , for the appointment of new Generals . It is true that they waited four days , 1848. 559 // qwq ing in prejudice against him , if disposed to prejudge him and condemn him beforehandy would not fail to give him infinite trouble , on account as well of their prejudice as of their ignorance of military affairs , and perhaps to bring him and the arms and honor of the country together , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprecate , and if possible to counteract and remedy , such an unhappy and desperate state of things . No honest and unprejudiced mind could give any other meaning or character to it . " Not an advantageous step can be taken , " says this letter , " in a forward march , without the confidence that all is well behind . If insecure in that quarter , no General can put his whole heart and mind into the work to be done in front . I am , therefore , not a little alarmed-nay , crippled in my energies-by the knowledge of the impatience in question . " * * * * " As a soldier , I make this assertion without the fear of contradiction from any honest and candid soldier . Against the ad captandurn condemnation of all other persons-whoever may be designated for the high command in question-there can be no reliance ( in his absence ) other than the active , candid and steady support of his Government . " It was in this connection , and directly following these explicit declarations , . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his rear from Washington , " while he should be engaged with the enemy in Mexico . This fire upon him had been begun already by the expression of a most unreasonable impatience at his stay in Washington ; and it proceeded from the President and Secretary , who , from their personal knowledge of the indispensable necessity of his engagements at general Head-quarters , ought to have met and silenced the senseless clamors against him from without , instead of yielding to them and joining in them , as they had done-or professed to do . This sort of treatment , if it was to be continued when he should be in the field , would be " a fire upon his rear , " paralyzing his efforts and his energies , instead of that . " active , candid and steady support of his Government* " which he had a right to expect and demand . To make his plans distinctly known to the Executive , in regard to his stay in Washington , and the proper period for his departure , he put on record , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , after making all preliminary arrangements here , to pass down the Ohio and Mississippi , to see , or to assure myself by correspondence , that the volunteers , on whom we are mostly to rely in the prosecution of the existing war , are rapidly assembling for the service ; to learn the probable time of their readiness to advance upon Mexico ; to ascertain if their supplies , of every kind , are in place , or are likely to be in place , in sufficient time ; to hasten one and the other ; to harmonize the movements of volunteers , and modify their routes ( if necessary ) so that all , or at least a sufficient number , shall arrive at the indicated points on the Mexican frontier , at the best periods , and , as far as practicable , about the same time . " Now it was this letter of General Scott , . sent in from his office , a room in the War* Department , to the Secretary 's room in the same building , which , after four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having arrived in the mean timewas discovered by the Secretary to be a paper " reflecting upon the motives and objects of the President in tendering to you General Scott the command in Mexico , " and conveying " the strongest suspicion , not to say a direct imputation , of most unworthy motives in the Executive Government-of bad faith towards yourself-of a reckless disregard of the interests of the country-of a design to carry on a war against you , while you are sent forth to carry on a war against the public enemy. ** We do not hesitate to affirm , that not a line , phrase , word or syllable , can be found in General Scott 's letter , which by any ingenuity can be tortured into a reflection on the " motives and objects " of the President , or as casting upon him an imputation , or suspicion , of " unworthy motives , " of " bad faith , " of a " reckless disregard of the interests of the country , " or of any " design " whatever , to carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith-the designs-of the President were not within the possible scope of the plain objects of this letter . The letter assumes , in perfect good faith , that the President and Secretary were sincere and honest , though very unreasonable , in the fault they had begun to find with him ; at any rate their 1848. j 561 // sincerity and honesty in the matter are in no way impeached or questioned . And this , undoubtedly , is the very mistake , and the only mistake , the letter makes . If General Scott had flatly told the President-Sir , you are acting towards me from most unworthy motives , and in bad faith ; I understand your design perfectly , which is nothing less than to find , or make , some plausible excuse for withdrawing from me your tender and promise of the chief command in Mexico ; if he had said this , it might not have been very respectful to the Constitutional Commanderin-chief , but it would have been literally true . And it was only the consciousness * unworthy motives , and bad faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the Secretary in his behalf , to fancy that they could discover any imputations *of the sort in this letter . The charge is a self-betrayal , and a confession of guilt . The whole case stands just here : The Pr*esident Ihad come to think that sending General *Scott to Mexico might result in endangering his own succession , or that of his dynasty , to the Presidency . He resolved to endeavor to get on without him in the field , and to keep him at home , where he could have , without any hazard , all the benefit of his great *capacity and experience in the formation of plans , and in the home management of details and operations for prosecuting the war . To some new Major-general , if he could get one-which was his first plan  --  or to General Taylor , on whom he settled down after his victories on the Rio Grande , he resolved to intrust the command-at least of the forces destined to enter Mexico by the way of that river . With the clear exposition which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false pretences , practiced towards General Scott by the Executive Government , in this first transaction , at the commencement of the war , we are prepared to enter on some inquiry into the . treatment he has received at its hands since he has been actually in the field . And the first inquiry which presents itself is , how came General Scott to be employed at all in the field , after what had transpired in May , 1846 ? The explanation is not difficult . The campaign of 1846 was drawing to a close , and peace seemed no nearer being obtained than when the war began . The President became alarmed at last , at the obstinacy of the enemy , at the enormous cost of the war , and the heavy sacrifice of life made in prosecuting it . The prospect was a gloomy one , and the President was in deep perplexity . On the 11th of October he received the news and particulars of the capture of Monterey , after three days of hard fighting , and a great loss of life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bring peace , or any prospects of peace . This was the constant disappointment after every victory , and every successful movement of the army ; and still the Government went hoping on , and expecting peace from the next and the next isolated movement . They thought peace would come if Taylor would send a force to take military possession of the State of Tamaulipas , and occupy Tampico , and they sent him instructions to this effect , written on the day on which he began the battles of Monterey  --  the 22d of September . Two days after receiving the news of the fall of Monterey  --  the 13th of October-these instructions were renewed , and General Taylor was informed that they had also under consideration a plan for investing Vera Cruz . Finally , on the 22d of October , explicit instructions were prepared and sent to Taylor , unless it should materially interfere with his own plar of operations , or weaken too much his present position , " to make the necessary arrangements for having four thousand men , of whom fifteen hundred or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Vera Cruz , or such other destination as may be given them , at the earliest practicable period . " But at this period , and earlier indeed , the rresident was laboring under another embarrassment , besides what concerned merely the successful prosecution of the war . Taylor was becoming too popular , and was already much talked of for the Presidency . The Gov*rnment was getting tired of his successes . They promptly sent him a rebuke for his temporary truce at the capitulation of Monterey . They advised him pretty strongly against making any further attempts beyond Monterey , while , for the expedition tJ Vera Cruz , 562 June , * // they instructed him to give the command to General Patterson and General Worth . They had previously , by an order from home , assigned the command of the expedition to Tamaulipas and Tampico to General Patterson . And thus it was cunningly arranged , that by detaching from Taylor 's column the best part of his army , for an enterprise in which the command was to be given to another , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , so far as they could see , in a state of inglorious inactivity . At the same time , it must be observed , that the projected enterprise itself -- that of investing Vera Cruz , with four thousand men-was puerile and contemptible in a military point of view . The notion was , that the city might be taken with that force , and then , with time enough , if the enemy around them would lie still , the Castle of San Juan d'Ulloa might be starved out . And nothing was proposed beyond ; it was not to strike at the Capital by way of Vera Cruz , but only to take Vera Crux , as Matamoros and Camargo and Monterey had been taken , and then sit down , dad hope again for peace . In reply to these notable plans of the Government , General Taylor told the Department , that he would march himself on Victoria  --  the capital of Tamaulipas-which he did ; and would send a detachment to garrison Tampico ; and he would then hold 4,000 men , of which 3,009 should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he warned the Government that these 4,000 men must be joined by 6,000 ' more from home , if they meant to take and hold Vera Cruz , till the Castle of St. John should fall ; and if there was any purpose of marching on the Capital , the expedition should not be undertaken with less than 25,000 men . Before , however , this last dispatch could have been received , which was dated the 21st of November , the Executive Government had waked up to the necessity of some change in its policy , in regard to this war . It now professed to come into the measure , apparently with entire acquiescence and cordiality , which General Scott had been urging upon it in four several memorials , * beginning with one on the 21st October , and the others following on the 12th , the 16th and the 21st of November . This measure was to strike directly at the Capital of the Mexican empire , entering by way of Vera Cruz , and first reducing that city and the Fortress of St. John .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise at 20,000 as the least number , and he proposed that this force should be raised , including ' volunteers , by adding ten or twelve new regiments of regulhrs , and filling up and increasing the ranks of the old regiments . This was his plan , and in the night of the 18th of November , the General received an intimation that he might prepare himself for the field , in reference to the execution of it . On the 23d he received his written orders , and immediately left Washington to put himself en route for the seat of war . And here two things may be observed : First , that the President had manifestly resolved that he would not , willingly , put General Taylor in the way of winning any more battles . By the orders already given , before General Scott 's plan for a marchto the city of Mexico had been thus adopted , Taylor had been effectually reduced to stand on the defensive ; and on adopting that plan , Taylor was to have ' nothing to do with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far reconciled to General Scott , notwithstanding the insubordination and disrespect of which he was accused in the preceding month of May , as to call him to the field for the high and responsible service of conducting a large army to the Capital of Mexico . It is sufficient to say , in this connection , that ' at this time , the impression was nearly universal-so fickle is popular sentiment-*-and shared no doubt by the President , that General Scott , by a " hasty " letter , containing an unlucky , because unstudied expression , though in all else a letter of characteristic candor , truth , dignity , and sterling sense , had effectually cut himself off , past all redemption ) from any pretensions to the Presidency . Now when General Scott left Washington , everything wore a smooth and fair appearance . We have reason to know that * General Scott wanted 15,000 men for his landing and attack on Vera Crux and the Castle ; but if he had 8,000 men he would go on , though he expected to be obliged to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 563 * When these memorials come to he read by the public , they will testify very strongly to the great military capaeity of General Scott . // every expression and promise of confidence and support , the strangest that words could be found to give utterance to , were tendered him by the President . It was his own plan of conducting the war , just as he had propounded it , that was adopted , or professed to be , with unreserved and hearty approval . And he was himself to command in the campaign , with which the Executive Government at Washington was to have little else to do , than take care that every requisition made by him for the enterprise , whether of for*ce , or of supplies , of whatever kind , should be , as far as possible , promptly and faithfully furnished . This was the voluntary and solemn engagement of the President and Secretary of War . In the written orders with which he was furnished , scarcely exceeding half a dozen lines , he was told " It is not proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you are left to prosecute them as your judgment , under a full view of all the circumstances , shall dictate . The work is before you , and the means provided , or to be provided , for accomplishing it . It is committed to you in the full confidence that you will use them to the best advantage . " It was in the full confidence , and with the buoyant hopes , inspired by treatment and assurances apparently so full 9f generosity , undoubting trust and implicit reliance , that General Scott took the field in command of an expedition , first for the prompt reduction of the city of Vera Cruz , and the strong Fortress of St. John , and then for a victorious march upon the Mexican Capital . And who now could be made to believe , but for facts too flagrant and notorious for contradiction or dispute , that at the very moment of dismissing *General scott to his command , with all these protestations and promises of implicit confidence and full and vigorous support , the President had asked for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved and adopted , another plan of military operations in Mexico , in some material respects different from , inconsistent with , and opposed to that of General Scott ; and was then actually under promise and engagement to the individual from whom this plan emanated , *t citizen in civil life , to give him the command in Mexico , over General Scott , and 11 other , by making him a Lieutenant-general , and to do this ns soon as the assent of Congress , then about to meet , could be obtained ! The settled purpose and the perfect good faith with which this engagement was made , are shown in the fact of the open and strenuous efforts made by the President , and his partisans and friends , through the whole ensuing session of three months , to push a measure through Congress , by which he should be enabled to carry his undertaking into effect . A more bold and shameless game of deception , falsehood and purposed treachery , than this towards General Scott , was never played , by any man , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , degraded and debased , on the face of the globe . But we must not leave this matter to rest in generalities . We must come to particulars . The war policy of the Executive Government was especially vacillating and uncertain along in the autumn of 1846 . They did not know what to do . They settled and unsettled plans in quick succession . Even their projected expedition to Vera Cruz with 4,000 men , was not a fixed purpose . The order to General Taylor , of the 22d October , was to hold the 4,000 men " ready to embark for Vera Cruz , or suCh other deslination as may be given f/tern . " And it is quite certain that after that , for a period , the conclusion was to stand still and do nothing . A writer , known to speak by the book , wrote from Washington to the New York Journal of Commerce , on the *lth of November - " There will be no expensive movements - no energetic movements-made before the meeting of Congress . * * * The whole responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so late as the 11th of November , the Secretary of War answered an application from a gentleman in Kentucky , who proposed to raise a company of volunteers for a reduced regiment thea in Mexico , by saying ,  --  " It is not contemplated to fill up the regiments that have been reduced . The amount of force already in service is deemed sufficient for the prosecution of the war . " Bti* , somehow , a sudden change came over these gentlemen ; for on the 16th of November , only five days after the Secretary 's letter to Kentucky , an order and reqnisition wa* issued by him for nine ad-564 June , // ditional regiments of volunteers to serve during the war ! This was two days before General Scott received his first intimation that he might be called to the field . What had wrought this sudden and extraordinary change ? Two of General Scott 's memorials were then before the Government ; had they suddenly yielded their convictions to his arguments ? Was it then , was it on the 18th , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received his final orders , the real purpose of the Government , in good faith , to adopt his plan of campaign ; and was it with a view , bona fide , to the execution of this plan , that these nine regiments of volunteers were called for , and ten regiments more of regulars were immediately demanded from Congress ? If such was not the real intention , then General Scott was basely cheated and deceived ; and that it was not-except contingently , and as a pis aller-is demonstrable from incontestible facts . We call SENATOR BENTON to the stand as a witness , and refer to his testimony at large , given in the Senate of the United States on the 25th of January , 184*7 . It may be found in the Congressional Globe of that date . Mr. Benton was in Washington on the 9th of November , as appears by a published letter of his of that date . He relates that the day after his arrival in Washington , he called on the President , who then asked him to give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave it to him , " says the Senator , " first in speech , face to face , and afterwards in writing ; and here it is-holding up a roll of paper-for I chose to retain the original for myself , while sending a copy to him . " Mr. Benton refused to reveal what his plan was , in detail , but so much he does reveal : That his plan was different from that of either General Taylor or General Scott , both of whose plans he disapproved and condemned ; that he would have nothing to do with either , and especially he would have nothing to do with an " attack upon the idle and solitary Castle of San Juan of Ullon ; " that his plan " looked to a result and promised an issue ; " that his war in Mexico would support itself ; that it was to be a union of policy and of arms , of diplomacy and of battle-peace for the peace party in Mexico , and " endless war " for the war party ; that his plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole body " - and this was to be supplied , and all difficulties about rank avoided , by the creation of a LIEUTENANTGENERAL . Mr. Benton further relates , that his plan was APPROVED by the President ; and to show that it was ADOPTED also , and agreed to be carried into prompt and complete execution , to the entire exclusion of every other plan , Mr. Benton still further relates , that the President tendered to him the office of Lieutenant-general - contingent only on obtaining the authority of Congress for creating such an officer-and that he agreed to accept the appointment . And we have abundant proof that the President adhered firmly and pertinaciously to his adoption of Mr. Benton 's plan of a campaign , and to his understanding and solemn agreement with that gentleman . The Annual Report of the Secretary of War recommended the increase of the regular army by ten regiments . On the 29th of Dece.jnber , the President sent in a special Message to Congress , urging prompt action on this recommendation , and asking authority for the " appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . " It was in reference to this " general officer , " that Mr. Benton 's explanation and avowals were made ; it was the Lieutenant-general in question . The Ten Regiments Bill was clogged , and its passage delayed , by the obstinate efforts of the President 's friends to carry the Lieutenant-general along with it , or upon it as a rider . And when this effort failed in the House , a Bill was promptly presented in the Senate by General Dix , for the appointment of a Lieutenant-general , eo nomine . This Bill was urged with all the strength and Eeal of the peculiar and confideutial friends of the President and Secretary of War . And , finally , when this failed , another mode of reaching this object was resorted to . The House had in January , by a vote of 120 to 90 , refused to give the President authority to appoint a Lieutenant-general ; and before the close of the session , this body had been so disciplined by Executive appliances , as to give the President power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to designate and 1848. 565 // assign one of his new junior Major-generals to take rank above his seniors , and be the Commander-in-chief in Mexico . The Senate disagreed to this provision , and it was only in the last hours of the session , on the 3d of March , that the House gave up the point . Thus strictly and earnestly did the President adhere to his engagements with Mr. Benton , and to his plan for conducting the war in Mexico . Nor did his efforts stop here . The Bill for the appointment of new Major-generals was passed , and Mr. Benton was promptly appointed a Majorgeneral , and a commission tendered to him . A serious design was entertained of finding in existing laws , or pretending to find , or of assuming , authority in the President , to assign Mr. Benton to the command over General Scott , and all others in Mexico ; in spite of the refusal of Congress to sanction such a proceeding . Mr. Benton signified to the President , in a note , with characteristic modesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , whether he should have " the command of the army , and authority to sign preliminaries of peace . " And to this the President , on the 9th of March , replied " Immediately after your nomination as Major-general had been confirmed by the Senate , I carefully examined the question , whether I possessed the power to designate you  --  a junior Major-general-  --  to the chief command of the army in the field . The result of this examination is , 1 am constrained to say , a settled conviction in my mind , that such power has not been conferred upon me by existing laws . " Never was a scheme of treachery more pertinaciously prosecuted than this of the President 's towards General Scott . And it was a scheme of treachery and bad faith which , in active and labored efforts to consummate it , covered the whole period of time from the 18th of November , when he informed him that he might prepare for the field , down to the 9th day of March , when he was actually engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor , though the particular scheme of treachery finally fell through on the latter day , did the disposition and will of the Executive Government , to wound , insult , neglect , disappoint , and betray General Scott , ever desert them , through his whole campaign , down to the end of a series of achievements almost unparalleled in the annals of war , when they consummated their infamous treatment of him , and gratified their venom and their spleen , by dismissing him-ignominiously they intended it to be-from his command , and handing him over , as a criminal , to a military Inquisition , compounded and packed by themselves , in its majority , so as exactly to fit it to the malignant uses which it was designed to subserve . That this scheme of treachery  --  the design to supersede General Scott , both in his command and in his plan of campaignexisted in the beginning , when he was first ordered to take the field and his plan pretended to be approved and adopted , and every protestation made of confidence and support , admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dates he gives us . He was in Washington early in November ; his first interview with the President on the subject of his plans , was the day after his arrival-not later , certainly , than th' 10th ; and so taking were they , that no time was required for deliberation . They were approved and adopted , and he was to be made a Lieutenant-general , to carry them into execution . And here the question presents itself ,  - -  Why was General Scott dispatched to the field , as if for the prosecution of another and a different plan of his own , if the purpose all the time was to supersede him and his plan , by Mr. Benton and his plan , as soon as the necessary authority could be obtained ? To our mind , the answer is not difficult . Mr. Benton 's plan , it is manifest , contemplated an invasion of Mexico , at some point on the Gulf coast , and a march upon the Capital , as General Scott 's did , though by way of being original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Juan of Ullon " standing unconquered in his van ! He would require much the same force in the field that General Scott required , for a movement towards the Capital . It would probably , however , be late in the winter , or the time might run quite into the spring , before the President could obtain the necessary authority for sending him to the field , and it was quite important that as much of the force required by him , as could be collected in the mean time , should be on the spot , organized and dis 566 June , // ciplined for his use . General Scott was as good a man as any-perhaps the best of any  --  to be his locum tenens , and his Messenger , to prepare the way for his coming . Meanwhile , General Scott 's independent design of reducing Vera Cruz and the Castle of St. John , whether only attempted or actually accomplished , would in no way . s* materially interfere with his , Mr. Benton 's , more original plan of operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do it ; and if not done , it would be just as well , since he would cut across lots , in some inexplicable way , for the Capital . All he wanted was to have his force , as much of it as might be , at some point on the coast nearest the capital , at as early a day as possible . He flattered himself - so he plainly intimated in his speechthat when he should take the field and the command , it would be quite agreeable to General Scott , being only a Major-general while he would be a Lieutenant , to remain under his orders as a " fighting General ! " It will be observed , moreover , that by sending General Scott to the field , the Executive Government secured to itself an alternative plan , and an alternative Commander-in-chief , in case the scheme of superseding him in the command should unluckily turn out a failure . In this connection , too , it is as well to say that it is easy enough now to see , why it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the winter , and so long as the prospect lasted of sending Mr. Benton to Mexico , whether Vera Cruz and the Castle of San Juan should be taken or not , It was not in his programme . And this , much better than the Secretary of War does in his letter of the 21st of April , accounts for the neglect and failure of the Department to furnish General Scott with the supplies for this work which bad been promised him-why ten large transport ships from the north were not sent to him , why he received only half the number of surf boats required , and ivhy , at the signing of the capitulation of the City and Castle , only about one fifth of the siege train , stipulated for , had arrived ! The exposition we have now made of the real relation-so false , hollow and heartless-in which the Executive Government stood towards General Scott and his VOL . I. NO . VI . NEW SERIES . 35 plan of operations in Mexico , is sufficient to enable us  --  and our readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we ought to hold the Secretary 's Letter of the 21st of April , and his statements of facts and materials used both in defence and in crimination ; and especially , to enable us to estimate truly the language of injured innocence , in which he has so freely indulged . Hear how the Secretary of War talks-as if he were an Israelite indeed , without guile ! " In conclusion , I may be permitted to say , that , as one of the President 's advisers , I had a full share in the responsibility of the act , which assigned you to the command of our armies in Mexico . I felt interested , even more than naturally appertained to my official position , that success and glory should signalize your ope* rations . It was my duty to bring to your aid the efficient co-operation of the War Department . I never had a feeling that did not harmonize with the full and fair discharge of this duty . I know it has been faithfully p*rforn*ed . There are some men , for whom enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even just , unless acts of subserviency arid personal devotedness *A*e superadded . From you I expected bare justice , but have been disappointed . I have found you my accuser . " Now , in the face of this doleful strain of complaint , and show of suffering virtue , there is likely , we think , to be found dwelling in the public mind , and finding a voice , too , in public speech , certain significant , and it may be awkward queries , which it were well , perhaps , if the Secretary would prepare himself to answer , that is to say , if he expects to gain much credit for his Popular Appeal against General Scott beyond that of having the ability to maintain a desperate cause with desperate and reckless cunning and ingenuity . What has the Secretary to say to a few plain questions of this sort ? Were you cognizant of the underplot , laid and matured before General Scott was sent to the field , by which he was to be superseded in command , and in his plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did you abet and aid in that plot ? Did you use your efforts and influence with Congress to procure its assent to this notable project ? When you were taking your " full share " in having General Scott as1848. 567 // signed to the command in Mexico , and were feeling so " interested " for his " success and glory , " did you know that it was intended , and did you intend , that he should be superseded at the earliest day possible ? Did General Scott understand from you explicitly , that he was sent to Mexico in good faith , to execute , at his own discretion , his own plan of reducing Vera Cruz and San Juan d'Ulloa , and then marching on the Mexican capital ? If so , was there at the time , a syllable of honest truth in the assurances thus given him ? If Mr. Benton 's plan was preferred by you , who proposed to let " the idle and solitary Castle of San Juan of Ullon " alone , were you then particularly " interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this particular , did your feelings " harmonize with the full and fair discharge of your duty " to General Scott ? If General Scott wanted certain large transport vessels from the north , and wanted one hundred and forty surf boats , and a large siege train , when Mr. Benton did not want any of them , and you preferred Mr. Benton 's plan of operations to Gen4-al Scott 's , how did it " harmonize with the full and fair discharge of your duty " to General Scott , to furnish him with these useless supplies ? Did you inform General Scott , in any way , or at any time , of the plot , or design , to supersede him in the comihand ? Was it honest to send him off in ignorance of it ? If this design , known to you at the time , did not command your approval , did it ever occur to you to express , or feel , any indignation at being made the chief instrument in playing off so gross a cheat , such a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory " you were so deeply " interested ? " Did you remonstrate-did you threaten to throw up your office ? We think , when the Secretary shall have answered these significant questions , and some others like them , which will be found in the mind of every intelligent person who understands the facts of the case , and shall have answered them satisfactorily , that it will be quite time enough then for him to expect to be heard with favor , or even with patience , by an enlightened country , either in an attempted vindication of the conduct of the Executive Government towards General Scott , as the Cornmander of our forces in the field , or in bringing criminating or scandalous charges against the militai'y conduct and operations of that eminent soldier . Our remaining space does not allow us to notice , as we could wish to do , the Secretary 's manifesto of the 21st of April . From the opening p&amp;ragraph in it , to the closing sentence , facts are either misstated , misapplied , or perverted ; false imputatibns are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the materials for a full exposition of this extraordinary paper , though well known to the Secretary , are not yet at our command . In the mean time . little more can be necessary , than to let that document be read in the light of the plain relation of facts which we have now laid before our readers . Only let it be remembered that General Scott was sent to Mexico , with a scheme already laid and matured , by the Executive Government , for betraying and superseding him ; and " the neglects , the disappointments , injuries and rebukes , " charged to have been inflicted on him , will be seen to be only the natural and necessary sequents of that original policy of imposition and fraud . It is not our purpose  --  and we are sure it was never General Scott 's  --  to hold the War Department responsible for any failures merely accidental or unavoidable . Such must always occur . Only let the Department show what failures did occur in this way . The Executive Government did not desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply himself , with a chief of staff in the department of Orders and Correspondence , such as he asked for and was entitled to have , and who should be at once an accomplished officer , a confidential friend , and a practiced writer . They preferred to compel him , as far as they could , to write everything himself , amidst the distractions of his campaign , and thus take the chance of catching him on the hip with some " hasty " letter . Here is the true reason , petty and contemptible as it may seem , why they refused to give him an Assistant Adjutantgeneral-whether major or captain-as he had asked them to do . They refused him such an officer , though there was a vacancy-unless he would take one of their choice , and not of his own . Taylor 568 June , // had a major of fiis own selection in this capacity , and Wool had a captain . Scott could have neither . Axid they have the impertinence to put their refusal on the false ground of their delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nearly broken the spirit of the whole army by their repeated and shameful violation of the rights of rank in behalf of pets and favorites-they who regretted and lamented that they could not send a junior Major-general to the field with rank over all his seniors ! * When General Scott , at an early period , preferred charges against a General , and a subaltern officer , " for conduct endangering in a high degree the success of the impending campaign , " no notice was taken of his charges-either then or ever-except finally to trump up the absurd apology for this neglect and insult , that officers could not , at the time , be spared from the field of Buena Vista , to form a court ; when that battle was not fought for a month after the charges were received in Washington , and was no more anticipated or dreamed of at the time , than a battle in the regions of the moon ! But this General , and subaltern , were favorites at Washington , we believe ; and the Government was not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Scott to maintain the necessary discipline of his army . They were then pushing the Lieutenant-general . Very much in the same way , and about the same time , they manifested their " sympathy and support " of General Scott , by an impertinent intermeddling with one of the most sacred rights of a commander in the field , conducting a critical campaign-that of selecting his own commanders of particular corps . This particular case-that of Colonel Harneyshowed that while General Scott could perform a stern duty where he believed the good of the service required it , it was not in his generous nature to do the smallest injustice to any meritorious officer . Yet the case was seized on as a fit occasion * The Secretary says , evasively , there was no vacancy " with the rank of Major . " An Act passed in the summer of 1846 , authorizing four additional Assistant Adjutants-general . It was perfectly competent to the President , and proper , to nominate any one of these , or all , if the good of the service required , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conceived in utter ignorance of all military usage , just by way of showing how the " feelings " of the Government " harmonized with the full and fair discharge of their duty " towards the General they had sent to the field with every protestation of confidence and support . We have spoken already of the utter failure of the Government to furnish General Scott with transport vessels of proper size , with surf boats , and with a siege train , according to promise . The fact of the failure is not denied , and the main excuse for it is , that the requisitions were too large . Mr. Polk and Governor Marcy draw on their great military experience , to determine the question of supplies for the siege and reduction of the second most formidable fortress on the Continent of America , in opposition to General Scott 's requisitions , and as an excuse for having forfeited the promise they made him in. this regard ! But how much too large were his requisitions ? Only one-fifik of the siege train had arrived when the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only to be sent . From the time General Scott left Washington to the capitulation of Vera Cruz , was more than four months ! yet out of forty or fifty mortars of ten-inch calibre promised , only ten or twelve of the number had arrived and were in position at the capitulation . More came straggling along after the afikir was all over . General Scott demanded* and was promised one hundred and forty sm-f boats , to cost *200 each , or *2*8*OOO. ; : th** Department furnished about 70 , . a4 a eoat of *950 each , or *66,500 . For thi* , there does not remain the slightest excuse or apology . We have the best authority for saying that General Scott 's estimate for the cost of such surf boats as he wanted , was over rather than under the mark , and that they could all have been f*rnished in one month , without the slig ; htest difficulty . As for the tea large transport vessels from the north required andr promised* they had been tardily ordered by the Department , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was countermanded from Washington . rTh&amp;y were expected and waited for more than a month . Writing from Lobos , February 28th , General Scott said : - " Perhaps no expedition . 1848.3 569 // was ever so unaccountably delayed , *** and under circumstances the most critical to this entire army ; for everybody relied upon knew , from the first , as well as I knew , it would be fatal to attempt military operations on this coast , after , probably , the first week in April , and here we are at the end of February ! " And for this the only excuse the Department has to offer is , first , that General Scott must have known of the order countermanding the transports , and therefore wantonly delayed his own expedition ! and , next , that the whole Quartermaster 's Department , with the Chief at its head , was under his immediate orders , without any control , or interference , from Washington , and therefore , it was his own fault if the expedition was delayed ; and this assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own admission , that he bad himself countermanded the order for transports from the north ! The order for these transports had been given by the Secretary , through General Scott ; the countermand was given by him direct to the Quartermaster General , then in the field , professedly under . General Scott 's orders , and without notification or warning to General Scott ! * A great part of the transports finally used , were small trading craft , picked up as they could be found on and near the spot , extremely hazardous and wholly unfit for the purpose-twenty or thirty of which were at one time actually driven ashore in a non her . Very soon after the contemplated treachery of " heading off " Gen. Scott by a Lieutenant-general , had been defeated , the Executive Government had the news of the fall of Vera Cruz , and the Castle of St. Juan  --  a most brilliant operation , conducted with infinite skill and judgment , and for which little thanks were due to them . But immediately that same hope , with which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of submission from the enemy since a new success had been achieved-was revived . In this contemptible idea , and the accustomed infirmity of purpose produced by it , all effort towatds sustaining Gen. Scott in his critical position , or towards furnishing him with the necessary men and supplies to enable him to retrAat from the destructive vomito on the coast , and push forward his conquering column in the direction of the Mexican Capital , seems to have been , for a time , wholly given up . The new regulars , as fast as they were raised and organized , were disp*atched , not to Gen. Scott , but to the line of the Rio Grande-not to the point where they were wanted , and had been promised , but where they were not wanted at all . This policy was obstinately continued long , long after every apology for it had been taken away by the knowledge at Washington of the utter annihilation of the enemy on the line of the Rio Grande consequent on the grand victory of Buena Vista. * Instead of reinforcements coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised army of 20,000 men , it was not till the 6th of August that recruits reached him at Puebla in sufficient numbers to give him a force of 10,000 men , to begin his march on the Capital . In the mean time , having been compelled , both from necessity and humanity , f to send home seven regiments of old volunteers , as early as the month of May , he was obliged to cut himself off from Vera Cruz , and make his army a " The Secretary , . in his defence , insists that the original understanding was that all the troops from the north were to be sent to the Brazos . This is said with his accustomed candor . No troops from the north , destined for Vera Cruz , were to be landed at the Brazos , as the Secretary had ordered General Cadwallader and his brigad to do . Besides , he had notice from General Scott , before he teft New Ortean.s , that he should probably require all troops , from the north , as they came to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazos at all . After the troops drawn from the Rio Graude had all actually left the Brazos for rendezvous at Lobos , it . is absurd to say that any troops from the north , destined for Vera Cruz , ought first to go to the Brazos . But after Vera Cruz and its Castle had fallen , and Scott was on his march for the Capital , troops which ought to have gone to him , were sent to the Rio Grande ! -*  - -   - -  . j After every effort to induce these troops to re-engage , General Scott said in public orders Captain qwq 570 Juiie , // " self-sustaining machine " in the heart of the enemy 's country . He was as ill-supplied for the road , as he had been for transportation by water . The chief Commissary had not received a dollar of money since they landed at Vera Oruz . Four months ' pay was due the soldiers . The army was destitute of necessary clothing , and even the new troops arrived as destitute as the rest . A thousand hands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantaloons , out of the worst materials , to cover the nakedness of the troops ! But if the Executive Government did not send to General Scott troops , and money , and necessary supplies , there was one thing they did send him-they sent him Mr. Trist . On the 12th of April they received the intelligence of the fall of Vera Cruz and the Castle , and on the 14th Mr. Trist was dispatched with a missive to General Scott , declaring their expectation that Mexico would now " be disposed to offer fair terms of accommodation , " and that Mr. Trist was sent forward to " be in readiness to receive any proposals which the enemy may see fit to make for the restoration of peace . " Instead of reinforcements , they sent an agent to receive the submission of the enemy-  --  and such an agent ! It was not a national Commission , composed of such men as Crittendrn and Benton , or Mangum and Calhoun , but it was Mr. Nicholas P. Trist , a clerk in the State Department , and selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a petty spite and enmity to General Scott , who was sent on this errand , as a confidential agent * of the Government , to the head-quarters of that Commander . General Scott could not be intrusted with this authority , to receive proposals from the enemy , and make a preliminary treaty of peace , under instructions , though this very power was to have been conferred on Mr. Benton , if he had taken the field as Lieutenant-general . It was too important a service to be intrusted to General Scott , though not too important to be committed to Mr. Nicholas P. Trist . The sequel of the infamous treatment of General Scott by the Executive Government has been answerable to its beginning and its progress . They have been utterly incapable of understanding , or rather , they have been utterly unwilling to understand and acknowledge , what sort of authority it is which belongs necessarily to a commander-in-chief in the field , conducting a campaign in the heart of an enemy 's country . The Head of Discipline , he has found it impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and malicious interference of the political government at home . They have abetted and justified , against the Commander , the outrageous conduct of a fighting General , a gallant soldier enough , but notoriously the . most factious and impatiently ambitious man of the army . Arrested by his Commander , the Executive interposes to restore this new political favorite to his command , without a trial , and even without inquiry ; and not content with this , he affects to consider the very act of this officer , which was the ground of his arrest-an act of gross insult and outrage to his Commander , and of insubordination hardly short of mutiny-as a rightful and proper and formal exhibition of charges and specifications against his superior ; and thereupon he proceeds , first , to dismiss General Scott from his high command , . and thenthe punishment having first been inflicted - places him before a Court , picked and packed by the Executive , * for inquiry into the pretended charges against him ! It should excite no surprise when we find the Executive , through his Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert , that this dismissal of General Scott was only relieving him from command at his own request . Marlborough , after some successful battles , including that of Blenheim , was created a Duke , received vast estates as gifts from the nation , and had a magnificent palace built for him at the public expense . Wellington , at the close of his campaigns in Spain , *When charges were p referred against Colonel Harney , and it became the duty and the right of General Scott to detail a Court Martial for his trial , with characteristic delicacy and generosity , because there had been previously &amp;ome personal difference between them , the General requested and directed Colonel Harney to select or name his own Court . Not to be outdone in generosity , the gallant Colonel declined to do so . They have beert , we believe the best of friends ever since . The President 5*d Secretary , in their generosity , assign General Towson , and General Caleb Cushing , to be the triers of General Scott ! Even the trial , in form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so intended , before such a Court . 1848. 571 // was created a Duke , and the nation made him a present , in a single gift , of two millions of dollars . Scott , at the close of his campaign in Mexico , had , in his whole military career , rendered as much signal service , and gained as much glcry for his country , by his mighty achievements in war , as Marlborough or Wellington had done for theirs , when they received the rewards we have mentioned ; and he receives from his Government , as his reward , a contemptuous dismissal from his command , and an arraignment before two tribunals-the one military and packed for the occasion , and the other popular-in both cases on charges equally false and frivolous , and also in both cases sought to be pushed against him with whatever vigor , ability , and influence the Executive Government can command for the purpose . But our space is exhausted , and we must c$nclude.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
