Democratic Review , June 1833 . The following little dramatic sketch , which forms the fifteenth Idyll of Theocritus , is , in the original , one of the most agreeable of the minor fragments that remain to us of the Greek poetry . The scene is laid at Alexandria , the great commercial emporium of the eastern part of the Mediterranean . The principal personages are two married women of the middling class , who attend the public celebration of the Festival of Adonis . The commencement of the dialogue gives us an interesting glimpse of the domestic life of a private Greek family , and the succeeding part a lively and graphic miniature sketch of the appearance of the city under the excitement of a public celebration . It is amusing to remark the complete identity of the occurrences described , and the feelings called forth with those which we daily observe on similar occasions among ourselves . The details are executed with the good taste , spirit , and truth to nature , which characterize Theocritus as one of the best of the Greek poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alludes to the mythological fable of Adonis , who was represented as living alternately , for six months at a time , on earth and in the lower regions . The fiction is supposed to have been originally an astronomical allegory , but it has been so much embroidered upon that it has nearly lost its character . The Festival of Adonis began with a funeral ceremony in commemoration of his death , and terminated with a jubilee in honor of his return . The song , included in this little drama , belongs , of course , to the close of the festival . It is a rather striking proof of the comprehensiveness of the Greek language that the original title , The Women at the Festival of Adonis , is expressed in Greek by the single word , ' Adoniaousai .
