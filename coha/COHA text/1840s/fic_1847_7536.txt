Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : ASPHODEL ........ In Heaven I bloom for Thee ! from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) For I would wreath my path below With lowlier flowers of lighter glow , And save the sacred , golden bloom Of Love , with all its pure perfume ; Nor let th ' ignoble cares of earth Profane my bud of heavenly birth , I 'd hide it in my soul and keep It fresh , with tears that Truth would weep , And all its incense , light and dew , I 'd fondly hoard for Heaven and you . Then , till we meet in holier bowers , Where radiant seraphs tend the flowers , Wilt thou not keep  --  through grief and glee  --  Love 's peerless blossom pure for me , And wreath with mine , where angels dwell , Thy spirit 's golden Asphodel ?

Pleasure , Glory , Fortune , Fame ,  --  These I will not stoop to claim : Take them ! All of Beauty 's power , All the triumph of this hour , Is not worth one blush you stole  --  Give me back my bloom of soul ! Take the cup and take the gem ! What have I to do with them ? Loose the garland from my hair ! Thou shouldst wind the night-shade there ;  --  Thou , who wreath'st , with flattering art , Poison flowers to bind my heart , Give me back the rose you stole ! Give me back my bloom of soul ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : ANEMONE .  --  HAREBELL.  --  SPIDERWORT. from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Thou art false , and I resign myself to my fate . Forgotten ! all the love  --  the pride , I lavished on thy breast , So soon  --  so coldly cast aside , Unpitied and unblest ! Forgotten ! ere the glorious smile , In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a star 's pure light , Within a troubled sea ! Forgotten ! ere thy last fond kiss Has ceased to thrill my heart !  --  Ere with the memory of thy touch , My happy hand can part ! Forgotten ! while thy soul-tuned voice Still lingers on mine ear , In those deep , low , impassioned tones , That Love so loves to hear ! Forgotten ! then let all forget !  --  I lose the world with thee  --  I ask no love  --  no hope  --  no faith  --  Since thou art false to me ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : CAMELLIA JAPONICA ........ Queen of the Heart . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Raven bands of hair Droop in graceful braiding ; Eyes of beauty rare , Flash beneath their shading . Eyes whose jet-like hue , Deep and rich and tender , Speak a spirit true , Softening all their splendor . Cheek whereon the rose , But when feeling wakes it , Breaks the pure repose , Ah ! how lightly breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure Loving words and low Steal with rare composure . Stately in her pace , Yet so softly , wearing All a cygnet 's grace In her queenly bearing ! But the heart within , All her looks informing , Kindling every blush , Every dimple warming ! Making her a joy , And an hourly blessing , In each kind employ , In each fond caressing . Yielding true and calm , To each household duty ! Goodness sheds a balm O'er her maiden beauty . F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : MARY . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) I know a star  --  whose light illumes The wildest gloom with warmth and glory ; I know a rose  --  whose blush outblooms The loveliest lip in olden story . I know a lute  --  whose warble low , Might lure an angel down to listen ; I know a pearl  --  whose tender glow Is dearer than all gems that glisten . And who this treasure rich and rare , Whose witchery every moment varies ? The smile  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , rose , lute and pearl are Mary 's . F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : GRASS ........ Unpretending goodness . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) The royal rose  --  the tulip 's glow ,  --  The jasmine 's gold are fair to see , But while the graceful grasses grow , Oh ! gather them for me ! The pansy 's gold and purple wing , The snow-drop 's smile may light the lea , But while the fragrant grasses spring , My wreath of them shall be ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : CHINA-ASTER AND FUCHSIA. from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Caprice is a woman 's privilege . I think of you , love , every moment ,  --  When I have a moment to spare  --  But the beaux , that are buzzing around me , All claim of attention a share . There 's dashing , distingue Lord Harry , And wicked , but witty Sir John ;  --  ' T is said they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had better come on ? I miss you so much ,  --  when alone , love ; But I 've one consolation , you 'll hear : I practice duetts with  --  my own love !  --  My cousin , young Clarence de Vere . His manly voice chords with mine finely , You 'd think they would melt into one ; He sings " Mia Cara " divinely ; He wants to know  --  when you 'll come on ! Your letters are truly delightful !  --  That is  --  what I 've read of them , dear !  --  But old Father Time has grown spiteful ; He flies like a fairy king here . I 've learned the new waltz with Lord Harry ; I 'm reading Rousseau with Sir John ; How very impassioned his style is ! Mamma thinks  --  you 'd better come on . Do n't hurry your business for me , sir  --  Do n't trouble yourself in the least  --  I 'm glowing with health , as you 'll see , sir ; My appetite 's lately increased ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride every day  --  with Sir John  --  And I 'm not sure but I shall  --  go off , love , By the time  --  you conclude to come on ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : CORN ........ Riches . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Cupid , in a pet one day , Pouting with a dainty rage , Flung his downy darts away , Angry at our hardened age . Tears were in his azure eyes ;  --  " Once , " he cried , " my aim was true ; Once the simple , gay , and wise Felt my power where'er I flew ! Hearts of stone ! no shaft divine , Slings henceforth my weapon be ! Give me , wealth , thy ingots fine ,  --  These ensure my victory ! " F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : HELENIA ........ Tears . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) They say I 'm just like thee , child ; I grieve to hear them so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am worn with woe . They say I 'm just like thee , love  --  Alas ! they can not know , Who mark my smiles of glee , love , The source from whence they flow . A pride I would not alter , Forbids me to reveal , Howe'er my soul may falter The wretchedness I feel . And so with idle laughter I while away the hours , And weep in secret after O'er memory 's buried flowers . They say I 'm all too wild , love , They chide my reckless joy ; They call me but a child , love , That plays with every toy . " A child ! " they little know , love , The woman-woes I 've proved ; " Too wild ! " ' t is but to show , love , A soul by grief unmoved . And so with seeming laughter I while away the hours , And weep a moment after O'er memory 's buried flowers ! Yet I was once like thee , sweet ; A singing bird in spring , My spirit fluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Love his arrow sent , love , And broke the buoyant wing , And changed to wild lament , love , The song I used to sing . And now with mocking laughter , I wile away the hours , And weep in anguish after , O'er memory 's buried flowers ! F. S. O Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : LILY , WATER ....... Purity . THE SOUL FLOWER . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Fair grew the Lily , The vestal of flowers , Nursed by the sunshine , Kissed by the showers . Lightly the honey-bee Sang of his love ; Softly the summer air Murmured above ; And the wild butterfly , Beaming and blest , Folded his frolic wings On her white breast . So lent the Lily Her leaves to the air , Woven of snow and light , Holy and fair . All that came to her Went happy away , For she was pure , And loving and gay . Balm , light and melody Flew to the flower , Making an Eden Of bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened by , Brightly she smiled again To the blue sky . And she thanked God For his kindness and care , With her heart 's incense , That rose like a prayer . Thus pure and beautiful , Ne'er could she err ; For she loved all things , And all things , her ! So when Death came to her , With her last sigh , Up stole the Lily 's soul Into the sky ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : LOVE IN A MIST ........ You bewilder me . A FLOWER-CHARADE. from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) The nymphs , in a pet , tripped to Venus one morn , And declared to the gay queen of Beauty , That the freaks of THE FIRST could no longer be borne , That he treated their maiden monitions with scorn , And laughed at their lessons of duty . They regretted to say that he dreamed but of play , While he vowed that he knew more than they did , And , for their part , they begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaxing him , day after day , They were sure that their bloom was quite faded . " We would gladly , " they sighed , " keep his little wings tied ! But the moment we bind him , he cries out , ' No , no ! let me go ! I 've a shaft  --  I 've a bow . ' Then he sharpens his arrow , and frowns at us so , That we fear he will soon put our eyes out ! " Fair Venus , amused at their innocence , smiled , But replied with her wonted suavity ,  --  " My thanks for the tenderness shown to the child ; I know he is petulant , playful and wild , I wish we could teach him more gravity ; But when he 's seen more of the world , he 'll outgrow , I trust , every light peccadillo . I wish him to study the languages ;  --  so Fit him out for his travels ,  --  at once let him go , And Jupiter bless the dear fellow ! " The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nymphs and his mother wept o'er him ; He mounted  --  he bowed  --  and away like the light , Past comet and star , sped the Paphian sprite , With his bow and his arrows before him . The second he reached at the close of the day , And he called for a bottle of nectar , But the blushing bar-maid murmured " What did you say ? Is it this ? " and she gave him a glass of tokay  --  Ah ! do not of mischief suspect her ! The last stole over his senses wild , With a strange , entrancing power ; He danced  --  he staggered  --  he sang  --  he smiled , And at length he wandered away , poor child , To weep in the garden-bower ! His tears sank warm in the earth , and lo ! A flower sprang up , like a fairy ! While the girl , as she saw the boy-god go , Exclaimed , " He has left me a token though , In this blossom , wild , glowing and airy ! I will name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who it was by his ringlets : " So she called it THE WHOLE for the wildered sprite , And it blushed and smiled , through its lattice light , As she wreathed its soft bloom in her ringlets . F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : MARYGOLD ......... The star of Earth . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) If when my star , in Love 's despite , Withdraws her beauty from the Night , I sometimes light , to cheer my way , An earthly lamp 's less sacred ray ; Think not its beam eclipses thine ! In Memory 's heaven thou still dost shine . And oh ! when once again afar , I see thee smile , my idol-star ! How pale , how poor that earth-born ray Beside thy spirit 's heavenly play ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : Low as the sigh of a flower from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Low as the sigh of a flower Heard in the stillness of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fear and delight . F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : ROSE , YELLOW ........ Oh ! teach me to forget . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Yes ! I will do thy bidding ; When yonder sun has set Forever from the heaven you love , Then , dearest , I 'll forget ! When the dove 's winnowing winglet No longer seeks its nest  --  When stars forget to smile in heaven , And ocean is at rest , And glowing summer boasts no more Her radiant roses ' birth , And bloom and light and loveliness Have vanished from the earth ; Then cold and calm Indifference Shall smile at fond Regret , And , lost to Love and Hope and Truth , My passion I 'll forget . But while the sunlight still recalls The glorious hours we met On upland slope , in woody glade , Ah ! how may I forget ? While every pure and lovely thing Some semblance bears to thee  --  While the rose wears thy virgin blush , Thy floating grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile Looks fondly on me yet , And the fond dove thy truth portrays , Ah ! how may I forget ? F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : ROSE , WILD ........ The Blush of Feeling . from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Nay ! come not to me , if you sigh for the splendor That ' neath the lash lightens , in Beauty 's blue eye ; I have naught but affection true , timid and tender , If this be not dear to you  --  all to you  --  fly ! Ah ! seek not my side , if the grace of a ringlet , That goldenly floats , too beguiling can be ; A love such as yours is , can ne'er want a ringlet  --  Go wave it o'er others , but come not to me ! Oh ! come not to me , if you watch the glow stealing O'er Beauty , like roselight of morning on snow ; No bloom warms my cheek , save the wild-rose of Feeling  --  If this be not dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : ROSEBUD , WHITE ........ Innocence . THE FLOWER-SYLPH 'S FROLIC , AT THE BIRTH OF THE ROSEBUD. from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) In my bower I lay , one balmy day , When Nature had put on her summer array , And with me young Fancy , that changeable sprite , My playfellow ever , by day and by night , When suddenly raising her magical bell  --  It was wrought of a diamond in fairy land  --  She rang a sweet peal , that o'er mountain and dell Went floating in melody merry and bland ; And lo ! at the summons a sun-tinted vision Rose slowly , and softly , and clearly to view , A scene of delight and enchantment elysian ,  --  A garden whose blossoms were bathing in dew ; And fair in the midst grew a noble Rose tree , From whose bosom a voice trembled tenderly low  --  Such a voice as you 'd fancy , if flowers were free To speak or to warble , from roses would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " come hither ! Come hither , from blossom and bell ! Come ! ere the noontide wither The blooms we love so well ! " Oh ! hasten to fill up the measure Of joy in the Rose-sylph 's heart ! I will show you an exquisite treasure Whose health you must drink ere we part . " Last night when your bright eyes were closing , A dear little Rosebud was born ! And in her green cradle reposing , She 's at home to relations this morn ! " Then I heard a low musical laugh of delight , Each blossom bowed meekly its dew-jeweled head , While straight through its leaves sprang a sunny-haired sprite , Warm and sweet with the fragrance and bloom of its bed ! From the Lily a delicate being arose , As pure as the leaves that had formed her repose , With silvery winglets , and cheek of faint hue , Like the sunset-glow stealing those snowy leaves through ! The Violet sent forth a timid young thing , With eyes of deep blue , and a soft dewy wing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That fluttered on pinions of purple and gold . The Tulip laid bare its bright heart , and a fairy On beautiful rainbow wings laughingly came , And forth from the Marygold , brilliant and airy , Flew one whose robe glistened with sparkles of flame . From the Pink with a blush stole an elegant sprite ; From the Jasmine a sylph with a sun-tinted vest ; And the Hyacinth oped for a being of light , With a boddice of blue folded over her breast . The Sensitive-plant at the summons shrank up ; Then trembled and oped with a sigh , full of feeling ; While slow from its dainty and delicate cup A tender , ethereal creature came stealing . F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : I own her fair beyond compare from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) I own her fair beyond compare , I own her air , perfection ; But give my bower some timid flower , That asks , each hour , protection ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The floral offering ( 1847 ) The ear attuned  --  through Discord 's war  --  To music 's high , harmonious law , Perceives at once , with shrieking pain , The one false note that mars the strain . Ah ! had thy heart , by Love 's sweet spell , Each jarring tone been tuned to tell , Each chord too rudely strained ,  --  how soon You 'd know that mine was out of tune ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : Oh God ! the vision haunts my day from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) Oh God ! the vision haunts my day , And makes a hateful day of night ; With those disheveled locks of gold , That careless smile 's bewildering light , Why comes she ' twixt my heaven and me , That radiant child of grace and glee ? Go ! witch the world with smile and sigh , Thou priestess proud at Passion 's shrine ! I yield thee every heart save one , And that is all the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , Thou radiant child of grace and glee ! F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : VIOLET , BLUE ........ Humility . FORGIVENESS. from Poems , in The floral offering ( 1847 ) A very little child one day , Too young to know the harm it did , Trampled with his small , naked foot , The place in which a violet hid . The violet sighed its life away , Embalming , with its last , faint breath , The little foot , that thus , in play , Had put its soft , blue flower to death . Ah ! was it not a tender flower To lavish all the wealth it had  --  Its fragrance  --  in its dying hour , Mild , meek , forgiving , mute , though sad ? My little girl , the lesson learn ; Be thou the violet ! love thou so ! Retort no wrong , but nobly turn , And with thy heart 's wealth , bless thy foe . F. S. O. Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floral offering ( 1847 ) She has woven a spell of enchantment , So subtle , so rare and so sweet , That I live in a dream of delight , Love 's worshiping slave at her feet .
