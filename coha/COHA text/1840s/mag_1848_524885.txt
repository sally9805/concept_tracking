txt tution which requires him to " recommend to Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . " He is not merely to recommend subjects to their consideration , but " measures ; " and there is nothing to hinder him from causing the measures he recommends to be put into form , and sent in in the shape of Legislative Bills , through the agency of the Executive Departments . This , it is well known , is not at all an uncommon thing in practice . And wiVhout the agency of these Departments , a legislative committee , if of his own party and principles , answer his purpose just as well . Nor is the initiative in legislation an unmeaning or unimportant thing . It is a substantial power , of great scope and magnitude . It is a power in legislation , if the President chooses to exercise it-at least it may be so under circumstances-only a little less controlling and absolute than that of nomination in appointments to office . Under this very power , to name a single case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recognition of his war with Mexico-in effect a declaration of warwhen if Congress , composed though it was in both Houses of his own friends and party , in large majorities , had been allowed to deliberate , and the members to inform themselves of the true state of things , by the reading and consideration of the public documents in the case , nothing more would have been done , at that time , than to authorize the President to repel any invasion of our proper soil and territory , and for which purpose alone supplies and means would have been placed at his disposal . Instead of this , a war of invasion and conquest on our part , hegun by him , was adopted and sanctioned by Congress , and even a legislative declaration obtained , dictated in ha*c vuba by the Executive , that the war existed " by the act of Mexico ! " The President has the power of the Veto a negative which the Constitution , in terms , makes equal to the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the members of both branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows , is little less than an absolute negative on any and all legislation with which he chooses to interfere . He is , like monarchs under other systems , the fountain of appointment and of honor . s. e can not confer a patent of nobility , but he can confer a patent of office , a much more substantial thing , and quite as much coveted and hankered after , and prized when obtained , in this country , as titles of nobility ever were in any other country . Official rank and station , in truth , constitute our republican noble orders , and are , of course , the only noble orders we have according to law . Our Excellencies and Honorables receive , too , by their commissions , the estate along with the title , which the Peer of other countries , at least in modern times , does not always receive with his new dignity . The President creates his own ministry , and changes them at his will . His will in regard to his ministers is altogether more independent and more absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same matter . The Queen can not keep a ministry in place for a day after the Commons have declared against them upon any important part of their policy of government . A declaration of " want of confidence " by the Commons puts an end to them and their policy . It must be this , or there must be an immediate appeal to the country in a new election . The Queen , or King , reigns , but does not govern , as the French maxim has it . If there be not an agreement between the Commons and the ministry , the government does not go on . It must take a new tack . It is different here . With us the ministers must take care to be in accord with the President if they mean to keep - their places  --  and generally they do mean to keep their places . If he be a man to have a will of his own , it is his will that governs . President Jackson declared that these cabinet officers were only his ngents and instruments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This makes the President and his cabinet together " a unit , " and gives him the virtual command of all the vast patronage of the Executive government in all its departments , in addition to his own direct power of appointment . And with such a power as this in his hands , he knows well enough how to manage a reluctant or refractory Congress . " I have found , sir , " said Mr. Webster , in his late noble speech on Mexican affairs , " in the course of thirty years ' experience , that whatever measure the Executive Government embraces and pushes , is quite likely to succeed . There is a giving way somewhere . If the Executive Government acts 438 May , // with uniformity , steadiness , and entire unity of purpose , sooner or later it is quite apt enough , according to my construction of history too apt , to effect its purpose . " The cases which illustrate this position-annexation-the war-  --  the further acquisition of territory -- are too recent and too remarkable to escape anybody 's attention . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patronage ; and no monarch in the world , in any country , employs this power more freely , or more effectively for his own purposes . This is the practice of our Presidents of late years . His Constitutional power is that of nomination , but in effect and in practice , it is the power of appointment . He creates the Ministry ; he creates the Judiciary ; he creates all foreign ministers and consuls ; he creates or controls the creation of the ( unctionaries of civil administration all over the country ; he is himself the Commander-in-chief of the army and navy , and every commission held in either arm of the public service , is held under his nomination . Nor is the power of the President bounded by the geographical limits of the States of this Union . Our government , from being merely national , has become imperial . We have our provinces and colonies , disguised under the name of territories , and we are multiplying these possessions . They are no part of the nation , are not represented in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them precisely as colonies are governed in other parts of the world . They are our dependencies , and our sway over them is strictly imperial ; and to that extent ours has become an Im - penal Republic . We send them governors , and j adges , and public attornies , and marshalls ; and the President creates them alljust as Victoria sends royal governers and judges , a complete Executive and Judicial Government , at this day , to our neighbors in Canada . But we have said enough , perhaps , to indicate what we mean when we speak of the attributes of true sovereignty with which a President of the United States is clothed . As the head of the nation , he is invested with great authority , even within the letter of the Constitution ; and he is now the head of a great empire also . When we come to add to all this , the po*rer which the President now-a-days is accustomed to assume , without any warrant of the Constitution , and against its express provisions and injunctions , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not fail to see that the President of the United States is what I have called him , a great Potentate , wielding a political authority of tremendous magnitude and importance . The election of such a Potentate becomes , then , a matter of the greatest interest to a people loving liberty and calling themselves free . It is true , the President is elected only for a short term ; and he can not , by the Constitution , transmit his office , or nominate his successor . Practically , however , he may go far towards nominating his successor . Everybody knows that Gen. Jackson did in fact nominate his successor . No Emperor Augustus ever more explicitly named his Cmsar . But a President may do more than this ; he may in hi* short term of office stamp a policy upon the government and country  --  a new policy - which can never afterwards be shaken off , and by which the destiny of the whole country shall be changed . This very thing has been done , and , what is remarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has ever filled the office , who was in by accident , and who went through his term without a party . Mr. Tyler carried the measure of Annexation , though it is perfectly certain , that opinion in Congress , by a strong majority , was against him upon it when he began the movement , and opinion in the country was still more strongly against him . In that measure began a departure from the line and limits of the Constitution , from the objects for which the National Government was established , and the proper destiny of the country under it , which has been promptly working out its legitimate consequences-war , public debt , more territory , and a vast increase of Executive Power . It has " brought death into the world and all our wQe . " The War , and all that comes in its train , sprang from Annexation . The War , too , like Annexation , was purely an Executive measure , literally forced upon Congress and the country by the President  --  a man , out of office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exercising no influence with the American people  --  a man whose opinions , out of office , on any important question of public policy , would never be asked or oared for 1848. 439 // hy the country , or any five well-informed men in it . This President has done another thing besides forcing Congress and the country into a war , equally remarkable . He has forced the Senate of the United States into compliance with his grand scheme and policy , the object of his war from the beginning-that of dismembering Mexico and taking large provinces from her on a compulsory sale . He , President Polk , has done this . Nothing is clearer than that a good deal more than one-third of the Senate were utterly opposed and hostile to such a policy and measure , and without the votes of a number of them the Treaty lately before that body could not have been ratified . How was their assent obtained ? Why , those who yielded , embraced one evil to avoid another , and a greater evil . They believed the alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a still more complete dismemberment , if not the utter absorption , of Mexico . They trembled before the wantonness and madness of Executive power and obstinacy-in the person of Mr. Polk ! They looked upon themselves , upon Congress and the country , as involved inextricably in his toils , from which there wa* no escape , but by his consent , and on his terms . He said , pay me this ransom , and I will r*lense you ; and they were willing to get off so , before he should double his demands , which he threatened to do . Annexation was an Executive measure ; the War was and is an Executive measure ; conquest and Mexican spoli*tion is an Executive measure . The country at large has had nothing to do with them , except as it has been dragged in to their support , or rather to an unwilling and painful acquiescence in them . And through these Executive measures , the government is to he changed , and the country is to be changed . With Mexican States added to our Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation in the Senate multiplied out of all proportion to the popular representation in the House ; with a foreign population of strange faces and strange language - peoiis , serfs and bondsmen-annexed to us and made free , native citizejis along with us , we shall not know ourselves or know our country . And all this a President of the United States may do , and bring about all this change , this essential revolution , and carry Congress along with him , and even chain the country to his triumphal car ; and he may do all this as President , wielding the potentialities of his eminent and imperial office , when as a man , out of official station , his weight in the community would be about equal to that of a respectable country parson , or village schoolmaster . Such , and so commanding , so powerful for evil , so nearly uncontrollable and irresponsible , is a President of these United States ; and we the people go on , electing every four years one of these high Potentates , with very inadequate consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do , little knowing , oftentimes , whether we are giving ourselves a Republican President , or a supercilious and imperial master  --  a Constitutional Executive , or a paltry yet powerful tyrant , the Chief Demagogue of an unprincipled party , or else the instrument of the Chief Demagogues of such a party , who will count the blood of the Constitution an unholy thing , and sacrilegiously put up the country as an idle stake in all sorts of dishonest and desperate games of hazard . As the period is at hand when the country must be engaged in another Presidential Election-another of these solemn and sublime acts of popular sovereigntyit is proper , if such a thing he possible , where everything is under " movement , " that we should pause long enough to look about us , to take a view of the ground we stand on and the state of things around us , and to consider whether the point and condition to which we have been brought , especially under the lead of the President last elected , is altogether agreeable and satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country to maintain its present positiQn , and prosecute the line of policy and movement on which it has been forced , or to stop short and to retreat , if retreat he not wholly cut off , and it be not too late to- stop , in order to find its way back , if it can , at least to some of those intrenched positions behind the Constitution , from which it has sadly wandered , and where , as often and as long as it has occupied them , it has always been safe , prosperous and happy . At least it is proper , when a Presidential term is about to be concluded , and the incumbent himself , or some one representing the same party 440 May , // of the same political kidney and complexion , and pledged to the same measures and general policy , or worse if worse can be contrived , is to be offered for the suifrages of the people , that there should be a strict consideration and canvass of the merits of the President and the current Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny , without fear except the fear of God , in the spirit of a true devotion to the interests and the fame of the country , and to the cause of the Constitution , of liberty , and of law , exposing faults and follies though with charity , and above all things exposing , with inexorable decision and firmness , all crimes committed against the Constitution and the country ; for , unhappily , it is crime , and hardly faults or follies at all-deliberate , wanton crime , in too many cases , little as the perpetrators may think of it or be conscious of it-which is committed , in these times , against the country . In a work of this sort* , it belongs to a public and political Journal like this to take its full share . It will certainly do so-though it will be no new duty or service on which we shall enter . We have done what we could , from the beginning , to make President Polk and his administration known to the American people , and to cause him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this course of proceeding , and with added energy and zeal as the time draws nigh when the country , through the peaceable forms of an election , is to make up , and enter on undying records , its solemn testimony and judgment , in regard to his conduct and acts , his policy and measures , and the manner in which he has acquitted himself in all the high trusts committed to him . Pursuing this general object at the present time , it will be our special design in the space that remains to us for this article , to bring into one connected view , as well as we can , but of course only in brief and imperfect outline , the prominent features and workings of the policy of President Polk in conducting the affairs of the Government , in order that we may have before us , and that our countrymen may have before them , sketched out and grouped t%ether for easy reference , the main points and matters connected with his administration , to which their attention will have to be principally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal subjects and topics of investigation and of political labor amongst the people and before the country , in the exciting season that is now just upon us . The whole duty of the Executive in this country , charged with the &amp;onduct of an administration , and the affairs of government , so far as the observance of great cardinal principles is concerned , may be comprehended and summed up in the following propositions : I. He must take the Constitution for his constant guide and counsellor , and he must take care to keep himself strictly within its authority and limitations , in whatever he does , or directs , or authorizes , or recommends to be done ; nor must be refuse or neglect to do whatever the Constitution and laws enjoin upon him as a duty . II . In the matter of our relations with foreign powers and nations , he must take care that the policy of the Government shall be marked at once with strict justice and high dignity-demanding nothing but . what is right , and submitting to nothing that is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings of any ; observing the strictest neutrality towards all contending or belligerent powers ; and forming en tangling alliances with none . III . It is his duty to see that the government is made as cheap and economical , in its whole administration , as it can be consistently with due efficiency and a becoming dignity ; and especially to avoid the creation of a Public Debt , small or great , except upon some overwhelming necessity involving the vital interests , the defence , or the honor of the nation . IV . In exercising the powers with which the General Government is invested in order " to provide for the common defence and promote the general welfare " - in exercising its powers in relation to national protection and security , to foreign commerce and internal trade and navigation , and to revenue , iind its jurisdiction over the navigable waters of rivers , lakes , bays and harbors-it is the duty of the . Executive to take care , as far as his authoiity and influence may go , that the Government shall , within the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical improvements in proper localities , do what it can to promote , ad1848. 441 // vance and facilitate intercommunication and interchange between the several States of tWe Union . V. In the regulation of foreign commerce and in the conduct of its own proper operations and business ; in providing for itself a revenue by duties on imports , and in the management of its revenue and its fiscal affairs ; the President must take care , as far as he can , that the Government shall shape its policy with a special reference to the protection and encouragement of home production and home industry ; and also so as to affect beneficially , and not injuriously , the general moneyed and business concerns and interests of the community . VI . The President must so conduct his administration as to make the Government a great Exemplar to the community , of Truth , Justice , Moderation and Virtue ; for a profligate or unprincipled government in a republic sap* the foundations , and betrays the cause of human liberty . Taking these few brief but pregnant principles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and measures of the Administr* tion since Mr. Polk has been at the head of affairs , it will not be difficult to compute the value of his official services to the country ; nor will there be any danger of going beyond the mark and ( loing him injustice , in the severe rebuke and utter condemnation which he can not fail to receive , for his course and policy in the conduct of affairs , from the country , or at least from all that intelligent and honest portion of it who have themselves any real principles in politics , anything fit to be so called , to stand upon . We believe the principles We have laid down are those of the Whig party everywhereand there are few enlightened men of any pat-ty who would not subscribe to them as abstract propositions ; and so glaring and flagrant have been the departures from every one of them in nearly the whole conduct of the Administration , that at least the Whi0 party , and all who think as we do , and who look upon these principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail to raise their voices , and put forth their efforts , in strong , unyielding , and indignant opposition to the President , and to the party that gives him countenance and support . I. Turning to look for a moment at the I treatment which the Constitution has received from the President , we find him putting that sacred instrument aside with a wave of his imperial hand , and , in matters of the highest national concern , marching straight forward to his own objects , with as little regard for the limitations and restrictions it imposes on the Executive power , as if he were the Czar of Russia , or the Grand Sultan , instead of the President of the United States . by a premeditated and deliberate act of deep design , he brings on a collision between the forces of the United States and those of a neighboring power , and plunges the nation into hostilities and flagrant war , from which there could be no escape but at the close of a protracted and most sanguinary conflict . This done , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little actual information in regard to the real state of affairs , but with our little army far away from home and our own soil , in the midst of the possessions of the Mexican people , and surrounded by overwhelming numbers of an incensed enemy , resolved to give them battle , and altogether the exigency of the case made so urgent , that no proper deliberation could be had , or none was allowed to be had , and in this way the full recognition of the war was secured , and the means obtained for prosecuting it-making it , in effect , a national war , as completely as if it had been originally undertaken and dechyred by the proper constitutional authority . Once in the war , it became the common cry that we must fight it out . The House of Representatives , by a decisive vote taken the other day , after the country had been carrying on a war of invasion and conquest in the heart of the Mexican dominions for twenty months , at the cost of a hundred millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this very war had been " begun unconstitutionally and unnecessarily by the Executive of the United States 1 " And we do not hesitate to affirm that this is to-day the undoubting conviction of eight-tenths of all wellinformed persons , of whatever party or political creed , throughout the length and breadth of the land . Nobody , not blinded to the simple truth by political partialities and partisanship , can entertain a doubt of it . 442 May , // Nor had the President any im*pulse or motive of patriotism , or of liberal and enlightened statesmanship , to offer as an excuse for this fatal proceeding . He had formed a plan of illustrating his reign of four years , and perhaps securingthereby the succession to himself , by adding vast regions of Mexican territory , and considerable numbers of Mexican population to the United States  --  a secret , selfish and wicked plan , which he dared not disclose to the American people ; since he well knew how sternly the faces of all considerate and disinterested persons would be set against it , and how surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be repudiated , scouted , disclaimed and discarded by the whole sober sense of the country . His design was to clutch and secure the object , if he could , before the country should be made aware of his purpose ; or at least to push matters so far that retreat would be impossible , without personal discredit , when at least he would be sure of the support of his party , and thereby of the acquiescence of large portions of the community , who have never any time to think for themselves , and allow others to think for them -- especially in matters of high public concern . He knew very well-it required only a very little observation , and some low calculation , bottomed on the worst aspects of human nature , to know-that the imaginations of men in a country of speculation and enterprise like this , are easily caught and 4azzled with what may seem to be a grand movement-something , anything , done or achieved out of the ordinary course of things . If he could fasten his hand on New Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wondering gaze of the American people as a prize already secured , and only awaiting their acquiescence and consent , he calculated with entire certainty on the issue . Texas had been annexed-itself a proceeding in utter contempt of constitutional limitations and forms ; and there was a question of unsettled boundary , which it was the duty of the President to have fixed by negotiations . That question was , whether the Nueces was the utmost limit of Texas in that direction ; or whether any other and what line should be taken beyond it . Mexico had withdrawn herself from all relations with us from the time when we proposed , by an official act , to take Texas to our embrace , while she and Mexico were in a state of war . We had offered to throw our shield over Texas , and we told Mexico that when that was done , if she fought anybody , any further , for the possession of that country , she must fight us . In this state of things Mr. Polk came into power . Before Annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still as foreign to us as Cuba or Canada-while it still remained for Congress to determine and pass upon the final question of her admission to our Union-she being still an independent Republic  --  the President undertook the defence of that country against a threatened invasion of her old enemy . This was done , he said , because the authorities of that country had invited and appealed to him for support and defence ! It was , then , what Texas demanded , and not what the Constitution prescribed or allowed , that governed the decision of the President in that matter . This was his first unauthorized movement towards a war with Mexico . An army was marched to Texas and took post on the Nueces , ready , according to positive instructions from the President , to defend that country and repel all invaders . And thus , if Texas had been invaded by Mexico , as was threat*ned , the President , in th' t way and at that time , without the slightest authority from Congress or the Constitution , would have involved us in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had in view , he would have seen a collision of arms , at that time , with , gratification , not as likely to lead to a protracted conflict , but as the probable means of bringing Mexico , weak and timid as he believed her to be , more easily to the point of that heavy sacrifice of territory to which he had resolved to reduce her , than perhaps could be done by naked negotiation , and the mere appliance of money . This plan failed , because Mexico insisted on putting herself strictly on the defensive against her new enemy , and would not , therefore , venture on an invasion of Texas . The President then set on foot a diplomatic intrigue-it deserves no better nameto effect his grand design of acquiring Mexican territory . He would secure his object by negotiation and voluntary cession , obtained through the weakness or 1848. 443 // treachery of some false and corrupted Mexican chieftain , or he would make the failure of the intrigue the occasion and excuse for a military demonstration , and , if need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " reside " near that government , as if nothing had happened to interrupt the harmony of the two powers . It was not the object of that mission to find and fix the proper line of boundary between Mexico and Texas , which was simply the duty of the President after Annexation had been consummated , so far as any question of territory was concerned between the two countries . The object was , by threats of war , and judicious pecuniary appliances , to bring Mexico , or some chief or another in Mexico , to consent to sell to the United States large portions of her territory . The Plenipotentiary , it is understood , carried with him proposals for the purchase , 1st , of the countiy up to the Rio Grande-that very country to which it has been so much insisted our title was clear and unquestionable ; 2d , the remainder of New Mexico beyond the Rio Grande ; and , 3d , a part or all , or nearly all , of Upper California . The amount of our claims upon Mexico-four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel ; five millions more for the second ; and twenty or twenty-five millions more , accordii*g to quantity , for California . The Mexican government refused to receive Mr. Slidell , as a minister resident , until the ground for a restoration of fx*iendly relations had been prepared by some proper understanding in regard to the offensive measure of Annexation . Baffled in this attempt , the President did not hesitate about his course . In anticipation , indeed , of this event , he issued orders to the army to take possession , on the ground of indisputable ownership and right , of a part of the very territory which he had been endeavoring to secure by negotiation and purchase . Thus was this shameful war brought on . It began on the Rio Grande ; but with so much certainty had the President calculated on this issue , that our naval forces on the coast of Mexico in the Pacific , under the direction of Coin . Sloat , were ready , with instructions of a date long previous , on the first notice of hostilities , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the principal towns and forts in that quarter . Who could have believed-who among that band of noble spirits who assisted in framing this goodly form of Government , and in putting it into operation , could have believed , that the time would arrive so soon when a President of the United States , a man , too , of no particular force , and having no hold on the popular feeling or confidence , would dare to entertain and devise a project for the dismemberment of a neighboring power , and actually begin a war for this object , into the support of which he should finally wheedle or force the nation , and to carry on that war to the point , or prospect , of ultimate and complete success ! Yet all this has been done in the time of the tenth President of the United States , and when the Constitution was not yet sixty years old . It would be unreasonable to expect that a President who had deliberatel*y set the Constitution aside in order to make a war , would give that instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was important , in order to carry his war of conquest as promptly as possible towards the heart of the enemy 's country , and at the same time to make the war popular at home , if it could be made so , to take advantage of the national and instinctive bravery and enterprise of our people , and to accept the services of such as might be disposed to engage in the work of carrying the conquering standard of the country into a foreign land . It was not difficult to find persons enough who were willing and anxious to bear commissions in such a service . But it so happens , that none but soldiers regularly enlisted in the army of the United States , and under the command of officers , of all grades , appointed and commissioned by the United States , can , by the Constitution , be employed in a war , the operations of which are to be carried on beyond the limits of the Republic . Militia  --  and all troops are militia , whose company and field officers are appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be employed in war , except " to repel invasions . " Yet the President called for large bodies of volunteers , which , as they are organized and officered , are only militia , and procured the sanction of Congress to his demand , with the design of sending 444 May , // them , and he did send them , into a foreign land , in a war of invasion and conquest . It was a natural consequence of a successful war of conquest thus begun and prosecuted , that the President should claim himself to be the conqueror of the countries brought under the power of our arms and should proceed , in his own name and by his own authority , to establish civil governments over all territories where the submission of the inhabitants should be received , and to institute , in all places under his military occupation , a regular system for the imposition of taxes and the collection of a revenue for the exclusive and independent use of the military chest . The President makes a war of invasion and conquest , employs militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered places without the aid of Congress , and , finally , undertakes to support his army , in part at least , by a regular Executive system of taxation and revenue . So much for Mr. Polk 's observance of the solemn promise which he made to the nation in his inaugural address , and to which he had just then bound himself by a solemn oath . " The Constitution , " said he , " will be the chart by which I shall be directed . It will be my first care to administer the government in the true spirit of that instrument , and to assume no power n9t expressly granted , or clearly implied in its terms. ** II . The next rule which we have quoted and laid down as proper and necessary for the government of the President in his official conduct , has been no better kept than that we have just been considering . This rule has reference to the conduct of the President in the matter of our relations with foreign powers . It requires that he shall govern himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict right , and that he shall leave all other nations to manage their own internal affairs in their own way . It enjoins upon him the policy and the duty of non-interference , and strict neutrality . In this connection we can only refer to the line of conduct adopted by him towards England in regard to the Oregon question , without pretending to enter into an exposition of that conduct . It was wholly wanting in moderation , truth and dignity , and but for the timely interposition of the Senate , and the adoption of better councils in that body , he would have inevitably brought the two nations into the conflict and strife of arms . Happily we escaped , in that instance , the consequences which his course and conduct were preparing for us . Unhappily , however , we have not been so fortunate in respect to the line of policy pursued by him towards Mexico . In following the President , now or at any time , through his tortuous course towards the Mexican nation ; whenever , in fine , we undertake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at sundry times , to justify his proceedings and his war , we shall need , in order to avoid being misled , to keep this main fact constantly in mind , namely , that his design of dismembering Mexico lay at the bottom of the whole affair . When he sent Mr. Slidell to Mexico , not to soothe that power for the loss of Texas , and to fix the boundary between the two countries on just and liberal terms , but to prosecute a dishonest demand for territory , Herrera was at the head of affairs , and every way disposed to make a just and reasonable accommodation with us . Paredes soon after displaced Herrera . This chief did not at all suit the views of the President . What he wanted was a chief who might be approachable , for a consideration , with propositions distasteful and dishonorable to Mexico , and he turned to Santa Anna as the man for his purposes . Santa Anna was then in Cuba , having been expelled from the government and driven into exile by his countrymen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to Mexico by the President , to overthrow Paredes and resume bis sway in that distracted country . On the same day on which the President sent his war message to Congress , which was not till he had brought the armies of the two countries into collision , he dispatched an order to Coin . Conner , in the Gulf , to admit Santa Anna to pass freely into Mexico , should he present himself for that object . This was in May . In June he was passed in , according to order , and shortly after succeeded in effecting the proposed revolution . Now the pretence and apology for this intrigue and interference with the internal affairs of Mexico , were , that Paredes was suspected of favoring a monarchical party in that country . In two different procla 1848. 445 // mations , emanating directlyfrom the Government at Washington , and addressed to the Mexican people , it was avowed and declared that a principal object of the war from the beginning had been to put down the monarchists , and secure the triumph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fatal movement of our troops to the Rio Grande , by which the war was precipitated , arid the further prosecution of military operations on the line of that river , had a principal reference to the bringing about of a revolution in the government of Mexico , we suppose admits of no doubt . Hear what is said in one of the proclamations referred to : " Reasons of high policy and of continental American interest precipitated events , in spite of the circumspection ( ! ) of the cabinet at Washington When it was indulging th' most flattering hopes of accomplishing its aim by frank explanations and reasonings ( ! ) addressed to the judgment and prudence of the virtuous and patriotic government of Gen. D. J. Herrera ( ! ) , the misfortune least looked for dispelled this pleasant hope , that is to say , Paredes assumed the government , and at the same time blocked up every avenue which could lead to an honorable settlement between the two nations . The new government discarded the national interests , as well as those of Continental America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these interests and the most fatal to the future of Mexican liberty and of the Republican System , which the United States hold it a duty to preserse and protect . Duty , honor , and dignity itself imposed upon us the necessity of not losing a season of which the monarchical party was taking the most violent advantage , for not a moment was to be lost ; and we acted with the promptness and decision necessary in a case so urgent , " &amp;c . Theobjectwhich the President had in view  --  the overthrow of Paredes , and the substitution of Santa Anna in his placeis doubtless truly enough stated in this manifesto ; but the true motive and the ultimate design are not here disclosed . It was altogether foreign to his duty , and a gross violation of every sound principle , for him to interpose , and that too with the army of the United States , to change the government or administration of affairs in Mexico , upon any ground or pretext of serving the cause of " Mexican liberty and of the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest motive in the case . But we must refuse to give the President credit for sincerity in ascribing to himself such a motive . It was not Mexican liberty that he was after-it was Mexican territory . There was no feeling or consideration for Mexico in the matter - except such as vultures have for lambs . It was a naked design of dismembering that country , through the treachery and betrayal of a government , or chief , to be set up and established for that purpose , by which he was governed . It was a naked feeling of rapacity which dictated his whole policy . He wanted her territory , and he was resolved to have it . Paredes stood in his way , and he set on foot a plan to revolutionize the government . He believed , undoubtedly , that Santa Anna would be found purchasable , and he procured his return to the country . He began in the stupid belief that when he and Santa Anna together had effected a revolution in the government , there would be nothing left to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the land , and Santa Anna the money . He acted under a delusion , as men of small cunning are very apt to do . All that he accomplished was to give back to Mexico her ablest chief and general ; to impose on himself the necessity of making the war one of naked and undisguised conquest , and to track his way deep in blood over every rood of ground trodden in his path towards the attainment of his grand object-the dismemberment of a country , for whose " liberty and Republican System " he had professed such tender concern . III . But we pass to other topics . And we desire it should be understood that we do not profess to do more in this article , than to indicate and present , in the most general way , the several subjects of political debate , connected with the conduct and policy of Mr. Polk and his administration , and arranged with some regard to order and convenience , which , as we suppose , are likely principally to occupy and employ the thoughts - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approaching presidential canvass . They are subjects to which it is probable our own humble labors may be a good deal devoted in the stirring period just now at hand . What , then , shall we say of President Polk and his policy and proceedings , when 446 May , // we come to consider the question-always a vital one in a republic-whether the government , under his lead , has made , as it was bound to do , the practice of a rigid economy in the public expenditures , a cardinal point in its policy , and whether it has strenuously aimed to avoid creating a public debt ? There are some plain facts which must be written down in this connection . As an example of what the Government is doing , it is found that its expenditures , during the present fiscal year , ending on the first of July next , will not be less , probably , than sixty-five millions of dollars . This is one fact . Another is this : that the public debt at the end of the present fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and including twenty-five millions of dollars to pay for Mexican territory  --  a purchase which gives us no domain , but fastens a perpetual curse upon us-will amount , according to the best - calculation we have been able to make , only in ascertained and ascertainable items , to the formidable sum of $98,800,000 . If peace shall be made on the basis of the treaty lately ratified by the Senate , which is yet a very doubtful issue , still the expenditures will go on outrunning the revenues of the government ; and when the fourth of March , 1849 , shall come round , bringing the present term of Mr. Polk to a period , the public debt of the country will not be less than one hundred and ten millions , if it shall be less than one hundred and twenty millions of dollars . At the close of the preceding Administration , the amount of the public debt was just about ten millions of dollars , after deducting the balance leftin the Treasury . The amount of debt , therefore , created in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a legacy to the country , if circumstances the most favorable shall attend it from this time to its close , will certainly not be less than one hundred millions of dollarsit may be a hundred and twenty millions . All this , however , is exclusive of the millions expended , or promised and due , or which will become due , in the shape of bounties in public lands , and other millions with which the Treasury will be burthened for long years to come , in the shape of pensions , and to pay for claims and losses , and all the odds and ends which are sure to follow on after such enterprises as the Adminis tration has been carrying forward . It will take some millions more to replace the stores and munitions which had been gathered in years of peace and laid up for the defence of the country , and which have been expended and destroyed in the career of rapacity and bucaneering ambition , by which the President has illustrated his brief term of official domination . Sixty-five millions of dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could suffice Mr. Polk for carrying on the operations of the government for a single year . At the end of his four years he will have expended in cash , received into the Treasury from ordinary sources of revenue , and including the balance which he found there when he came in , about one hundred and twenty-three millions , and he will have created and saddled upon the country besides a debt of at least one hundred naillions more . Mr. Adams 's administration cost the country , exclusive of payments on account of the public debt , an average yearly sum of about twelve millions six hundred thousand , or about fifty millions five hundred thousand for four years . This contrasts rather strongly with sixty millions , exclusive of payments on account of public debt , expended in a single year of Mr. Polk 's administration . But there was no war in Mr. Adams 's time . There was , however , a war  --  a war with Great Britain , which taxed and tasked the energies of the country to the utmost-iduring Mr. Madison 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as little to the advantage of Mr. Polk . The sum of the expenses for the EIGHT years of Mr. Madison 's administration was ONE HUNDRED AND rORTY-rOUR MILLIONS six HUNDRED THO*U5AND DOLLARS , or an average of eighteen millions a year ; while the sum of the expenses for the rou* years of Mr. Polk 's administration , , exclusive of payments on account of debt , will be more than *wo HUNDRED MILLIONS ; though this will include twenty-five millions to pay mainly for vast barren wa*stes of desert and mountain in Mexico , or rather for jurisdiction to the Imperial Government at Washington , over such a country , and over the sparse and wretched population that vegetates upon it . It will be for the country to say whether any sufficient apology can be found for these vast expenditures and this public 1848. 447 // 448 May , qwq // The President and his Administratwfl. lation enough , and wealth , character , and civilization enough in each to make a respectable nation or empire ; all this we may do , and all this we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present Administration are carried out to their consummation ; and when it is done , and fully completed , we shall no longer have a Constitution , or an American Republican Union . IV . But two or three other topics claim a passing notice before we bring this article to a close . We have spoken of the duty of the government in regard to Internal Improvements , and have laid it down as an undoubted principle that it is bound , in the exercise of its necessary powers , to do what can he done , within the limits of a wise discretion , to give protection , security , encouragement and facility , by means of these improvements , to the operations and movements of internal trade , travel and transportation . The first Congress that sat under the Constitution , by a formal enactment , recognized the duty of performing all necessary and proper acts , and making all necessary and proper provisions " within any bay , inlet , harbor , or port of the United States , for rendering the navigation thereof safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the expenses of such necessary works should be defrayed out of the Treasury of the United States . *j ? his was in 1789 . The wants of commerce , in this respect , were satisfied , at that day , with " light-houses , beacons , buoys and public piers , " constructed and placed in the bays and harbors of the Atlantic coast . Sonn afterwards the works necessary for rehdering these bays and harbors " safe and easy " were increased in number and variety ; and as early as 1798 , Congress set the example of a law for improving the channel of a river in the interior of a State . From this time forward the legislation of Congress went on , strictly within the limits of the Constitutional authority under which the first light-house was constructed , or the first buoy planted , but extending and multiplying the means of rendering navigation safe and easy , as the country itself expanded , and the wants and necessities of trade and transportation , internal and external , increased . Appropriations for harbor and river improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tyler , both inclusive , amounting altogether to more than seventeen millions of dollars . Under Gen. Jackson 's administration alone ten and a half millions were appropriated for these objects . It is only in comparatively recent times that it has become a matter of prime importance and paramount interest that the care and consideration of the Government in the matter of these improvements , should be extended to the great lakes and to the Western rivers . A trade of three hundred millions of dollars annually , which has already sprung up in these quarters , renders attention to these lakes and rivers , with a view to increasing the security and facility of their navigation , an indispensable duty , unless the whole system of harbor and river improvements , everywhere , on the Atlantic as well as in the West , is to be abandoned . It is , indeed , the utter abandonment of the whole system and policy everywhere , which is recommended to the country , and insisted on by Mr. Polk in one of the most earnest and elaborate State papers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veto Message of Dec. 15 , 1847 , an appeal is taken from Congress to the people against this whole policy . " In view , " he says , " not only of the Constitutional difficulty , but as a question of policy , I am clearly of opinion that the whole subject should be left to the States . " Gen. Jackson undertook to draw certain arbitrary distinctions with a view to limit the objects to which appropriation should be made . Other . Presidents also have desired to restrict these appropriations to objects of a particular character or class . But this is the first time , we think , that a President has formally proposed and insisted on the utter abandonment of the whole subject by the National Government  --  to go back , in this particular , to the Confederation , and charge the States with the care and control of all works and operations designed to make navigation " safe and easy , " not only in all rivers , but in all bays and harbors , within their respective limits . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungracious task of attempting to cut off the lakes and the great rivers of the interior from the beneficent care and action of the Government , with all the vast commerce which belongs to them , daily grow* ing as it is in magnitude , and involving pretty directly the interests and the business of fully one half the population of the 1848. // Union , while that care and action should still be extended to all the wants of commerce on our Atlantic border . We are free to say that justice and fair dealing , and the plainest dictates of duty under the Constitution , require the total abandonment of this policy in all quarters , or else that it shall be applied with an equal hand in whatever quarter urgent demands for its exercise may arise ; but we think , at the same time , that until the Government is prepared to go quite back to the plan of the Confederation , to give up its whole jurisdiction over commerce , foreign and domestic , and over all navigable waters-not to build or to maintain a light-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from duties imposed on imported merchandiseno longer to maintain ships of war at home or abroad for the protection and safeguard of our commercial marine , and no longer to employ consuls and ministers in watching in foreign ports and countries , the interests andconcerns of commerce- until the Government is prepared to go thus far in a movement backward , like a crab , we hold , and shall hold , that it is bound , by the same constitutional authority and duty under which it acts in any of the particulars here referred to , to adopt and prosecute a wise and discreet system of harbor and river improvements which shall not slight or neglect the urgent wants of commerce and navigation wherever they exist , or shall be found to arise . It is a little curious , certainly , to see a President , who finds no constitutional difficulty in the way of paying money out of the national treasury for the construction or use of a canal or railway from ocean to ocean , across Mexican territory , or of sending out ships of war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doctrines of " strict construction , " and his grave doubts , against all propositions for improving harbors and rivers at home . But Mr. Polk is used to looking abroad , instead of taking care of the interests of the nation at home . Oregon , up to " fifty-four forty , " at one time was dearer to him , apparently , than the whole country he was appointed to preside over , from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean ; and so New Mexico and California seem to be now . All his policy and all his energies have been directed to objects at a distance , and out of his own country . lie was no sooner in place than his vagrant eye struck out for Queen Charlotte 's Island , and San Francisco , and Santa F* , and Tehuantepec , and the Dead Sea . His dreams were about an " American Continental System , " and he threw out a defiance to Russia and England , if they should dare attempt to plant their subjects in any uninhabited part of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico happened not to be in hands to suit him , and he sent an army into that country , proclaiming that a principal object was to revolutionize the government , and place the power in other hands . A hundred millions spent in this object , and in persuading Mexico , by arguments spoken in the thunder of cannon and written in blood , to spare to us , who are so straightened for room , the half of her empire  --  a debt of a hundred millions saddled on the country for objects so worthy , so indispensable , and in such harmony with the designs of the Constitution , and the character and genius of this Republic ; this is nothing ( the money , we mean , ) in the estimation of Mr. Polkhardly worth considering-while a million , or half a million , or a tenth part of that sum even , spent in works of necessary improvement at home-spent for the benefit of his peace-loving and industrious countrymen at home-seems to strike him with alarm , as tending to the overthrow of the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not , of course , permitted to wonder , after what we know of the manner in which the attention of the President has been engaged and absorbed in objects outside of the limits of his own country , that he should think it a matter of very trifling importance-if , indeed , he should think of such a matter at all-how the interests and affairs of the business community , how the interests of property , of industry and of labor , may be affected by the measures which , the Government shall adopt for the supply of its own exchequer , and for the management of its funds and its fiscal affairs . Everybody knows , upon the slightest reflection , that such considerable operations as those referred to  --  the imposition of taxes in the shape of duties on imports , and the gathering in of revenue from them to the amount of twenty-five or thirty millions a year ; the 450 May , // receipt of thirty , fifty , or sixty millions a year , by loans or otherwise , into the treasury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast sums by the Government-that operations like these can not be carried on at all without producing a strong effect , one way or another , on the business and industry of the country , and on the monetary affairs of the community . Production in every department must be affected by them ; currency must be affected by them ; employment and prices must be affected by them . The occupations in which whole communities shall engage , the channels into which the industry of the whole country shall be turned , may , and must , to a considerable extent , depend on the action and policy of the Government in the particulars here referred to . To Mr. Polk , however , all this seems a matter of the most perfect indifference . Having certain foreign objects of ambition or particular desire to accomplish , requiring a heavy expenditure of money , he must have a tariff adjusted exclusively to the production of the greatest possible amount of revenue , regardless of the certain and inevitable destruction which it must bring , sooner or later , on particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general prosperity of the country . A tariff framed with a view to encourage and secure the largest possible amount of importations , for the sake of reaping the largest possible amount of revenue from the duties on them-this , and nothing less , can satisfy the President , though it be certain to the plainest comprehension that the result must be the depression of all kinds of business , the utter ruin of many , and , if the experiment bc continued long enough , inevitable national bankruptcy . If the country must have its full supplies of manufactured goods from abroad-its woolens , cottons , iron , and a hundred other things-in order that the Government may tax the imports for revenue , then the production of such articles at home must be given up ; and this involves necessarily the ruin of all interests engaged in such production at home . And if these supplies must be received from abroad , and not produced at home at all , or to any considerable extent , the importations must be enormously great , and they must be paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avails of our national industry , or we must soon sink into overwhelming indebtedness . Our resort is necessarily to agriculture ; we can go nowhere but to the soil . But those from whom we take our supplies of merchandise have a soil of their own , and no lack of hands to work it ; and except in case of a general failure of crops , and the very rare occurrence of a threatened fainme , they want , and they will take , very little , almost nothing , comparatively , of the edible productions of our fields . The balance of trade of course runs against us ; when we can not pay in the productions of our industry , in kind , we must pay in gold and silver so long as we have it ; and when that fails , as fail it must , since , in the operations of trade , its only legitimate and reliable use is to pay casual balances , then the last stage of national folly , distress and disgrace is reached . But what is all this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean time , his ample returns of revenue ? And as little does it seem to concern him , that this is wholy a gratuitous mischief and ruin , which his tariff policy is bringing on the country . It admits of the clearest demonstration , that a tariff , arranged on the principles and general basis of that of 1842 , and affording ample and equal protection to all the leading ob* jects of our national industry , is a better tariff for revenue , if we would only give it steadiness and permanence , than Mr. Polk 's tariff of 1846 . The policy of the President in regard to the tariff is of the same character as that which he has adopted in his plau for the management of the fiscal affairs of the government . So far as the Sub-treasury is not a great government cheat-in John Bull 's language , an unmitigated humbugit is a cumbrous machine , giving no facilities or honest advantages whatever to the government , but bearing all the while with the weight of an incubus on the community , and ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of intolerable distress to the whole country . In a country , where the established and universal currency is paper , issued on the basis of gold and silver , and immediately convertible into it , the Government undertakes or professes to repudiate that currency , and to take the gold and silver exclusively for its use as money . It goes to the basis , the foundation , on which the 1848.
