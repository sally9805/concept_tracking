Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : Turn to thy books , my gentle girl from Poems , in Sibylline verses ( 1846 ) Turn to thy books , my gentle girl  --  They will not dim thine eyes ; That hair will all as richly curl , That blush as sweetly rise . Turn to thy friends  --  a smile as fond On friendship 's lip may be , And breathing from a heart as warm As love can offer thee . Turn to thy home ! affection wreathes Her dearest garland there ; And , more than all , a mother breathes For thee  --  for thee , her prayer . Too soon  --  oh ! all too soon will come In later years the spell , Touching with changing hues thy path , Where once but sunlight fell . Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : As smiles with glory , soft but warm from Poems , in Sibylline verses ( 1846 ) As smiles with glory , soft but warm , The morning ' mid the wreathing mist , So through thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist , Yet meekly bow before the blast Their leaves , that but from lightness quiver , And when the unwelcome wind has pass 'd , Look up again as bright as ever  --  So meets thy brow the storm of fate , Yet meekly seems to yield the while , And so , wert thou left desolate , Thou ' dst look to heaven with tender smile .
