txt THE author of " Sartor Resartus , " in a petition to the House of Commons , on the copyright question , signs himself " Thomas Carlyle , a Maker of Books . " This phrase , which applies to Herr Teufelsdr6ckh only in a quaint sense , is applicable to Mr. G. P. R. James in its literal meaning . He is , indeed , no " maker " in the old significance of that term , for he creates nothing ; but he is emphatically a literary mechanic . The organs of his brain are the tools of his trade . He manufactures novels , as other people manufacture shoes , shirts , and sheetings . He continually works up the same raw material into very nearly the same shapes . The success he has met with in his literary speculations should be chronicled in the Merchants ' or Mechanics ' Magazine . He is a most scientific expositor of the fact , that a man may be a maker of hooks without being a maker of thoughts ; that he may he the reputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his literary wares , and yet have very few ideas and principles for his stock in trade . For the last ten years , he has been repeating his own repetitions , and echoing his own echoes . His first novel was a shot that went through the target , and he has ever since been assiduously firing through the hole . To protect his person from von . LvILI. - No. 123. 35 // critical assault , he might pile up a bulwark of books many volumes thick and many feet high . Yet the essence of all that he has written , if subjected to a refining process , might be compressed into a small space , and even then would hardly bear the test of time , and journey safely down to posterity . When we reflect upon the character and construction of his works , and apply to them certain searching tests , they dwindle quickly into very moderate dimensions . We find , that the enormous helmet encloses only a small nut , that the nut is an amplified exponent of the kernel , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As space has no limits , and as large portions of it are still unoccupied by tangible bodies , it seems not very philosophical to quarrel with any person who endeavours to fill up its wide chasms yet , in the case of Mr. James , we grudge the portion of infinite space which his writings occupy . We dispute his right to pile up matter , which is the type or symbol of so small an amount of spirit . We sigh for the old vacuum , and think , that , though nature may have abhorred it in the days of Aristotle , her feelings must have changed since modern mediocrity has filled it with such weak apologies for substance and form . Piron , standing before the hundred volumes of Voltaire , remarked , " This luggage is too heavy to go down to posterity . " What would he have said , if be could have seen the hundred volumes published by Mr. James ? We think of the " Vicar of Wakefield , " which one can carry in his pocket ; of Charles Lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ion " ; and of many other small and precious gems , which time can not dim ; and when we contrast these with Mr. James 's voluminous mediocrity and diffusive commonplace , we obtain a new and vivid idea of the difference between quantity and quality . When a man has little or nothing to say , he should say it in the smallest space . He should not , at any rate , take up more room than suffices for a creative mind . He should not provoke hostility and petulance , by the effrontery of his demands upon time and patience . He should let us off with a few volumes , and gain our gratitude for his benevolence , if not our praise for his talents . But when we find him " multiplying himself among mankind , " and looking out upon us from such a vast variety of points , - demanding our assent to the common notion that he is a great producer of // thought and sentiment , - we are provoked into a desire to sift his pretensions to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of Mr. James , even to that unfortunate portion of them who consider him the legitimate successor of Scott , as to assert their ignorance of his faculty of reproduction . A dim reminiscence , similar to that on which Plato founds his doctrine of the soul 's pre*xistence , they must have had occasionally , while re-perusing an old novel in a new dress . A dull country gentleman was once seduced into an attempt to read the " Vicar of Wakefield . " He journeyed through that exquisite hook , seemingly at the rate of ten pages an evening ; but when he laid it down for the night , and carefully marked the place where he stopped , some impudent niece or nephew put the mark about eight pages b ack in the volume . Of course , many months elapsed befo re he arrived at the end . He was then asked how he was pleased with it ; " Oh ! he liked it very well , but he thought there was a little repetition in it ! " An objection somewhat similar to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with about as clear an insight into the real secret of the matter . To write a good novel , or a series of good novels , is not generally considered , even by those whose whole reading is confined to romance , to require any great effort of talent or genius . A man who repeats some axioms in physics , or wraps up a plain fact in a metaphysical shroud , is more likely to be considered as a great personage , than a writer of creative mind , who thrills the heart , or warms the imagination , with a prose epic . The products of the inventive powers rarely obtain so much of the popular reverence , as the deductions of the understanding . Works which have caused their authors vast labor and patient meditation which have stimulated every faculty of their nature to the utmost ; which may have required not only the highest imagination , but the deepest and most comprehensive thought ; and which are pervaded , it may be , by the results of a whole life of feeling , action , observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light reading . " It may be light reading , but nothing is more certain than that it is not commonly light writing . The novel of " Ivanhoe " may be placed by some in the department of light literature . But if those who coolly classify in this manner would but reflect upon // the vast and minute knowledge of English history it displays , the power of intellect evinced in the conduct of the story , and the greater power of imagination exercised in making the dead past a living present , - and , especially , if they would bring to mind the author , as he appeared while the scene between Rebecca and the Knight Templar was circling through his heart and fancy , as he strode hurriedly up and dQwn his study , with his face agitated by high passion , and his lips quivering with the intensity of his feelings , - they might perhaps think , that the matter was not so " light " after all , and that any word suggestive of indolence was the most inapplicable that could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the high genius which they sometimes manifest . The interest of the story is the test which is usually applied by the general reader . A young lady reads with great delight * *f he Scottish Chiefs , " " The Children of the Abbey , " or " Santo Sebastiano . " The sentiments are refined , the incidents please , and the whole work is " so interesting ! " She takes up the " Bride of Lammermoor , " a tragedy which Sophocles might have written , had he lived in this age , and acknowledges that , though it is interesting , it is an unpleasant book , for it ends badly . And thus she judges . To her , Miss Porter , Mrs. Roche , Mrs. Radcliffe , Miss Edgeworth , Scott , Buiwer , James , and Dickens are all delightful novelists , all interesting , and therefore , all equally good , except that Scott and Dickens are sometimes inclined to low humor , and are not always so refined as the others . At the same time , she acknowledges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to unfit the mind for practical duties ; and she throws out dubious hints of the histories and philosophies which form the staple pf her reading , and of the scientific lectures which she honors with her attendance . The absence in most minds of any clear principles of criticism , and the many bad and feeble novels which are mixed up confusedly with those which are excellent , are the probable causes of this hallucination . We are often struck with the lack of discrimination , even of sensible people , on this subject . Smollet and Fielding are placed in the same category with Ainsworth and Lever , and all are often confounded with Dickens . The peculiar taste and idiosyncrasy // of each writer , the diversity both in the subject and the manner of its treatment , the different faculties exercised by each , and the wide difference in the moral character unconsciously impressed on their works , - all these points are repeatedly overlooked . All these works please , and help to wile away an hour of ennui or leisure , and they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mere fact of writing a good work of fiction entitles an author to a high rank , even among those who are called imaginative writers . Pope , they think , will outlive the whole tribe . Novel-writing , then , is generally deemed to be as " easy as lying . " The facility with which things called novels are written seems to favor the dogma . Still , we humbly conceive it to be an error . Many persons have attained a marvellous proficiency in falsehood , and tell lies as assiduously as a friar does his beads ; but the nunber of great novelists is small . Lying , therefore , is no key to the mystery of romance . Let us seek the solution in a rarer quality - truth . " I can write prose as well as Mr. Pope , " said the sagacious Edmund CurIl , the bookseller ; " but he has a knack of rhyming which I do not possess . " Now the difference between Mr. Curll and Mr. Pope is no greater than that which exists between good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the latter can not obtain ; - and this is the knack of seeing and telling the truth . Here is an important distinction . The power of faithfully delineating life , character , society , and manners , is one of the rarest gifts of genius . In its greatest manifestations , it is felt to be the noblest exercise of a creative mind . Now Mr. James , in some of the most important qualifications of a novelist , is remarkably deficient . He has little objectivity . He is chained to his own consciousness . His insight into character and life is feeble . He can not go out of his own little world of thought and emotion , and sympathize with other grades and modes of being . Every thing he writes is " sicklied o'er " with his own feelings . There is no spontaneous exercise of his faculties , - none of that yielding of the will and reason to the impulses of imagination and passion , - none of that running over of the heart in the worship of the mind 's creations , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other beings , - which we observe in the masters of his art . His plots , his characters , his emotions , his outbreaks of feeling , are all deliberated and forced . He places a moral reflection , or a feeble speculation , at due pauses in the march of his story , with a sort of mathematical precision . The reader who desires not to have his principles corrupted by unconscious sympathy with any act or utterances of the characters in the novel , which may not square with the moral code , is soon relieved from any apprehension of the kind , by noticing that Mr. James follows the progress of the plot , catechism in hand , and reads a homily from it whenever the necessities of morality require . If he had written the tragedy of " Othello , " and had put into Jago 's mouth the words which Shakspeare uses , he would have filled half of the page with notes , stating his reasons for such an outrage upon morality , carefully distinguishing between his own opinions and those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malice and revenge . Mothers , therefore , think they can trust their children to the care of Mr. James , and are willing that they should journey through the land of romance under his guidance . As soon as one of his novels is issued , the newspapers devote a column to his " beautiful " moral reflections and rose-colored sentiments . Readers who have a right to demand , that the journal should he filled with news and advertisements , find themselves cheated and bored , by being compelled to admire the old speculations of Mr. James on destiny , fatalism , the affections , the will , and such other topics as form the staple of his colloquies with the reader . Now this is " from the purpose " of novel-writing . To a person accustomed to the manner of greater and more artistical novelists , it is an unendurable infliction . If the thoughts were valuable in themselves , bore any marks of originality and freshness , seemed to be called forth naturally by the incidents related , or were woven with any skill into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the understanding of Mr. James never succeeds in the attempt to clutch an original idea , or to speculate on any subject which requires dialectical power ; and , consequently , he doses the reader with truisms , or perplexes him with reveries . He gives dim hints of his opinions on any question of metaphysics which crosses the path of his narrative , // but he does not grasp and attempt to answer it . The most striking instances of " catching at ideas by the tail , " of which we have any knowledge , are seen in his reveries on destiny , which re-appear in each successive work that comes from his fertile pen and unfruitful intellect . It seems astonishing , that a man could have this subject so often in his mind , for a period of twenty years , and not blunder upon some opinion about it , correct or erroneous . He does not appear to know , that his unformed notions on this point , so far as they can be reduced to formulas , lead directly to fatalism . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of skill in the creation or accurate delineation of individual character . If the novel be intended as a mirror of actual life , either past or present , it should contain not only events , but men and women . Character should be exhibited , not didactically , but dramatically . We demand human beings , - not embodied antitheses , or personified qualities , thoughts , or passions . The author has no right to project himself into his characters , and give different proper names to one personality . We want a forcible conception and consistent development of individual minds , with traits and peculiarities which constitute their distinction from other minds . They should be drawn with sufficient distinctness to enable the reader to give them a place in his memory , and to detect all departures , either in language or action , from the original types . We desire beings , not ideas ; something concrete , not abstract . To fulfil this condition seems easy ; but the scarcity of men and women in current romances and plays proves it once , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is sometimes called " characterization " is very rarely found , even in the works of men of genius , or rather men with genius . Byron 's power in ' this respect only extended to one character , and that was his own , placed in different circumstances and modified by varying impulses . When he aimed at a larger range , and attempted to give freshness and life to individual creations , the result was feebleness and failure , which the energy and splendor of his diction could not wholly conceal . Manfred , Childe Harold , and Don Juan are the different names of one mind . Shakspeare 5 Timon comprehends them all , and is also more naturally // drawn . Innumerable instances might be given , of strenuous attempts made in this difficult department , which have ended in ignominious failure . Dr. Young 's Zanga and Shiel 's Pescara are ideas and passions embodied . Jago is a man , possessing ideas and passions . In truth , to be successful in the exact delineation of character requires a rare combination of powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the attribute of universality , not of versatility , or subtilty . It can be obtained only by outward , as well as inward , observation . That habit of intense brooding over individual consciousness , of making the individual mind the centre and circumference of everything , which is common to many eminent poets of the present age , has turned most of them into egotists , and limited the reach of their minds . They are great in a narrow sphere . They have little of that clear catholicism of spirit , which is even " tolerant to opposite bigotries " ; which seeks to display men as they are , not as they may be , or ought to be ; which is not fanatical for one idea , and seeks not to be considered as the one inhabitant of the whole earth . Most of our great poets of the present century have taken the world into their hands , and made it over again , agreeably to a type of excellence in their own imaginations . The current subjective metaphysics of the day pursues the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us everywhere . The splendid mental qualities often exercised in both redeem them from the censure we apply to meaner and smaller attempts in the same one-sided , subjective method . Not in this manner did Shakspeare work . It was not from a lack of imagination , that he did not turn every thing he touched into " something rich and strange . " His excursions into the land of dream and fancy throw all others into the shade . But he knew when and where outward men and events should modify inward aspirations and feelings . He would not do injustice even to crime or folly , but represented both as they are . In what may be called the creation of character , in distinction from its delineation , as in Hamlet , Macbeth , and Lear , his excellence is unapproachable . In no other department in which the human intellect can be exercised , does it so nearly approach the divine , as in this . It is creation in the highest human sense // of the term . It takes the elements of humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new individual , essentially different from other beings , yet containing nothing which clashes with the principles of human nature . Who believes , that a character exactly like Macbeth or Miranda ever existed ; yet who ever thought they were unnatural ? In fact , these ideal beings are as true existences to the soul , as any friends or enemies whom we see bodily . They are more real than most of the names of persons which we read in history . We quote their sayings , and refer to their actions , as if they were living beings . They are objects to us of love or hate . We take sides for or against them , in all their principles and actions . We forget the author in his creations . The delineation of character , in which observation , reflection , and imagination are variously exercised , is also a high merit in a poet or novelist . English literature contains many authors who have evinced great skill in the use of this power , and it is indispensable to the novelist of real life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western , Rob Roy , Baillie Nicol Jarvie , and Tony Weller are names taken at random , but they are all living beings . They are our friends from the moment we make their acquaintance . Has Mr. James added one to this company ? Has he delineated a single character which is wedded to our memories ? Yet few authors have written more novels ; and his volumes are filled with more names of persons than would suffice for a chronological table to a universal history . He has certain types of character , which he generally reproduces in each successive novel . And here we would do Mr. James complete justice . He has an exact sense of moral distinctions , and his personages , though not strictly individuals , are walking essays on character , replete with instruction , and displaying some analytical skill . His hero is generally brave , loving , noble in mind and heart , combining reflection with action , and is a fit model for imitation , if we except the number of men he slays in the course of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly chivalrous way , and is justified in it by the usages of the times in which the person is supposed to live , we hardly think that even the peace societies would take much exception to the // practice . The moral tone of thought and action is generally high and true . The heroine is always idealized into something which is neither spirit , nor flesh and blood . We perceive that the author has an exalted feeling of the beauty of woman 's character , and has a desire to represent it in concrete , so that it will strike forcibly upon the heart , and be garnered in the memory ; but he fails in his purpose . His women , like his men , are ideas and feelings emhodied . They are constructed , not created , or painted ; built , not drawn . They do not stand boldly from the canvass . They are , to our minds , reflections on female character , like those we read in the " Rambler . " We are told by the author , that they act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not find it out for ourselves . His heroine is so beatified with description , that she loses all hold upon sympathy . Die Vernon and Jeanie Deans whisper in our hearts , that she does not strictly belong to the sex . She is a beautiful icicle , flushed with the sun 's tints , and having the appearance , but not the reality , of warmth . She is a frail , delicate , lovely , unreal creature , whom we praise and admire , as we do all that is good and beautiful . We hope that she will get safely through all her troubles - that her health will not he injured by mental distress or outward accident - and that she will in the end be happily married . She is " A Young Lady 's Guide , ' ' walking from the covers. ** Now all this , we repeat , is " from the purpose " of novelwriting . If we compare one of Mr. James 's heroines either with a fine creation , like Desdemona , or a natural delineation , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelley 's Cythna , we perceive , that he fails in each and every department of the creation and portraiture of character . She is neither the reality , nor the possibility , of woman . Connected with these names of good persons , there is generally a scoundrel . The mechanical nature of Mr. James 's mind is shown more in the construction of his wicked personages , than in anything else . His rascal is an unmitigated rascal . He takes the idea of a man with a sharp intellect and great capacity , whose whole nature is under the dominion of selfish passion , - gives the idea a name , and intermingles it with the machinery of his plot . This criminal appears regularly in every novel , and labors // assiduously to overthrow the hero and heroine . He is something like Gammon , in " Ten Thousand a Year . " He has the advantage over goodness , until nearly the end of the volume , and is then dismissed to proper punishment . This type of character is the most forcible of the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws it into the shade . Whenever Mr. James aims to draw humorous persons , to fill in the spaces of his narrative , he never succeeds , not even in making them say witty or humorous things . We might extend these remarks to other personages in our author 's novels ; but it is needless . If we are correct in the view we have taken , it is proved , that Mr. James , in several high qualities of romance , is deficient . Yet he is compared , by many of his admirers , with Scott . Their reasoning to support so singular a conjunction must be drawn from the stores of honest Fluellen . Mr. James chooses historical events as the basis or auxiliary of his plot , and pours forth novels as other men do essays ; Sir Walter Scott did the same ; therefore , . they hear a surprising resemblance to each other as novelists . This is the old argument ; " There is a mountain in Wales , and there is a mountain in Macedon . " In truth , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their art , than Scott and James . Scott 's marvellous range of character , the fertility with which he created or painted individual beings , his genial sympathy with his race , his remarkable objectivity of mind , his open sense to all outward objects , would alone constitute a great gulf between him and James . He did not repeat himself in his novels . He wrote fast , because his mind produced quickly . In the poorest of his novels , he always gives us some characters whom we ever rememher with pleasure . Mr. James 's knowledge of history , great as it is , and much as he dr'aws upon it , is used without any of the peculiar power of imagination with which S*cott gave life and hue to what were before mere names , and made his readers contemporaries with the past . A king , , a man-at-arms , or a tournament , delineated by the author of " Waverley , " is presented to our minds as vividly as real personages or events , which have passed before our own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gives to his scenes the vividness of history , not that of reality , or romance . // A writer who chooses great subjects and personages for his themes often obtains that rank in general estimation , which should be held only by those who treat them with eminent ability . Mr. James is considered by many to be a greater man than Mr. Dickens , because he delineates kings and nobles ; describes battles ; shows a minute acquaintance with history ; makes all his characters mathematically moral or immoral ; strains ever to obtain a certain stilted elevation of thought and sentiment ; is careful never to wound the most fastidious delicacy with any words which may convey or suggest unpleasant and vulgar images ; and speculates dubiously on government , nature , the arts , religion , and destiny . We are quite sick of hearing him praised for his attempts , instead of being judged by his execution . One of Mr. Dickens 's coachmen is more worthy of admiration than one of Mr. James 's kings . A cardinal , or a pope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to delineate the former , " from the heart outwards , and not from the flesh inwards , " may be a greater triumph of art than to succeed in portraying the latter ; but still Parson Adams " bears the gree " from all the clerical dignitaries of romance . The nature of the man should not be confounded with his name or his garb . To call a personage a bishop , and to represent him in the dress of his order , is not to delineate a bishop . Beneath all externals , there are a human heart and brain , and an individuality distinguishing him from every other bishop . To exhibit him dramatically , either in play or novel , it is indispensable that these characteristics should be preserved . It may be asked , why it is , if Mr. James is thus deficient in the higher qualities of the novelist , that his works are so popular . Are they not read and admired by thousands ? They are read , admired , and forgotten . They are not read a second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another flows into it , which , in its turn , gives place to a third . No characters or incidents adhere to the mind , and become to it a possession for ever . After we have studied them all , we find that they have only given us general ideas , or furnished us with historical knowledge . We love and remember none of his personages for themselves alone . They are all insensibly resolved into their original abstractions . We recollect one 2f his few types of character , as we remember a proposition in Combe 's " Constitution of Man . " // But it may still be asked , Whence comes it , that his novels are read at all ? We might here avail ourselves of a New England privilege , and answer this question with another equally pertinent . Why are the productions of fanaticism , quackery , bad taste , and sentimentality read ? Why do melodramas draw larger audiences than " Macbeth " ? But we have no wish to evade difficulties , by insisting strongly on the rights derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledging , that , though the test of merit is not success , yet there must be some reason in the construction of a popular book , to account for its popularity ; and in Mr. James 's case , this public favor is owing to the intricacy and interest of his plots . The incidents in his novels are brought together with much cunning and skill . Every person who begins one of his books desires to get through it as quickly as possible . To many this may appear the highest praise , and to settle the question at once . To us , it does not so appear . Although the power of creating incident , and of skilfully linking one event to another , is an important element of a good novel , yet it is not the most important , nor is it one in which Mr. James enjoys preeminence . When we discover the secret of his method of story-building , our admiration decreases greatly . We acknowledge , that his novels are interesting , that they awaken and fix attention ; but we discriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of " Tom Jones " or " Ivanhoe . " We perceive that his plots are pieces of machinery , constructed according to the laws of mathematics . Their intricacy , and not their naturalness , is the source of their hold upon our minds . The characters seem not to have free play . They are puppets , moved by the scheming brain of the author . We know that the hero and heroine will enjoy no felicity , or peace until the conclusion of the third volume , and we hasten to the consummation as fast as our eyes can carry us . The world to which we are introduced is not a free , common world , where there are chances in favor both of vice and virtue ; but a fenced park , full of man-traps and spring guns . A sort of iron necessity conducts every thing . We do not feel ourselves safe , until we have come to the conclusion . A sort of feverish , unhealthy excitement is the feeling we experience as we read . There is always some murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past or the future , which we have a natural desire to expose and punish . The good characters are entangled in such a web of evil ; there is such a provoking succession of premeditated accidents which seem untoward they are walking so long on the verge of a deep gulf , into which the slightest false step may precipitate them ; that our feelings of philanthropy are enlisted in their behalf , and the common axioms which forhid cruelty to animals impel us to wish them speedy death or happiness . Mr. James is also a spendthrift of human life . When he has done with a character , or thinks it necessary to enhance the interest of his story by something awful , he strikes his pen into one of his dramatis personce , without the slightest mercy , and literally blots him from existence . He knows well , that murder and violence are popular in romance , and he is desirous , like a sagacious book merchant , to make the supply equal to the demand . Whether he has any compunctious visitings of conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are unable to determine ; but we think the carelessness with which he slays evinces the feebleness with which he conceives . If his personages were real to his own heart or imagination , if they were any thing more than clothed ideas and passions , we doubt if he would part with them so easily , or kill them with such nonclialance . His hero , of course , is preserved amidst the general slaughter , but not without many wounds both of the body and spirit . We have heard the style of Mr. James praised , but on what principle of taste we could never discover . To us it seems but ill adapted to narrative , it has li*le flow and perspicuity , and no variety . It is usually heavy , lumbering , and monotonous . His sentences seem constructed painfully , yet doggedly , and not to spring spontaneously from his brain , inspired by the thought or feeling they are intended to convey . The impression they leave upon the mind is a little unpleasant . Half of the words seem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have strength enough to clear the passage . Occasionally , a short , sharp sentence comes , like a flash of lightning , from the cloud of his verbiage , and relieves the twilight of his diction ; but generally , the reader must plod laboriously through one of his volumes , and , if he can overlook the style in the incidents , it is all the // better for his patience . James has none of that wonderful power of clear narration , which we observe in Scott ; that ductile style , which changes with each change in the story , and seems insensibly to mould itself into the shape of the thought and emotion which are uppermost at the time . Nor has he any of that quiet , demure humor , which Scott often infuses into the very heart of his diction , as in the first hundred pages of " Redgauntlet . " There is a strait-laced gravity in Mr. James 's manner , which is often ridiculous , because wholly inappropriate . In all those higher qualities of style , which do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences , but spring directly from passion , fancy , or imagination , and bear the impress of the writer 's nature , he is very deficient . There are but few felicitous phrases in his manifold volumes . He has hardly any of those happy combinations of words , which stick fast to the memory , and do more than pages to express the author 's meaning . With all his command of a certain kind of elegant language , he has little command of expression . His imagination , as a shaping power , has either no existence , or he writes too rapidly to allow it time to perform its office . His imagery is common ; and his manner of arraying a trite figure in a rich suit of verbiage only makes its essential commonness and poverty more evident . His style is not dotted over with any of those shining points , either of imagery or epigram , which illumine works of less popularity and pretension . To us his temperament seems sluggish , and is only kindled into energy by the most fiery stimulants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal , and he does not always succeed in attaining even that humble height of expression . As his object , however , seems to be to fill out three volumes with a narration of incidents which will please , rather than to cultivate any of those qualities of condensation and picturesquene*s which would compress them into one , we may not be justified in interfering between him and his bookseller . In these remarks , we do not intend to say , that our novelist has no passages which clash with this opinion of his style . It would be a monstrous supposition , that a human being could possibly write a hundred volumes , without being betrayed at times into eloquence and beauty of expression . We refer , in our strictures , to general traits , not to individ // nal exceptions ; to the desert , and not to the oases in it . Mr. James evidently possesses talents sufficiently great to enable him to write well , if he would only learn to " labor and to wait " ; but he is cursed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of his pages than to the quality of his rhetoric . In these remarks on Mr. James , as a novelist , we have intended to do him no injustice . We are willing to grant him the praise of talents and learning , and to do fit honor to the moral purpose he seems to have in his writings . But we dispute his claim to those qualities which constitute the chief excellences of a novelist ; we doubt his possession of that fecundity of mind , which can produce a series of novels , without constant repetition of old types of character and old machinery of plot . If the severity of our criticism has ever run into fanciful exaggeration , it has been owing to the petulant humor engendered by exposing unfounded pretension . Indeed , Mr. James does not appear like a man who could be wounded or hurt by severe criticism . The abstract character of the personages of his novels affects our own view of himself . We oppose him as we would oppose an idea or a principle . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape the idea suggested by his name into a palpable person . Whenever an author appears to our mind in a concrete form , the quality of mercy we extend to his compositions is never " strained " . We feel for his pardonable vanity , and we would launch at him no sarcasm calculated to lacerate his delicate sensibilities . He is a human beinb , a brother , or , at least , a cousin . If he be a dunce , we pat him on the shoulder , and tell him to try again . If he be a man of talents , with some absurd or pernicious principles , we regret that the latter should weaken the respect we hear to the former . But not so is it with Mr. James . We no more think of hurting his feelings by sharp criticism , than of wounding the sensibility of Babbage 's calculating machine by detecting it in a mathematical error .
