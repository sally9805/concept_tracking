txt THE various treatises on the position and duties of the ministry , which within the last few years have gone abroad , have contributed much to form the advanced character of the modern American pulpit . There is yet one view of the sacred office , which , though not difficult of apprehension , we have no where seen the subject of particular remark . It is the mental and moral influence of its duties returning on the minister himself . This therefore we propose for present consideration . The intellectual and moral perfection of man is the highest end of his being . Minor pursuits are alone possessed of value and dignity as they subserve this final attainment . There is no tyranny of circumstances , or depraved character , like that which checks the upward tendencies of the soul . Likeness to God is our chief end and happiness . Nothing is a permanent injury which does not hinder mental or moral growth ; and no gift is a real good but as it advances our spiritual well being . In choosing a profession for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and importance , how far the particular duties to which it conducts us , favor in a greater or less degree that intellectual and moral culture , which are the power and beauty , the glory and greatness , of the human mind . These observations show what constitutes the highest development of mind . Culture of the soul exists in every degree . Intellectual maturity and perfection imply , not extravagant expansion of one power , but the united growth and harmonious exercise of all . By a complete development of mind , we mean then , not extraordinary cultivation of a single faculty , or the excess of any emotion , but the full-orbed soul , of constant , growing light and influence , in which are ripening together all the faculties , and unfolding all the virtues of man . The answer to our inquiry will now depend on the estimate formed of the active and contemplative duties of the ministry , as every character is chiefly determined by the nature of its studies and its associations . Before pronouncing how far any profession cherishes the nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subjects it offers to our thought ; the exercise it affords to the reasoning and imaginative faculties ; the field which it opens for the action of gentle and heroic moral qualities , and the stimulus it supplies to exertion . Under the force of such conditions all human greatness is born . The first point of argument then for the superiority of the ministry to other professions as most favorable to enlargement of the mind , is found in the grandeur of those subjects with which religion , attentively studied , brings the soul in contact . Truth is the life of mind . It is that on which it feeds and grows . There is no plainer law of the mental constitution than that we become gradually assimilated to the objects of constant thought . That the soul may become great , it must have great objects of contemplation . A man can hardly be a of low mind , if that mind is continually open on vast objects , and filled with enduring interest . For illustration , take the science of astronomy . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it lifts the eye , to heaven . The first reason is the immensity of the objects filling the astronomer 's vision . The mere contemplation of the heavens is effnobling . It awakens the soul to a new world of // thought , and fills it with the grandeur of the universe . So in the world of active life . The same truth recurs in the history of all great men and revolutions . Truths which overwhelm the soul with a sense of infinity , which take hold of everlasting interests , have an omnipotent energy abiding in them . Like God in his absolute reign , they admit no fellowship , no equality . In their presence man loses the thought of common cares . Trifling interests are forgotten while the mind gives itself up to awe in contemplation of infinite and solemn truths . A single great thought , continually revolved , understood , and felt , is often enough to change entirely the character of a mind , and the course of a life . One clear insight into the true end of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one deep conviction of the immutable rights of man , has revolutionized men and kingdoms . Besides , there is a connection between great thoughts , by which one introduces another . The eye is hardly fixed on a single star before the sky is filled with the rushing glories of a universe of worlds . Such is the law in all human investigations and pursuits . The idea of a profession is exclusive . It is the conception of a class of men , and a class of ideas . To each belong certain engrossing topics , ideas of its own , upon which the mind is oftener and more intently occupied than on all others . So that , unless its peculiar trains of thought are themselves of liberalizing tendency , there is danger that confinement to a profession will contract rather than enlarge the mind . In the character of those original and ever recurring ideas as trivial or grand , resides the primary element of feebleness or strength . What then are the ever-present ideas of the minister  --  the controlling themes of reflection and discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eternal and the Almighty . Let us contemplate it in itself , and in its influence . The idea of God is the highest conception of the human mind . We behold in it all that is grand in a power which extends around and above us without limits ; all that is sacred and venerable in wisdom and goodness , which no finite intellect can fathom , with whatever is alluring in kindness and touching in mercy . It is this idea , infinitely more grand than the most astonishing attainments of philosophy or conceptions of poetry , which , in the steady contemplation of sanctified intelligence , contributes more than all else to the endless advance . ment of minds in heaven . But such mental illumination and advancement come only from dwelling on the object by devout meditation on the creation where lines of celestial glory are revealed , or in the intense solemnity of prayer . The promised land lies beyond Pisgah , and he who would see it must climb to the point of vision . Go forth , then , and learn God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , till the mind comes back , overwhelmed with the greatness of that Being whom we worship , bowed in reverence , and trembling with awe at thought of infinite wisdom and almighty power . Such objects no man can steadily contemplate without having his mind lifted up to something of that greatness which he adores . The idea of God is indeed an universal one . It is peculiarly a truth for the human race , giving authority to law , and furnishing to man a source of boundless consolation . Still it is a truth like all others , to be appropriated by the free action of the mind . And who so likely to receive its benefit as he who is ever revolving it in the recesses of his thoughts ? The priest of the Lord dwells in the pavilion of the Almighty . He ministers at the altar , and // lights its sacred fires . He treads the inner courts of the temple , and hears daily the solemn voices of the sanctuary . It is but natural that on him , more than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever of grandeur belongs to God , attaches itself to the administration of His government . The course of Providence , moving aloft , as on eagles ' wings , " through the storms of the world , marks divinity to men . How superior to ordinary views of human life is the faith which beholds all events obedient to the control of a Providence , wise and just , and directed to the accomplishment of a benevolent end . It is easy to see how such wide prospects affect elevation of character . Religion , operating through its higher truths , is inseparable from the advancement of the human intellect . The greatest character can develope only under an impression of the eternal realities of the universe . Man attains no resemblance to God while living in a world of shadows . This land of dreams , which flits before us , but decoys and wastes the mind . Only looking through it and above it , inhabiting a world of higher conceptions , and conversant with the nobler truths and interests of religion , the mind towers up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this suggests another point , the impression of the Christian idea of God on the temper of mind . A calm , philosophic temperament is often as needful to success as grandeur of thought and force of intellect . Religion aids this . It makes the timid brave , and the weak strong . Belief in God , more than all things else , lifts us above the depression of calamity , and gives that settled and tranquil mind , which is best suited to intellectual effort and success . There is another distinction of these truths , answering more completely to the law of our mental progress . The presentation of one class of views , without any variety , belittles , or at best but feebly impresses the mind . It is the glory of Christianity that its ideas are not so bounded as to imprison the intellect , like the narrow creeds of paganism . It opens the mind on a vast field of truth , and at the same time , its principal ideas-God , Christ and heaven , are capable of indefinite enlargement , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So with Christian views of human life . Man , as the child of eternity , the heir of endless life , or endless woe , is invested with a dignity and importance unknown before . Life becomes solemn and earnest . The prophet of the Lord walks among men , but his thoughts are on eternal things . While the crowd around him are consumed with momentary cares , he is dwelling on the destinies of the soul ages to come , when the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll , and earth and time be gone . He sits upon the mount of contemplation , amid the undimmed brightness of eternal day , and glory covers him . In the hours of lonely meditation , thought wanders afar above to the celestial world , " there in the land of faith adores , " or broods with untired wing over the blackness of darkness , and the ever burning lake . Oh ! what scenes here rush upon the mental eye . Such a mind can not degrade itself to the level of ordinary men . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and eternity , with overpowering thoughts and emotions crowding on him , he will not stoop to the low things of earth . His intellect , his aims , his character , naturally take the vaster proportions of the unseen world . Next , we observe the exercise given by religion , and the studies of a minister , to the reasoning faculties . A prominent difference between really great and common men in the same department of investigation or // active duties , is that the enlarged , comprehending minds have pursued their studies in the form of science . Not content with beholding the separate grandeur of particular truths , they have endeavored to connect those truths with each other ; to show their relations , their mutual harmony and support . They have labored by long and patient induction of particular phenomena to arrive at general laws . And thus by slow and wasting toil has been reared the pyramid of scientific truth , itself the enduring monument to their fame . Even astronomy failed to free itself from ministering to superstition and terror , till its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human intellect . Long had the philosopher turned his telescopes nightly to the heavens . But yet the highest order of mind was not seen . It was not enough to number the stars , and mark the time of their periodic revolutions . Only when Newton rose by long processes of investigation to trace a system among stars and suns ; to demonstrate in every movement of the heavenly bodies obedience to an universal law , and thus lay the foundation of one of the noblest of sciences ,  --  did the world pronounce the astronomer great . After induction comes deduction , the application of general laws to explain particular phenomena . These are both high efforts of the mind . In asserting that the ministry is well adapted to exercise our faculties of analysis , investigation , and of classifying truth , we claim for religion the character of a science . By a science is commonly meant a system of general laws ascertained respecting any material or spiritual existences . In this sense evidently religion is not only a science , but the noblest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat simply of the coarse elements and properties of matter , religion reveals a system of laws which govern the spiritual world ; which regulate the relations of mind with mind ; of man with his brother here , and with God above . The outward universe , studied and adored by infidel philosophers , is valuable only as the abode of intelligent existence , and the theatre of moral action . To overlook these great agents and interests in the study of material science is the gross , though constant blunder of atheistical philosophy . Where is the spirit of Plato gone , that God and his government are not now thought of , in that classification of the sciences , which is intended to embrace man 's widest knowledge of the universe of things ? Every gem in the sky is told , the bowels of the earth are explored , to render the circle of truth complete . Yet it is forgotten that there is in the bosom of man a brighter gem , and in his relations to God are bound up more momentous interests . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but the veil of the Almighty , to soften , while it reflects the glory which no man can see . Science is the record of his invisible movements , discovered only in their effects . The laws of nature are his immutable will ; and he studies them to no profit who is not led to Him . To make men realize the presence and agency of the unseen God is the office of science as well as of religion . Every thing is related to the Deity , and it is in tracing the Supreme Intelligence in all his works , in following them up to that power , and wisdom , and goodness in which they had their origin , lies the great labor and progress of created minds . Instead then of allowing the denial that religion has the certainty and universality of a science , we affirm that its claims to that character are such as should make unbaptized philosophy retire in shame . Divine truth is above all other truth , as God is enthroned // over all other beings . And when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let religion descend from the skies , to sit on the summit of human knowledge , its glorious and celestial crown . Is it asked , where in religion is the opportunity for scientific investigation ? We answer , not to ascertain the facts of religion , nor to establish laws of human duty , for these are the revelation of God . But to show the harmony of those laws with the wants and powers of the human soul ; to draw out distinctly the evidences of their divine origin ; and more than all , to follow that induction of all laws and all science , which leads to one Supreme , Eternal Mind . To the minister then as his peculiar study the whole moral universe is outspread . It is his province to examine and unfold whatever concerns the authority of God , or the eternal safety of man . The science of theology in its fullest extent , natural and revealed ; the vast field of moral philosophy and divine government ; the free and accountable nature of man ; the premonitions within of wrathful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great problems of human life , human nature , and human destiny , are before him . To religion , as the highest truth , all truth is tributary . This is the vantage ground of the minister . Material and mental science are completely subservient to his use , both for purposes of illustration and argument . Thus an acquaintance with astronomy has doubtless suggested many of the splendid conceptions of Chalmers . The same rule obtains in all departments of knowledge . Whatever illustrates the power , and wisdom , and goodness of God , contributes directly to the grand object of the preacher , to bow the human mind before an invisible object of worship . Whatever commends the law of God to the reason and conscience , powerfully aids in enforcing obligation . Pursuing these general subjects , counteracts the tendency to exclusiveness of idea which belongs to professional study , adding the philosopher to the Christian , by uniting piety with the widest liberality and enlargement of mind . With this widening of mental reach , comes the secret sympathy of devotional taste with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arising from this influence . The same moral causes which give strength , also impart beauty to the mind . Viewed in its highest relations , religion produces all the effect of the sublimest poetry . Faith gives more than poetic insight into the beauty and significance of all living things . To a mind filled with religious thought , creation is full of spiritual lessons . The heavens declare the glory of God , and the earth is full of his praise . To him comes home that truth , which is not merely an image , that the universe is a temple , inhabited by no outward forms , but by the real presence of the object of worship . Night , with her solemn train , moving round the earth from age to age , is its vaulted roof ; the winds and waves its hymns ; the opening day its morning orisons , and " the light of setting suns " its evening sacrifice . Under the former impulses , the mind bursts up into a new and higher region of thought . These shed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to the point of eliciting truth . Even to ascertain and harmonize the doctrines of religion with the Bible in our hands , requires no small share of intellectual acuteness and judgment . For this as careful an examination and comparison of passages is needed as the induction of material phenomena in the journal of a philosopher . In both cases facts diverse and seemingly contradictory have to be harmonized , and // things alike to be distinguished ; the place and circumstances of each must be weighed ; and a nice discernment to hold the scales of evidence , and cool impartiality of judgment are equally necessary . Whatever sagacity in reasoning distinguishes the advocate ; whatever love of truth , and patient search for it , immortalize the judge , are here in constant requisition . 1-lence the greatest reasoners of our country and the world , have been theologians . So in removing objections , and establishing the claims of religion to be received among the most certain6 matters of human belief , the minister will have occasion often to compare the teachings of Christianity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , and the rectitude of his eternal law , have to be defended before the reason of man . The grounds of all religion , and thus the highest moral questions are involved in the harmony of nature with the word of God . Thus the world of science , as opposing or upholding religion , is the field of his debate . It will not do to say that philosophy has no right to influence religious belief . Many of its conclusions are as certain as the evidences of Christianity . All objections to a divine religion , it is his high duty to meet . When the natural philosopher has arrived by induction at the laws of a particular science , it is his business by a higher induction to show the harmony of all well founded science with the truths of man 's moral nature and accountability , and complete the victory of faith over unbelief . Frequent exercise of the intellect on the grand truths and arguments of religion , thus imposed as a part of ministerial duty , never fails to produce an enlarged habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To a part of these evidences , Butler and Paley devoted numerous and toilsome years , and illustrated in their philosophic emi nence , and still more in the elevation and serenity of their lives , the influence of their pursuits . Where they led , the ministry are called to follow . If the Gospel is ever to triumph over the world , its truth must be placed on impregnable foundations . The work is not done . The evidences of Christianity are but beginning to be explored . We are invited to new worlds of discovery . On this field lie the treasures of universal learning and history . Nature gives testimony to her Creator . Arguments of infinite force and extent are found in the analogies of the external world . Connected as man is by invisible relations with the universe ; placed midway in the scale of being between the insect arid the Deity ; - every thing within him , in the world around , and the heaven above , every gradation of intelligence ascending from nature to spirit , and to God , bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of an immortal soul . Christianity is sometimes reproached as an arbitrary appointment , neither requiring nor admitting explanation-an impression , as unjust to religion as it is pernicious to man . There is no institution , human or divine , which is less arbitrary . It has its foundation in essential and ineradicable wants , in the undying nature of a human soul . Let the ministers of religion set themselves to this high argument . Let it be shown that Christianity is adapted as no other religion is , to every faculty and sentiment of our being ; to man in his intellectual , social , and religious character , as a spirit intelligent , accountable , and immortal ; that it alone sets before him life 's true end and dignity ; leading to that harmony of the soul with herself , of reason and conscience with appetite and passion , which is the sum of her aspirations ; of mankind with each other , and of all with God ; that it alone can bring // man into that tranquil and blessed condition for which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full growth of his powers , and a happiness which is perfect . Such is the exposition of the Gospel for which the world is sighing . Christianity can not assume her universal reign , till she comes forth arrayed in celestial beauty . This will be done when the gospel shall appear in its own native character , a scheme broader than philosophy , whose origin is higher than earth , recognizing man 's true nature , dealing with his highest interests , answering the supplications of want , and more than fulfilling the prophecies of hope . We indicate the liberalizing tendency of a profession , by designating its duties . The minister stands on the high places of the field . Overlooking the defenses of religion , he is ever strengthening its walls , and deepening its foundations . His mind is continually exercised to fortify and establish the power of Christianity on earth , by profounder investigations into the greatest subjects , to which the human intellect is ever directed . All the topics we have named and more ; the empire of law as governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament in a Redeemer 's blood ; the debasing and hardening tendencies of sin ; the purifying influence of Christian faith and hope ; the effect of Christianity upon civilization ; the results to flow from the spread of the gospel ; with a multitude of like subjects of a comprehensive character , all come properly within the range of ministerial study and discourse , requiring close and prolonged examination , and giving scope to the loftiest human powers . Thus we have spoken of religion as fitted to enlarge and strengthen the intellect of man universally , and above all , of the Christian teacher as its student and expounder , through the simple grandeur of its subjects alone , and the study of those general principles which give it the character of a science . Here we may pause and look around . We have before us already a power of expansion beyond all estimate , in the simple influence of habitual communion with truths , awful as the being and attributes of God , vast as eternity . He who wanders among realities and interests such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which at once excite and baffle human inquiry , and hanging over the abysses of the universe , is like the traveller among the mountains of Switzerland , where he is surrounded at every step , by the gigantic forms of nature , and feels his soul alteriiately bowed in the deepest dust of humility , and raised to heaven with emotions of awe and grandeur . The soul , rapt in contemplation day by day , whereinto God 's word and spirit enter and abide , is emancipated at length from the bonds of space and time . It has a source of elevation which no lesser influence can inspire . Genius may climb the mountain top , but if it leave not earthly things , its vision is hemmed by low and narrow bounds . But where imagination tires , devotion taught by God , soars aloft to dwell by the eternal throne , to learn the celestial hymn , and look out where around unnumbered suns rise and set , and beneath , stars and systems roll . Thoughts taking hold on eternity , affections embracing the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitant of the unfading world , and life bears witness to a growing conformity to the perfect existence of heaven . But on this point we have lingered too long . Phe delightful theme betrays us . The ministry has other duties than the investigation of truth . It is rather in the application than // in the settlement of principles a minister 's time must be passed , and we have now to contemplate him entering on this new field for the exertion of his powers . We have spoken of deduction as a high effort of mind . By this , or by reasoning generally , is meant application of established laws to particular facts under them , or the reduction by a logical process of complicated phenomena to simple principles intuitive to all , and at which discussion terminates . How important a part this kind of discourse plays in all public instruction is obvious . The statesman can occupy but a small part of his time in studying the abstract science of political economy . On his skill in applying a few general principles to intricate questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplicity of duties which this new department of ministerial labor has created , how wide is the range given to intellectual power . Here the practical character of this office comes into view , and its value is recognized as a mighty moral influence ever operating for the welfare of society . Rules of duty are to be applied to men in a thousand different circumstances . Into no relation , social or political , can man enter , into which the obligations of religion do not follow him . And never shall we witness the full effect of Christianity until its influence is felt restraining , governing men in every relation , and at all times . The position occupied by the minister as the guardian of public morality is wholly peculiar , and supremely important . His object is nothing less than to bring every human soul , and relation , and act , into strict conformity to the everlasting law ; and thus , as his influence flows on into futurity , to bring under the control of truth and secure to God the mind of generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life more comprehensive than any human government can prescribe . Actions which no earthly power deigns or dares to notice , are fit subjects for his approval or condemnation . The bearing of Christianity on society and government opens another field into which as God 's ambassador he has a right to enter , and where the divine law must reign . Religious principle must pervade every social organization , and regulate all duties between man and man . Is here no opportunity for strength of mind to show itself ? In this are no wide grasp of intellect , no power of argument , no eloquence of persuasion , demanded ? Does the legislator lay down laws to govern his fellow men ? The Christian minister lays down a law which is to govern him in his legislation ; a law supported not indeed by the penal enactments of men , but by the more terrible sanctions of infinite wrath and almighty power . Among the ambassadors of earthly courts he appears a messenger of the King of kings . It is thought high praise of one 's abilities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here it is given to a feeble mortal to expound a law to kings ; to unfold and apply the principles which guide , not the administration of one state or nation , but which govern the whole universe of God , unchanged from the beginning ; and which are to last and extend their mighty sway over infinite worlds , and through interminable ages . It seems proper in this connection to remark on the dignity of the ministerial office as devoted to religious instruction . Intellectual culture is owned in the instinctive homage of society as adding elevation to individual character . The gift which it is so honorable to possess , it must be still more so to impart . Accordingly , however unworthy and trifling the estimate of fashionable opinion , the office of a teacher has held a high place in the regards of // the wisest of mankind , and the faith . ful instructor is justly honored by them as a benefactor to the human race . Thought , quickening of the mind to activity , lie energy of self-command , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moral cultivation has superior excellence . By so much the office of a religious teacher excels all others . Communicating higher views of man 's nature and destinies , leading to a juster estimate and more correct principles of this life , and fixing the uplifted eye of faith on another and better to come , the blessings he imparts , the sacred memorials he leaves behind him , are in the changed character and happiness of the soul , in purified desires , enlarged affections and elevated hopes . If such be the demands in preaching the Gospel on the reasoning powers , no less wide is the field which it opens to the imagination , and no less powerful is the appeal to every feeling of the human breast . To the orator these are essential . The preacher may reason well and yet his hearers be unaffected . His arguments are conclusive , yet sin is not alarmed . Lines of truth fall clear and soft as moonbeams on the painted windows of the cathedral and the marble of the altar , yet as cold . Imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when addressed in large bodies , are controlled more by images than abstract ideas . " The vision and faculty divine " irradiates all human thought , and gives it life , brilliancy , and power . To the preacher quick conception and imaginative powers are especially necessary , to diversify the instructions of the pulpit , to infuse new life into those solemn services which sometimes weary in the act of repetition ; to suit the music of religion to each changeful mood and temper of the human heart , and make its old truths like the timeworn sublimities of nature , ever fresh and new . Vivid description and deep emotion-feelings awakened in the orator 's own bosom , and communicated to those around him , with striking delineation of past and future scenes ,  --  these are the influences which seize on men 's hearts and carry them away . Bursts of eloquence , such as charm and sway the world , are not the product of a cold and reasoning intellect . They come in moments of self-forgetfulness and devotion , when the heart is possessed hy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , with a power which admits neither resistance nor control . For these there must be a theme , an audience , and an occasion to kindle the speaker 's imagination , and arouse his feelings to the utmost effort . All these impulses surround and animate the faithful minister . He is an orator . Labors of thought and agonies of prayer are his preparation . Placed in the midst of a hurrying , worldly age , he addresses men as estranged from their Maker , at war with God , while hastening to his bar . Before him lies the image of a world in ruins . On a dark and swift.rolling billow man flies to eternity . Generation after generation hurries onward and away without God and without hope . Here , then , the preacher stands to call men back from their wild pursuit of pleasure and wealth to seek first the kingdom of God . He comes to man polluted by sin , and points him to heaven . To reason of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come ; to turn men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sa. tan unto God ; to unite and purify the church ; to quicken piety , and encourage effort ; - are the objects which animate the toil , and give urgency to the appeals of the minister of Christ . If zeal and constancy correspond at all with the greatness of the work to be done , then must he who stands // on the watchtower of religion , as of freedom , be ever awake . At home , and abroad , in his chosen flock , and upon the church universal , must his influence be felt in the encouragement which he gives to Christian enterprise in every form . Look , what gigantic schemes the ministry are appointed to carry on . While the heralds of salvation are plunging into the depths of our western forests , and bearing the word of life to every shore , on pastors at home rests the business of sustaining them , of increasing their numbers and strength until the banner of the cross waves on every hill , and the whole earth be filled with the knowledge of God . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble sentiment of man , exalts together all the elements of his being . The force of that single motive , the conversion of the world , has produced more grandeur of character than all worldly ambition beside-a motive that made Paul and Luther the fathers of ages in which their influence should control the destinies of mankind ; that awoke the unconquerable minds of Loyoln and Xavier to such prodigies of human exertion ; and that still sends forth thousands to perish in distant climes for the universal regeneration of man . And not merely the objects sought , but the records of inspiration themselves from which the mind learns its lessons of benevolence , call into exercise imagination and feeling . All the scenes of history and prophecy , the primitive innocence and sad apostasy of man ; sin with its train of woes ; the life , sufferings , and death of the Son of God ; with the retributions of eternity ,  --  are at the preacher 's command . Scope is given him for every variety of sub . ject and illustration , from the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thunders of the judgment day . Such is the inspiring character of the Gospel . Join with this a power of language adequate to the expression of Christian themes , and the pulpit will witness effects transcending all other human impressions . " When Massillon entered the pulpit , " we are told , " not the pious and the sober merely , but the votaries of pleasure and business thronged the church . The theater was forsaken , the court forgot their amusements , and the monarch descended from his throne to hear the illustrious preacher . While he spoke , the king trembled ; while he denounced the indignation of God against a corrupted court , nobility shrunk into nothing ; while he described the terrors of a judgment to come , infidelity turned pale ; and the congregation , unable to resist the power of his language , rose from their seats in agony. ** In the production of such wonderful effects there was no great secret . The power of that humble priest lay in the simple fervor , the natural earnestness and eloquence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye , and the tone of his voice , wrought with electric power , because through every outward art and grace shone a celestial fire , a soul baptized with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven . Such examples show us the power of religious truth presented with that divine ardor and love which is its natural accompaniment , and raise our ideas of that office whose duty it is to publish it to the world as the first of earthly dignities . To the previous arguments for the superiority of the ministry , may be added , its influence , though 51-lent , is more wide-spread and lasting than any other . It is sometimes objected that the labors of the minister are not followed by that marked effect which attends efforts in the senate and at the bar . If immediate impression alone be re // garded , this is perhaps true . Yet it is a fact easy of explanation , and argues in the clergy no mental inferiority . The objects of both must be considered to render the estimate correct . There are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appeals to passion on the one hand , or on the other to reason , the nobler affections and conscience of man . The grandest of all human results is produced by addressing the higher faculties and the moral sentiments . A demagogue may infuriate the mob without one grain of sense in him or them . It needs no great power to produce effects which last for a moment by appealing to hatred or fear . These are passions quickly roused , and the reckless and unprincipled excite them most easily . Far other is the business of him of whom we speak . The minister of Jesus has no object to foster pride , and inflame passion and excite to violence , but , infinitely higher , to calm the agitated breast , and breathe into it purer feelings and a spirit of peace . The word spoken by him strikes not at sudden , temporary effects , but has an aim to control the whole current of life and of society . And its results are to be measured by the fruit of years . Such influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toils in secret . There he labors intensely for enduring results . Like the stately elm , which grows up by the silent process of nature through the lapse of a century , the great mind attains its extraordinary growth , not in the hot-bed of passion , but under the clear light of heaven , by the sun and air and dew of holy thought , and pure motive , and benevolent action . We confess to us there is no greatness like this  --  the greatness of Luther , and Fenelon , and Robert Hall ; a sympathy with all things great and good , sanctifying genius , and pervading its highest manifestations ; and even the picture of Erskine or Webster in the finest passages of their oratory sinks beside the inspired eloquence of the blind preacher and Massillon , or Whitefield at Moorfields , or John Wesley preaching on his father 's grave . What now is the witness of the Christian ages to the power and value of the ministry ? To what grand result have their labors for centuries tended ? The answer is written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ranked in its effects on mankind with the great influences of literature and legislation , often animating and controlling both . Instances of exalted attainments and successful exertion every where abound in the church . From the days of the golden-mouthed Chrysostom to Saurin and Bourdaloue , these depositaries of learning and religion have spoken in commanding tones to the world . And to pass by the million-voiced appeals which no record has preserved , there still live in the body of English literature productions of the ministry , specimens of as lofty eloquence , of as pure thought and sentiment , as ever enriched the noblest of human tongues . These are the men who have led in every important moral movement . They have headed the advancing columns of liberty , of humanity and religion throughout the globe . Armed with the authority of God , they alone have been able to stand in ages of despotism against the tyranny of kings . See how the labors of the fearless reformers sent out a restoring influence among the nations , as it brought the truths and motives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So in all ages of the church the influence of a truly Christian ministry has been to preserve belief in God , to keep alive the sense of religion and accountability in the world , the best bonds of society , and the chief blessings of mankind . Ser // vants of God , they have proved the most devoted benefactors of men ; at once the supporters of divine authority , and the friends of human advancement . There is yet another point which requires mention to give completeness to this subject . It is the influence of pastoral duties on the mind and character of a minister . In considering the tendency of a profession to enlarge or contract the mind , the exercise given to the intellect is not the only item of account . l*Te wish to learn its bearing on the whole spiritual man . Intellect can not be divorced from the affections . Whatever affects the heart , affects also the understanding . That system of influences which is most favorable to a perfect intellectual and moral development of man , is one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studious habits and social propensities , adding to the force of abstract thought the influence of human and humanizing associations . The happy union of these influences , strikes us as a peculiar felicity of the ministry . The profession necessitates acquaintance with men . And the mingling of active pastoral duties with hours of intense meditation and study , we are persuaded , if entered on with a right spirit , will be found favorable to the formation of the purest and loveliest character . Mingling with all classes of society , frees the kind pastor from that narrow bigotry and pride , so prejudicial to purity , elevation and force of character . He sees all sides of human life and human nature . His associations , so far as they are select at all , are chiefly with the pure , the holy , the blessed of the world . Or , if he looks after others , it is like Howard , entering the prisons of the condemned , or the Savior sitting at meat with publicans ; an intercourse of mercy , from which the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye of pity fills with tears , the soul of devotion ascends to a yet loftier elevation . The world does not afford a sight combining more of dignity and of grace than such a Christian minister , mingling like his master , among all classes , sharing in their sympathies , and soothing their sorrows ; lifting up holy hands in the beautiful ordinance of baptism ; pointing the erring to the Lamb of God , and comforting the dying with Christ , the resurrection and the life ; the patron of good , himself the example of every virtue : " That tries each art , reproves each dull delay , Allures to brighter worlds , and leads the way . " Such is the minister of heaven , a character formed in solitary thought , bending over the book of God , by dying beds , and in awful prospect of the unseen world . These familiar influences work upon the mind day by day , till the seriousness and serenity of the future state become habitual . It is no objection to the highest order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for it there . Common judgments are more the product of capricious tastes than reflection . The most powerful agencies of nature operate unobserved . The stars move in their orbits without noise . Time utters no voice as with resistless hand he takes down the monuments of the past . Some , by confession of the world , among its greatest spirits , were not recognized as such by their own age . The evidence of their greatness has been discovered in the silent moulding of opinion , the guidance given to thought , long after they were dead . It may be that many of the greatest minds now acting on mankind will never be known until the light of eternity shall show where they lived and what they did . Fame is not greatness , nor applause immortal influence . Biography records the outward // life . The growth of the soul is often known only to God . With some opportunities for observing the interior life of different professions , our experience has led us to revere the ministry . Ordinary abilities indeed often attempt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so has every other . The pulpit can not hide poverty of intellect , or dignify want of education . Still it is true that minds as great as ever labored under the sun , have counted it their highest honor . Many leading intellects of the age , that would adorn any office to which man may aspire , are in it now . We have seen indeed , humiliating bigotry and narrowness in the ministry . But after all , the greatest men we ever knew , the most pure and generous spirits , and the profoundest intellects , have been members of that profession . If , to crown the evidence of a noble life , as the old philosopher required , one must go calmly to its close , and die as he has lived , let the records of ministerial fidelity speak for him . When the career of active toil is done , he sinks calmly , like the slow descending summer sun to his peaceful setting ; and as golden clouds of light linger in the path of that luminary , so after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and example , abide in the thoughts and affections of the living ; and in the gentle , reverent tones with which his name is mentioned , is the surest witness of his faithfulness , the best blessing on his memory . We have spoken of the living soul as growing into the image of God , in the power of intellect and virtue . Let the poor , the widow and the orphan write his epitaph . The practical intention of these remarks is to induce in ministers , and all who aspire to the honors and hardships of that commission , a loftier sense of the dignity of their calling . The sublimest of all human trusts is deposited in their hands , the unsearchable riches of truth and hope in Christ . Would that we could present the pattern of a perfect minister , standing in his desk , with a sense of the sublimity of his office and message , to address a congregation of immortal souls ! the feelings of that moment , " Holy , holy is the Lord of hosts ! Wo is me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready like the awe-struck Isaiah , to shrink away ; and then the delineation of truth , the glowing power of argument , the earnestness of entreaty , that alternately awe , and thrill , and melt the hearer-we would describe them all . We speak thus exaltedly of a pro . fession long beloved , to aid in bringing a nobler race of preachers on the stage , a race that shall fill the openings of the present , and hear up the honors of the past . God from above invites an age of new labors and achievements . The dying earth entreats it in wailing , melancholy voices . We would summon to this noblest of professions , and through it , to the highest of human interests , every various faculty and power of man , the fascination of every gift , and the splendor of every acquisition-joining with the profoundness of German erudition , and the comprehensiveness of Bacon , the impetuous oratory of Chatham , and the persuasive eloquence of Rousseau . We acknowledge the utility of other professions , and the elevating pursuits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been seen , that this is a profession which overtops all others in importance , laying hold of eternity , and concerning interests to remain when authors , and books , and the pageantry of time , shall perish . When the libraries of learning , and the palaces of pride shall sink down in the destroying element ; and the accumulated wisdom of ages and earthly fame , shall have ceased their empire , this influence , begun on earth and continued // into futurity , shall survive in the ransomed soul and the immortal song . We admire the hero . We revere the sage , who gives us thought , and aim and hope ; who seems to stand on an eminence above his fellow men , and stretch out his arms over the human race to bless them . How far above the king stands the benefactor of his race , who has quickened the soul to effort , enlarged the boundaries of knowledge , purified men 's desires , strengthened their good resolutions , cheered their feeble hopes , and sent an influence abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Christian minister is privileged to exert . On the faithful discharge of his duties , rests the hope of the human race . Let then the minister of Christ dedicate himself a living sacrifice to God , an offering to the spirit of humanity and Christian love ; and go forth to that work to which so much of genius has been consecrated , feeling that he is entering on duties which minister to the fullest growth , and call for the intensest action of all his powers ; that the field which opens before him is boundless , and the ends in view are all noble ; and that , as he has but one life to live , there is nothing better than to toil without ceasing for the honor of God in the promotion of every thing that is good ; for the welfare of man in his regeneration and advancement ; for the interests of that kingdom which shall never be destroyed.
