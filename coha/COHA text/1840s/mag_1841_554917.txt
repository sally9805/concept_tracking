txt Tnis work is a treatise upon certain branches of architecture suited to the wants of builders and mechanics , and especially of such as can not consult with an architect . It is full of hints to those unacquainted with the science of construction , and of excellent designs for those who have not known and cultivated it as an elegant art . The first part of the book is occupied with descriptions and drawings of the Etruscan and the Grecian orders , the measurements and proportions of which are taken from the most approved models ; the succeeding part gives directions and designs for rooms , windows , doors , fireplaces , cornices , porticoes , balconies , and all the other constituent parts of our domestic architecture ; and remarks on the subject of carpentry conclude the treatise . It is executed with exemplary suitableness to its object . The text is clear and simple in its style , and the illustrations are quite as neat and beautiful as those of any similar European work . It is , perhaps , a little too brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such experience as that of the author , might be made of great advan // tage to them , in pointing out the way to the accomplishments of their trade , and preparing them to acknowledge and he guided by the true standards of taste . As much appears to be done to this end in the present work , we can not hut wish for more , in the same fair style and excellent spirit . That a work so expensive as this , should have passed through three editions , is an excellent sign . It shows an eagerness for the study of construction , for which American mechanics hardly have credit , and which must be eventually evidenced in buildings throughout the country . It is a little surprising , that they have not more taste and knowledge of architecture . It would very much increase the profit and interest of their occupation . But the fault partly lies with those , who have the requisite knowledge and ability to instruct them . They are as eager for light upon this subject as upon any other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as Mr. Benjamin 's . We hope that he and other architects will look upon this reception of his hook as an indication of a want , and furnish the public with other works of more copious instruction . The field for good influence is very wide , the subject is new , and all portions of the community are in need of knowledge . In turning over the pages of this work , we were led into some reflections upon subjects of rather recent , hut certainly curious interest . XVe merely break ground upon them , aiming at no more than to open the surface . Speculations upon the character and developement of our times , in all their features and complexions , are now so common , that the subject seems fathomed . Its necessary phraseology is wearisome and trite , and has introduced us to it , in all its Eghts and bearings , until a child talks with fluency upon great truths , which lay dim in the distance to the mental sight of a Bacon or a Burleigh . We , should not approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fancy we saw upon it one green sprout , just budding forth , still young and tender , promising to blossom and bear great fruit , if untimely blasts do not injure it . Hitherto , to speak of American Art , was to speak of a thing hardly in existence . But the greatly increased number of American artists within the last few years , the awakened public interest concerning them , and the magnitude and character of many of the subjects of their late works , authorize us to hail the genuine birth of the young // spirit among us , and to crown it with the laurel of prospective fame . It will be useless , perhaps , to inquire , why we Americans have been so long without a school of art . But an obvious reason appears in the necessity for the developement of the physical resources of the country , for reducing lands to cultivation , for building towns , opening communications , bringing , in fact , our continent into a habitable state for civilized man . The time , expense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bear a comparison with the industrious efforts of any European country . We have changed the outward features of a quarter of the globe . Barren forests are turned into wavin0 grain ; mighty rivers , formerly navigated but by the solitary canoe , have become the common highways of a numerous people ; roads connect points at vast distances ; and cities and towns have been sown over the wilderness . Infant Rome , with her battles and her colonies , her public works , her aqueducts and temples , did not achieve greater things than these , nor the great historical wars of a Philip or C*esar , with their hosts of armed men , effect so much as the same number of men in this country , at war , not with transient human opposition , but with the eternal and intrinsic obstacles of Nature . We have for the last two centuries been preparing the land for a national habitation ; and rapid has been the preparation , though still the limits of our industry and ability were hemmed in by the necessities of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are incapable of every other ? and that , as for a few generations we have been the pioneers of civilization , our ambition and progress will be limited to this task ? Rather from this time will the elder part of our people make similar progress in all that makes and honors a civilized nation , in science , in literature , in philosophy , in art . It is on this broad basis , built by the brawny strength of our ancestors , that we are now to rear the lasting fabric of a moral , intellectual , and national character . The adaptation and utility of Art to us Americans may be strongly urged upon the broad grounds , of our want of occupation for our leisure hours ; of our deficiency in subjects of elegant cultivation , affording occupation to the class of non-working men in the old world , a class , which though as yet by no means abundant , must spring up with our increased wealth , and // greater subdivision of labor ; of their counteracting the overworked , business , anxious character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real refinement over the few leisure moments of each day , and giving employment to those born to fortune , as well as to those , who , having acquired it , still labor on in the acquisition , for the want of better pursuits , even when the most exorbitant wishes for wealth have been long satisfied . We are almost without the means of amusement and wholesome recreation , and the want glares upon us in the frequency of diseases , originating in or brought out by , mental over-excitement and labor ; in our too serious temper and manner ; in the thoughtful expression of countenance , and in the total absence of hilarity and jovialness , in which the American of the Eastern States departs so widely from his ancestral English character . Where can we innocently quench the rational thirst of the mind for recreation , separated from application , and of the body for rest , stimulated by enjoyment , which strengthens , not exhausts , but in the cultivation of the exhilarating , inspiring arts ? During all periods , and among all nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sprung up the natural product of the character , genius , and climate , and when , as exotics , they have been introduced by conquest or wealth ) , to fill the vacancy which competency and idleness always produce . All history shows how naturally and perfectly they have answered these ends , and how admirable is their use in that state of society , which must soon be ours , where leisure and cultivation may be combined ; how often they have proved a peaceful resource against the dangers of popular , turbulent idleness , as well as a promoter of the sister graces of life , and of all the high attainments of civilization ; how often they have essentially contributed to elevation of character , to the developement of a great moral sentiment of mankind , - a sentiment at all times earnestly cultivated with us . As illustrators of moral subjects , they can delight and strengthen the noblest feelings . Their power is in nature , and no repetition can diminish their freshness . Heroic sacrifice , devoted faith , sufferin2s endured for principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift of a kind Providence , can he severally transported froni the world of the imaginary and ideal into actual and glowing existence , by the colors of the canvass , or the outlines and mellow surface of the marble . If all the // occasions of affecting feeling , or noble actions , sparkling throughout our brief history , could be preserved to us by the arts , disengaged from all commonplace accessories , what fuel would be given to honorable ambition , what light to virtue Does not even the pictorial exhibition , or the sculptured form , accurate in the representation of one we have learned to admire , excite those wholesome feelings , which their living presence would do ? No one could stand before a statue of Washington , perfectly expressive of the character of the man , embodying his noble mind in the lineaments of his face and form , without awe and admiration , without carrying away some of the inexhaustible influence which breathes around it , without experiencing a pious awe , and rising for a moment into a fuller conception and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effect or influence is permanently valuable . The statue which constantly produces it , should rank with the gift , bequeathed to his country and to man by his biographer , the most precious gift which can be offered by a citizen or acc*pted by a nation . In the same way , no one could st8nd without delight before the definite , tangible representations of the poetical conceptions of Scott , and see them plainly figured to the before vaguely excited imagination , clothed in the garb of living pictures or statues . It is disclosing them to the mind through a new sense , which doubly deepens their impression . But , in reply to these remarks , admitting their truth , it may he urged , that certain periods of national existence , peculiar stages of civilization only , are favorable to the developement of the arts ; that this age and country are not the time and place for their rise ; that art must spring from an irresistible impulse , independent of patronage ; that it is a bursting-out of a succession of geniuses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cQmniand admiration and respect , duly granted to the preeminence of their powers and pro ( luctions ; that with us , nothing like this has appeared , or is likely to appear ; that we are , of all people , the furthest removed from the ideal in our intellectual character , and from leisure in our manner of life ; that we can not comprehend the beauties of art , when presented to us , much less may we hope to create them . It may be said , that we are born for different objects , trained to opposite pursuits . We grapple with the actual and outward world ; we struggle for support , advancement , // competency ; busy life here knows no leisure , no recreation ; all are swallowed up in the absorbing pursuit of business ; how could art be born , how live , in so uncongenial a soil ? These are pressing objections , but they may be met by an examination into the national character , which seems to us remarkably adapted to a keen relish for the arts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Americans have a tendency to excitement , great enthusiasm , deep sensibility and sympathy , an undertone of strong feeling constantly breaking out . We have lost , from long separation and difference of circumstances , much of our ancestral English phlegm , hardness , and composure , and have become quick , inventive , easily absorbed in any exciting profession , and constant and earnest in any attractive pursuit . This is the sort of character , which the artist most easily impresses , and one form which he himself is most apt to spring ; for it is one awake to historical allusion , sensitive to touches of character , alive to all the influences of the beautiful . It is no contradiction to this statement to allow , that the taste of the community is most crude , extravagant alike in its praise and blame . The fault lies in its insufficient acquaintance with the works of art , and the want of a true standard of judgment , to be gained only by a study of the best works , which we , for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever enters this country , that it is not enjoyed and felt , not from a spirit of fashionable imitation , but from a natural love and relish , not so keen , of course , and discriminating , as that of the connoisseur , but still furnishing a deep foundation for the highest cultivation of the popular taste . For art with us must be popular , enjoyed by the people , supported by the people . We have no privileged class to sustain it . Hence its progress may be more gradual , but it will be more fruitful , more rich and various in its maturity , and more lasting . In England we doubt if there is , or can be , a popular taste for the arts . It is not in her character or condition . Art is liberally patronized ; but is it not for the sake of the patron , rather than of the people ? It seems an exotic , supported by the immense wealth and luxury of the nation . Its native fruits have never been of the rarest kind or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , and in // their way have been unsurpassed ; but the school can not be said to have ever arisen to general characteristic eminence or influence . There is much to be hoped for from the spirit of emulation amongst us . In this respect we may anticipate advantages , similar to those enjoyed by the Italian states of the middle ages . A generous rivalry must spring up between the artists of different states and cities ; various schools will be originated , each with a pride and reputation of its own . The same spirit has done wonders for us , in internal improvements and public works ; its influence must be equally happy in the peaceful rivalry of the arts . But above all , we have liberty , the soil from which every heavenly gift to man springs with most vigorous growth . To art it is particularly essential , and has accompanied it , wherever it has arisen to its natural and palmy state . The artist must feel no restraint over his hand or his thoughts ; his touches can not be guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free and manly mind . Patronage , when forced upon him , may support a sickly representative of art ; but , like poetry and eloquence , when bridled , it loses its noble gait and graceful bounds , it becomes tame and impotent . No people enjoyed greater comparative liberty , than the artists under the Medici and their contemporaries ; and , although living at a time when aristocratic tyranny was beginning to smother popular liberty , they always kept alive among their own class the spirit of personal freedom . No man 's life was more free from sycophancy or servility than Michael Angelo 's . His just , though modest estimation of his own merit , and of what was due to his art , led him into many a contention with those , whose power over him could condemn , if they dared , to imprisonment and misery . Personal effort and talent , during all the flourishing times of Italian art , were the only security for success ; and the benefits of patronage fell , with but few exceptions , and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever cases of neglect do occur , they may be traced to the fault of the individual , who obscured his merit by caprice , indolence , irresolution , or treachery . The artists came forward to struggle in the arena of fair public contention , and in that contention they acquired the vigor , manliness , and boldness of their style and subjects ; through danger and // difficulties they won their way up to the then lofty eminence of distinction ; like Leonardo di Vinci , they painted , girded and armed , with the drawn sword by their side , to protect themselves from the treachery of rivals , or the violence of fellow-citizens , in whose feuds their ardent tempers had joined . Like knights of chivalry , they watched , mailed arid equipped , for their beautiful visions , and a greater purity and softness were imparted to them from their contrast to the dangers , which lurked around their studio . Their entPiusiasm was kindled hy difficulties , and their devotion worshipped more fondly the creations of peace and purity , which elevated and sanctified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such struggles and dangers , that art found for itself a home , and grew , and produced its richest fruit . We do not mean to say , that these dangers and difficulties were the parent of art , or its appropriate atmosphere ; but they show , that , as its creations are of high and difficult execution , so they can not he ohtamed without a corresponding exertion and sacrifice , without the whole mind of the artist being bent to his work , and unpressing those around him with the vigor and influence of his genius . But , again we would repeat , that freedom is an essential , vital element in the condition of the arts ; its very atmosphere and light . How necessary it is to them , is shown by this that they make it , when they do not find it , or die in the attempt . Political and popular freedom is best , as favoring the whole class of artists ; whereas individual freedom favors only the single artist . The arts may have gleamed up during a despotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a preceding period of freedom , and not the growth of the times in which they actually appeared ; and , as soon as the hand of compulsion has pressed upon them for a time , we shall find them becoming meagre and barren . Architecture may possibly be an exception to this , as many Roman emperors , who ruled with a bloody sword , devoted their wealth and magnificence to architectural structures . But even in the present ruins of these structures , the design and original plans seem less striking and beautiful than the gorgeous and meretricious richness . Pure taste declined with the lengthening line of the Ca*sars . With us , artists have not to struggle against oppression , compulsion , rude disorder , or an uncivilized state of society , // but against ignorance , and the uncultivated taste of the public . Yet , even in this contention , their independence and character will be fully tried . For no ordii*ary resolution is requisite to cling to the pure and difficult path ; to purge the fancy from those creations , which attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and add a portion to the influences , which lead to a higher state of the arts . Still , let the aim of each be lofty , and , whatever point he reaches , that point will be in the right line to eminence . Let them labor for their art itself , in its highest perfection , and then , if a misjudging public bestow no applause , they may be conscious how much their efforts have surpassed that public , and shot beyond the backward taste of critics . There is no want of patronage towards native artists . Merit , in general , meets with as much reward with us as perhaps anywhere . In Europe , there may be instances of greater rewards to prominent individuals ; but a proportionably greater number swell the list of the neglected and starving . But the word patronage seems a term inapplicable to the employment of artists here . It is more of an equitable and natural compensation for labor and talent ; a purchasing of an intellectual gratification . It would be better , perhaps , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the European sense of the word ; that artists , being less dependent on the wishes and tasteless instructions of their employers , might exercise a freer choice of subjects . Much of the time now wasted in committing to canvass the head of some master of a family , or his favorite son or daughtei , at half l ) Iice , for the sake of turning a better penny , deserves to be employed upon the more difficult execution of worthier subjects , so as to lead through the path of constant practice to the perfect expression of conceptions of noble interest . There is no lack of artists among us . The number at present is very great for a new country , particularly of sculptors . Painting has never been without its more or less distinguished votaries ; but it is a little remarkable , that sculpture should spring up in a country so far removed from every specimen of it , that hundreds of thousands have never seen a statue . In some individuals , the taste for it , as a pursuit , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so remote from its objects , that it is to inspiration alone , not the faint images // of art wafted from abroad , that we must look for an explanation of the phenomenon . It was the impulse of genius which led Mr. Powers from his inauspicious heginnings in waxen figures , to the attempt of embodying in stone , not the featt*ires and lines alone of the human face , hut the expression , the mind , the light and force of character . There is something very striking in the career of such an individual , springing from an humble beginning , pushing his way forward beyond the doubts of his situation , beyond home and friends , and carrying his triumphant course across the Atlantic , into a land , the very garden of art , there to wrest the palm of superiority from the most accomplished competitors . Would not the slightest distrust of his genius , or a timid admiration of his pursuit , have led him to remain at home , and earn the easy admiration of his countrymen , without entering the lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living under the influence of the purest models of ancient and modern times ? Does not a natural impulse speak out in such a career ? Does nature ever induce such privation and labor but for success ? Ours is a day of wonders , but this certainly might rank among the remarkable things . A sneering foreign critic might remark upon such a course , with some apparent aptness , as the height of an alleged national selfsufficiency ; but surely the historian , noticing the various developements of our character from time to time , might quote the example of this artist as a noble instance of its energy , enthusiasm , and high-wrought determination , and adduce his success as a proof of the sagacity and discernment which direct it . Yet similar has been the career of two other American sculptors , to one of whom , Greenough , belongs the additional merit of having opened the path to Italy , and , by successfully trying the experiment , led on the young career of our arts . How prominent his success , his high name among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be more than dawning , since his greatest works have not yet appeared , and be himself is scarce entered upon that period of life , which is the flower age of the artist . His productions exhibited in this country show great purity and delicacy , a spiritual tone , and freedom from all servitude to the common and prevalent Italian tastes and subjects . The developement of his higher powers belongs to those grander works , ordered by our government , // one of which is so popular , and at the same time , dignified , that it will naturally call forth all his genius . An excellent characteristic of this artist was his early and constant attention to the very highest objects of his art . He aimed at the ideal and poetical , to be expressed by the whole figure , and seldom or never reached by busts alone ; he appears to have felt , at the outset , the extent of his art , and to have grasped it all . The same may be said of Mr. Crawford , led by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy . Devoting himself in Rome to a close study of the antique , he purified his taste , whilst he improved his practice with the chisel and clay . His ambition led him , in his earliest efforts , to a daring attempt , and produced his Orpheus , representing the bard , just in the act of descending into the shades of hell , to reclaim his iLurydice ; a statue most poetical and original in its conception , and extremely difficult of execution the body being thrown forward , and motion diffused throughout the whole figure . The hardihood of a young artist attempting a subject so new , and a position so difficult , including points to be settled by his sole judgment , without the authority of the antique , could only be justified by a sight of the statue itself . As the production of a young man , it is wonderful , and might grace the studio of any living artist , and add to his reputation . The most apparent road to success , with young sculptors in America , is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation is at best doubtful . Mechanical ingenuity and skill may be acquired , but taste is not exercised , nor invention called out . Nature is studied , not to idealize upon , or to combine her various excellences into one perfect whole , but merely to copy with minute accuracy , to make a fac simile . The mind of the artist is not taxed , and there is no , fair opening for those characteristic touches , which are the essence of expression . The hand and the eye may be improved , and it is a gratifying and useful proof of power , to bestow upon a family and friends the almost living resemblance of one perhaps dead , though still familiar in their recollections . But , beyond this , the advantages of such practice are very doubtful . The artist who aims at the highest excellence in his art , would do well to quit this branch of it , when his emergencies cease to require it . One word upon the popular notion , that the arts are a source // of corrupting luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l ) ortion of our subject . It is apparcntly a * ) rejudice , springing from the association of the fine arts with the character of times when they most flourished , and which happened to be times of general corruption and licentiousness . Thus the vices of the Italian character are interwoven with our notions of Italian painting , and sculpture , and music , and we foolishly anticipate , from an introduction of the latter , an inundation of the former ; whereas they are no more cause and effect , than Italian poverty and Italian statuary , or political subjection and frescos . Doubtless there may be an immoral picture , and an immoral statue , but they are not - more necessarily so than hooks ; and it would be as reasonable to condemn English literature , because " Tom Jones * and " Don Juan " could be found in it , as to condemn painting , because Titian courted the applause of his countrymen by his corrupting representations of Venus . it is wiser and better to deny at once the authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality are incompatible and to regard as nearer the truth the opinion , that love of innocent enjoyment , of beauty , the gratitication of fancy , the indulgence of taste , are among the original , strong , good principles of our nature , the developement of which will ward off corruption , and complete and perfect the social man . There still remains one branch of the fine arts , which we have left to the last , as for this country the most imf ) ortant and influential of all , - Architecture . Let us take the word in its widest and most popular signification , as a term including all those predominant and distinguishing characteristics , which mark and constitute the style of buildings in different ages and among various nations . In this wide sense , all periods , from the most savage to the most civilized , have their architecture , and we may jump at once out of the limits of the five orders , and , ranging through all history and all countries , find everywhere this interesting and popular art developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit of being the most historical of the arts , not alone as marking the chronology of its builders , but as distinguishing , in its forms , materials , and uses , the character and advancement of the period and people , which gave it*birth . By it we can rightly sketch the progress of man from the earliest times downwards . It marks , in imnperishable // characters , in the pyramids of Egypt , the despotic vanity of the ruler , and the slavish subjection of the subject , compelled to years of labor upon a useless mass raised to perpetuate only a single name . In the elegant temples of Greece , we admire the pure , well-balanced9 heightened , intellectual character of the Athenians , prolonging its influence to the present day . In the ampitheatres , the long aqueducts , the paved ways of Rome , we recognise the grand popular spirit and heroic character of the republic , and , in the gorgeous palaces , the overgrown luxury of the empire . The mixed architecture of the middle ages carries us back to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world was borrowed from the past , and whatever was graceful and humane was but the broken and distorted reflection of former days . Then followed the Gothic , grand , majestic , and spiritual ; vast in its compass , to hold the mighty myriads of the northern hordes , simple and sublime in its main divisions and proportions , indicating the high and daring tone of their character , yet complicated and puerilely minute in its ornamental details , to mark the barbarity of that character . Thus , too , the ruined castles upon the Rhine are the great historical proofs of the once feudal state of the country . The numerous and gorgeous churches of Rome mark the ascendency of religion , and its union with temporal power ; and the barred and fortresslike palaces of Florence , the times of turbulent party spirit , of warring aristocracy , and struggling democracy . The opening of Pompeii has probably made us more intimate with Roman manners and customs , and styles of living , than all the learning and criticism of modern Europe ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in this broad definition of the term , that we can speak of architecture in America ; for to consider it otherwise , or as the science of construction based upon the strict arbitrary rules of the five orders , would make it a subject of painful and fruitless contemplation . If we examine the character of our buildings , we shall find them reflecting our state of society , cur form of government , and our prominent occupations . Our Statehouses and town-houses mark our represet ) tative and legislative authority ; our banks and storehouses , our high commercial activity ; and our numerotis and various churches , the flourishing , btit divided and independent , state of religion . These are the objects of our architectural ornament and display , and // they are precisely those characterizing our condition . Hence we see that architecture is the great expression of national character , and that every great period of society has its significant style . Again , it is the most popular of the arts . We mean , it influences and gratifies more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their full enjoyment , some degree of cultivation ; hut the rudest will be impressed with the imposing piles of architecture . Fine buildings are the household furniture of a city , and as influential upon the disposition of its inhabitants , as domestic furniture upon the good manners and character of the family circle . They are ever present companions to the citizen , confronting him in his daily walks , gradually affecting his mind and tastes , and binding round their well-proportioned members , the chains of renewed and strengthened association . They go to make up a large portion of the pride felt in home and country . If the citizen of an ornamented city be ahsent for a time , he misses its customary outward influences , and returns with zest to the well-ordered arrangements , the majestic fronts , the pleasing interior , of his own public buildings . He acquires a feeling of ownership , and even of care , for these precious ornaments of his land ; and his vanity is gratified by pointing them out to strangers as marks of the taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , architecture is so popular and influential , it is highly important that it be not neglected , as all our hopes rest upon popular cultivation . It is in fact one of the most natural and apparent means of producing that refinement , ease , and profitable enjoyment of leisure , whose absence mars our society , and takes from its true beauty and worth . The solid qualities of character are possessed by this people in as great perfection as by any other ; but these alone do not constitute the full enjoyment of life . We have yet to supply occupation for many leisure minutes of each day , which are now shaded over and darkened by the trespassing cares of our business occupations . this art is peculiarly adapted to effect this , as study and attention to it awaken in the mind the liveliest images of beauty and grandeur , and inspire it with the full enjoyment of embodied grace . And even the mere occupation of construction is a useful and exhilarating stimulus . The interest of planning a house , or su @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much greater that of erecting a large public building , the receptacle of multitudes assembled for the most serious and lasting objects , to deliberate upon national interests , or meditate upon the sublime truths of religion . Then we build for centuries , for remotest generations , carrying the associations of the present far beyond the recollections of living witnesses , into the furthest future ages ; associations free from the factiousness and ill-blood of political excitement , and awakening a generous pride of citizenship . and an enthusiasm for national glory and honor . The popular disposition is always to embody its feelings of admiration and enthusiasm i12 such objects , and thereby to give them a locality , a habitation , and a name . Even religion gains power and support from the imposing house of prayer . We are too apt to despair of ever seeing any thing like a national school of architecture . Certainly there is much ground for the feeling . But it is unfortunate to indulge it now , when we are requiring so many public buildings of a permanent character ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will stand a source of perpetual annoyance to succeeding and more cultivated generations . Most of our cities are now of a size to erect buildings for the various public offices of religion , of legislation , of finance , of education , &amp;c . They are rich enough to furnish materials of the best description , and in suitable abundance ; and the skill of the mere builder is not wanting to make them durable for ages . But the mind of the artist is wanting . No one has yet appeared to captivate the popular admiration by new and appropriate forms . That our people do not express more interest in their public buildings , or more indignation at their imperfections , is in no way surprising . They have as yet never fairly known what enjoyment is to be derived from a fine building . They have never seen one which comes home to their associations , their ideas of fitness and excellence , or their notions of grandeur and majesty . At present , our public and private buildings present constant violations of the simplest rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parts and propriety of ornament . Proportion gives enjoyment even to the most un // cultivated eye , though none but the most skilful band can create it . It is only to be obtained by long and patient study , by poring as it were over the models of acknowledged merit , and catching the spirit of their beauty , not the mere measurement of their lines . It must be the habitual expression of the hand of the artist , as beauty is that of the mind of the poet . But there are few , if any of the works of American architects , which are stamped with this truly artistic character , and many of our most pleasing buildings are those planned and erected by English artists during the colonial times ; such as the King 's Chapel in Boston , and the Episcopal Church , at Cambridge , in every line and combination of which we see the hand of an accomplished draughtsman . Breadth of effect , dignity , and imposing appearance are also most uncommon ; not so much from the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute division of parts . The facades of most houses are made complete sieves for the admission of light , and it is doubtful , in some , whether windows or blank wall predominate . This , of course , gives a fragile and summer-house like effect to the outside , which should be as nassive and stable in appearance as possible , and is equally prejudicial to the good appearance of the interior , as admitting various cross lights , instead of one broad mass . Ornament , too , is lavished with the most tasteless and unnecessary profusion , as if the beauty of ornament consisted , not in its appropriateness and finishing effect , but in its costly extravagance . Simplicity and unity are the ground work of beauty , and this trick of subdivision , and running to miniature and incongruous details , is utterly at war with it . In no buildings is this confusion and display of ornament so manifested , as in our Gothic modern churches , cottages , and barns . The ornament of the genuine Gothic impresses us , in the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect in a great mass , and partly from the lightness which it gives to such solid materials as stone or marble . But this richness and its effect degenerate into childish display upon a smnall building , especially if the material be frail and , as two or three clumped pillars , and a small fretted vault , have little reference or similarity to the thick-studded grove , or its broad but delicate canopy of leaves , ( the origin // in nature of the Gothic order , ) still less may these unhallowed cuttings and carvings of tl ) e carpenter 's chisel , so common with us , claim any alliance with the lofty magnificence of the Gothic , which they imitate in so ghastly a manner . Imitation is had enough in its greatest perfection ; but we are flooded with miserable imitations of transatlantic buildings , deficient in the points most worthy of imitation , their beauty of proportions and solidity of materials . There is another disregard of propriety in our buildings , highly injurious to their good appearance , even if they were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , so as to allow no space for the spectator . Trinity Church , in Boston , is a striking instance of this defect . Viewed from the Common , down Winter Street , it strongly impresses the spectator with the idea of its solidity and grandeur ; but approach it , and the neck is twisted off , in trying to enjoy its massy proportions . And so Saint Paul 's , in the same city , having a portico remarkably harinonious in its proportions and color , rarely attracts the eye , disturbed on the one side by the encroaching row of brick dwelling-houses , and by the rather fantastic Masonic Temple on the other . The new Custom House is far more happy in the relation of its proportions to the space in which it will be viewed . Striking , however , as are all these defects of American architecture , it is obvious , that a great improvement , a higher taste , and a desire for better things , are manifesting themselves . The wants and wishes of the country are expressed in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House at New York , and that at Boston , which do honor to American genius and taste , and will be favorable witnesses , as long as they shall stand , to the degree of present advancement . Now , then , is the time for the man to arise , who will give originality and power to the creations of the architect , and new direction and influence to these symptoms of dawning luxury . The people are fast parting with the obstinacy and conceit , which led them to interfere with the plans of the architect , resigning them for that better wisdom , which acknowledges and follows a guide welt skilled in his profession . The country abounds in materials of the richest description , daily consumed , and worked up into the form of churches , banks , warehouses , and city halls , only needing the ordering // mind of the architect , to spring into shapes of elegance and fitness . The task of making a fine building is quite as easy as that of making an vgly one , and only requires resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to manage and guide and persuade his employers . There is no reason to fear that our people will not acknowledge beauty and orderly arrangement , when they see them , and with them the merit of the artist . In fact , the bar to beautiful structures does not exist so much in the incapacity of tl ) e people , as in that of the artist himself . Though we have had men of merit , we have had none equal to the high and difficult task ; none with the creative and energetic mind , the enterprising spirit , the soul overflowing with the love of art , the memory teeming with all its past productions , the imagination exercised in all the varieties of combination , the self-devotion , the determination to effect , the continued sacrifice of all other pursuits and interests . These are the elements of the required character , and until they come to fashion the man , we can not say to what extent he may not influence a people , young and easily moulded , or how far he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every state of man , that acceptable food must be supplied to them ; and proud , happy , and long revered will be the memory of the artist , who slakes from the great we 11-spring of his own creative genius , the thirst of our nature for ideal beauty materialized and brought within the limit and intercourse of our senses . Let us imagine , as a closing picture , the course of such an architect , to whom nature had given the true elements of vigor and genius . The reports of the treasures of the old world would soon lead him across the waters , to draw , from the relics of three thousand years , instruction , improvement , and inspiration . He would peruse each order , and each national style , with deference to the taste and character of its inventors , studying them as eagerly as a scholar the literature of the past , copying , and recopying them , selecting what was good and IJure , and rejecting the bad , until the whole peculiar spirit of their beauty had passed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations , as they passed on , improving or degenerating , into the new forms of succeeding times ; observing the while , that the imagination is as sportive and changing , as readily adapting itself to each new feature of society , with the trowel and chisel , as with the pen . He // would learn , that , though one age might boast of its preeminent purity of taste , yet none was without its expression that , if the simple Doric , or the graceful Ionic , might exhibit an almost divine beauty in the Attic temple , still the GrecoGothic cathedral was not without its barbarous quaintness , nor the Moorish villa without its rich , i**aginative , fantastic Asiatic air . He would see how powerfully the frowning palaces of Florence brought back the turbulent , dark , savage times of their constructors , and awed the memory into historical recollections , less joyful and exhilarating l ) erhaps , than those awakened amid the rich ruins of Ephesus and Delos , but not less fascinating . Then , seeing how modern civilization , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his art , he would tax his ingenuity to give beauty to even its minute structures , knowing that all form is capable of expression , and that the artist has almost the power of divinity over his materials , binding all things in beauty . His hand and his eye would he taught to execute with unerring fidelity the concel ) tions of his imagination and these would be guided by that deep knowledge of the wants , habits , and character of his fellow men , which constitutes the philosophy of his art , without which he can not hope to influence or impress the popular mind . Let him , after such a tuition , return to America , coming not like a pupil , still clinging to the leadingstrin0s of the master spirits of the dead past , but confident in his own light , braced by nature and study to the noble task of writing in stone and marble , all over the country , the imperishable record of our condition , so new , so fresh , so unexpressed . Let him rightly combine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producing what is truly national and emblematical to the American people , and it is impossible that he should not strike home to their admiration . Have we not feelings , passions , prejudices , assQciations , as strong and as lively as any people on earth ? and where lies the reason , that they should not be addressed by wood and stone , as well as any of those of the hundreds of nations , who have risen and sunk into the tomb of history , leaving nothing but their temples , palaces , and fortifications , as a tangible memorial of their existence ? Is there any thing more delusive in the anticipation of a future brilliant career of the arts in America , than in the hope , that we may see a national literature , or a national school of science , or of philosophy ? The time may or may // not come within this or the next century , hut come it certainly will , and we venture to affirm , that with regard to one of them , Sculpture , its day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington lands on the shores of the Potomac.
