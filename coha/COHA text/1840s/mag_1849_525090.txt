txt " Paradoxical as it may appear , I think Great Britain the largest grain-exporting country in the world , although it is impossible to calculate accurately what quantity of grain , and other farming productions , is consumed in preparing fifty millions of exports by which she so greatly benefits . This grain , and these farming products , are placed in the laboratory of that wondcrful machine , man , which gives him the physical power , aided by steam , of convertin0 them into broadcloths , calico , hardware , &amp;c. , and in these shapes your wheats and farmin0 find their way to every country in the world . " THE above passage is from a letter by an eminent merchant of Liverpool , now in Parliament , and we propose to take it as our text in an examination of the policy of Great Britain and its influence on the other nations of the world . England does export more food than any other country of the world . Of her fifty millions of exports more than twothirds consist of food . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the Black Sea , the rice of India and Carolina , the sugar of Jamaica and Brazil , the coffee of Cuba and Caraccas , compresses them into the smallest possible form by means of the laboratory of the human stomach , and thus is enabled to export food to the amount of more than thirty millions sterling ; while the people of these United States , producing annually a thousand millions of bushels of food for man , and a thousand millions of pounds of cotton , are compelled , for want of the light and easily transported , and comparatively inexpensive , michinery by aid of which their food and their wool could be converted into cloth , to send both to a distance of thousands of miles , obtaining a single bale of cloth for five bales of cotton , and thus losing on the road and in the work of transportation a large portion of the product of their labor . England exports more food than any other country , and she imports more . She realizes in perfection the theory of the teachers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imports the measure of a country 's prosperity . According to them , the more ships , and wagons , and men , that can be employed in the work of transportation and ex change , the more rapid must be the growth of wealth and happiness . If we speak with them of the poverty and wretchedness of Ireland , we are referred to the amount of imports and exports for evidence that she is becoming richer and more prosperous . If we refer to the depopulation of India , we are assured that she exports more than ever , and must , therefore , be increasing in prosperity . If we point to the superiority of the condition of the Chinese , as compared with the people of Hindostan , we are assured that a large external commerce is indispensable to ny advance in civilization , and that the poor people of China ' are so deficient therein that it is lawful and Christian-like to batter down their towns and destroy their inhabitants , in order that those who remain may enjoy the blessings of that system which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur to these men that , the more numerous the people employed in the work of exchange the smaller must be the number employed in that of production . A bushel of corn transported from Iowa to Manchester is still only a bushel of corn , and yet the labor that has been expended in the work of trctnsportalion is probably twice as great as was originally expended in its production , and had the whole been applied to the latter work , there would have been three bushels for the consumption of man instead of one . Each individual man understands this perfectly , and therefore it is that the farmer prefers a wagon to a cart , and a railroad to either . The labor of one man on the latter will accomplish more transportation than will that of a hundred horses and men , and all the balance is ap // plicable to the work of production , and this is the sole advantage resulting from the substitution of an iron road for one of stone . The manufacturer of iron knows the importance of having the forge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton manufacturer brings the loom as near as possible to the spindles ; and yet the men who undertake to lecture on the economy of nations would have us believe that in every increase of the quantity of our exchanges with far distant men , is to be found a new step in the road to prosperity . With them commerce and the machinery of trade are everything . They exult in every increase in the size and number of ships , yet a ship produces nothing . The hales of cotton , or the barrels of flour , that are placed on board are still but bales of cotton and barrels of flour when they are discharged . The labor of the farmer converts a bushel of wheat into twenty bushels , while the labor of the sailor adds nothing to the stock of food or the maT terials of clothing , and yet are we taught to find in the number of seamen an index to a country 's wealth . Such is the political economy of all the English writers , and in it they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic ; the result of which has been , that while there has been a perpetual effort on the part of the people to pursue the course they felt to be advantageous , it has been steadily counteracted by the efforts of half-instructed politicians to compel them to move in an opposite direction . If we turn to the last Report of the Secretary of the Treasury , we find him priding himself on the fact that his measures have tended to the promotion of our exchanges with distant nations , necessarily accompanied with much loss of time and labor ; but we should fail if we sought to find in it any evidence that his measures had tended to promote those domestic exchanges which are effected with the aid of inexpensive machinery , and at small cost of labor , leaving a large quantity of labor to be applied to the work of increasing the juantity of products to be consumed or exchanged . Mr. Walker is a disciple of the economical school of England . The policy of that country has , at all times , been that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NO . I. NEW SERIES . food , their cotton , their wool , and their other raw materials , that she might convert them into forms that fit them for consumption , and then return them to the producers , mines all the cost of transportation and exchange . With that view she has desired to have colonies with which she could have what she called free trade . Independent nations would not have it , because its ruinous effects were too obvious , but subjects could be compelled to do that which she insisted was for their interest . The people of her American provinces might smelt their ore , but if they desired to convert their iron into nails they must send it to English workshops , there to be converted by aid of costly English food ; while the granaries of the provinces were groaning under the weight of wheat , and rye , and Indian corn , for which there was no market , and then to be returned to them burthened with enormous expense for transportation and exchange . They might make hats for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their neighbor subjects , they must do it through the medium of English ports , if indeed even that could have been permitted . That was her freedom of trade . She has desired to be " the workshop of the world , " and such , according to Lord John Russell , she must be . With that view she prohibited the export of every species of machinery , and the artisan was sent to prison if he endeavored to transfer himself and his skill to any foreign country . The world now rebels , and tariffs of protection have become almost universal , and England , fo reed to adopt measures of conciliation , repeals her corn-laws , hoping thereby to obtain additional power to control the exchanges between the producer and the consumer of other countries , compelling the food to come with the wool and the cotton , that all may be converted into cloth , and thus to increase the already existing burthen upon her neighbors But the result has thus far been a total failure . The demand for her manufactures has not increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At no period of her history has distress been so universal . At none has the difficulty of obtaining employment been so great . At none has there existed so great a desire to ship off to distant markets the laborers 3 35 // held to be surplus ; and while she employs ships of war on the African coast to prevent the purchase of black slaves , she courts a demand for the white ones of the United Kingdom , offering not only to give them , but also to pay a portion of the cost of transportation , careless whether they perish of disease on the voyage , or starve on the shores of the St. Lawrence . With each step in her progress her difficulties increase , because her system is unnatural and , therefore , unsound , those difficulties being but the natural consequences of its existence . " The eyes of England , " says Mr. Carey , in his recent work , the Past , Present and Future , to which we propose shortly to call the attention of our readers , in an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must and would , " he continues , " have ships , colonies , and commerce . To that desire is due the waste of thousands of millions ; of more than would have sufficed to cover the island with railroads ; to render every field a garden ; to provide food in abundance for a population five times greater than now finds subsistence on her soil , and composed of a healthy , hardy race , capable of guarding their own rights , and regulating for themselves the hours of labor , the drainage of houses , the mode and expense of interments , and a thousand other things , in reference to which they are now compelled to claim parliamentary interference : by which is indicated an extreme inability to protect themselves . " The state of things that has existed during the last thirty years is the strongest commentary on the system . It is impossible to look at any work on British agriculture without being struck with its backward state in most parts of the kingdom , when compared with what might naturally have been looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cry is everywhere that the people are too numerous ; yet the best lands in many of the counties are badly cultivated , although wealth so much abounds that it has been made a matter of question whether it might not be too abundant for the prosperity of a nation. * So abounding , it has , however , been almost as often the question where to get it , as how to be rid of it . For the first few years that followed the Congress of Vienna , it was lent to all the arbitrary sovereigns of Europe . In 1*25 , it was sent throughout Spanish America . In 1836 , it was sent to all North America . Between each of these , however , was a period of extreme distress to manufacturers and ship- tions. owners ; of starvation to operatives , and of ruin to tenants ; and such would continue to be the case were the system to be continued . None was ever devised so well calculated to retard , without the aid of war , the progress of a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a nation that imports food , which yet can , even now , produce it at less cost of labor than any other of the world , America not excepted ; and it has also succeeded in causing the waste of hundreds of millions in loans , colonies , &amp;c. , of which but a small part will ever return. ** Few errors are more common than that which leads us to believe that the agriculture of Great Britain is generally in a high condition , and that the land is made to yield all the produce of which it is capable . But half a century since that country was described by a writer of the highest authority , as being " disfigured and burdened everywhere " with " immeasurable wastes , commons , and heaths , " resembling " one of those huge , unwieldy cloaks worn in Italy and Spain , of which a small part is serviceable to the owner , while the rest is not only useless but cumbersome and oppressive ; " and as containing " in proportion to its size , more waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself not excepted. " * At that very time Mr. Malthus was preparing for publication a book having for its object , that of accounting for the distress and misery of the people by aid of his principle of over population ! Since then there has been a great improvement , but it is yet small compared with what it might have been had that country been accustomed to look more at home and less abroad . The hundreds of millions wasted in foreign wars would have made railroads that would have given to almdst every farm in the kingdom facilities of communication with every other one ; and the labor that has been spent in building the ships of war , and fabricating the arms and ammunition required for the acquisition and protection of colonies that were valuable to her only because they could be compelled to trade with her on such terms as she might think proper to dictate , would have accomplished , thirty years since , the works of drain * Eden 's History of the Poor , quoted by Mr. Carey , at page 51. 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Naage , // and of improvement in other forms , that are now going on , yielding abundant supplies of food produced at home , for the maintenance of the millions employed in the conversion of the raw materials of the earth into the cloth and the iron required for their own consumption , and that of the prosperous cultivators by whom they would then have been surrounded . " In the natural course of things , " says Mr. Carey , " there is a strong tendency towards placing the consumer by the side of the producer , and thus diminishing the quantity required of the machinery of exchange ; and wherever that tendency does not grow in the ratio of the growth of population , it is a consequence of some of those weak inventions ' hy which man so often disturbs the harmony of nature . Wherever her laws have most prevailed , such has been the tendency , and there have wealth and the power of man over the great machine , most rapidly increased . Rent is the price paid for the use of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity required of the machinery of exchange . " Among these " inventions " may he pVced in the first rank this British system which has for its object the separation of the consumers and the producers of other countries . Common sense teaches the producer of food that if the market be near at hand he saves both time and labor in making his exchanges , while his land is improved because of his power to return to it the refuse of its products ; whereas when the market is distant there is great loss of time and labor , and his land is exhausted by constant cropping , while returning to it no part of its product , and yet in this is found the essence of the colonial system of England . The system is unnatural , and therefore it is that it requires large fleets and armies , with their attendant taxation , for its maintenance . Unless coerced thereto , the people of Ireland would never have submitted to laws prohibiting them from exchanging with other parts of the world except through the medium of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discouragement of all the manufactures of Ireland . The produce of that country , except the little that is required for the subsistence , such as it is , of the miserable people employed in the work of production , is consumed abroad , and the land already in cultivation is thereby exhausted ; whereas , were that produce consumed at home by prosperous workmen engaged in converting ore into iron and wool into cloth , the power of the land would be maintained , and the people would acquire the means of subduing to cultivation her millions of acres of bog that would give to their use , soils of a quality far superior to any now in cultivation . Deprived of all power to engage in the work of manufacture , her people waste annually more labor and manure than would make all the iron and cloth required for the consumption of the United Kingdom , with its almost thirty millions of population ; the necessary consequence of which is , that they are poor and turbulent , and therefore is it that large armies are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs upon England a dead weight scarcely to be borne , and the latter is likely soon to be compelled to make an effort to release herself from all connection with a people that would , under a different system , have ranked among the most civilized of Europe , occupying one of the most prosperous countries of the world . What Ireland is , the American provinces would have become , had they not released themselves from the connection , and thereby obtained the power of protecting themselves against the perpetual error of the British system . India is exhausted . Her manufactures have been ruined , and the producer and consumer having thus been separated , there has been a steady diminution in the power of production and consumption , to the great astonishment of English political economists , who now anxiously inquire why it is that a country favored with the enjojment of free trade with them , is not blessed with prosperity . So is it with the West Indies , and so is it with Canada . Every country that enjoys free trade with England is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumers and the producers of other countries , and to the consequent ex -- haustion of their lands . " The earth is the sole producer . Man fashions and exchanges . A part of his labor is applied to the fashioning of the great machine , and this produces changes that are permanent . The drain , once cut , remains a drain ; and the limestone , once reduced to lime , never again 1849. 37 // becomes limestone . It passes into the food of man and animals , and ever after takes its part in the same round with the clay with which it has been incorporated . The iron rusts , and gradually passes into soil , to take its part with the clay and the lime . That portion of his labor gives him wages while preparing the machine for greater future production . That other portion which he expends on fashioning and exchanging the products of the machine , produces temporary results , and gives him wages alone . Whatever tends , therefore , to diminish the quantity of labor nc ? cessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity that may be given to increasing the a mount of products , a. *d to preparing the great machine ; and thus , while increasing the present return to labor , preparing for afuture further increase . " The first poor cultivator obtains a hundred bushels for his year 's wages . To pound this between two stones requires twenty days of labor , and the work is not half done . I-lad he a mill in the neighborhood he would have better flour , and he would have almost his whole twenty days to bestow upon his land . He pulls up his grain . Had he a scythe , he would have more time for the preparation of the machine of production . He loses his axe , and it requires days of himself and his horse on the road to obtain another . his machine loses the time and the manure , both of which would have been saved had the axe-maker been at hand . The real advantage derived from the mill and the scythe , and from the proximity of the axemaker , consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labor more and more to the preparation of the great machine of production , and such is the case with all the machinery of preparation and exchange . The plough enables him to do as much in one day as with a spade he could do in five . He saves four days for drainage . The steam-engine drains as much as without it could be drained by thousands of days of labor . He has more leisure to marl and lime his land . The more he can extract from his machine the greater is its value , because everything he takes is , by the very act of taking it , fashioned to aid further production . The machine , therefore , improves by use ; whereas spades , and ploughs , and steam engines , and all other of the machines used by man , are but the various forms into which he fashions parts of the great original machine , to disappear in the act of being used ; as much so as food , though not so rapid ly . The earth is the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other machines is in the direct ratio of their tendency to aid him in increasing his deposits in the only bank whose dividends are perpetually increasing , while its capital is perpetually doubling . That it may continue for ever so to do , all that it asks is that it shall receive back the refuse af its produce-the manure ; and that it may do so , the consumer and the producer must take their places by each o ! her . That done , every change that is effected becomes permanent , and tends to facilitate other and greater changes . The whole business of the farmer consists in making and improving soils , and the earth rewards him for his kindness by giving him more and more food the more attention he bestows upon her . " It is obvious that the smaller the quantity of labor that is needed for fashioning and exchanging the products of the earth , the greater is the quantity that may be given to increasing the quantity of products , and the greater will be the quantity of food , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who labor . Equally obvious must it be that the saving in the labor of exchanging must necessarily be attended with aa increase in the facility of cultivation , because of the power to return to the land the manure yielded by its products , and that thus every step towards the approximation of the consumer and the producer is attended with a double result , by increasing the labor to be applied , and the advantage with which it may be applied . In opposition to this , however , the political economists of England tell us that every increase in the quantity of labor applied to cultivating the land is attended with diminished reward ; and this is asserted in the face of the fact that at no period has labor yielded returns as large as those which are now obtained . It is impossible to open any book on English agriculture , without being struck with the wonderful increase in the returns obtained from similar surfaces , while the improved machinery of the present day enables the laborer to ejiltivate a larger surface than at any former period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place within the last thirty years is said to be gre ' *ter than the whole averaqe product of the land of this country , and that increase has been obtained by the application of l'bor to the extent of twenty , forty , eighty , or one hundred shillings per acre ; being less than the cost of the wild lands of the West to the settler , if we estimate his actual expenditure from the time he sets out on his pilgrimage until he is enabled to clear and cultivate as much as enables him to obtain subsistence for himself and his family , and 38 Jan. , // provide a proper shelter for them . At no period has labor applied to land yielded results so large , and yet the whole system of English political economy is hased on an assumption directly the reverse of this universal fact . At a great agricultural dinner given by Sir Robert Peel a few months since , some remarkable statements were given as to the great results obtained from small expenditures on land . One of the guests stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for only seven years , he had expended from thirty to thirty-five shillings per acre fl7. *O to *S.4O1 in drainnge , and had thereby doubled the product , paying himself by the first year 's crop . Another portion which he had drained had proved so productive that it rented for ? 5 *24 per acre , instead of 5s. 1 . ' 20 . In another case it was stated that a piece of land containing ninety-five acres , that supported fourteen cows , and grew eighty-eight bushels of wheat and beans , had been made to produce one thousand bushels of wheat , besides supporting forty head of cattle , large and small , one hundred sheep , and eighty pigs . The most remarkable case , however , was that of Mr. Woodward , who was obtaining from his whole farm an average of about fifty bushels to the acre , whereas much of it had been accustomed to produce , before it came into his possession , but little more than ten bushels , and all this was the result of the application of some fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Supposing it even eighty shillings , it would represent but eight weeks ' labor of one man , and where in this country can man obtain land capable of yielding , permanently , forty bushels to the acre , ( the difference between the present and former yield , ) and already provided with buildings of every kind , roads , markets , &amp;c. , at the cost of eight weeks ' labor or even twice that quantity , per acre ? Most certainly nowhere ! In no part of Europe , except in Belgium , Holland , and Tuscany , is labor npplied to the work of cultivation rewarded with as large returns as in those parts of England , where it is applied in sufficient quantity to the preparation of the land , particularly by means of drainage , a work that has only recently been carried to any great extent . That such is the case , is obvious from the fact , that nearly the whole of the supplies required for its population is furnished the labor of only two-fifths engaged in agriculture , whereas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one-half so employed . As we pass south and west from that State , the proportion steadily increases , until at length we find in the extreme south , and extreme west , nearly the whole so engaged , except so far as they are employed on the roads leading to distant markets , in which to exchange their products for the cloth and iron which under a more natural state of things would be produced at home . With each step in this progress we find a diminution in the produce of labor applied to the cultivation of the land , and that difference is most remarkable when compared with England . We can not open nn English agricultural journal without being struck with crops of forty or fifty bushels of wheat to the acre , constantly increasing too , because of the presence of the consumer enabling the farmer to return to the land the refuse of its products ; and with the wonderful yield of green crops , to the extent of fifteen or twenty tons to the acre , produced by the demand for milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from the presence of a large consuming population : whereas , if we then turn to the Report of our Commissioner of Patents , we are equally struck with the fact , that while the wheat lands of Ohio and New York yield now on an average less than twelve bushels to the acre , even that small product tends steadily to decrease , because of the necessity for xv asting on the road , and in distant markets , the manure that should go back on the land ; and that thus there is in operation a constant process of exhaustion , because of the wide distance that in this country intervenes between the producer and the consumer . It may , we think , safely be asserted , that the return to agricultural labor in the well cultivated portion of Great Britain is at least thrice *s great as in this country , and yet even in the former the general result is small compared with what it might be made . Mr. Laing , one of the most intelligent of British travellers , tells us that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , and coolly compare what we see in the best districts farmed in large farms with what we see in the best districts farmed in small farms , 1849. 39 // we see , and there is no blinking the fact , bet*er crops on the ground in Flanders , East Friesland , Holstein , in short , on the whole line of the arable land of equal quality on the continent , from the Sound to Calais , than we see on the line of British coast opposite to this line , and in the same latitudes , from the Firth of Forth all around to Dover . Minute labor , " he continues , " on small portions of arable ground , gives evidently , in equal sorts and climate , a superior productiveness where these small portions belong in property , as in Flanders , Holland , Friesland , and iDitmarsh in Holstein , to the farmer . It is not pretended , " he adds , " by our agricultural writers , that our large farmers , even in Berxvickshire , Roxburghshire , or the Lothians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drainage , and clean state of the land , or in productiveness from a small space of soil not originally rich , which distingu ishes the small farmers of Flanders and their system . " * In confirmation of this we have the statement by Mr. Mechi , one of the guests at the dinner above referred to , that the agriculture of the country was " in a very backward and unsatisfactory state compared with its manufactures , " and that their " agricultural mechanical appliances were rude , costly , and unprofitable . " t Mr. McCulloch gives us the following picture of the progress of English hus-bandry " Considering the wonderful facilities of communication that exist in Great Britain , and the universal diffusion of information by means of the press , the slowness with which agricultural improvements make their way , is not a little surprising . Mr. Harte mentions that when he was a youth , he heard Jethro Tull declare that though he had introduced turnips into the field in King William 's reign , with little trouble or expense , and great success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own estate until after the peace of Utrecht . It might , one should think , be reasonably supposed , that improved practices would now be much more rapidly diffused ; but experience shows that this is not really the case . What is well known and systematically practised in one county , is frequently unknown , or utterly disregarded , in the adjacent districts ; and what is to every un * Notes of a Traveller , by Samuel Laing , p *83 , American edition . j Skinner 's Journal of Agriculture , vol. 3 , P. 430. prejudiced observer evidently erroneous and injurious to the land , is in some quarters persisted in pertinaciously , though a journey of not many miles would open to view the beneficial effects of a contrary practice . " * Ten weeks ' labor of one man , or an expenditure of five pounds per acre , converts , as we see , a machine that produces ten bushels into one yielding fifty bushels to the acre . Let us suppose , however , the addition to be only twenty bushels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of food with that required for obtaining it from Poland , Egypt , or the United States , by aid of the complicated machinery of commerce now in use . If ten weeks ' labor be required for one acre , one thousand weeks would suffice for one hundred acres , and thus the labor of twenty men for one year would produce a machine capable of yielding two thousand bushels of wheat annually ; and that of three hundred men for two years would produce one that would yield sixty thousand bushels ; and if they were working for themselves on their own land , instead of being mere hired laborers , it would be much more . At ten shillings per week , the labor of these three hundred men would be worth ? 15,600 , being far less than the cost of a mill of very ordinary size , to be employed in converting the cotton of India into a form to fit it for re-exportation to that country , by aid of male and female , adult and infant laborers , who must work twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete with the poor Hindoo who obtains for a month 's labor about two rupees , or one dollar . The man who cultivates ten acres of land , his own property , and obtains from it fifty bushels of wheat , or its equivalent , per acre , obtains five hundred bushels for his year 's work . The same labor employed in producing iron or cloth , to be exported in exchange for food , does not produce , on an average , including the share of the owner of the furnace or the mill , more than three bushels per week , or about a hundred and fifty bushels per annum . In the one case labor is applied directly to the production of the commodity that is required ; in the other it is applied indirectly , and we know that " the more direct- * Statistics of the British Empire , vol. i. p. 545 40 Jan. , // The Policy of England and its Results . ly power is applied , the less is the friction and the greater is the effect ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friction increases and power diminishes . " " So , " says Mr. Carey , " is it here . The friction is great , and hence it is that food is high , and that wages are low . In many parts of England , the agricultural laborer has but nine shillings per week , while the ordinary price of wheat is not less than fifty shillings per quarter , and it is frequently more . The laborer has for his week 's work , therefore , hut about a bushel and a quarter , or a bushel and a third per week , for all purposes , and he can accumulate nothing . Throuuhout the United States , the laborer has about seventy-five cents per day , which will not vary materially from the average price of a bushel of wheat ; which would give six bushels as the price of a week 's work . He can , therefore , consume more than the English laborer receices , and still lay up more than half his wages . That he does this is every day seen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not room for the population of the United Kingdom to employ itself in cultivation , and that the withdrawal of labor from manufactures would flood the agricultural labor market . To those who think so , we would recommend a re-perusal of the passage we have extracted from Mr. McCulloch , and also a careful examination of the condition of Ireland . They will then see that in the latter , the best lands , those which require drainage , are uncultivated because of the want of the means of improvement . Even , however , in the former , how wonderfully small is the improvement now being made compared with what might be made were the spirit which animates some few of her landed proprietors to become universal , and with every step in their improvements there would arise a new demand for labor to be applied directly to the work of production . At the dinner above referred to it was stated by a clergyman , that on a piece of land that gave , before it came into his possession , employment to but three and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , must have been poorly paid ; there are now kept in full employment no less than twelve , and their large production enables them to obtain good wages . With every increase in the power of producing food at home , there would be increased demands for labor to be employed in the work of converting the food and the iron ore into iron , and the food and the wool into cloth for the use of the prosperous producers of food , while the power to construct roads and to build houses would grow with the improvement of the land ; for every diminution in the labor of exchanging would be attended with an increase in the quantity that could be given to the work of production . With abundant wealth to be applied to the work of improvement , and with a power to produce food at less cost of labor than any country in the world , except Belgium , Great Britain buys her food abroad , employing in its production the people of Russia and Poland , Egypt and Sicily , being precisely those whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and she pays for this costly food in the labor of men who can not obtain of it in exchauge for a year s services , on an average of years , more than a hundred bushels of wheat , or its equivalei*t . The whole number of occupiers of land , and of agricultural laborers , was given in 1831 at less than two million four hundred thousand , * while the value of agricultural produce , the standard being wheat , at six shillings and threepence or $1.50 per bushel of seventy pounds , was estimated at*155 , OOO , OOO , t or the equivalent of five hundred millions of bushels , a yield which might be doubled with the application of the same labor were the spirit of improvement general throughout the kingdom . Even as it is , the return is equal to an average of about two hundred bushels to each , but it is to be remembered that very many occupiers are not laborers , and that a very considerable portion of the labor of those who are so is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being employed in the work of draining and ditching , road-making , &amp;c. , &amp;c . With this allowance , the return of food per hand may fairly be set down at double that obtained from labor employed in the work of manufacture . Nevertheless , she buys her food abroad when she might produce it at home , and that she may do so she crowds hundreds of thousands of people into closely-built , ill-drained , and ill-ventilated towns , whose * McCulloch 's Statistics of the British Empire , p. 593. 1 Ibid , p.590. 1849. // cellars are filled with starving operatives , who , if they could be employed on the land , would obtain larger and more constantly increasing returns to labor than any others in the world . So employed , they would need neither fleets nor armies for their protection , and taxes might he dispensed with , whereas under the existing system by which the soils of Germany and Russia , of Canada , South Africa , and Australia , are cultivated by the aid of spinning-jennies and power-looms , immense bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are employed in the construction of arms , and of ships and steam vessels , to be employed in protecting the trade and in compelling the colonists to submit to decrees of Parliament regulating the manner in which it shall be carried on with their fellow subjects at home , who are themselves taxed so heavily for the maintenance of those armies and fleets that vast bodies of soldiers and of special constables are required to preserve even the appearance of order in England itself . The average product of labor is but half what it should now be , and of that half a large portion is absorbed by the unceasing demands of the government . The laborer gives much labor for little food , and the owner of land obtains much food for little of either labor or capital , and thus the whole of this unnatural system tends to make the rich richer and the poor poorer . Her constant effort has been to produce an unnatural state of things by which she might tax the world for the support of the fleets and armies by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself has been that of producing an unnatural distribution of her population . The consumers of food  --  the people employed in the work of converting raw materials into cloths and hardware , and those employed in the work of transportation and exchangehave borne too large a proportion to the producers of food , and hence has arisen that dependence on the proceedings of distant nations that is now held to be the very perfection of a sound political economy . Its effect under the most favorable circumstances , is that of increasing the difficulty of obtaining the necessaries of life , for the price of all is dependent upon the cost of obtaining that last small por tion which is produced in Russia and Poland at the cost of much labor , and which then requires a large additional quantity for the performance of the work of transportation from the banks of the Vistula , or the shores of the Black Sea , to the neighborhood of the consumer in Manchester or Birmingham . Its effects , under unfavorable circumstances , we are now witnessing . The smallest disturbance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , been attended with the closing of mills , attended with distress and misery among the operatives , the necessary consequence of which has been a diminution rather than increase in the habit of care and economy necessary to enable them to provide against a recurrence of such a state of things . With another throw of the political dice , the demand for cloth and iron has increased , and with it the demand for laborers , who have invariably manifested a disposition for turbulence exactly proportioned to the servility with which they sought employment in the gloomy state of things from which they had just emerged . Now , however , a crisis in the foreign trade of England seems to have arrived , and what is to be the result nr one can tell . All Europe is in commotion , and the market on the continent for her products is almost destroyed . The West Indies are in a state of utter ruin . For years past , the trade with India has been a gambling one , in which the losses have been immense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept away within the present year . The demand for the products of her mills and her furnaces has so greatly diminished , that her exports for the first six months of the present year fell off about a million sterling per month , or at the rate of nearly sixty millions of dollars for the whole year ; and that notwithstanding the vast increase in the export to this country consequent upon our adoption of that most ruinous measure , the tariff of 1846 . For a year past , this country has been her sole resource ; but if , as we hope and trust will be the case , the tariff of 1842 be re-enacted in the course of the next session of Congress , we shall then be enabled to see in full perfection the results of a system which drires men from the labor of the field to the workshop , with a view to compel the agricul 42 Jan. , // turist of all other countries to use the machinery of England when they would nrefer to use their own , having the shoemaker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food produced by the man who desires to wear the shoes . The disciple of Mr. Maithus would tell us that the poverty and wretchedness now existing in every part of the United Kingdom are the natural results of the great principle of population , and that as man always increases more rapidly in number than food can be increased in quantity , starvation is the necessary consequence of the rapid increase of population that has taken place in Great Britain during the last half century ; and he will persist in this assertion despite the well known fact that the consumption of food per bead is now probably six times greater than it was when the population numbered but two millions ; * and despite the universal fact that when men are poor and scattered food is always obtained with difficulty , while with increasing population the facility of obtaining it is always increased . In no country of continental Europe is population so dense as it is in Belgium , and in none does the laborer obtain as much food in return for the same quantity of labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results .

When Sicily , and Egypt , and Africa abounded in population , they were the granaries of Rome , but with each step in the diminution of their respective populations , their powers of production have been seen to diminish in a still more rapid ratio , and the scattered people that now remain have little to consume and less to spare . The true cause of the present and probable future difficulty of England , may be found in the fact that her policy has tended to compel her subjects in Ireland and in all her colonies throughout the world , as well as the people of other nations , to do that which they would not naturally do , in sending the food and the wool to the spindle and the loom , instead of bringing those simple and inexpensive machines to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them has been that of preventing the natural concentration of man by aid of which labor is rendered more productive , and of causing the exhaustion of the land they cultivated , and thereby increasing the difficulty of producing the commodities for the supply of which England was thus rendering herself dependent upon them . She has exhausted every country that was dependent upon her , and the state of exhaustion that she now herself exhibits is but the necessary consequence of this great error of her policy . Her day of power is past.
