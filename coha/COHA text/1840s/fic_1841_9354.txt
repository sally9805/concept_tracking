JOB AND HIS CHILDREN Joseph M. Field , playwright , actor , manager , reporter , editor , " colyumist , " packed into the forty-six years of his life a variety of theatrical experience . Born in Dublin in 1810 , Field came from an old Warwickshire ancestry , of which the Elizabethan playwright , Nathaniel Field , was the most famous member . Brought to the United States at the age of two , Joseph Field began his theatrical career at seventeen , on the stage of Boston 's Tremont Theatre in November 1827 . In the ensuing twenty-nine years he wrote or adapted a score of plays , appeared as an actor in many different cities , owned and managed a theatre in Saint Louis , operated a newspaper there , and gained temporary fame as a writer of humorous stories and articles for the New Orleans Picayune . Field 's career coincides with the rapid westward movement of the theatre in his generation . As early as 1830 he spent at least part of the summer on the stage of the old Salt House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans , Mobile , Montgomery , Cincinnati , Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York , and Boston saw his performances , and gave him a contemporary reputation especially in eccentric comedy rles . His own comedies and farces were closely associated with his career as an actor . The practice of employing guest stars for short engagements kept Field traveling much of the time . In the years 1835 and 1836 , for example , he acted first at Montgomery , Ala. , then went to Saint Louis for six weeks , returning , with stops in Cincinnati and Baltimore , to New York . After a brief appearance at the Park Theatre in September , he went to New Orleans for the winter . Within less than a year he had again spent a brief season in Saint Louis , and had returned to Mrs. Hamblin 's Theatre in New York by early August 1836 . If there is any one place especially to be associated with the name of J. M. Field , it is Saint Louis . In cooperation with those two pioneers of the western theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his best efforts . Several of his plays were first produced at the Saint Louis theatre . With his brother Matthew ( also , for a brief time , an actor ) and Mr. Charles Keemle , he published a paper , The Reveille , in Saint Louis , beginning in May 1844 . Important in Saint Louis theatrical history is Field 's Varieties Theatre , operated from May 1852 to the end of the year 1853 . But through these same years Field spent occasional seasons in Mobile , New Orleans , Philadelphia , and New York . He wrote poems and humorous articles for a New Orleans Picayune column , over the signature , " Straws , " in 1839 and 1840 . The Picayune sent him abroad as a foreign correspondent the next year . Upon his return , he spent several months at a time as a member of the company at Mitchell 's Olympic Theatre ( New York ) , at the Chatham , the Park , the Walnut Street Theatre ( Philadelphia ) , and later at the Chestnut Street Theatre ( Philadelphia ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York ) . At Mitchell 's Olympic in 1842 he received the top salary of twenty-five dollars a week , plus one-third of the receipts of one benefit , on the condition that Mitchell have title to any new plays Field might write . Early in his career he tried almost any rle . In one season ( 1837 ) he played Richard III , Macbeth , Lear , Othello , Hamlet , Iago , Prince Hal , Orlando , Benedick , Sir Giles Overreach , and Hastings ( Jane Shore ) . These rles were played in Saint Louis and other provincial theatres , where Field was a star . He established his reputation as an actor , particularly in the East , not with these rles , but upon his interpretation of comic characters , to which he soon gave his full attention . Most of these comic parts were in ephemeral farces and comedies , but he was especially admired in the rle of Sir Benjamin Backbite . Except for the Picayune articles and The Reveille , Field 's only published works were two volumes of prose sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar of Jurytown and Other Stories ( 1847 ) . None of his plays was ever published , and the only one known to be in existence is the recently discovered Job and His Children , appearing in this volume . The following list supplies , in order of original production , all the plays that may safely be assigned to Field . Authorship of the first play in the list is the most doubtful , for if both Odell and Carson ( The Theatre on the Frontier ) are to be accepted , Field acted at the Park Theatre in New York and at the Salt House in Saint Louis at the same time .

Griselda ; or , The Patient Woman ( from a German play by Waldauer ) . Chestnut ( Phila . ) , October 23 , 1854 . Metropolitan ( N.Y. ) , November 27 , 1854 . Ludlow says that Field wrote the successful burlesque of the popular La Bayadere , The Maid of Casimere , entitled Buy It , Dear ! T is Made of Cashmere , first produced on March 16 , 1843 ; but Odell assigns this play to Horncastle , and its first production to November 2 , 1840 . Although Ludlow appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more plays which might be assigned to Field , could their authorship be determined . Of the plays listed , The Artful Dodger was the most popular . Family Ties won a five-hundred dollar prize given by Danforth Marble for the best Yankee play , but it was none the less a failure . The plays perhaps averaged ten to fifteen performances each . For the curious reader , the most regrettable loss is Victoria , in which the Queen and James Gordon Bennett were the chief characters , supported by the Duke of Wellington , the Duchess of Kent , and Prince John Van Buren ! It seems safe to say that Field was a better actor than playwright or theatrical manager . His managerial career included the seasons of 1850 and 1851 at Mobile , after which he ventured on his own responsibility in opening Field 's Varieties Theatre in Saint Louis , on May 10 , 1852 . This theatre , accommodating nearly twelve hundred people , was located on the south side of Market Street , between Fifth and Sixth Streets . It survived less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a shrewd manager . After abandoning his experiment in December 1853 , Field spent the fall season of 1854 in the East , and then went to the theatre in Mobile , where he remained until his death , on January 28 , 1856 . He was survived by his wife , Eliza Riddle , a popular actress whom he had married in Saint Louis in November 1837 , and by a daughter , Mary Katherine Keemle Field . In later years , under the name of Kate Field , his daughter became a well-known lecturer-entertainer , and the editor of a political paper , Kate Field 's Washington . From accounts of Field 's plays , it seems pretty certain that Job and His Children was one of its author 's rare attempts at serious drama . It involves a sentimental plot of the stern parent and the disobedient daughter , whose reconciliation occurs after a series of complications and misunderstandings . Job and His Children was first produced by Field at his own Varieties Theatre , and was later produced in Mobile . The manuscript seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chippendale ( whose autograph it bears ) , and it was he who played the part of Job . It was discovered in the possession of a book dealer in New Brunswick , New Jersey , from whom it was purchased by Mr. Barrett H. Clark . For additional information concerning Field , see especially N. M. Ludlow 's Dramatic Life As I Found It , W. G. B. Carson 's The Theatre on the Frontier , and Lilian Whiting 's Kate Field , A Record . A portrait of J. M. Field appears on page 438 of the third volume of Odell 's Annals of the New York Stage .

Melissa Well , after you left and Hampden got the farm , with Grandfather Job it was neglect on neglect , yet he never uttered a word of complaint . At last , news came of your loss , and then the old man never spoke at all . He did n't weep or complain , but seemed to go about in a dream , and then they treated him worse and worse , and now they say he 's crazy , and if Heaven is merciful , he is so , for who can speak his misery if he 's not ? Faith weeps on Milton 's breast Milt . Milton Trice Poor Faith , be calm . And this unnatural Hampden . Oby . Oby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm 's worth three times what it was , besides this landin ' at the Cove . And then he 's an elder and a selectman .
