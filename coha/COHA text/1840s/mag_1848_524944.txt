txt FROM the formation of the first system of society , the subjects which fall wjthin the province of political philosophy have employed the most powerful intellects of all nations . But though illustrated by the liveliest genius and the profoundest reflection , they have not until a very recent period assumed even the forms of science . We can not tell what formulae of economical truth passed from existence in the lost books of Aristotle : the father of the peripatetic philosophy undoubtedly brought to public economics the severe method which enabled him to construct so much of the everlasting science of which the history goes back to his times ; but whatever direction he gave to the subject , by the investigation of its ultimate principles and their phenomena , his successors , and the writers upon it since the revival of learning , have generally been guided by empirical laws , which in an especial degree ht*ve obtained in regard to the economy of commerce . Scarcely any of the literature or reflection upon the subject has gone behind the bold but entirely unsupported hypotheses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as th' fanciful systems of the universe that were swept from existence by the demonstrations of Newton . Not only have economical systems generally been woven of unproven hypotheses , but they have rarely evinced any such clear apprehension and constructive ability as are essential in the formation and statement of principles ; and down to the impenetrable chaos of Mr. Mill 's last cumbrous octavos , t there is scarcely a volume on political economy which rewards the wearied attention with any more than a vague under standing of the shadowy design that existed in the author 's brain . In the eminently original and scientific work before us , we see economy subjected to the fundamental and ultimate methods of investigation of which the results have a mathematical certainty . We have new facts , new reasoniags , new deductions ; and if the paramount ideas are not entirely original , they are discovered by original processes , and their previous existence is but an illustration of the truth that the *n stinctive perspicacity of the common mind often surpasses the logical faculty in cognizing laws before they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a distinguished place among our philosophical and political writers .

Mr. Colton has not rejected the title of " political economy " because he proposed to enter a different field , or because the subject and argument have no relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so much abused in this country by the rude agitation of what are commonly called politics , that he does not think the word now used with us comports with the dignity of the theme ; and the second part of his title is adopted from a conviction that the economical principles of states are to be deduced from their separate experience and adapted to their individual condition . The task which he proposed to himself is , the exhibition of the merits of the Protective and Free Trade Systems as they appiy to the United Stales . He expresses at the outset his opinion that the settlement of the question he debates is one of the most desirable , and will be one of the most important results which remain to be achieved in the progress of the country ; and we can assure him that the accomplishment of it will be rewarded by the best approval of these times , and an enduring name . The second chapter of Mr. Colton 's work is devoted to a statement of the New Points which it embraces . By new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely original , though many of them are so ; but that on account of the importance of the positions he has assigned them , as compared with the positions they occupy in other works of the kind , they are entitled to be presented as new . Many of them involve fundamental and all-pervading principles , that have not hitherto appeared in speculations upon the subject , but which are destined hereafter to have an important influence in its discussion . Some of the most prominent of these points are : I. His definition of Public Economy , that it is the application of knowledge derived from experience to a given position , to given interests , and to given institutions , of an independent state or nation , for the increase of public or private wealth . II . That Public Economy has never yet been reduced to a science , and that the propositions of which it has been for the most part composed , down to this time , are empirical laws . III . That the propositions relating to the minor questions in debate have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experimental induction . IV . That labor is capital , and the parent of all other capital . V. That protective duties in the United States are not taxes , and that a protective system rescues the country from an enormous system of foreign taxation . VI . That different states of society require a corresponding adaptation of the systems of public economy to each . VII . That popular and general education is a fundamental element of public economy . VIII . There are new points on the subject of money and a monetary system , which are regarded by the author as vital and fundamental in public economy , and exhibited under new and impressive aspects . IX . That freedom is a thing of commercial value . X. That protection as opposed to free trade is identified with freedom , and with the principle of the American revolution .. XI . That the history of freedom for centuries , for all time , shows it to be identical with protection . XII . That the American revolution is the opening of a new era in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the struggles after freedom . XLII . The history of the rise and progress of the free trade hypothesis is made a point of importance , and of much interest and instruction . XIV . The interests of the American . people are represented as necessarily wedded to the protective principle , and the masses who have been for a time sedi*ced by the deceptive promises of free trade , are supposed to be after protection under fia*l* colors . XV . The different cost of moner and labor in the United States , as compared with their cost in the countries with which we trade , is made the foundation of the necessity of a protective system ; and this necessity is averred to be the resuI* of the 1848. 143 // organization of society on freedom principles . XVI . That the destiny of freedom is but imperfectly nchi*ved , and is contingent on a protective system . XVII . That an American commercial system , adapted to this end , is required . XVII . That the principle of free trade is identical with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world which are most free , require protection against those which are less so , because the sole object of protection is to maintain and fortify freedom . XX . The great amount of agricultural products and labor which go forth in the form of manufactures , is made a distinct point of , to show how necessary manufactures are to an agricultural country , and how it is impoverished by allowing itself to be dependent on other countries for its manufactured products . XXI . That public economy differs from private , not in principle , but in the comprehensiveness of its interests ; and that there can not be two kinds of economy , any more than two kinds of honesty . We have not stated these new points either in the order or in the form in which they appear in the work itself ; nor have we given all of them ; but these are sufficient to show , that the author has extended his views much beyond the common range , not to say that he has gone more profoundly than most writers into the rationale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author himself on some of the points above specified , and perhaps on others . Itis in the discussion of these propositior*s that Mr. Colton evinces his highest poweiu ; and while the reader will understand that little justice can be done either to the propositions or to the arguments by which they are maintained , in so brief an article as this - er indeed within less space than the close-thinking andterse-writing author himself devotes to them-he will be instructed by the hasty abstract whi.h we shall make of so much of the work as relates to them most directly and forcibly . In regard to the firsf point , it will be conceded that in all investigations of this sort , definitions comprehend or suggest the scope and laws of argument , and are indispensable to its perspicuous and satisfactory conduct . In offering this definitiona fruit of the reflection of years-Mr . Colfon makes the following observations : " We have tried our best to tolerate the introduction of the term , science , into this definition , as the substantive part of it , in accordance with general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;c. ; and we do not repudiate the idea that science is implied in it , or that it is a proper subject of science . But we are forced to deny , that , as yet , the subject has ever been reduced to a science , and that down to this time , it has any otherTorm ofa system than a collection of what the logicians call empirical laws . If it shall be admitted that we have contributed , in any degree , so to sift these empirical laws , and so to adjust them in a scientific form , as to subject them to recognized canons of experimental induction , as we propose to attempt to do , still our definition stands in a form not inconsistent with the definition of a science ; and though we fail in our proposed task , the purpose of our definition is not impaired . Its terms indicate sufficiently the class of sciences among which it must take rank , if it is deemed worthy to be called a science . It is a science composed of contingent propositions-contingent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar institutions of the country to which its rules are applied at any given time , and contingent on the changes , in these particulars , to which that country may be subject in the succession of events . It will be seen , therefore , that our definition is a new point , and that it rescues the whole subject , entirely , from the position which has been claimed for it by the Free-Trade economists , as a science of uniform propositions-uniform for all countries and for all times . Every person must see , that one of the essential attributes of Free Trade is the uniformity of its propositions for all nations , and that any departure in a system of public economy from such uniformity , is not Free Trade , but a violation of its principles . The poles of a planet , therefore , can not be wider apart , nor the heavens farther from the earth , than the main position of these two antagonistical systems . The propositions of the one are the same for all nations , in all time , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , and institutions of the country to which they are applied for the time being . * * * * * * * " It will be observed , that we have not only departed from usage , in our definition of public economy , by denominating it the application of knowledge derived from experience , instead of callihg it a science ; but that we require a given position , given interests , and given institutions , of a state or nation , in order to know how to make the application . The very terms of our definition , therefore , take the whole subject from the determinate and immutable laws of Free Trade , and place it on what may be 144 Aug. , // called a contingent basis , itself subject to a variety ofcontingencies . In Free Trade , we have only to understand its propositions , and then we know what they prove , or pretend to prove . But in our theory of public economy , we consult facts , experience , under a given state of things , in order to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead ; in our system , they follow . In the former , the propositions determine results , or affect to do so ; in the latter , facts , by their practical operation , determine the propositions , because they determine results . In the former case , the theory , or , rather , the hypothesis , is first , and the results are hypothetical ; in the latter , the theory is last , and is made to depend on the facts . Our theory , therefore , is not one of propositions , formed irrespective of facts , but a theory grow ingoutof facts . * * * * " It will also be seen , that , from our definition , as a starting point , the field of public economy opened by it is entirely new . It is not the world , it is not all nations , it is not any two nations ; but it is one nation in particular . The law of the definition necessarily brings the subject within these limits . This imparts an entirely new character to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; it is a particular case . It is a system of public economy for the United States alone , which we are required to frame . It has been shown above , that it is not possible to construct one for all nations , nor even for two . All pretensions of this kjnd are utterly baseless , and can do nothing but evil so far as they are influential . " Under the second point above specified , our author says " Both *ie novelty and importance of the position here taken , demand some exposition . If it be well authorized , true in fact , for the purpose we have in view , it can not be too well understood . When Free Trade economists have arrogated the high and dignified title of a science for their theme , one naturally asks , what sort of a science is it ? In what is its artificial structure apparent ? Where are the principles and rules by which we arrive at infallible conclusions ? A science , well and truly formed , can predict results with certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and any pretension of this kind that fails in its predictions , is thereby proved false . Have the laws of public economy ever yet been so adjus*d as to produce this result ? Manifestly not . If they had , all the world would have known it , and there would be no controversy . ' The truth is , the whole subject still remains a wide field of empirical laws , not entirely useless , but yet unadjusted as to scientific order and relations , having not the slightest claim to the dignity of a science . If any should think we have failed in our classification of the laws of public economy , in their historical condition down to this time , as being empirical , let them tell us under what category of dogmas they should be ranked ; or Jet them say , if they choose , that they do not all belong to this class . We are not tenacious on that point . We only say , they have never yet been reduced to a science . That is evident , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no uncertainty " in figures , in mathematics , in geometry , in astronomy , or in the physical sciences generally , so far as their respective domains have been explored ; nor is there uncertainty in any science , the elements of which have been ascertained and adjusted in scientific order and rela*-tions . There can be none . It is the very nature of science to realize its predictions . We do not affirm confidently , that all the dogmas which ever have been uttered on public economy , will fall within the logician 's definition of empirical laws : but we think they will generally be found there ; nor can we conceive how a more respectable rank could fairly be assigned to them . It is not simply for the convenience of classification , that we have put them there ; but because we could not find a more legitimate place . " Now , let us consider what the characteristic of an empirical law is , as presented in the above citation , from John Stuart Mill : The property of being unfit to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circumstance , in which the observations have been made . ' It may not always be so good as this ; but it can not be better . It must be seen , therefore , that it entirely cuts off the generalizations of Free Trade , and falls directly in the line of our definition . No law of public economy can be safely trusted except for the time , place , and circumstance , in which the observations have been made ; ' that is , the observations which have established the law . The principle necessarily restricts every system of public economy to one nationto that nation where the observations that have dictated its laws , have been made . Within these limits empirical laws may be serviceable , and by proper attention may be reduced to a science . For a wider range it is not possible that a science should be made of them on this subject . In the language of Mr. Mill , it is not simply absurd , but abstractedly impossible . ' " From under the third head , where the recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the author professes to have constructed his general argument , we make the following extracts " We for a long time thought that public economy never could be made a science in the 1848. 145 // strict sense of the term . But that position can hardly be maintained , if it be allowed that everything is a subject of science , and capable of being brought into its place as such ; and if , moreover , it be considered , that it is a part of science to adapt itself to the nature of the subject . A science of contingent propositions , for aught that can be seen , is as supposable as one of uniform and immutable propositions . The propositions of public economy , as we bold , must necessarily change with a change of data ; and it can not be denied , that such changes are constantly transpiring in every commonwealth . It will be found that this principle of a liability to a change of data , presents itself on the threshold , and that it lies at the foundation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aside , or turn the back upon it , with any hope of a successful investigation , or useful result . A public measure required at one time , may , by events , or even by its own operation in the complete fulfilment of its purpose , require to be modified , or suspended , or superseded , at a subsequent period ; and the same measure may be of the greatest importance to one nation , which would be injurious to another , possibly to all others . Nothing can be more contingent than the propositions of public economy . * * * " It must be admitted , that nothing is more desirable , in public economy , than that the certainties of science should be brought to bear upon it ; and nothing is more evident than that , hitherto , they have never been so directed . The reasons are obvious , as shown in our citations , here and there , from Mr. Mill . It was impossible that a science on this subject should be constructed out of the common experience of nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one nation for the use of another . It is orgy in the line of the experience of one nation that the rigid principles of such a science can be applied , and for that nation only . All beyond this field is a region of empirical laws , as before shown ; and of that precise category of empirical laws , which are utterly incapable of being reduced to a science . " In the chapter devoted to labor , one of the longest and strongest of the work , besides piesenting his subject in many novel aspects , Mr. Colton avers that heretofore labor has occupied a false position in systems of public econ*rny , and that a vast amount of doctrinal and practical error has been the result ; in short , that , as labor is so important and all-pervading an element in public economy , any system which does not give to labor its true position , must necessarily be vitiated to its core and foundation . " Labor , " says Mr. Colton " Labor is capital , primary and fundamental . The position which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to what is called capital , as if labor were not capital , and capital of the most important kind , has tended to degrade labor , and to strip it of its essential attributes as the producer of all adventitious wealth , or of that state of things which distinguishes civilized society from barbarism , it has also tended to cloud one ofth e most important branches of public economy in obscurity , and led to much embarrassment in the consideration of others . The natural order of things is thus reversed ; that which ought to be first , is put last ; the cause stands in place of the effect ; the agent is taken for the instrument ; the producer for the thing produced . " Although it will be convenient in this work , in order to avoid frequent repetition and unnecessary circumlocution , to employ the customary phrase , capital and labor , in the usual sense , it is due to a just consideration of the comparative claims of these two things , to assert the prior and paramount rights of labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of public economy . Labor is capital of its own kind , not as a subject to be acted upon for the increase of its own value , but as an agent that imparts value to every other kind of capital which it creates , or which , after having created , it employs as an instrument , or takes in hand for improvement . It is doubtless true , that the faculties or powers of labor are subjects of culture and use , for the increase of their skill and effectiveness ; and in this sense are subjects of action for the increase of their value . In this particular , the faculties or powers of labor occupy the position of any other kind of capital , as subjects of improvement by labor itself . It will be observed , however , that it is not labor , but the faculty of labor , the value of which is thus increased . " European economists , for the most part , if not universally , regard labor as a mere power , like horse-power , or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school mean by the proportion of the whole produce of the earth allotted ' to labor , is simply that which is necessary for its subsistence , as for that of a horse , an ox , or any other brute . The three chief elements of public economy , as taught by Smith , Ricardo , and others of the same school , are rent , profit and wages . ' It must be seen that a system of public economy , constructed on such principles , is entirely unsuited to American society ; and though its doctrines in the abstract may often be correct , its whole must be totally inapplicable to a state of things radically , fundamentally , and essentially different from that for which such a system is designed . It was morally impossible , from the social position of these economists , that they should be able to adapt a system of public economy to American society , not having thought 146 // it incumbent on themselves to make any other provision for labor , than to save it from starvation , and to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does out of his ox or his horse ; and believing , as they do , that system the best which will secure this end most effectually . There can be no redeeming quality with Americans , for a system of public economy , one of the fundamental principles of which is of this kind , pervading it throughout , imparting its charac-* ter to it , and constituting a part of its very essence . The three words , rent , profit , and wages , ' in the sense in which they are employed by Smith and his school , as representing the three comprehensive parts of their system , are sufficiently declaratory of its character , and look back to a feudal state of society . The things here intended are not to be found in this country , and are not tolerated by its institu tions. * * * * * * " Labor-capital is the parent of all other capital . Other capital is chiefly , if not altogether , the creature of civilization , though the same thing , in substance , may be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public economy , it is regarded as one of the things receiving its definite form and measure from the hand of civil polity . It will be found , indeed , that the entire structure of civilization o*ves its existence to labor , and of course those parts of it which derive their tangible value from its forms , and which are regulated by them . Civilization itself is secondary and ministerial , in relation to all the capital which labor creates , and comes in to define and protect it . It was in part the value of these products of labor which made civilization necessary , that it might receive a definite form , and be made secure . No man can apply his hand or point his finger to a thing regarded as capital , which is not the product of labor . All intrinsic values are but fictions of the imagination , always imapalpable , vanishing as they are approached . The diamond and the pebble are of equal value in the eye of the barbarian , and would be equivalents in every other eye , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , which is able to purchase the diamond at a high price . We do not , however , mean to say , that it is improper , or without significance , to use the terms , intrinsic value . They are employed in this work in the usual sense , and are pertinent when so used , because they represent a practical idea . It will be found , however , that this value is entirely the product of labor ; and this conclusion may be justified by the doctrines of all the economists worthy of respect . * * * * " Labor , in its true position , defines human rights , without a word , and men will scarcely fail to recognize them , while it remains there . But , when thrust out of place , into a false position , and chained to slavery ; when it is made to occupy this position in all the systems of public economy most in vogue in the world , it is no wonder that men who are entitled , and who ought , to be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proclaims a great truth , the consequences of which are stupendous , when carried out to all its legitimate results , in a system of public economy , morally and socially considered , as well as commercially  --  and more especially in the former aspects . " The rocking of the cradle of American independence , jostled into one those distinctive elements on which the Free-Trade economists have founded their system . It broke down the barriers of classes , which form the peculiar features of that system , and the doctrine was then proclaimed , that all men are born free and equal . ' As before , more especially from that time , this nation became a community of working men , in whose eyes labor is an honor ; and he who does not work , is the exception to the general rule . Labor , therefore , in the United States , occupies an elevated , influential , honorable position . It is not the man that lives by work , but the man that lives without work , that is looked upon with disrespect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , has far less consideration than he , who , though equally able to live without work , devotes him self to some useful pursuit . * * * " Labor , work , is the spirit , the genius of the American people . It was so from the beginning by necessity ; it became a fixed habit of the community ; and has ever been a p art of the morale of the country . It is a grand pol itical element ; it was born of a great political exigency ; it was nourished in a political cradle ; it graduated into matihood with political honors ; it made with its own hajids , and has ever worked , the machinery of the political commonwealth ; it lies at the foundation of the social edifice , pervades the entire structure , and its escutcheon stands out in bold relief from the pediment . And is this the thing , the element , the power , that is to content itself with the position and the doom of the third class enumerated , defined , and described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be expressed by Adam Smith and others , as seen in the citations from them , without a picture drawn from slavery . * * * * * * * " It shotild be observed that labor is never in perident , when it has no alternatiie ; that is , when it is not strong enough in its own position to accept or reject the wages offered to it in any given case , if unsatisfactory , and when , in such a case , it can not turn away , and live and prosper . When it can do this , it not only has a voice in its wages , but the parties in contract , the employer and the employed , stand on a footing of equality . This principle is equally applicable to the producer of commodities of any description , as the proprietor of a farm , workshop , or any other producing establishment , over which he presides , and where , per1848. 147 // haps , he labors with his own hands , as to him who works for hire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States as an independent nation , when labor was not in this sense an independent agent-when it could not reject an unsatisfactory offer , and yet live . It is not pretended that labor has been able to dictate its own terms . That would be equally improper and unjust , as for the employer to do it . But it has always had an alternative . *As a last resort the American laborer can at any time go to the backwoods His independence is never necessarily sacrificed . * * * * " In the light of this contrast , the condition of European and other foreign labor is one of absolute bondage . In the first place , it is for the most part deprived of all political influence . This is the primary cause of its misfortunes . In the next place , and also for the most part , it has no voice in its wages . There is no alternative left to it . It must work for what is offered , and work hard , or perish in want ; and the wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare subsistence , as to be often insufficient for that . In all those countries , labor is the agent of power . Power dictates its wages , controls it , enslaves it ; and it needs but a little reflection , in connection with what has already been said , to see that this difference is immense , and immensely important . " But we must resist the temptation to farther extracts from this interesting chapter , to pass to the fifth point as we have specified them , which in fact contains two of the most important to be found in the work , occupying two chapters replete with facts , statistics , and argument . We refer to the positions , that protective duties are not taxes , and that they are besides a rescue from an enormous system of foreign taxation . It must be admitted that this 1 ) ornt established in the first case , would be enough to settle the controversy between free trade and protection . We can not begin to do justice to these chapters by citations . They must be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be appreciated . They are overwhelmingly convincing , and leave little to be said . It has been so generally conceded , and it is so easy and nati*ral to believe , that protective duties are taxes , that an argument to prove the contrary will occasion surprise . It will be yet more surprising , when the subject comes to be understood , that the free trade argument on this point had ever received the slightest credence . But not content with this achievement - not a small one certainly-Mr . Colton has marched boldly into a field yet more entirely new , with an array of figures and facts , to demonstrate a system of foreign taxation , under free trade , which is not only immense , but amazing . It is to be hoped that these two chapters , so new and strong as they are , will not only be appreciated , but that they will produce their proper effect . With these remarks we leave them , as the argument , in either case , can not be broken up without injustice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and which is the tenth of the work , entitled , " The different states of society in Europe and America , require different systems of public economy , " will naturally be appreciated by this title . Like other distinct lines of argument in this work , it is replete with fact , and characterized by skill and energy . The fallacies , not to say the atrocities of the doctrine of the Adam Smith school , as it relates to this point , are here laid bare to observation , and the Malthusian theory is scattered as with a thunderbolt . We cite the following passages on this point " Mr. Malthus 's theory of population , which is generally respected in Europe , particularly in Great Britain , explains all this . He thinks men multiply faster than there is room , work , and food for them ; that the masses will fight against each other for employment to support life ; that landlords , and all capitalists , may rely on this natural strife , among laborers , in bidding for the lowest wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from this theory , it may be assumed that the natural increase of the human family is not a blessing , but a curse , to the majority of the race ; and that the masses are doomed by Providence to degradation , to a state of serfdom or slavery , to want and wretchedness , without hope or possibility of relief . " Rather than be guilty of this libel on Providence -- it is indeed a very grave and impious one-it would have been much more consistent with Christian piety , and with the Christian doctrine of morals , it may be said more philosophical , to assume a defect in society . It is shocking to ascribe such a want of wisdom and goodness to the Creator ! Mr. Malthus supplies in theory what was wanted to sustain the practice of the European world , to wit , the hopeless degradation and misery of the masses ; and the European economists of the Free-Trade school , assume the fact as a postulate , putting it in the place of one of the foun 148 Aug. , // dation-stones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly  --  to make it visible , prominent , staring out in the face of man and of heaven . This theory , recognized and reduced to practice in society , is an insuperable bar , a yoke that can not be broken , an iron despotism over the masses of mankind . * * * " It may , therefore , be assumed as a fact , involving a fundamental element in the system of the Free-Trade economists , and pervadir* every part of it , that the masses of mankind are to be regarded as mere working machines for the benefit of the few , with no other cost than to be kept in the best working order . Such an element of public economy , lying at the foundation of a system , being as one to three of the capital parts , stops nowhere in its influence and control over the various subdivisions and ramifications of that system . The only thing that remains the same , is , the position , the necessity , the hopeless doom of this working machine. ** One more extract from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which Adam Smith , Ricardo and Say wrote , is found in the United States , and it would not be tolerated here for a moment . It is , indeed , that very state of things that was forsworn in the American Revolution , and against which the new government , institutions , and laws , set up at that epoch , and afterward matured and permanently established , were expressly framed to guard , and guard forever , with jealous care , that they should never obtain footing again on American soil . This new and reformed state of society , commonly and not inaptly called republicanism , rejects with indignation and scorn the idea of those relations which constitute th%basis of the system of Smith , Ricardo , Say , M'Culloch , and others of that school . It was natural enough , it may be said it was necessary , at least apparently unavoidable , that they should take such premises as they were furnished with , on which to erect their edifice . It is evident what those premises were , because they are distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system built upon such premises , must correspond with them . But the American system is directly the opposite of this . There is no resemblance in the premises , and none in the structure raised upon them , if it be properly built . " In the chapters on " Education . as an element of public economy in the United States , " the seventh head as enumerated by us , is opened another rich field of argument , where our author is not less at home than elsewhere . We present the following extracts " It need not be said , that the intelligence and virtue of the people depend upon education . It remains to show , in what respects , and how far , education becomes an element of public economy in the United States . We are not prescribing rules for European or other foreign nations . The withholding or lack of popular education among them-for it is the education of the people generally of which we speak-may be as necessary to their theory of society , as the enjoyment of it is to ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be constantly borne in mind , that Adam Smith and his school have adapted their system of public economy to the state of society with which they were surrounded , and not to that which exists among us . It is impossible , under their system , that general education should prevail-as much so as that it should prevail among slaves . There is no provision for it . It is the bare subsistence only of those who do the labor of society which they have provided for . In the first place , they have not a democratic state of society ; next , they do not propose to have it ; thirdly , they make no calculation for it ; and lastly , as the working classes , under their system , have little or nothing to do with government , their education is not deemed important . On the contrary it is systematically suppressed , because it is reckoned dangerous . It must be seen , therefore , that the condition of society in the United States , in these particulars , is diametrically opposite . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country from Europe-especially those from Great Britainwere men of intelligence and strong virtue . Many of them were persons of as high culture , and of as much chivalry of character , as anjr that were left behind them . It may be sai that they were men of the strongest character of the times that produced them ; and those who followed in their train were men of the same stamp . The motives of emigration then were of a high and social character , and not such as now pour upon this continent the floods of European paupers and culprits . It was mind of the highest order which could not endure the chains of European despotism , and which came here for freedom . Th* object of their coming , and the qualifications which fitted them for the enterprise , are directly in point of the argument in which we are now engaged . It was their high culture and eminent virtues which enabled them to lay the foundation of that stupendous system of political society and of public economy , which has subsequently and gradually grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , and the means which they ordained to secure it , were schools and religion , education and the virtues of Christianity . The history of the colonies , from the earliest settlements , down to the Revolution and establishment of American independence , is replete with proof of this assertion . 1848. 149 // There arose , therefore , from the first , a state of society not before known in Europe or elsewhere-a republican or democratic society , in which there were no uneducated classes , and no laboring classes which did not comprehend the whole community . All went to school , and all worked when old enough ; and or1 no point were the people more thoroughly educated than on the principles of free government . The oppressions of the old world drove out its own sons from its own bosom , and under its own charters , to set up a school , which must necessarily , in a course of time , subvert its authority , and become independent , because the emigrants brought away all that was good , and left behind all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society were all healthy , and full of infant purity . While the old world , from a vitiated and decrepit constitution , tended to decay , the new , purged of parental diseases , sprung up with giant strides , to giant vigor . Instead of the old leaven of European economists , that intellectual and moral culture belongs only to the higher classes , and that the working classes require nothing but bare subsistence like cattle , schools were provided for all-all were educated-trained to knowledr*e and virtue as a preparation for the working time of life . It was a republican or democratic state of society from the first , and continued to be such , till the struggle arose between the colonies and the mother-country , which resulted in American independence . * * * * * The system of common schools , early set up in this country , coeval indeed with American civilization , handed down from generation to generation , provided for as the first care of the state , watched over with paternal solicitude , nurtured , endowed , edified , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficiency , is the cradle of those chances of which we speak . On this broad foundation , common to all , has been erected a system of select and higher schools , up to the college and university , which are also within the reach of all , by reason of a system of public economy , which it is our special purpose in this chapter to notice ; not , indeed , so much within the reach of all , as the common schools , but yet not excluding any , nor presenting insuperable obstacles to any . The poorest and meanest born of the land , prompted by innate ambition , and developing hopeful talent , can , and do often , pass through all the stages *f education , from the common school till they have graduated with honor at the highest seminaries , and entered upon the graver resppnsibilities of life , to contend in open and fair field , with the best born , for the highest prizes of the social state , whether of wealth or of influence . And it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help forward merit that emerges from obscurity , and strives to rise . The common school is the basis of all ; the genius of the government is the parent of all ; and the joint operation of the two crowns all . " Passing for the present our eighth enumeration of new points , relative to money , we hasten to dispose of several following that , which , though eminently interesting and instructive for the novelty and practical character of the views presented , we have space only to notice with a few brief remarks . The chapter under the head of a definition of freedom , as " consisting in the enjoyment of commercial rights , and in the independent control of commercial values fairly acquired , " exhibits what we will venture to say will be regarded as an entirely new element of public economy , if it is to be received into the list ; and our author makes it at least one of the foundation stones of an American system . It is an argument of profound interest , and must be read entire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing out of it , are several points which we have specified in our enumeration , which , we doubt not , will receive attention and awaken sympathy , as exhibiting views in a striking light , and which , though not before reduced to form , are common to most minds , such as , protection the cause of the the American revolution ; protection the ground of all the struggles for freedom , in past ages , down to this time ; the new use of freedom in American independence , as founded in a protective system ; the rise and progress of the free trade hypothesis ; American instincts as they bear on this question ; the fact and reason of the different cost of money and labor , here and elsewhere ; the destiny of freedom but imperfectly achieved , being only in the beginning of its career , and its dependence on a protective system ; free trade a license for depredation on the rights of others , or its identity with the principle of anarchy ; &amp;c. , &amp;c . All these are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in our condensed notice it is impossible to do justice to them by an attempted analytical review . We return to the subject of money , only , however , for the purpose of noticing the new points , one of which is the announcement and specification of the foundation of the value of money ; another , the distinction 150 Aug. , // between money as a subject and as the instrument of trade ; a third , money as the " tools of trade ; " and a fourth , the functions of money . The author allows that other economists have approximated these points , and cites them enough to show that they had glimpses , but not clear views of them ; and that for want of clear views , great mistakes and some fatal errors ha*ve been committed-errors still current with all their mischievous influences . The following are a few brief citations , made very much at random , here and there , from the chapters on money-there are four of them-which may serve , in some measure , to show their character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of man and history give no advice , certain metals , commonly called gold and silver , having been discovered and found to possess excellent and unrivalled qualities for certain uses , and for ornament , became precious . ' This may be supposed to be the origin of the name , precious metals . ' For certain purposes of use and ornament , other things have been held much more valuable even than gold and silver , and for which ten , twenty , a hundred , and even a thousand to one , in weight , of the precious metals ' have been and are given , as an equivalent . Nevertheless , partly on account of their scarcity , and especially on account of their adaptation to so many useful and ornamental purposes , no other substances , original , or however formed , have ever acquired the position of being held so universally precious , ' as gold and silver . " And it is to be observed , that this view does not bring us to their position and use as money . Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . This was not the original ground of their being held in such high estenm ; but they have been adopted , and have obtained universal consent , to be used as money , or a common medium of exchange , because of their value for other uses , and because they are always in demand for such a vast variety of appropriations , other than money . Money is but one of their uses , later in the order of things ; and it is only a fraction of their value that is created by their use as money , in the same manner as anything else is increased in value , in proportion as.its uses are multiplied . The real foundation of the value of gold and silver may be said to be , was in fact , prior to their having been Niewed in the light of money , and appropriated to that use ; and the cause of their being thus appropriated , was doubtless the discovery , by experience and observation , of their unrivalled qualities for other uses and in other applications . Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functions of money , apparently for ever , without the remotest probability of change . Nevertheless , this was not an accident , was not arbitrary ; but there were substantial , fundamental reasons , of the nature of value , lying somewhere back , beyond . Gold and silver could not even now retain their value as money , but for the foundation on which they fall back and rest , as being greatly valuable for an almost infinite variety of other purposes , which are always ready to take up and absorb them , whenever they can be spared from trade , and which , as a part of trade , is constantly being done ; and as a part of trade also , they are as constantly going back into the forms or into the uses of money , though not in so great amount . The natural current from the bowels of the earth , is to the other uses of gold and silver ; and only so much of them is arrested , on the passage , for money , as the necessities of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will surrender their plate , trinkets , or any other precious'things , composed of gold or silver , for money . * * * * * " Assuming that nothing is money but gold and silver , or that which will command them at the will of the holder , it may be remarked , that the universal credit of these substances , when used as money , must have a foundation . That foundation is usually called intrinsic value . But a little reflection will show that the value thus asserted , lies farther back than the use of these metals as money , not denying that this use is a fraction of their value . But how came they to be used as money ? Davanzati , an Italian economist of high repute , says : Gold and silver , being found to be of no use in supporting human life , have been adopted , ' &amp;c. , that is , appropriated to the use of money . This , we should think too puerile to be noticed , except for the gravity with which it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the nature and force of things . ' But this answer , as must be seen , has no more point in it than the surface and materials of creation , inasmuch as it has all this range . Others answer : By reason of their qualities . This is not denied , so far as those qualities determine their intrinsic value , which brings us back to where we started from . But it is said , they mean the adaptation of their qualities to this specific use which has some reason in it , but more against it . The very authorities who give this reason , because forsooth they must give some reason , such as M'Culloch , overturn it by starting objections and proving the great inconvenience and expense of these qualities in such an appropriation of these substances . " The truth is , gold and silver were proved to be valuable , highly so , and always in demand , before they were used as money . They were found to be remarkable for their beauty and 1848. 151 // utility , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were held in high esteem , no matter whether for utility or fancy , as both these ends impart value or command price ; and the longer and better that they have been known , tried , and compared , so much more stern and abiding has been the proof of their excellence , and so much greater the number of uses to which , they have been appropriated and for which they have been in request . These. * are facts which run back through all history , and are without contradiction ; and the growth of history on this point , as to both materials and time , only tends to verify them . Gradually in the course of time and by the exigencies of society , they came to be appropriated by general consent to the uses of money , till at last that consent became universal in the civilized world . This appropriation , therefore , was ulterior and consequent to the ascertainment of the many useful and admirable qualities of these metals for other purposes , without which there is no probability that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The inconveniences of gold and silver , as a currency , are increased by time , as civilization advances , as commerce is extended and increased , and as , by this means , the uecess*ty of effecting commercial exchanges with the greatest possible expedition , and in great amounts , is augmented . For this and other reasons , many eminent economists and statesmen have exhausted their wits to find a substitute . Even Ricardo appears seriously to have believed that the British government might found a currency on its credit ! He advocated it , if we are rightly informed , in the very face of the depreciation of the Bank of England paper , during its suspension of cash payments from 1797 to 1823 . He appears to have based his theom* on the fact that the depreciation was no more , whereas we think he should have come to the opposite conclusion , from the fact that it depreciated so much . That credit is itself a currency in one sense and to a great extent , is undoubtedly true , but it must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now inquiring for , to wit , the foundation of the value or credit of gold and silver as money , as the medium of trade . All seem to admit that it is not in its character as money ; for who of the economists , it may be asked , has ever yet got farther than Turgot in this investigation , who laid this foundation in the nature and force of things ? ' Clearly that can not be satisfactory . " And yet a knowledge of the foundation of the value of money is not less important for an intelligent view of the whole subject , than is a knowledge of the foundation of anything else that can be named , to a right view of it . Branches of truth on such a practical matter may doubtless be seen and correctly stated without this knowledge , but no philosopher should be satisfied till he has got to the bottom of his subject , and he is liable to error , if he does not find it . * * * * * * " M. Say observes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its functions , it must of necessity be possessed of inherent and positive value . ' But surely its value must lie somewhere else than in its character as money ; or in other words , something else must have made this gold eagle and this silver dollar valuable . Time was when they were not money ; now they are . There must have been some other reason for their adoption than that money was wanted . Say these metals are scarce ; there are many things more so . Say they are convenient for this use on account of their qualities ; there are other substances not ill , and some much better adapted in these attributes for such an appropriation ; and allowing that these useful qualities , added to their scarcity , impart a substantial value to gold and silver as money , which is not denied ; still the value for which they are credited , relative to that of other commodities most necessary to man , is in great , prodigious disproportion , independent of other considerations . Say that this disproportion is convenient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , doubtless is true . It is then an arbitrary value  --  a fraud ! The world has cheated itself , and reckons it a good bar-gain ! " It is evident , self-evident , that gold and silver , as money , must have had a value to start with , and as a reason for being able to start . This is th' point , and all that is claimed . To suppose that the world has been swindled or swindled itself into the belief that money has a value which after all is factitious , and that it should be satisfied with this persuasion on the principle that it is a convenient delusion , is not more absurd than contrary to M. Say*s own doctrine , when he says , a system of swindling can never be long-lived , and must infallibly in the end produce much more loss than profit . ' It is not easy to believe that the world has been thus cheated , and that the credit of its circulating medium does notrest on a basis entirely independent of itself . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say that intrinsic value is the basis is precisely what we maintain . Intrinsic value for what ? It is INt the idea or function of money that constitutes intrinsic value , but it is that which qualifies for the function ; and the qualifying power lies back of money itself , is underneath it , is its foundation . But why adopt an absurdity without cause ? Why hold debate here when the numerous and important values of gold and silver for other uses are so palpable , quite enough to recommend them for the offices of money , and quite sufficient to sustain them in the discharge of these functions ? In this light , society is safe , and the good sense of mankind is vindicated , in adopting the precious metals as a common 152 Aug. , // currency . It would be most unpleasant to be obliged to believe that money is a fraud , or even that the use of it is a self-imposed deception . * * * . * * * * " Without doubt , gold and silver employed as money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not unimportant ; hut the foundation on which they started as money , the causes which summoned them to this position , to these important functions of society apd of the commercial world , will be found only in values of an older date ; and the causes which still sustain their credit as money will also be found in the same old values , and in a multitude of others since added and continually augmentingas the uses to which these metals are applied , other than that of money , are multiplied in the progress of time and in the advances of civilization . It was never an accident , nor a sum or concatenation of accidents ; it was never an arbitrary fit nor an arbitrary law of society that lifted gold and silver into the position , and installed them into the functions of money ; it was not custom ; it was not even the necessity of a common medium of trade that selected them for this duty , though that necessity was urgent ; but it was a substantial value imparted to them by time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to increase . It was the nature and force , ' not of things ' in general , as Turgot taught , but of these very things in particular ; it was their own position , their own force and nature , their own value , independent of and prior to that of money , that made them money . As a law of society which grew up with society , it could no more be resisted than a law of nature . It was not a choice which men made , but a necessity into which they were forced ; and not a necessity to have this or an alternative at their own will , but to ha* this and nothing else . There was no more uncertainty hanging over the predestined use of gold and silver as money , than over the course of the heavenly bodies . The law in one case is as forcible as that in the other , and both are ascertainable and definite . One is the attraction of gravitation , the other the intrinsic value of gold and silver for other uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common medium of trade , and find in it two simple but important functions , one to express values , and the other to consummate commercial exchanges , by being given on one side and accepted on the other , as the consideration thus agreed upon . It is a medium as the instrument , it is common because the world has so ordained . " " The Free Trade economists , Adam Smith and his , school , say that money is a commodity , and that it occupies the same position in trade as other commodities . We grant that it is a commodity , and that as a subject of trade , it occupies , as they say , the same position as other commodities . But we deny that it discharges the functions of money , and hold that it is merely passive , when it is the subject of trade . Gold and silver , in passing from the mines to market , bullion in the market , and all manufactured articles which are composed in whole or in part of the precious metals , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin , bank notes , and negotiable paper of every kind , when bought and sold . Bankers and money-brokers trade exclusively in money , and money in their hands and in whatever form , coming or going , is always a subject of trade . The precious metals , in bullion or in coin , passing through the hands of brokers from one country to another , are subjects of trade while in the hands of those dealers , though they may be at the same time discharging the functions of money between debtor and creditor , who employ bankers and brokers as agents cf remittance . All notes discounted at bank are subjects of trade in the transaction , both to the lender and to the borrower . Bills of exchange , bonds and mortgages transferred , and many other descriptions of credit for which a consideration is paid , are subjects of trade . All who borrow credit for a consideration , buy it . It is a subject of trade in the transaction . Gold and silver , in all other forms than that of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other forms and conditions of money and of credit go , and so far as the precious metals are devoted to other objects than money as subjects of trade , we agree with the Free Trade economists that they occupy the same position as other and all other commodities exchanged in trade . " But it must be observed that money , in its own proper functions as such , has had nothing to do with all this except so far as the considerations rendered in these transactiona are concerned , as , for example , the discount and interest of a note . They are merely the preparatory stages through which money passes , the platform on which it is tossed about in a merely passive state as the subject of trade , till it reaches the great field of the commercial world where it is destined and designed actively to discharge the appropriate functions of money . This is a field before which the Free Trade economists have held up a screen . Let us go behind it and see how money operates there in distinction The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is operated upon chiefly to the difference between money as asasubject of trade before it gets there . " A consideration of the difference of destinaa subject and as the instrument of trade , 1 tion of money , and of the things for which it is and to price as an attribute of money and j exchanged , as the medium of trade in this field , of things purchased by it . The following will cast light on this point . The destination are extracts on these two points of money here is for an endless round of duty 1848 // in the discharge of the same functions , whereas On price , Mr. Colton remarks - the destination of the subjects of its agency in qwq and only functions . The only fundamental measure of money is the scales ; though , in the superstructure of a monetary system , many other accidental measures are employed , for convenience , all having reference to this , and being based upon it . " To show that money , as a subject of trade , has no price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , with one bar of gold or silver bullion , does not propose to exchang* it for another bar of the same weight and purity . There is no motive . Nor does a person propose to exchange coins for others of the same denomination and weight ; nor bank-notes for others of the same denominations and of the same bank ; nor any kind of money for another , where there is no foundation or reason for difference in value , and of consequent advantage to one of the parties , which advantage would be a foundation of price , or a motive for exchange . There is no motive to exchange an equal for an equal . It must be a difference of some kind to constitute the foundation of price in money . In purchasing the use of money on time , the principle of price is doubtless too obvious to require farther illustration and enough has already been said to show the different positions and proper functions of money , as the instrument of trade , and that price does not belong to it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either that cheapness or dearness should be applied to money alone , or to the things of which it is the medium of exchange . Custom has applied them to the latter , and ordained money to express all their values . This office of money is a law made and obeyed by all the world , and there is no antagonist law . There is nothing else by consent or practice , that expresses the value of money as such . Ricardo , Smith , and others.by violating custom and the ordinances of universal consent in this matter , have , we think , introduced confusion and darkness where order and light are needed , and plunged into an inextricable labyrinth . " Mr. Colton devotes his third chapter on money entirely to a consideration of this agent as " tools of trade , " exhibiting views as true and practical as they are new in form . For it is in form , chiefly , that Mr. Colton s views are new . Every person will find himself perfectly familiar with the whole doctrine of this chapl*er , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never saw those thoughts in such a shape before . Judge by the following specimens " Can a farmer till his grounds without a plough ? Can a tailor make up his garments without his shears and needle ? Can a waterman put forward his boat without a paddle ? or a ship navigate the seas without sails or steam ? Can any work , of any sort , be done without the appropriate instruments ? Money is as much the instrument of trade , as the plough is of agriculture , the tailor 's needle of making garments , the oar of speeding the boat , or the sails or steam of navigation . But Smith , Say , Ricardo , M'Culloch , Twiss and their co-laborers tell us , in effect , that the plough is only a commodity , and the farmer may as well sell that as his corn ; that the needle is only a commodity , and the tailor may give his whole stock of tools for his dinner , without inconvenience ; that the waterman may barter his paddle for a fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both do as well without their tools as with ; that the weaver will suffer nothing in selling his loom and shuttle ; that the woodman may exchange his axe for a shirt , without harm to his occupation ; that the smith may part with his hammer for a saw , in an exchange with the carpenter , and both go on with their work ; that the shoemaker may exchange his kit of tools for a coat , and still work on with profit ; in short , that all these things are mere commodities , and provided the parties have made a good speculation , as a trade , they have done well ; or if they have merely got an equivalent in market values , they can not be losers . Such is the doctrine of Free Trade ! " But money is a nation 's kit of tools ; ' nothing more ; nothing less . And yet these gentlemen say , it is no matter ; it is just as well ; the nation will not suffer the least inconvenience , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtains , by the exchange , equivalent values . They say , in effect , that the shoemaker can still go on making shoes , and do as well as ever , if , by exchanging his kit , he gets other commodities of equivalent value . It is impossible to escape from this issue on the premises of these gentlemen . No one can deny that this is precisely the case which they have made . " if it be said that a man ought to part with his tools of trade , ' rather than not pay his debts , it is raising a new question , which is one of morality . We go further back , and anticipate this question , in the position , that a man should be more prudent than to allow his tools of trade ' to become liable for his debts . This is precisely the position we occupy on public economy . We hold that money , enough for the demands of trade , is the tools of trade ' to a nation , and that its system of economy should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tools ' in the condition of liability for its debts . A nation can not hold on to its tools ' after they have become thus liable ; but they must go , till there is no more to go ; and then the effiux is barred by exhaustion . The doctrine of our opponents is , that a nation is none the worse off , is put to no inconvenience , 1848. 155 // by the loss of its " tools of trade ! " Is not this the CASE which they have made ? If it be not , we know not what is . " This chapter should be carefully studied by every American . It is suggestive of considerations deserving the profoundest reflection . It is written with such philosophical clearness , that a child can understand it . We have referred to the chapter upon labor . We do so again to ask attention to the very elaborate and powerful pamphlet under the title of " The Rights of Labor , " which Mr. Colton published a year or two ago . Perspicuity is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preeminently lucid , shapely , and satisfactory . The subject is one of the gravest that can arrest attention in a democracy . Its importance is justly apprehended by the author , and he discloses and sustains his hypotheses in relation to it , with the ability and confidence of a thorough mastery and an unhesitating conviction . This pamphlet is not so much for the men of the closet and the senate as for the masses ; and it is issued in a form and at a price to insure the largest circulation . In sketching thus rapidly some of the new points in Mr. Colton 's Public Economy for the United States , we have occupied all the space that can conveniently be appropriated to a reviewal of the work . We are compelled to leave unconsidered m*iy chapters of scarcely less interest or importance ; as the balance of trade ; banking ; the mutual dependencies of agricul* ture , manufactures and commerce ; gains of protection , and losses by free trade ; the effects of protection , and of the want of it , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of agriculture , of commerce and navigation , of the home trade , of the cotton-growing interests , and of all other interests of the country ; the principles , objects , and modes of a tariff ; the tariff of 1842 , and 1846 , &amp;c. &amp;c. : all these and their cognate subjects , are considered at large in this work , with an overwhelming array of statistics and facts , bearing on the various points , as they arise . - We have thus endeavored to attract attention to a work which is most timely , and which for its great ability and truly national character , is destined undoubtedly to be widely read , and to exert a powerful in*uence in our country , if not upon all those thinkers throughout the world , who are now attracted to the subject of which it treats . There has never been a time when the questions of public economy were more necessary to be understood by our people  --  and there has never been a time when their importance was in such danger of being forgotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful , invest a nation with but a glittering show of glory for substantial happiness , with but the fiery redness of inflammation , for the complexion of genuine health . We commend the work heartily , not only to MEN , of the closet or of action , but to the students of the school of experience , who are to conduct the ship of State through the storms that are signalled in the horizon , or to be engulphed in the common ruin of which the most sagacious see threatenings in the present distractions of the mind from the means and ends of a true national grandeur.
