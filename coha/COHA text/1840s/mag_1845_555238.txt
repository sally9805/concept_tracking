txt THE . alumni of Harvard University were peculiarly fortunate in selecting , as the orator for their recent anniversary , one whom many years of intimate connection with that institution had made conversant with its history , condition , claims , and wants , and who had gained the right to speak with authority of the duties of the graduates to their . LiIlma . Jlliater , by his own faithful services on her hoards of instruction and supervision , and by untiring devotion to her interests . His address is full of valuable suggestions with reference to college discipline , and bears throughout the tokens of sound discretion and great practical wisdom . It is , at the same time , a scholarly production , rich in classical and literary allusions and quotations , and bearing numerous marks of the liberal tastes and pursuits to which the author 's life has been consecrated . We avail ourselves of its appearance , to fulfil a long cherished purpose of presenting our views of the present condition and wants of our venerable University ; and , in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , in illustration and corroboration of our statements . The means of liberal education now presented at Cambridge are undoubtedly more ample than at any previous period , and far surpass those enjoyed at any other literary institution on this side of the Atlantic . The chairs of instruction , with hardly an exception , are filled by men of well known and eminent scholarship in their respective departments , and of exemplary diligence and zeal in the cultivation of literature and science . The library , meagre as it is when cpmpared with those of European universities , is beyond comparison more valuable than any other in America , and has of late increased with unexampled rapidity . In point of scientific collections and apparatus , Harvard , though for a time behind Yale , must now , with her new and splendidly furnished observatory , take precedence in the department of astronomy , and in that of natural science is fast gaining ground on her only competitor . The standard of qualifications for admission at Cambridge has been greatly raised // within a few years , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission of the few dunces and drones who enter there a miracle . The amount of learning , which may he acquired there by industrious and ambitious students , is much larger and more various , than it formerly was ; and the instruction given to such students is as thorough and faithful as could be desired . The courses of lectures annually delivered there comprise a very extended circle of liberal studies ; they are all accurate and able expositions of the branches of knowledge , to which they respectively appertain ; and some of them add the attraction of commanding eloquence to that of profound learning , while others , no less valuable and useful , serve , indeed , to remind the hearer , that the Muses do not always dwell together . In fine , our University may now be said to lack no desirable facility for the cultivation of any branch of knowledge , that can properly come within the range of a collegiate course . But , notwithstanding the superior advantages which it offers , ( and which , we are glad to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of professional students , ) Harvard College , in the most populous part of the whole country , has remained stationary as to the number of undergraduates , for twenty or thirty years , while the younger New England colleges are every year admitting larger and larger classes . Nay , more , considered as the college of Massachusetts and New England , Harvard has been constantly losing patronage . Were it not for the more than quadrupled population of Boston and its environs , the Cambridge catalogues would have exhibited an annual decrease for the last twenty years . Twenty years ago , about one fifth of the undergraduates were from Boston , and about one fourth from places within ten miles of the College . Now , about one third are from Boston , and not far from one half come from towns within ten miles of Cambridge . Meanwhile , the catalogues of other colleges have shown an annually increasing number of students , who , coming from the immediate vicinity of Cambridge , must needs have had some peculiarly stringent reason for resorting to colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their homes . This state of things is not to be accounted for by the increased number of colleges ; for there has been but one new college established in New England for the last twenty years ; // the flu mber of students at Yale , instead of falling off , has increased of late years ; and Harvard College has a much larger population in its immediate vicinity than Yale or Dartmouth , though it has fewer students than either of these institutions . Still less are we inclined to ascribe this state of things to any actual change in the relative position of our University , among the literary institutions of the country . Other colleges have , indeed , greatly improved . The numerous academic corps of Yale contains professors second to none in their respective departments . The little company of instructers at Bowdoin is composed of men of signal diligence and ability ; while Bowdoin , as well as Brown University , attracts much interest and patronage , from the well known and eminent talents of its presiding officer . Dartmouth College has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised its literary standard for the lovers of study ; but its increased advantages are , in our judgment , more than counterbalanced by the introduction of a system , which dispenses with all college honors , assigns all public performances by lot , and leaves the student destitute of any stimulus from without to persevering diligence . But whatever improvements may have been made in other colleges , we can not but think that Harvard has advanced pan passu , and still maintains her precedence of the rest , both as to the advantages directly offered , and as to all collateral encouragements and aids to a liberal education . This , we believe , is generally conceded by the alumni and patrons of other colleges ; or , where any distinction is claimed in behalf of any other institution , it is at least admitted , that , if a student may acquire less , he also has the means of acquiring more , at Harvard than elsewhere . Yet , notwithstanding this , it must be confessed , that Harvard has , of late , been constantly losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , and is fast becoming simply a high school for a portion of the youth of Boston and its vicinity . Pecuniary considerations , no doubt , deter many students fi'orn entering at Harvard . The course there is , indeed , an expensive one , for reasons entirely beyond the control of the College boards . Most of the expenses are determined by local causes , which they can not obviate . The price of board depends on the cost of rent , fuel , and provisions , // which is necessarily high in the environs of an overflowing city . Then , too , the general style of dress and furniture is made more sumptuous than is needful , by the vicinity of the city , and by the large proportion of the students who are from rich and fashionable families . Yet in all these things there is room for economy without reproach ; and an indigent young man , who sees fit to practise rigid self-denial to secure to himself the highest literary privileges , only elevates himself thereby in his social position among his fellow-students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A student , who shares with another a college room , pays but fifteen dollars a year for rent and care of room . The tuition fee , including the use of the library and the expenses of lecture rooms , is but seventy-five dollars per annum , - a large amount , indeed , compared with that charged at many other colleges , and with the ability of many students , yet less than the tuition fee at any respectable high school in this vicinity , and pitifully small , when considered with reference to the extent and variety of the privileges to which it introduces the student . Nor is it possible for the College , in the present state of its funds , to reduce this fee . It is said , indeed , that the College is rich ; but its wealth in one aspect makes it poor in another . About three fourths of its invested funds were bestowed for specific ends , and are not available for the general expenses of the institution . Very few of these specific endowments are sufficient for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require , every year , additional appropriations from other sources . Under these circumstances , the full tuition fee is absolutely needed . Nor , in truth , should we desire to see it less ; but would be glad to have it raised . We like to see things appraised with some reference to their true value . A liberal education is too good a gift to be offered at a paltry price . Raise its cost , and it will be more highly esteemed , and more ambitiously sought . We have heard complaints of college bills from men who would spend more than a year 's tuition fee on a single dinner-party , and whose servants ' wages a professor 's entire salary would hardly pay . Now we can see no reason why the parent , who denies himself and his family no indulgence or luxury which can be bought with money , should sue in forrnd pauperis before the College faculty , and expect to pay less for his son 's education , than the boy will 4* // pay to his boot-black . The College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for tuition to students both indigent and meritorious , so that those who can not pay may be taught without price . We would earnestly recommend a provision of this kind , as one of the most useful forms which private munificence could take . The donor might , it is true , gain more *c1at by founding a professorship , which should bear his name down to posterity in connection with its honored incumbents ; but in no way could he act so surely upon coming generations for the advancement of literature and science , as by removing the obstacles which poverty puts in the way of so many youth of genius and promise . Harvard College has , we doubt not , lost much patronage from its supposed connection with a particular religious sect . It is often spoken of as a sectarian institution . No imputation could be more unfounded . The whole administration of the College has , in this regard , been eminently catholic . The services at the College chapel are , indeed , conducted exclusively by Unitarian divines ; hut the students are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vicinity . Most of the professors and instructers , also , are Unitarians ; but Episcopalians and Calvinists have not been wanting on the board , whose religious sentiments have been well known at the time of their election ; nor do we believe that a Unitarian , as such , would be elected to office in preference to another candidate of equal qualifications . We have been conversant with the administration of the College , both as a student and an instructer , and can bear our cheerful testimony , without fear of the production of a single fact to the contrary , that favoritism towards students on sectarian grounds is a thing unheard of , - that students of all denominations have been treated with equal fairness , justice , and kindness , - and that , for the petty offices , scholarships , and exhibitions , at the disposal of the faculty , the combined ratio of need and merit has constituted the only claim . Were we to make any exception to these remarks , we should refer to the presidency of Dr. Kirkland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Education Society . He had , of course , no sympathy with their peculiar system of theology ; but he respected them on the score of their reputed piety , their exemplary morals , their healthful social influence , and the sacred profession for which they were destined ; and , // not unfrequently , he eked out , from his own private income , the scanty charity on which they were dependent . But then there is the Unitarian Divinity school , which now constitutes a distinct department of the University , and must needs , in the eyes of the public , reflect back upon the College its own theological character . There it is , standing , we admit , where it ought not . It is our earnest desire and hope , that this school may soon be divorced from the College . But its existence results from no alienation of college funds for the benefit of sectarian theology . Its building was erected , its professors are supported , by funds bestowed by Unitarians , and with the express design and purpose of providing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services which the professors perform for the whole University , they are left without compensation . No trust , therefore , would be violated , should the theological endowments be separated from the property of the College , and given to a distinct board of trustees ; and such an arrangement , though not within the scope of a judicial tribunal , might be authorized by an act of special legislation . The building might then be sold , or devoted to other uses , and the school removed to some town , where it should have an independent existence , and be a distinct and prominent object of interest and patronage to the denomination with which it is connected . As friends of both institutions , we would advocate this measure . They would live best apart . The Divinity school is now overshadowed and dwarfed by the College , which , solicitous to shun the charge of sectarianism , doles out its support in scanty pecuniary justice , without extending to its interests the judicious supervision and beneficence , of which it stands in imminent need . Nor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the College , can the College , even by the utter neglect or disregard of its concerns , escape the imputation , among ignorant and bigoted people , of lending its influence and patronage to the growth of Unitarianism . In this connection , we wish to say a few words with reference to the Hollis professorship of divinity . It is made a frequent ground of reproach to the University , that , while the statutes of the professorship require that its incumbent should be a man " of sound and orthodox principles , " the venerable Dr. Ware , a well known Unitarian , should have // been for thirty-five years professor on the louis foundation . The statements made , and the documentary evidence adduced on this subject , in President Quincy 's History of the University , ought to put this complaint for ever at rest . From this , it appears , that Hollis , himself a Baptist , was exceedingly reluctant to admit into the articles of his foundation any religious test , except a recognition of the Scriptures as the " most perfect rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very words " sound and orthodox , " on the ground that New England orthodoxy laid at that time emphatic stress on the obligation of infant baptism ; and , though , in a truly catholic spirit , he claimed not the exclusive benefit of his numerous benefactions for those of his own communion , he was unwilling , in express terms , to provide for their perpetual exclusion . Wearied by the importunity of his American friends , he at length consented to the insertion of the obnoxious words ; and in fact , in the case of the first professor , his apprehensions were realized , - " the divine right of infant baptism " having been one of the points on which the candidate 's orthodoxy was tested . The College corporation , therefore , in dispensing with all sectarian tests , in the case of Dr. Ware , complied with the expressly and repeatedly declared desire and purpose of Hollis . But waiving this point , had an account current been kept between the salary of the Hollis professor and the endowment from which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before Dr. Ware 's accession to the chair ; and it would appear conclusively , that , prior to the close of the eighteenth century , the College had invested in orthodox divinity of the said century the entire principal and interest of this much vexed foundation . Hollis made provision for a salary of but forty pounds , - then deemed sufficient for the purpose , but subsequently found utterly inadequate . In fact , the funds of the professorship have long siuce been merged in the general funds of the College , and the continuance of the name of Hollis in connection with it is simply an appropriate expression of respect to the memory of an early and munificent benefactor . But as , in sectarian warfare , the refutation of a serious charge goes for naught , and as a professorship of divinity can not but impart a sectarian aspect to the institution , why might it not be the wisest policy for the College to cancel that office , - now vacant , - // to abolish the chapel services on the Sabbath , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it formerly was , of a part or the whole of the faculty in rotation ? We believe , that the religious good of the students would be more surely consulted by making them members of common Christian congregations ; and , as for the service of morning and evening prayer , we should delight in the obligation which such a duty would impose upon the instmucters to be themselves men of a devout spirit and a religious walk ; and we should prize most highly , from our remembrances of former times , the influence and weight of character , which would accrue to them from the regular and appropriate performance of this service . The causes already referred to go far towards accounting for the present condition of Harvard College , in regard to the number of undergraduates . Pecuniary considerations and sectarian preferences operate largely against it ; and we doubt whether it can at present gain increased patronage , if its general course of study continue parallel with that pursued at other colleges , however much more accurate and thorough may be the instruction dispensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why may there not be also a difference in kind ? Why might there not be instituted at Cambridge a course of studies for students of much higher attainments than those now admitted ,  --  a course , on which the graduates of other colleges might be just qualified to enter ? The present instructers are amply competent to initiate their pupils into the most recondite branches of mathematical and physical science , and to conduct them through the most extensive course of classical reading . Many young men every year enter upon their professional studies prematurely , for the sole reason , that they otherwise have no opportunity of pursuing a regular and profitable course of study . There are many , who would not deem their education completed , so long as there was a higher seminary of learning , to which they could resort . Our highest standard of college education in this country is scandalously low . An intelligent and industrious youth of sixteen may easily reach the first university honors of the country , with attainments which would barely qualify him to enter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his classical studies // through the whole four years , reads in Latin select portions of Livy , Horace , Juvenal , Cicero against Verres and IDe Officiis , the Medea of Seneca , and the Aulularia of Plautus , and in Greek a nearly equivalent amount . On the completion of this course , he is no more than well prepared to commence reading the classics , no longer as a task-work , but with taste , discrimination , and enjoyment . Even this is a higher point than a student can reach anywhere else in the country . It is absurd , then , to speak of the amount of classical requirements and attainments at any of our seminaries of learning ; they must be estimated in the style in which Dickens gives the dimensions of the Lilliputian steamboat on the Connecticut , - " thirty feet short by six feet narrow. , , But at Cambridge , even this brief and scanty measure of classical learning can be attained only by entire abstinence from several important branches of general culture , and by comparative neglect of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of literary acquisition , at which they are now sent forth , the institution would become at once , and long continue , without a rival , the University of America . Studious young men from all other colleges , and from every part of the United States , would be drawn together there ; and the list of undergraduates would soon exhibit as large a proportion of names from distant parts of the country , as does now that of the members of the Law school , nearly half of whom are from the Middle , Western , and Southern States . Could such a course as this be established , many of the features of the German university system might be advantageously adopted . The studies to be pursued , the books to be read , might with propriety be left , in a great degree , to the option of the student . Recitations might , Cor the most part , be superseded by lectures , and by critical expositions of classical authors . The attainment of a degree might be made to depend on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under such a system , should depend in part for their compensation on the number of students , whom , by their talents and reputation , they could attract to their respective departments . We would not have them , however , without some fixed stipend . A man should be relieved from solicitude about his daily bread , in order that // he may devote himself freely and heartily to intellectual labor . But we would take a hint from the plan now generally adopted in respect to the masters of our freighting ships , who receive a monthly stipend sufficient for bare support , but depend for all beyond on a commission upon the freights that they can earn . We would have each professor paid by the College the lowest salary that would suffice for a respectable livelihood , and let him add thereto as much as he can by a tuition fee from every scholar who joins his classes or attends his lectures . On this plan , the College , with its present permanent sources of income , could support a larger number of professors than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutors and mere officers of police might be dispensed with , a senior professor might be the literary head of the University , and a treasurer might be the only salaried officer other than the professors . An institution thus organized would be of incalculable benefit to the whole country . Its influence would be at once most sensibly felt in the ( so called ) learned professions . It would redeem them from the curse of extreme juvenility , under which the land groans . It would prescribe a thorough basis of liberal culture for those who aspire to eminence in professional life . It would fix the scholarly habits of its graduates , and make them reading , thinking , improving men for life ; whereas now , half of our graduates can exhibit , ten years after leaving college , no marks of a liberal education except its parchment testimonial . It would raise up a generation of scholars worthy of the name , and would enlist very many so earnestly and zealously in literary and classical pursuits , and give them such facility in the acquisition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as profound critics , original thinkers , and able writers . But all this , desirable as it is , is more than we can at present expect ; though we believe that Harvard University is destined , at some future time , to assume this position ; and we can not but trust , that , by calling the attention of our readers to the need of higher means of culture than are now enjoyed , we may have done something towards the ultimate supply of such means . Very different , however , from the plan which we have sketched , should be the system of discipline and instruction for the class of // students , that now , from year to year , enter the University . In marking out a suitable course for them , their average age should he taken particularly into the account . Accustomed to the juvenile aspect of the students at Cambridge , we seem to ourselves , when on the grounds of any other college , to be among the posterity of Anak . On our first visit to Dartmouth College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , judging from their athletic forms and bronzed faces , that they were the substantial young yeomanry of the neighbourhood , then at the village to attend some caucus or merry-making , we asked , after they had gone by , " Why do we meet no students ? " The members of that college are capable of casting so large a vote , that the reigning party in the State have thought it necessary to incur the odium of disfranchising them , - a game , which , at Cambridge , would not be worth the candle . The majority of the students at Cambridge are the growth of the most approved system of hot-bed cultivation ; as Freshmen , they are microscopic objects ; they take their degrees in early boyhood and our venerable University is fast becoming , in a double sense , " gentis cunabula nostra3 . " For students generally so immature in years , and with a course of preparatory study so limited as is the case at present , we can not but deem the system of elective studies highly inexpedient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , who have previously pursued the same course , ought to diverge , and thenceforward to shape their plan of study with reference to their respective tastes , professions , or destinations in life . But by placing this point of divergence too early , though you may not , indeed , disqualify the student for success in any one profession or calling , you incur the risk of sending him forth into life with a disproportioned , one-sided , defective education . We grant , that , in order to preach acceptably , to maintain a lawsuit successfully , or to blister , bleed , and purge , a man needs acquaintance neither with Horace nor with Homer , and has little occasion to refer to fluxions or to conic sections . But the country is flooded with these professional hacks , - with men , who are adroit and popular in the routine of professional duty , but who could be termed literary men only by the grossest of mnisnomers . Such men are produced with sufficient rapidity without aid from our colleges . The object // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to qualify a young man for entering upon his professional studies , but to give him literary tastes and intellectual habits , to spread before him the various departments of learning in their mutual relations and bearings , to make him acquainted in each department with the sources of knowledge and the modes of investigation , to awaken his curiosity on a wide range of subjects , and to make him , wherever his lot is cast , the judicious friend and patron of education and of all liberal pursuits . In order to do this , the student should acquire a sufficient knowledge of other languages than his own , to fix in his mind the great principles of general grammar and comparative philology , and to acquaint him with the sources and relations of his own vernacular tongue . He should read enough of the classics to give him correct ideas of that early Greek and Roman culture , which has transfused itself into every form of modern civilization , art , and literature . He should study mathematics so far as to train his mind to accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes by which calculations are made and results reached in astronomy and its kindred sciences . In metaphysics and ethics , he should at least learn the history of the principal theories and systems , should he made aware of the points at issue and the state of the controversy on each , and should be put in possession of waymarks to guide him in his future inquiries and reflections . Now , the student at Cambridge may perform creditably all that is required of him , and yet may make such a choice of studies as to leave himself grossly deficient in some of these essential branches of a good education . He may read in Latin only Horace and a part of Livy , or , in Greek , Xenophon 's Anabasis , two hooks of the Odyssey , and a hook or two of Herodotus . He may suspend the study of either or both of these languages at the end of his first year , without having attained any good degree of ease or skill in reading Latin or Greek , and at precisely that stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten , or at most enough only will be retained to enable him , by much conjuring , to divine the sense of a random classical quotation . In mathematics , he may study merely an elementary treatise on geometry , part of a treatise on algebra , and the formu // las of plane and spherical trigonometry , omitting their " applications to navigation , surveying , and spherical astronomy " ; and he may thus go through life , a liberally educated man in his own esteem , without any knowledge of the principles on which the laws of the visible universe are ascertained and its phenomena calculated , or even of the way in which the navigator finds his place at sea , or the surveyor the area of a many-angled field . A graduate thus deficient in either of these branches of education is not prepared to be even an intelligent member of a highschool committee , or trustee of an academy , or to ascertain the qualifications of a teacher . He can not in any community assume the place , fulfil the trusts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded to men of collegiate education . He must through life incur the liabilities and bear the burdens , not only of an imperfectly educated man , but , what is much worse , of one who purports to be what he is not . Some , who coincide with these views in the main , contend that they need to be modified in the mathematical department ; for , say they , there are many good minds that seem to have a natural inaptitude for mathematical reasoning . But we are disposed to think , that even such minds may gain in vigor and comprehensiveness by the effort of mathematical study , even though they make imperfect recitations , and are conscious of retaining very little of what they learn . There might , however , be two distinct courses of mathematics , between which the student might have his option , - one , which , in addition to the present minimum course , should embrace the applications to navigation , surveying , and astronomy , now omitted ,  --  and one which should initiate the student into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculus . One capital objection to the plan of elective studies is , that , in nine cases out of ten , the choice will be made by the very party that ought not to make it , - by the student himself . Many parents are unable to make a judicious choice for their sons , and many others will feel unwilling to interfere with the choice which their sons may make . Most of the students are too young to be trusted to mark out their own course of study , and that is the very reason why they are at college , instead of studying at their own homes . A // youth of sixteen , even if he be a Sophomore , has not selfknowledge enough to discriminate between whim and taste , disinclination and incapacity , love of letters and love of ease . He knows too little of his friture life to determine what branches of knowledge will be of most avail in after years . He will be affected by the love of learning and the thirst for knowledge less than by a thousand other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . If studiously disposed , he yet may select studies for which he has already formed a taste , in preference to those for which he ought to acquire a taste . If ambitious , he will enter the classes in which he knows that he can excel , instead of supplying deficiencies in the branches in which he has been imperfect . There is an essential truth implied in that well known hymn , which breathes a prayer for " Not what we wish , but what we want . " A youth 's wishes and wants are very apt not to coincide , and his choice of studies would always be governed by his wishes , not by his wants . In most cases , he would need , for the just balance of his powers , and the fit proportion of his culture , diligent discipline in precisely the studies which he would not choose , or would abandon at an early period in his course . It is said , indeed , that the experiment of elective studies has resulted in the production of better classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a most manifest improvement in the appearance of the scholars at their examinations . Of this we have no doubt . Let a similar experiment be tried in any common school ; let only the bright or the willing boys be put upon the more difficult branches of study , and let the dull and lazy be kept upon the primer and the spelling-book , and that school will turn out eminently good scholars , and will outshine all others in its public examinations . But the parents of the neglected boys would feel themselves authorized to make loud and bitter complaints of the teacher , who , without dismissing them from his school , made no attempt to extend to them its full privileges . Had we a son in whose talents and application we had entire confidence , we should certainly send him to Cambridge under the present regime ; but were he not above mediocrity , we should fear that his // interests would be sacrificed to those of his more capable and diligent fellow-students . Youth of inferior capacity , or of less studious habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if retained , should have all possible diligence and effort bestowed upon them to bring them as near as may be to the standard of the more highly endowed or the more industrious . With regard to the practical working of the system of instruction under discussion , we dare not trust the judgment of the instructers themselves , for whom , nevertheless , we entertain sentiments of the highest respect and esteem . Their time is now , no doubt , more fully and much more pleasantly occupied than under the former system ; they are surrounded by more striking evidences of proficiency than before ; and it is hardly possible that they should not feel most sensibly every advantage , and be blind to every evil , flowing from the plan now in operation . The present system does injustice to the public , as well as to the individual students . A diploma from the first literary institution in the country ought to be prirnd facie evidence that the student has at least passed through , without scandalous delinquency , certain essential departments of a liberal education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confer a title declarative of respectable literary attainments upon a young man oblivious of what Latin and Greek he once knew , with a little French and a little Spanish , a quantulum of wayside knowledge gleaned from lecture-rooms , and a smattering of half a dozen branches of science , that might as well have been studied at a country academy . It is said , indeed , that the certificates of proficiency in different departments , which accompany the diploma , must be sought as the true evidence of what the graduate has accomplished and attained . What , then , is the use of the diploma ? The certificates can never be a matter of public notoriety ; the diploma is so , nor ought it ever to be conferred , where in justice those certificates would need to b&amp;withheld . But it is said , that there are many young men , preparing for mercantile and active life , who want little classical learning , and need not the higher branches of mathematics , who , if they can choose their own studies , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelors , who wear broadcloth , yet buy no groceries , but would buy their // broadcloth of the grocer , if he would keep a good assortment . Is he therefore bound to sell broadcloth ? The University is not obliged to furnish to order all kinds and measures of education . Its avowed object is the cultivation of the higher departments of literature and science ; nor can it justly he expected to supply wants of a different class . If a young man desires an education of a lower grade , there are numerous high-schools and academies adapted to the measure of his desire . Or , by a long standing regulation of the University , he may there become a student in certain departments , without being a candidate for a degree . But if , after pursuing this partial course , he wishes to palm himself upon the world as a man of liberal education , let not the University by its parchment become an accomplice in the fraud . We would have , then , the regular course of college studies the same for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the average capacity of the students . Some may break down on the course ; let them leave the ground . Others may be able to do more ; let them select voluntary studies sufficient to fill their time and task their powers , without expecting these studies to have any weight in the scale of merit , or the conferment of college honors . We pass to another head of remark . For students as young as those at Harvard generally are , we doubt whether the rigid forms of thorough recitation can be relaxed to advantage . Scholars of their age have seldom formed self-dependent habits of study ; they are still , in a great degree , eye-servants ; they have much , in the buoyancy of their spirits , and in the attractions of society , to render close application difficult ; and lessons , in which they are not thoroughly examined , will be in many cases slighted . At that age , too , the power of continuous attention to the living voice is but imperfectly developed , and mere lecturing or exposition would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , have recitation the sole class exercise , even in a single instance ; nor would we tolerate an instructer who could be nothing more than a task-master . Let familiar explanations and comments be offered upon every lesson ; but let the teacher never fail to ascertain whether his pupils have performed the assigned exercise with fidelity . 5* // It seems to us , that there prevails in the public mind a mistaken notion as to the kind of men needed for the officers of instruction in a college . The common idea is , that he who has the most learning , or exhibits the highest order of genius in any branch of knowledge , must of course be the best professor in that department . This by no means follows as a matter of course . Those most swift to learn are not always the most apt to teach . Genius is often hasty and impatient . It is a comparatively easy thing to instruct youth of quick apprehension and industrious habits , to descant to eager listeners on the beauties of an ancient author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mathematical reasoning , touching " summa fastigia rerum , " and leaving intermediate processes , and references to first principles , to the ready *vit of the apt and well trained scholar ; and for such work a man of commanding talents and high attainments is always competent . But the college teacher has a far different task . He must not only himself occupy the serene heights of literature and science , but must know how to let down the golden chain to those below . He must have a mind at once comprehensive of great principles and minute in details . He must sustain and feed the enthusiasm of the ardent and persevering scholar ; and at the same time , with the halting and inapt , he must take short steps where it would be easier to take long ; he must often retrace the ground already gone over ; he must bring himself down to the most patient analysis , the most homely illustration , the most wearisome reiteration of dimly seen or soon forgotten principles . He must both lead the van and bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being conversant with the idiosyncrasies of every mind , and , with ready skill , adapting modes of teaching and incentives to diligence to the infinitely various capacities with which he has to deal . The practice of selecting for professorships men of somewhat advanced age and established eminence in other walks of life is , we believe , of American growth ; and so is the principle from which this practice takes its rise . " JVon omnia possumus omnes " is deemed an axiom beyond dispute in every other portion of the civilized world ; and from it flows , as a legitimate deduction , the good old rule of St. Paul , " Let every man abide in the same calling wherein // he was called . " In the European universities , professors are chosen young , and educate themselves for their work . They often spend their lives , from boyhood till a late old age , in the same university ; and when they are chosen from without , success and eminence as teachers , no less than as scholars , are deemed requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who fills one place well as fit for any place ; and the usefulness of very many men of high talents and attainments is undoubtedly greatly diminished by the absurd translation of them from spheres of duty , which they fill with eminent ability , to new positions and relations , demanding entirely different modes of study and forms of activity . Thus there is no such thing , in one 's life , as " seeing the end from the beginning . " A man who gains an enviable reputation as a physician is as likely , on the strength of that reputation , to be sent to Congress , as to be chosen to office in a medical society ; while the accomplished statesman and diplomatist , for his character as such , may be deemed the most fitting candidate for a post of literary trust and honor . The extension of this principle to the government of a college may , indeed , reflect much temporary lustre on the institution , by associating with it a distinguished name , and may , in some instances , secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but this latter result can never be foreseen and calculated , and , when it occurs , must constitute an exception to the almost universal rule . Therefore , though Harvard University has been , and is , happy in enjoying an unusual number of these exceptions , - though , in choosing her officers thus at haphazard , she has seemed to play with loaded dice , we are glad that she has of late set the example of educating her own professors within her own walls . We like the spirit of the old Harvard law , which entitled the tutor , who had acquitted himself well in office for a series of years , to a professor 's chair . The tutors should be chosen from among those graduates who are deemed the most hopeful candidates for professorships . In this subordinate office , they should learn to teach and to govern , should themselves acquire and exemplify the spirit and the habits of true scholars , and should gain for themselves on college ground that consideration and regard , which the incumbent may command by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure . And , // except in rare cases , professors should be chosen only from among those whose skill in the instruction and discipline of youth has been thus tested and approved . In connection with these somewhat desultory remarks on college discipline , we would say a few words on one topic of prime importance ; namely , the bodily health of the students . We fear that at Cambridge the ambition of the more industrious is stimulated too highly , that they are permitted to undertake too many exercises , and that , in the closeness of the competition , college honors are sought even at the risk of life . The last few years have been marked by a series of dangerous maladies and deaths among the high scholars of their respective classes , under circumstances which suggest the apprehension , that larger demands were made upon the intellect than the bodily frame could sustain . We have been told by the victims themselves , that they had frequently passed the whole night without retiring to rest , and that the only alternative has been to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day unprepared . There are , indeed , but few in each class , who will incur such hazards for the sake of preeminence ; but those few are the very ones whose life and health should be most carefully cherished , and who , if deficient in prudence , ought to be defended against themselves . By the present regulations , a student may choose for himself , and take rank in , as many different departments of study , as will occupy him in recitations and at lectures for twenty-one hours in the week . There being seldom more than one exercise on Saturday , there remain four for each of the other five secular days . A good scholar can hardly spend on an average less than two hours in preparation for each exercise ; so that , in adopting the legal maximum of study , he must give , each week , twelve hours a day to his desk and the recitation-room , for five days in succession . This some well matured and vigorous frames can sustain ; not , however , without serious peril . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of mature years might endure . Many of them have not yet attained full stature , and are at the very season of life , when the free enjoyment of air and exercise is essential to insure compactness , health , and vigor to the physical frame . Three lessons a day , with two hours study upon each , are as much as can be performed with safety ; and , if more time than this be spent in // literary pursuits , it might better be passed in some profitable course of reading , upon which the forecast shadow of the recitation-room did not rest . Another arrangement , undoubtedly prejudicial to health , is that which crowds most of the lectures and recitations into the interval between breakfast and dinner . It is an arrangement of great convenience and comfort to the professors , who perrorm their services without solicitude , and whom the dinner-bell leaves to the free disposal of the residue of the day . But this plan bears a very different aspect , when considered with relation to the students . They sometimes pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a confined posture , and breathing the corrupt air of recitation-rooms ; and when this is over , they go to their chambers with the burden of the next day 's work upon their minds . Three or even four lessons must be studied before they sleep ; and how studied by the ambitious scholar ? His aim is not only to deposit them in his memory in a shape in which they may lie ready for future use , but to commit them with entire , minute precision , to have them connected in the memory with well chosen and graceful words , and to prepare himself to recite them with all possible facility and fluency , so as to constrain the instructer to give him the highest mark . Now , to study in this manner three or four lessons in as many successive layers , so carefully placed that they shall remain entirely separate one from another , is an anxious and wearisome task , and can hardly be sustained year after year , without making the eye dim , and the face pale and haggard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for the restoration of the custom of former times , when the hours of study alternated with those of recitation , and the student had deposited one burden before he bowed to take up another . Then but cue lesson , as the phrase ran , " was committed over night " ; and of that the student was relieved before breakfast . The morning study-hours were closed by another recitation ; and the third was fixed at as late an hour in the afternoon as the season would permit . In those days , though there were hard students , there were few broken constitutions ; for the confinement of the recitation-room was too transient to in* flict serious injury , and the hours of recitation were so arranged as to leave intervals , which invited the students , with // unburdened minds , to bodily exercise and relaxation . In offering these hints , we are at once redeeming a promise to the dead , and discharging a duty to the living . We would confidently appeal for their justice to the medical members of the Senatus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they will deliberately acquit the present arrangement of all injurious consequences . Judge White , in his Address , discusses in detail the question of the expediency of domiciliating students within the walls of the College . He advocates the affirmative , in opposition to an able argument for the negative in Dr. Wayland 's " Thoughts on the Collegiate System . " We can not but believe the plan of domiciliation , universally adopted in our American colleges , to be indispensably necessary , when considered with reference to the youth of so large a proportion of the students , and their constant need of the judicious supervision of those superior in years . We quote the following remarks of Judge White upon the influence exerted , mentally and morally , one upon another , by fellow-students within the college walls . " The objection grounded on the moral dangers to the young , arising from their being so intimately associated in a community by itself , guided by its own unwritten code , ' and in large numbers , of whom not a few may have been already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and demands a more extended notice . " These dangers are not peculiar to bodies of students , still less to students resident within college walls ; common boardinghouses certainly would not exclude them . The true remedy is to be sought in counteracting influences ; and such influences , we know , exist in great strength at this University , and might , doubtless , be rendered yet more predominant . " Entering college with good moral characters , and full of youthful aspirations , a vast majority of every class are ardent for virtue as well as for learning , and helpers of each other 's jby and progress . If , as suggested , older residents influence for evil those who have more recently entered , ' other older residents there are , of greater power and attraction , to influence for good . What ingenuous youth of Harvard ever failed to find in other classes , as well as in his own , lights and guides to cheer him on his way , models of virtue and scholarship to elevate his motives and his ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are much more zealous in making proselyfes than the virtuous . ' This we doubt . The moral energies of the people , so easily awakened in the cause of phi . lanthropy , show the activity of virtue and benevolence ; and none are more susceptible of sympathy in any such cause , than young men in the higher stages of their education ; a sympathy , which , when properly directed and cherished , shields them from a thousand temptations . " We are told , too , of the waste of time which must result from frivolous conversation , where the opportunities of conversation are so abundant . ' But this , as we conceive , is not attributable to collegians more than to other young persons , nor to the young alone ; older men , congregated in less numbers , have always been liable to the like charge , from the curious quidnuncs whom St. Paul encountered at Athens , to the last meeting on change . " Nothing , indeed , is more natural , than for youth of studious minds and buoyant spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the Sport that wrinkled care derides , And laughter holding both his sides . ' But , if abundant opportunities for conversation lead to excess of frivolous talk , they lead also to much intellectual converse equally rational and instructive . The memorable remark of Mr. Fox , that he had been more instructed by his friend Burke , than by all other men and books put together , strikingly illustrates the value of that mutual improvement which results from the companionship and familiar intercourse of intelligent minds . Young friends and fellow-students , frank and confiding , are open as the day to each other . Their mental acquirements become common property . Every individual , among many classmates , has many minds , instead of one only , at work for his improvement . A learned jurist , of the London University , observes , that young men , as far as their mutual information extends , are the best professors for each . other . ' " Thus , in addition to all that the students obtain from college professors and teachers , they make continual advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual excitement , mutual instruction , and mutual influence ; a fact which should make us less anxious to fill up with stated exercises the whole time of the more talented students in college . It has been remarked by a most competent judge , that a very great excellence of the English universities lies in the degree to which they call out voluntary energies and con amore study ,  --  not oppressing the mind by enforcing too many studies at once , - the // lecturers being few , and the tutors rather directing and assisting the study of books , than presenting themselves instead of books . " - Address , pp. 26- 28 . With regard to the moral conduct and character of her students , we believe that Harvard College need not shun comparison with any similar institution in the country . There are , probably , fewer young men of rigid , ascetic morality there than at some other colleges ; but we doubt whether there is anywhere else a nearer approach of the great majority of the students to a respectable moral standard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm and high . Meanness is never tolerated there ; and the grosser forms of dissipation meet with general abhorrence . Wine , or a villanous compound to which the venders give that name , is the student 's greatest enemy ; convivial intemperance his chief danger . A vigorous stand against the use of wine was made a few years ago by some of the more thoughtful among the undergraduates ; but the temperance society which they formed , unless recently endowed with new life , has been suffered to languish and to become inefficient . When we remember at what shining marks within those halls the demon of intemperance has taken fatal aim , when we recall to mind the consciousness of perfect safety and self-control professed by those who there commenced their swift march to a drunkard 's grave , we feel constrained to appeal with earnestness to all who occupy places of trust , counsel , instruction , or influence in connection with the College , to aid in establishing within its walls the principle and habit of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , unrestrained by the presence of those of maturer years , he is easily made blind to the limits between moderate and excessive indulgence ; and , those limits once passed , the shame of drunkenness ohce incurred , the precedent is established for all future similar occasions . But with these students , precept will be vain without example . The preacher of abstinence must himself abstain . No matter if he can command by special importation the pure blood of the grape , and from the very hills whence flowed inspiration for Anacreon 's song , while the grocer 's back-shop is the student 's Samos and Madeira ; // the two will be drunk or thrown aside together . We trust that Harvard will not enjoy another year the unenviable distinction of being the only college in New England , that furnishes her alumni with intoxicating liquors at their Commencement and anniversary dinners . It is the earnest desire of very many of the best friends of the College , that there should on this point be a departure from ancient custom . They dare not hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the assembled learning , talents , and piety of New England make public exhibition of it on three consecutive days every year . We doubt whether any parties would feel aggrieved by the disuse of wine on these occasions . We have in former days tasted the wine of the Commencement dinner , and can record our unhesitating testimony , that it comes from the vintage which supplies the students ; it bears the same brand ad nauseam ; whatever fortunes it may have sustained on land , it is " expers mans . " No lover of wine ever thanked the Corporation for it ; but many dear lovers of their . filma . Miater , many anxious parents , many youth rescued from the contagion of bad example , will " rise up , and call them blessed , " if they will put away this nuisance . On this subject we gladly fortify our own opinions and suggestions by the weighty and judicious remarks of Judge White . " Who of us can look back upon his classmates , without a most melancholy recollection of brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all blasted by the scorching rays of alcoholic excitement ? There now rises before me the image of a once loved classmate , the only son of his mother , the darling child of his father , a venerated clergyman , whose heart swelled with grateful joy at his son 's early promise of excellence , but whose gray hairs were brought down in sorrow to the grave . And no near relative remains on earth , to check the freedom of these allusions , or to forbid the tribute which my heart would pay to the memory of one , whose life was as full of instruction to others as of unhappiness to himself . " When this son of bright promise appeared among us , his pleasantry and social qualities attracted notice and regard , while his courteous manners and superior gifts of elocution gave him consequence with his associates . But his judgment was imma. ture , and failed him most sadly . lie it was who broached the idea of a high.go , as being requisite to give us a rank among the classes in college ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assemble at his room , on a winter 's evening , to manufacture the noble article , bringing with them the necessary tools , in the shape of black bottles well filled . The morning 's dawn disclosed the glorious result , in broken windows , broken bottles , and - broken character ! " The charm of a spotless academic reputation was gone from the class . The hero of the scene - but not alone - persisted in his maddening course to its fatal close , in mid-age , followed by tears , not curses , - this being his one great fault , for which he paid so dear . Naturally of a noble and generous dis . position , and inheriting a liberal patrimony , he made what atonement he could to his Alma Mater , and by his last will enrolled himself among her distinguished benefactors . Peace to his memory ! Honored be his virtues , which were all his own . His errors and miseries , and the agonies of hearts most dear to him , might have been avoided , had but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God made known to us and placed in our hands , been present to protect him in his youthful career . His is but one of a thousand heart-rending tales . " Who , upon these classic grounds , with such facts before him , would not be tempted to exclaim , in the magnanimous apostolic spirit , If wine make my brother to offend , I will drink no wine while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend ! " - Address , pp. 34 , 35 . We close our remarks with one additional suggestion . We wish that there were some mode , in which the students of the University could be brought into more intimate social relations with their instructers . We are aware , that some of the ancient barriers between teacher and pupil are removed , nor are we ignorant of the kind and persevering efforts of the present head of the College to introduce the students into social intercourse with the members of the faculty and their families . Yet there still remains too much of mutual distance and reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , cultivate the acquaintance of their teachers , and feel always sure of a kind reception ; but ought not the retiring and timid to he sought out , and made to feel that there are those ready and glad to stand to them in loco parentis ? In former times , the intercourse between the particular tutor ( so called ) and the class under his charge partook somewhat of the parental and filial relation . The student felt at liberty to resort to the tutor of his class for special counsel and direction , whenever needed ; and the // tutor often sought other occasions of meeting the individuals of his class than those of set exercises and formal college discipline . 1'Iight not an arrangement of this kind , carried out by a more minute subdivision of classes , meet a want , which many parents , that have sons in college , deeply feel , and of which the young men themselves have a vague and dreamy consciousness ? According to this plan , there should be assigned to every member of the faculty his quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make himself acquainted , to study their characters , to watch over the formation of their habits , to give them advice on all subjects of importance , as to recreation , reading , and modes of study , and to act as their special moral guardian , in pointing out sources of danger and of evil , and in shewing to his pupils , both by precept and example , the " more excellent way . " An arrangement like this would supersede in a great degree the severer , sterner portions of college discipline , would strike the axe at the root of reigning evils and abuses , and would go far towards establishing that sacred regard for moral obligation , without which mere literary attainments are empty and worthless . We have thus passed in review the condition and wants of our University . We have done this in the spirit of sincere reverence and love . It has our warmest wishes , - it has had and shall still have our earnest , however feeble , efforts , for its enlargement and prosperity . We regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget not its early consecration , " Christo et Ecciesiie " ; and though , in the present distracted state of the New England church , we wish that there were no theological organization within its walls , we trust that its motto will be verified in all coming time , as it has been in days that are past , by the severe sanctity of manners and morals , and the unfeigned piety of heart , of those who guide its counsels and impart its instru*tions.
