txt WE have been deeply interested in these volumes , not because the two brothers whose writings and biographies are contained in them had any very remarkable gifts of intellect , or were ever likely to gain a distinguished place , either by their genius or their eccentricities , in the list of uneducated poets . They were representatives of a class - the best class , it is true , but we hope also a tolerably numerous one - among the peasantry of Scotland , who have always been noted for the possession of higher traits of character than are usually found compatible with extreme poverty . The hardships which they endured were very great ; they were born poor , and misfortune seemed to pursue them through life with unrelenting severity . Their industry , sobriety , and good sense , their noble independence and firmness of spirit , and their spotless lives , would have sufficed to raise them , one would hope , to a position of tolerable comfort , even if the circumstances by which they were surrounded from the first had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky in every thing they undertook ; accident , disease , and death repeatedly interfered with the execution of their plans , and finally carried them both off , when they had hardly attained middle age , and before their case had been made*sufIlciently public to attract universal sympathy and respect . Their story is a painfully interesting one , and , though from a very different cause , is still as rich in instruction as the more tragic record of the life of Burns . We gladly do our part to make it better known on this side of the Atlantic , where they could never have supposed that their names would be mentioned . Alexander Bethune , the elder of the two brothers , was born in the parish of Letham , Fifeshire , in July , 1804 . His father , who had been a servant before his marriage , and was an ordinary farm-laborer afterwards , was obliged frequently to shift his residence to procure employment . In 1812 , when John , his second son , was born , he was living at a place called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir David Lindsay , whom Scott celebrates in lines which have rather more sound than poetry - " Still is thy name in high account , And still thy verse hath charms , - Sir David Lindsay of The Mount , Lord Lyon King at Arms . " The mother , though she also had been a domestic , was better educated than her husband , and was fond of repeating ballads and other poetry , which first gave the boys a liking for rhymes . She was religiously inclined , thoughtlessly generous to others who were no poorer than herself , and not a good housewife , so that her household were more indebted to her for the cultivation of their minds than for any domestic comforts . She taught the two boys to read , and gave them a little instruction in writing and arithmetic ; whatever facility they afterwards acquired in the use of the pen or with figures was gained by their own exertions , as Alexander went to school only for three or four months , and John only for one day . To herd cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was at work in some distant field , and to help him throughout the afternoon in his task of clearing the ground of furze , was the employment of both lads while they were from eight to twelve years of age . At the latter period , they began the ruder toil of ditching or breaking // stones on the highway , and were able to earn , when they worked by the piece , from is. to is. 3d. a day . During the winter , the weather being often very severe , and their work on the road giving no motion to their lower limbs , the legs and feet of John , the4 only twelve years old , were with difficulty preserved from freezing ; and the older l*rother complained , that , on first attempting to move in the morning , " his joints creaked like machinery wanting oil . " But these hardships did not overcome their love of reading , and whatever hooks they could borrow in the neighbourhood were diligently studied by the light of the evening fire . in the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews , who was struggling hard for an education , taught a small school at Lochend , where the Bethunes then lived . Alexander obtained some instruction from him in his hours of leisure , and the bent of his mind was still more affected by the long recitations of poetry , with which this young student , who had an excellent memory , often favored him . He began to copy out some extracts from books , both in poetry and prose , and to make remarks upon them , in which he strove to imitate the style of the originals . Bunyan , Cowper , Burns , and Blair , the author of " The Grave , " were his great favorites . If he had not possessed good judgsnent , a manly and sedate turn of mind , and a very even temper , these studies would probably have been only an injury to him , by making him more sensible to the hardships of his lot , and giving him more ambition than circumstances could ever gratify . But his letters , poems , and other writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he makes no parade of fortitude or self-denial . He was too proud to complain , and seems to have carried the feeling of independence even to an unreasonable extent . Now and then , some expressions of impatience escaped him against the rich who made a poor use of their wealth , while he saw clearly how much might be accomplished by it ; but the feeling even in this case was dictated more by regard for others than for himself . The only change he desired in his own lot was one to be produced entirely by his own exertions . The family was not so poor but that there was a possibility of their becoming poorer . As the father grew old , his health failed , his earnings were cut off , and the attempts made // to relieve him were attended with expenses which ran them considerably into debt . As the weaving business was then prosperous , higher wages could be earned at it than by ordinary labor on a farm ; so it was determined that John , now twelve years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on condition of receiving half his wages during that period , and boarding himself . When he had learned the craft , the expectation was that he could teach his older brother , who , in the meanwhile , by desperate economy , might save enough to buy a loom . Then they could each earn 2s . Gd . a day , instead of less than half that sum , which was the rate of agricultural wages . The spirits of both were high , and before John 's apprenticeship had half expired , he made the discovery that , by allowing his master to take the whole , instead of half , of his earnings , his term might be abridged full six months . The sequel of the attempt may be told in Alexander 's words , which he wrote as the biographer of his brother . " From the estate having changed masters , his father had lost his situation as forester ; and being now , from the infirmities of approaching age , unable to endure the privations and hardships incident to the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening of his days was another motive for making the most of every thing . With these objects in view , a house adjoining the one in which his father lived was taken as a workshop ; by the most desperate economy , about X 10 had been previously saved to purchase looms , and other articles appropriate to weaving ; and at Martinmas , 1825 , he commenced that business on his own account , with the writer of this sketch as an apprentice . The * 10 was fairly expended in procuring a proper supply of utensils . The future , however , was still bright , and his hopes of independence were high ; but a sad disappointment was before him . " The effect of the almost universal failures which occurred in the end of 1825 and beginning of 1826 was severely felt by him and his apprentice almost at the very commencement of their career . While thousands , who had formerly been engaged in the same business , were in a state of idleness and starvation* they were glad to find employment as laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at is. a day . Before the trade had recovered , the house which he had occupied as a workshop was required for the accommodation of a family ; for a number of years afterwards it did not appear that it would have been advisable to make // any great sacrifice to obtain another , and thus the whole of the weaving utensils , which but a short time before had cost what would have been a little fortune to him , were no better than so much useless lumber . His hopes from this quarter were now completely at an end ,  --  are this may be regarded as the first of that series of disappointments of which his future history in a great measure consists . " - L*fr of J. Bethune , pp. 29 , 30 . Illness was soon added to the other misfortunes of the brothers . When John was but fifteen years old , he was employed , with two other laborers , in clearing out a watercourse , taking marl from a pit in a marshy situation , and draining a swamp , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees for hours together ; this was during the months of November and December , 1827 . He took a severe cold , which probably did permanent injury to his lungs , and confined him to the house for the rest of the winter . " The cough , which was uncommonly hard and dry , was so distressing , that he could not lie down in a bed , and for a number of nights he sat by the fire . " He had recovered far enough , however , in March , to resume his work but " ever after , when he caught cold , he was subject to a hard , dry cough , which lasted for weeks , and sometimes even months . " In November of the following year , while Alexander was employed in blasting rock , a charge exploded prematurely , which threw him into the air , and he fell head foremost upon a pile of stones . His face was severely mangled , the skull was laid bare for several inches , and his limbs were badly bruised . The physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but after a confinement of four months , during which he was affectionately attended by his brother , he was able to resume work . Speaking of John , he says , - " Patienily did he watch by my bedside till it was supposed I was out of danger ; and then , to provide for the exigencies of the family , which now depended upon him alone for support , he wrought at his former occupation by day , and took his turn to watch by night , till I could be left with safety . The result of this accident was a heavy expenditure , and four months of inability to labor ; at the end of which period , from his exertions in behalf of his unfortunate brother , he again found himself in debt . " Just three years afterwards , Alexander was exposed to a precisely similar acci // dent , that killed a laborer by his side , and by which his face was again so scorched and cut that he was disfigured for life , and the sight of one eye Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , the brothers conceived the plan of adding something to their slender earnings by writing for the magazines , and even publishing a book . It was first necessary to make some improvement in their penmanship and orthography . " For this purpose , " says the elder brother , speaking of John , though the account applies also to himself , " he carried a little work of which he was fond always in his pocket . " " From the short poems , of which nearly one half of the book is composed , he selected one , and when going to and returning from his work , as well as in his journeys at dinner.time , he was in the habit of conning it over till he had fixed the spelling of every word in his memory ; after which he took another , and thus proceeded to the end of the work . He also bought a copy of Mayor 's Johnson 's Dictionary , ' and this , whenever he had occasion to write , he laid down beside him , determining not to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was in the slightest hesitation . When at any time he had a few minutes to spare , which could not be turned to a more profitable account , he used also to pore over its pages for the proper pronunciation and accentuation of words , marking as he went along , and trying to fix in his memory , such as appeared to be any way poetical or striking . By persevering in these means , he at last acquired the ability of spelling accurately any common word which he had occasion to use ; and by imitating whatever he considered worthy of imitation in those specimens of the writing of others which fell in his way , a marked improvement in his penmanship soon began to be observable . " - pp. 39 , 40 . They wrote mostly upon scraps of paper which they picked up after they had been used as envelopes and for other purposes , and they economized even this material by writing in a very fine hand . Their house had but one room , and the hours of daylight being given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening and morning by the light of the fire , holding an old copy-book to support the paper upon their knees ; John had no other writing-desk than this through life . As he did not wish it to be known that he was thus engaged , an old newspaper was always kept at hand , and if steps were heard approaching the door , his writing materials were instantly concealed under it . He fre // quently suffered from a severe cough , and successive attacks of the measles and the small-pox still further injured his constitLitiOn . During all his early manhood , says his brother , " the state of his health was such , that lying longer in bed than five hours at a time *roduced such a degree of uneasiness as to render it painful rather than refreshing ; and , as a necessary consequence , he rose in general about three in summer , and at a little past four in winter . rfljese long and solitary mornings he spent for the most part over a fire which he had himself kindled ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found him always employed either in writing or reading . " " He was now in his nineteenth year ; and by this time he had begun to carry a book , with a slip of paper and a pencil , constantly in his pocket ; and if , in the course of his solitary labors by day , a good idea occurred , he sometimes took such notes of it as would enable him to recall it in the evening . About this time , The Happy Home , ' Phe Shout of Victory , ' Song to the Rising Sun , ' and a number of other productions , the original MSS. of which are stitched up with these , were composed . The first of Hymns of the Churchyard , ' of which there are three , owes its origin to the same period ; and I shall never forget the time and the place at which I first heard him read it . The house which we inhabited was long and narrow , with a small vacant space at the farther end of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , on the summer evenings , when he had the advantage of daylight till it was almost ten o'clock , he sometimes retired with his papers . On one of these evenings , I had taken sanctuary in this quarter before he came home . The sun shone cheerfully in at the little window , giving an air of warmth to the place , and making visible a long , level streak of its dim , smoky atmosphere . When he arrived , with his writing materials in his hand , he leaned upon the chest where my papers were lying , and said , If you would only stop for a few minutes , man , I would let you hear my last production . ' He then read , with a low , musical voice , the lines beginning , ' Ah me ! this is a sad and silent city , ' which will be found in the following pages . Of these , the first verse rose spontaneously while walking in the churchyard during the interval of public worship , and the others had been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 . The quantity of verse and prose which he produced , under the circumstances , was truly astonishing . If printed in full , they would occupy several volumes . As far as we can // judge from the specimens in the books which are before us , the language was always correct , the lines smooth and flowing , and the rhymes good ; but of course he had little range of thought or copiousness of diction , and further cultivation of mind would probably have in*ced him to abandon poetry for prose . Neither of the brothers seems to have been ambitious of literary fame for its own sake , but to have written only as a means of eking out their scanty livelihood . " We are poor , " said John to his brother ; " it must be long before we can save the veriest trifle from our miserable earnings ; and if at any future period we could make only a few pounds by writing , it were worth looking after for our parents ' sake , if for nothing else . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the miserable earnings , ' as he termed them , were not squandered upon idle indulgences , it may be mentioned , that from them , previous to November , 1832 , about ? 14 had been again saved . In the spring of 1830 , the reader will recollect that he was rather in debt ; little more than two years had passed since then ; and when it is known that his earnings seldom exceeded ? 19 in any year , - that , besides himself , he had at least one of his parents to support , - that he was in the habit of giving considerable sums in charity , and , perhaps , still more for books , - some idea may be formed of his personal expenditure , which could not possibly exceed ? 7 per annum , food , clothing , and every thing in. cluded. " having thus mentioned his little savings , I hope the reader will pardon me for stating the manner in which they were expended . On the 8th of November , 1832 , the writer of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by an accident in a quarry ; and before lie was able to resume his work , the last farthing of the ? 14 was gone , and the author of the following poems , and the narrator of his story , were left to begin the world again , with only the clothes on their backs ; and these , having already seen severe service , promised soon to leave them . " - pp. 46 , 47 . After some unsuccessful offers of poems and prose stories to various magazines , Alexander Bethune applied , in May , 1835 , to one of the Messrs . Chambers , the publishers of the celebrated " Journal " which bears their name , for advice as to the mode of publishing some of his writings . In his letter he showed with great freedom what were his situation // and circumstances , mentioning " that the coat in which I now write has actually served me since the year 1827 , during the whole of which time it has been on service every day , with the exception of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . " He would not ask nor accept " any thing heyond advice and some literary assistance ; when I can not provide for myself , no one shall hear me murmur at my fate . " These liberal publishers did all they could to aid him , and in a few months two of his stories , illustrative of Scottish rural life , were inserted in their Journal , and he was well paid for them . About a year afterwards , the manuscript of " Tales and Sketches of the Scottish Peasantry , " written mostly by Alexander , but with some contributions from his brother , was finished and taken to Edinburgh ; but so difficult did it prove to find a publisher for it , that , " had it not been for its falling into the hands of one who ever afterward proved a steady friend , it would probably have been brought back and burned in disgust . " This friend was a young man , then employed in a printing-oflice , who has not allowed his name to be published . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscripts , selecting from them what was most fit to be printed , and finding publishers for their successive works . The volume of Tales and Sketches appeared in 1838 , and the sale of it produced about ? 20 for the Bethunes ; its publication was of further use to them , as it gave them a name as authors , and the manuscript stories which they offered to the editors of magazines and other collections were now more favorably received , and they sometimes obtained a moderate price for them . They wrote frequently for Wilson 's " Tales of the Borders , " and thus earned more money than they had received for all their other writings put together ; some of their poems appeared also in the Dublin University Magazine . Encouraged by this success , they began to form more ambitious projects . Some years before , they had resolved to write a volume of poems on Scripture subjects , to be called The Poetical Preacher ; they had now conpleted this work , but could not find a publisher for it , and but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been printed . The next scheme was proposed by John , that they should prepare some lectures on Practical Economy , which they might deliver in the // towns and villages around , selling admission tickets like other lecturers , and afterwards form them into a volume of which the copyright would produce something . It was not " Political Economy , nor Rural Economy , nor Domestic Economy , to which he alluded , but *at sort of economy which we had ourselves practised , and which , if it were adopted by others , might enable more persons to live independently on their own earnings than had as yet thought of doing so . " They began the lectures immediately , with no other guide than an article in the Penny Cyclopa*dia , though they afterwards borrowed a copy of the Wealth of Nations , and two or three other works on economical science . Probably they would have done better , if they had written without any guide , for the work when finished contained rather an incongruous mixture of a portion of the doctrines of political economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by their own experience . They acted out their prudential maxims in one respect with laudable consistency , as neither of them ever married . rhe Lectures , like their other works , were first written on brown paper bags ripped open , and other scraps which they had picked up , and with no other desk than their knees . Two quills , also , which were more than half cut down when they began , sufficed for the whole undertaking . The scheme did not succeed . When the hour arrived , the writers found that they had not courage enough to appear as public lecturers , and the labor of committing to memory what they had written proved intolerable . Their young friend at Edinburgh procured a publisher for them , but the world apparently did not need instruction in practical economy , and but few copies of the work were sold , till subsequent events directed attention towards the writers of it , and the remainder of the edition was then quickly disposed of . This was a sad disappointment to the Bethunes , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not allow the failure to damp their energies . The house , or hovel , in which the family had lived for more than twenty years , was in very bad repair . When it rained , they were obliged to place dishes upon the beds to catch the water that came through the roof ; and in winter , pools were formed upon the floor of the single apartment that the house contained , so that the brothers , who slept at the // farther end of the room , were obliged to set stones and blocks of wood to step upon in order to reach their bed . The yard attached to the house seemed at first not to admit of cultivation , as it had no fence , and only nettles would grow in the thin and grai*lly soil ; but by great labor , continuing the attempt after repeated failures , they had made a pretty garden of it , which produced flowers and berries , and enabled them to keep bees . * VJ7* whole of this had been done in the mornings and evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , and protracted our labors till it was late at night , working occasionally by the light of the moon . " To obtain a place of retirement for writing , John had also built a sort of large closet , which had a whole window in it , instead of the single pane of glass that formerly lighted that end of the house ; and further , " with no better materials than three old paling stakes for jambs and lintel , two round poles which served as supports between these and the roof , some ropes made of straw , and a quantity of mud scraped from the highway , " they bad constructed a fireplace and chimney in this closet , which they considered as their study . But the hut on which they had bestowed so much pains they were now required to leave , as the estate had changed hands , and the new proprietor probably wished to clear the ground for some " agricultural improvements , " after the fashion of many Scotch and English landlords . Their father and mother were now quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fatigue of far or frequent removals , the brothers resolved to lease a spot of ground , and to build a house of their own . Their wages had not exceeded on an average 7s. or 7s. 6d. a week for each ; but out of these and their literary earnings , in the course of seven or eight years , they had saved about thirty pounds . How severe was the economy necessary to effect this saving , we learn from a letter of Alexander 's , written some months afterwards - " While finishing the Lectures , which was previous to the melting of the snow , the authors were living upon oaten meal and potatoes , with scarcely any addition except water and salt . " The story of the house-building must be given in the words of the elder brother , writing as the biographer of John . " On the 26th of July , 1837 , with the aid of one mason whom we had engaged to work along with us , we laid the foundation // of our future dwelling ; - and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish a house thirty-six feet in length , and twenty in breadth , without asking or taking any assistance except such as we could pay for at the ordinary rate , and with no more wealth than two boils of oatmeal4o serve as summer provision , the thews and sinews of two human beings , and about ? 30 in money , reflecting individuals would have probably pronounced us fit for Bedlam : yet such was the case . In less than a week , the mason was called away to another job , but we still persevered . The drudgery which the poor author of the following poems now underwent was such , that few , perhaps , would have cared for encountering it . He left home every morning before five o'clock , travelled three miles , commenced work immediately , and wrought till nearly half-past seven in the evening , with no more rest than was absolutely necessary to swallow his breakfast and dinner . The last of these , indeed , which consisted exclusively of bread , he frequently ate from his pocket , working the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles back to his home ; and after being thus engaged in hard labor and travelling for nearly fifteen hours , it may be believed that he was sufficiently tired before he reached it ; yet day after day the same process was repeated , except during those short intervals when the mason wrought along with him , and then he dropped work at the usual time . Had it not been for a vision of the future which was now before him , it is probable that even he might have shrunk from this dreary task . But in imagination , he already saw the house finished , the garden inclosed , with the crops put into the ground ; and his father , now venerable from age , walking through it on a fine summer day , or , if he wished for exercise , employed with a hoe in the little inclosure which he would then be able to call his own . With such illusions - for , as Providence had decreed , they deserved no other name - we used to cheer our journey homeward ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient inducement to encounter still greater difficulties than those with which he had to contend . More stones having been provided than were necessary , the house was raised to two stories . On the 9th of September , the walls were finished ; and before the 30th of the same month , the roof was on , an earthen floor laid , the lower fiat plastered , part of the partitions built , and doors and windows provided , with very little assistance from tradesmen . With the exception of the carriage of three cart-loads of lime , every thing had been paid in ready money . But by this time the last farthing of the ? 30 was expended , the stock of provisions was completely exhausted , and the author of the following pages was glad to 42* // engage in such work as he could find , to procure the necessaries of life for himself and friends , and provide a little money to defray the expense of removing , which had now become inevitable . " - pp. 75-77 . They were not long to *joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sufficiently dried when they began to occupy it , and the dampness , together with the pain caused by leaving his old home , had an unfavorable effect on the health of the father , who had long been quite feeble ; in about three months after their removal , he sickened and died . The expenses of his funeral absorbed their whole savings in the early part of the winter , and while the snow was on the ground they were out o1 work , so that for some time they were obliged to live on oatmeal and potatoes , without the addition even of milk . The next summer , they were so encouraged by obtaining six guineas for some stories which they had written , that John resolved to give up all other employment , and trust entirely to his pen for support . His friends remonstrated , but he persevered , and the result was what they had apprehended . He was often disappointed in attempting to get any price for his productions , and the confinement within doors , assiduous application to his pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back his consumptive complaints . His cough returned in the winter , with other bad symptoms , and after suffering for about six months , during which he was tenderly watched by his brother , he died in September , at the age of twenty-seven . In little over a year , his mother , who had received several shocks of paralysis , so that she required almost constant attention from her surviving son , followed John to the grave . Alexander was now alone in the world , and the bereavements be bad suffered , united with the other hardships of his lot , so far wrought their work upon him , that be seems to have become permanently dejected , morbidly sensitive in his intercourse with others , and feverish in his desire for indep endence of action . He was not morose , but poverty , sorrow , arid repeated disappointment bad broken his spirits and though he still labored with unflagging industry , hope had ceased to gild the future for him , and he shrank from the idea of any change in his situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still engaged for most // of the time as a day-laborer , but his mornings and evenings , for a year after the death of John , were devoted to preparing a sketch of his life , with a selection from his poems , to be published hy subscription . This volume appeared in 1840 , and met with a very favorable-*ception ; it passed quickly to a second edition , and the attention and sympathy which it excited brought many offers of assistance to its author . But with a jealous feeling of independence and self-respect , he declined them all . When money was sent to him , as was frequently the case , by persons whom he had never seen , it was invariably returned - " I acknowledged the gift and returned it at the same time , thanking my benefactors in the best way I could , assuring them that I was not in want , and that , upon principle , I considered it the duty of every man to provide for his own necessity as far as his ability would go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in an anonymous letter , merely asking him to acknowledge the receipt of it through his publishers ; he did so , and informed his unknown benefactor , with thanks , that the money was deposited in the bank , subject to his order . Those who wished to hefriend him , therefore , were obliged to confine their efforts to promoting the sale of his books , which aid he gratefully accepted . In 1841 , Mrs. Hill , the wife of the inspector of prisons in Scotland , who had become interested in his case , procured for him a situation as one of the assistant keepers of the bridewell at Glasgow . He accepted it , thinking that he was to be a sort of moral teacher for the convicts ; but after a week 's trial , finding that he was expected to perform only the duties of a turnkey , and to associate with very disagreeable persons , he gave up the place , and returned to his former home . Some other attempts to provide him with more agreeable employtnent were equally unsuccessful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he worked in the fields for most of the time , though the improvement in his circumstances gave him more leisure for writing . Early in 1843 , he published another collection of stories , called The Scottish Peasant 's Fireside , which was moderately successful . This was his last literary labor . While it was passing through the press , he was attacked by fever , and before he had recovered from it , all the symptoms of pulmonary dis // ease were manifest . He saw that his end was approaching , and prepared himself for it with resignation and reliajous trust . After lingering for a few months , during which it is a satisfaction to know that he lacked no comforts , but was nursed with care and ten*rness , he died , and was interred in the same grave with his brother . Upon one side of the monument which he had himself erected to his brother was put this inscription - " In the same grave with John , rest the remains of his brother , Alexander Bethune , the last member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1843 , aged 38 . With scarcely any school education , and under the pressure of poverty and the severest toil , he produced several works of much merit , illustrative of the character and manners , and conducive to the improvement , of his own class of society ; and was as remarkable for his independence of spirit and private virtues , as for his literary attainments . " We have preferred to tell the simple and touching story of the lives of these two peasants , instead of making any comment upon their writings or characters . The moral of the tale it is easy to read . There are but few persons accustomed to complain of the hardships of their lot who may not learn a lesson of contentment and thankfulness , of industry , energy , and perseverance , from the history of John and Alexander Bethune . We can not help adding , that there must be something radically wrong in the constitution of that society which offers no greater encouragement for the practice of all the virtues that can adorn an humble station in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not always enough to say , that we must submit to the dispensations of Providence ; it is sometimes our duty to inquire if the institutions of man be not at fault . The worst of all forms of tyranny is that which hinds a man for ever to that condition of life in which he was born , be it of high or low degree , however he may have merited removal from it by his character or behaviour.
