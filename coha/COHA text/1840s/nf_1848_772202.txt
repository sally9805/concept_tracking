Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1847 , BY GOULD , KENDALL AND LINCOLN , In the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts . STEREOTYPED BY S. N. DICKINSON , BOSTON . PREFACE . I have noticed that young people are fond of reading anecdotes , narratives , parables , &c.; This taste of theirs sometimes leads them to devour all the trash that comes in their way , with no other object than mere amusement . But , if properly guarded , it may be the means of conveying truth to their minds in a form not only more attractive , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to supply reading of this kind , which shall be not only entertaining but instructive . I never write for the amusement of the reader merely . But I am glad if he is entertained at the same time that he is instructed . This book is not a mere compilation of stories . Its main object is to illustrate truth and character . No anecdote has been admitted but such as could be turned to this account ; and if suited to this purpose , the question has not been asked whether it was new or old . But nearly every one has been entirely rewritten , presented in a new dress , and made to bear on the object in view . The work was suggested , while writing my last two publications , " How to be a Man , " and " How to be a Lady . " I had designed to illustrate the topics there treated of , in this manner , but could not find space . The favor with which these works have been received , has encouraged me to undertake something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one for boys and one for girls , but the matter in each is entirely distinct . The same anecdote is in no instance introduced into both books ; though in some cases the topics are similar . They form a pair , for the rising youth of both sexes ; and if they shall contribute in any degree towards forming their characters , after the true model , my object will be attained .

A man 's character is formed early in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very great changes take place after a person has grown to manhood . But , even in such cases , many of the early habits of thought , feeling , and action still remain . And sometimes , we are disappointed in the favorable appearances of early life . Not unfrequently the promising boy , in youth or early manhood , runs a rapid race downward in the road to ruin . All the promising appearances failed , because they were not formed upon religious principle and a change of heart . But , as a general rule , show me the boy , and I will show you the man . The following cases afford illustrations of this principle . Benedict Arnold . I suppose all my readers have heard of Benedict Arnold , the traitor ; and of his attempt to betray his country into the hands of the British , during the Revolutionary War . His name is a by-word in the mouth of every lover of liberty in the land . But there are few that know how he came to be such a character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more surprise . His father was an intemperate man ; and at an early age , Benedict was placed with an apothecary , in Norwich , Connecticut , his native town . His master soon discovered in him the most offensive traits of character . He seemed to be entirely destitute of moral principle , and even of conscience . He added to a passionate love of mischief a cruel disposition and a violent , ungovernable temper . He had no sympathy with any thing that was good . His boyish pleasures were of the criminal and unfeeling cast . He would rob the nests of birds , and mangle and maim the young ones , that he might be diverted by their mother 's cries . He would throw broken pieces of glass into the street , where the children passed barefooted , that they might hurt their feet . He would persuade the little boys to come round the door of his shop , and then beat them with a horse-whip . All this showed a malicious disposition , and great hardness of heart . He hated instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his mind any religious or moral principles , nor make any good impression upon his heart . Before Benedict had reached his sixteenth year , he twice enlisted as a soldier and was brought back by his friends . He repaid his mother 's kindness with baseness and ingratitude ; so that , between the intemperance and wretchedness of the father , and the cruelty and depravity of the son , she died of a broken heart . When he grew up , the same character followed him . We need not be surprised , then , that , in the most critical period of his country 's history , he betrayed his trust . He was a General in the American Army , in the Revolutionary War ; and by his extravagance , and his overbearing behavior , he brought upon himself a reprimand from the American Congress . His temper , naturally impetuous , had never been controlled , and he could not bear reproof . He was bent on revenge ; and to accomplish it , he entered into a negotiation , through Major Andre , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , to the enemy . If the plot had not been discovered and prevented it would have been a very great calamity to our country . It might have turned the scale against us . I have some personal reason to feel indignant at the traitor , besides what arises from the love of country ; for my father was on picket guard at West Point , the night in which it was to have been delivered up , and would have been the first man killed . If Arnold had been caught , he would have closed his career on the gallows ; but , as it was , he escaped , and a more worthy man suffered . He received , as the reward of his treachery , the appointment of Brigadier General in the British Army , and ten thousand pounds sterling . But his name will go down with the history of his country , to the latest generation , black with infamy . He was a bad boy , and he made a bad man . And , as Solomon has said , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A single incident , in the history of George Washington as a boy , furnishes a clew to the character of George Washington as a man . I refer to the well known story of the new hatchet and the cherry-tree , with his refusing to tell a lie ; which I need not repeat , because it is preserved in the books that are read in our common schools , and embalmed in the memory of the rising generation . This incident shows that he had already in his bosom a deep-seated principle of stern integrity , which no temptation could shake . This was the leading feature in his character when he became a man . We have evidence , also , from other incidents which have been related of his early life , that strong , deep-seated , filial piety , was one of the prominent elements of his youthful character . He had learned , in early life , to honor and obey his parents ; and this taught him to love and reverence his country , instead of making himself a despot , as most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , was the religious element . Religious principle controlled his conduct both in private and public life . GOVERNOR RITNER . Joseph Ritner , who was for some time a member of the legislature of Pennsylvania , and afterwards Governor of that state , was once a bound boy to Jacob Myers , an independent farmer , who brought him up . While he was governor , there was a celebration of the fourth of July , at which Mr. Myers gave the following toast :  --  " JOSEPH RITNER  --  he was always a good boy , and has still grown better ; every thing he did , he always did well ; he made a good farmer , and a good legislator ; and he makes a very good governor . " All this man 's greatness was the result of his being a good boy . ROGER SHERMAN . Roger Sherman , in his public life , always acted so strictly from his own convictions of what was right , that Fisher Ames used to say , if he happened to be out of his seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the question was about to be taken , he always felt safe in voting as Mr. Sherman did , " for he always voted right . " This was Mr. Sherman 's character everywhere . But , if we inquire how it came to be such we must go back to his early life . Mr. Sherman 's character was formed upon the principles of the Bible . And , when he was an apprentice , instead of joining in the rude and vulgar conversation , so common among the class to which he then belonged , he would sit at his work with a book before him , devoting every moment to study , that his eyes could be spared from the occupation in which he was engaged . When he was twenty-one years of age he made a profession of religion . He was as familiar with theology as he was with politics and law . He read the Bible more than any other book . Always , when he went to Congress , he would purchase a copy of the Bible , at the commencement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home , he would present it to one of his children . Mr. Macon , of Georgia , said of him , that he had more common sense than any man he ever knew . Mr. Jefferson , one day , as he was pointing out to a friend the distinguished men in Congress , said of him , " That is Mr. Sherman , a man who never said a foolish thing in his life . " Mr. Sherman was a self-educated man , a shoemaker , and a Christian . He was brought up , after the old New-England fashion , in a pious Connecticut family . And , as was the boy , so was the man . If you would be a good man , you must be a good boy . If you would be a wise man you must be a studious boy . If you would have an excellent character , it must be formed after the model delineated in the Holy Bible . The basis must be a change of heart . The superstructure must be laid up on the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Filial Piety , I mean the exercise of those feelings of reverence , submission , and love ; and the faithful and conscientious discharge of those duties , which children owe their parents . The first duty which man owes , is to God ; the second , to his Parents . They are his appointed guardians , in the season of helplessness and inexperience . God has entrusted him to their care ; and in return for that care , he requires honor and obedience . A child can not be pious toward God without being pious toward his parents . The corner stone of a good character must be laid in piety towards God ; the rest of the foundation , in piety towards Parents . Show me the boy that honors his parents , and I will show you the man that will obey the laws of his country , and make a good citizen . Show me the boy that is disobedient to his parents , and turbulent and ungovernable at home , and I will show you the man that will set at naught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil work . When a boy ceases to respect his father or to love his mother , and becomes tired of home and its sacred endearments , there is very little hope of him . GEORGE WASHINGTON . When George Washington was about fourteen years of age , he wanted to join the Navy . Accordingly , all the arrangements were made for him , in company with several of his young companions , to go on board a man of war . When the time arrived , he went into the sitting-room , to take leave of his mother . He found her in tears . He threw his arms about her neck and kissed her , and was about bidding her " farewell ; " but seeing her so much afflicted , he suddenly relinquished his purpose . The boat which was taking officers , men , and baggage , from the shore to the ship , went back and forth , in his sight . At length it came ashore for the last time . A signal flag was raised to show that all was ready . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companions now entered the boat , and as they approached the ship , signal guns were fired ; and soon after , the sails rose majestically , one after another . George could no longer bear the sight , but entered the room where his mother sat . Observing that his countenance bore a strong expression of grief , she said , " I fear , my son , that you have repented your determination to stay at home and make me happy . " " My dear mother , " he replied , placing his arms round her neck , and giving vent to his feelings in a gush of tears , " I did strongly wish to go ; but I could not endure being on board the ship , and know that you were unhappy . " He was young , ardent , and ambitious , and had doubtless anticipated , with great delight , the pleasure he should have , in sailing to different places , on board a man of war ; and , although the expectation of pleasure which boys sometimes indulge , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a noble generosity to sacrifice all the high hopes he had cherished , to the feelings of his mother . Obey God rather than man . As a general thing , it is the duty of children to obey their parents ; but , when a parent commands what is wrong , the child should not obey . A poor woman told her son to cut down a large pear tree , which stood in the garden of the cottage where they lived , for firewood , as they were suffering from cold . The boy made no answer . His mother repeated her command ; but he still hesitated , and said , " Mother , I ought to obey you , but I must first obey God . The tree is not ours . It belongs to our landlord ; and you know that God says , ' Thou shalt not steal . ' I hope you will not make me cut it down . " She yielded , for the time ; but after suffering from cold a day or two longer , she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her , " Mother ; God has often helped us , and supplied our wants when we have been in trouble . Let us wait till this time to-morrow . Then , if we do not find some relief , though I am sure it will be wrong , yet if you make me do it , I will cut the tree in obedience to your command . " To this she agreed . The boy retired to his closet , and prayed earnestly that God would help them , and save him from being compelled to break his law . The next morning , he went out and found a man whose wagon had broken down under a heavy load of coal . He told the man his case , who agreed to let him carry away the coal , and they might pay for it , if they were able , when he called for it . But he never called . It is always safe to do right . A son 's love . A man in Sweden was condemned to suffer death for some offences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son , about eighteen years of age ; who , as soon as he heard of it , hastened to the judge and begged that he might be allowed to suffer instead of his father . The judge wrote to the king about it ; who was so affected by it that he sent orders to grant the father a free pardon , and confer upon the son a title of honor . This , however , the son refused to receive . " Of what avail , " said he , " could the most exalted title be to me , humbled as my family already is in the dust ? " The king wept , when he heard of it , and sent for the young man to his court . Filial piety rewarded . Frederick , king of Prussia , one day rung his bell , and nobody answering , opened the door and found his page fast asleep . Seeing a letter in his pocket , he took it out and read it , and found it was a letter from his mother , thanking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wants . The king was so much pleased that he slipped a bag full of ducats into the young man 's pocket , along with the letter . Filial Tenderness . A young man , newly admitted to the military school in France , would eat nothing but bread and soup , and drink nothing but water . He was reproved for his singularity ; but still he would not change . He was finally threatened with being sent home , if he persisted . " You will not , I hope , be displeased with me , " said he to the Principal of the institution ; " but I could not bring myself to enjoy what I think a luxury , while I reflect that my dear father and mother are in the utmost indigence . They could afford themselves and me no better food than the coarsest of bread , and of that but very little . Here I have excellent soup , and as much fine wheat bread as I choose . I look upon this to be very good living ; and the recollection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit me to indulge myself by eating any thing else . " Filial impiety punished . God has promised long life and prosperity to the child that honors his parents . Of course , this promise is not meant to be absolute ; for many die before they have an opportunity of obeying the command , and others are taken away for wise reasons . But , as a general principle , the promise is verified . On the contrary , the word of God declares , " The eye that mocketh at his father , and scorneth to obey his mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young eagles shall eat it ; " meaning that God will visit with sore punishment those that despise and ill-treat their parents . Boys , when they begin to approach manhood , are very apt to think themselves wiser than their parents , and to be restive and turbulent under restraint . Two young men in England , the sons of pious and wealthy parents , wanted the family carriage to ride out and seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , they resolved to resent it ; and accordingly went off with the determination to go to sea . Their father sent word to Rev. Mr. Griffin , of Portsea , requesting him to find them , and try to persuade them to return . He did so ; and among other things , urged the feelings of their parents ; who , after watching over them with so much care and tender anxiety , must now see all their hopes blasted . This touched the heart of the younger , and he consented to return ; but the elder was obstinate . The carriage , he said , had been refused , he had made up his mind to go to sea , and to sea he would go . Mr. Griffin then requested the young man to go with him to his house , and he would get him a ship that he might go out as a man and a gentleman . This he declined , giving as a reason , that it would make his parents feel to have it said that their son went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , he would go . " Is that your disposition ? " said Mr. Griffin ; " then , young man , go ; and while I say , God go with you , be sure your sin will find you out , and for it God will bring you into judgment . " The younger son was restored to his parents , while all traces of the elder were lost , and he was mourned for as for one dead . After a considerable time , a sailor called on Mr. Griffin , and informed him that there was a young man on board one of the ships in the harbor , under sentence of death , who wanted to see him . What was his astonishment , on finding the young man , who had gone to sea to be revenged on his parents for refusing him a sinful indulgence , a prisoner , manacled and guarded ! " I have sent for you , " said the young man , " to take my last farewell of you in this world , and to bless you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . Would to God that I had taken your advice ; but it is now to late . My sin has found me out , and for it God has brought me into judgment . " Mr. Griffin spent some time with the young man in conversation and prayer ; and then hastened to London , to see if he could not get him pardoned . But , when he arrived there , the warrant had already been sent for the young man 's execution . He returned home , and arrived on the morning that the young man was to be executed . Within a few minutes after his arrival came a pardon , with which he hastened to the ship , where he met the young man 's father , in the greatest agony , as he was returning from taking , as he supposed , his last farewell of his son . Mr. Griffin entered the vessel at the moment when the prisoner , pinioned for execution , was advancing towards the fatal spot . In a few moments , he was restored to the embrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the agonies of death , as a punishment for his disobedience to his parents ; though , in consequence of his penitence , his life was spared . Think how you will feel when your parents are gone . A young man was lamenting the death of a most affectionate parent . His companions , to console him , said that he had always behaved to the deceased with tenderness , duty , and respect . " So I thought , " he replied , " while my parent was living ; but now I recollect with pain and sorrow , many instances of disobedience and neglect , for which , alas , it is too late to make any atonement . " If you would avoid this bitter reflection , ask yourself , when disposed to do any thing that will grieve your parents , " With what feelings shall I think of this , when they are dead and gone ? " Benefit of Obedience . A boy wishing , one afternoon , to go with some other boys , on a sailing excursion , asked permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe struggle in his mind between inclination and duty , he gave up his anticipated pleasure , and remained at home . The other boys went . A sudden flaw of wind capsized their boat , and two of them were drowned . The boy , when he heard of it , was much affected , and said to his mother , " After this I shall always do as you say . " Reward of Disobedience . Another boy was charged by his father , as he was going away , to be gone a few days , not to go on the pond . Saturday , being his holiday , he asked permission of his mother to go a skating . She told him he might skate about in the fields and by the sides of the road , on such patches of ice as he could find ; " but , " said she , " be sure you do not go on the pond . " He went out ; and contrary to the strict charges he had received from his parents , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ice was a foot thick . But there was a place that had been cut open to get ice , where he and his companions fell in , and he was drowned ! Some years ago , a boy in Woburn , named William Wheat , came to a terrible end in consequence of disobedience to his parents . Three Sabbaths before his death , he left the Sabbath School , and went to a public house  --  a place where no boy should go , on any day , unless sent on business . The next Sabbath , his teacher reproved him , and he was very angry , and declared it was the last time he should ever enter the Sabbath School ; which proved true . The next Sabbath , he did not go ; and the following Wednesday , he got an old gun barrel , which his parents had repeatedly forbidden him to meddle with , and charging it with powder , applied a lucifer match , to " fire off his cannon , " as he called it . The gun burst and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent ungovernable disposition , despising the authority of his parents and the law of God . He only came to the end to which the road , in which he walked , naturally leads . Boys should never attempt to set up their own judgment against that of their parents . When a parent denies the requests of his children , he does it , not to deprive them of pleasure , but because he sees a good reason for it . If the child submits , he will one day see that his parents had a good reason , although he could not then perceive it . Let this reflection silence all murmuring : " My father and mother know better than I. " The truth of this is clearly proved in the foregoing cases . Conscientious Obedience . Some children obey their parents because it is right , and because they love them . This is true , conscientious obedience  --  the obedience of the heart . And those who render to their parents this kind of obedience , will be just as careful to obey them , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will be careful not to evade their commands . They only want to know the wishes of their parents , promptly to obey them . The shouts of half a dozen children were heard from the piazza of one of the large boarding houses at Saratoga Springs  --  " O yes ; that 's capital ! so we will ! Come on now ! there 's William Hale ! Come on , William , we 're going to have a ride on the Circular Railway . Come with us ? " " Yes , if my mother is willing . I will run and ask her , " replied William . " O , O ! so you must run and ask your ma . Great baby , run along to your ma ! Ai n't you ashamed ? I did n't ask my mother . " " Nor I. " " Nor I , " added half a dozen voices . " Be a man , William , " cried the first voice ,  --  " come along with us , if you do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you see we are all waiting ? " William was standing with one foot advanced , and his hand firmly clenched , in the midst of the group , with flushed brow , flashing eye , compressed lip , and changing cheek , all showing how the epithet coward rankled in his breast . It was doubted , for a moment , whether he would have the true bravery to be called a coward rather than do wrong . But , with a voice trembling with emotion , he replied , " I will not go without I ask my mother ; and I am no coward either . I promised her I would not go from the house without permission , and I should be a base coward , if I were to tell her a wicked lie . " In the evening , William was walking in the parlor , among the crowd , with his mother , a Southern lady , of gentle , polished manners , who looked with pride on her graceful boy , whose fine face was fairly radiant with animation and intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could dare to do right , when all were tempting him to do wrong . Cheerful Obedience , Sullen Obedience , and Disobedience . When children are away from home , they are bound to obey those to whose care their parents have entrusted them . Three boys , Robert , George , and Alfred , went to spend a week with a gentleman , who took them to be agreeable , well-behaved boys . There was a great pond near his house , with a flood-gate , where the water ran out . It was cold weather , and the pond was frozen over ; but the gentleman knew that the ice was very thin near the flood-gate . The first morning after they came , he told them they might go and slide on the pond , if they would not go near the flood-gate . Soon after they were gone , he followed them to see that they were safe . When he got there , he found Robert sliding in the very place where he had told him not to go . This was disobedience outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond , not so much as sliding at all , because he had been forbidden to venture on the dangerous part . This was sullen obedience ; which is , in reality , no obedience at all , because it comes not from the heart . But Alfred was cheerfully enjoying himself , in a capital long slide , upon a safe part of the pond . This was true obedience . Suddenly , the ice broke where Robert was sliding , he immediately went under water , and it was with difficulty that his life was saved . The gentleman concluded that Alfred was a lad of integrity , but that his two brothers were not to be trusted . Obedience secured him happiness , and the confidence of the kind gentleman with whom he was staying ; while the others deprived themselves of enjoyment , lost the gentleman 's confidence , and one of them nearly lost his life ; and yet , to slide on the dangerous part of the pond would have added nothing to their enjoyment . They desired it from mere wilfulness , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys into difficulty ; and if they cherish it while boys , it will go with them through life , and keep them always " in hot water . " CHAPTER III . SOCIAL VIRTUES AND VICES . SECTION I.  --  BROTHERLY AFFECTION . Sergeant Glanville . Customs vary in different countries . In England , when a man dies without making a will , his property goes to his eldest son . Mr. Glanville , who lived in the days of Charles II. , had an eldest son , who was incurably vicious ; and seeing no hope of reforming him , the father gave his property to his second son . When Mr. Sergeant Glanville died , and his eldest son learned what was done , he became greatly dejected , and in a short time his character underwent an entire change . When his brother perceived this , he invited him and a party of his friends to a feast . After several dishes had been served , he ordered one , covered up , to be set before his brother ; which on being opened , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate . This , he remarked was what he was sure his father would have done , had he lived to witness the happy change which they saw . Generosity of an elder brother . Mr. H  --   --  , an ingenious artist , for want of employment , was reduced to great distress , and applied to his elder brother , who was in good circumstances , and begged some little hovel to live in , and some provision for his support . His brother was melted to tears : " You , my dear brother , " said he , " you live in a hovel ! You are a man ; you are an honor to the family . I am nothing . You shall take this house and estate , and I will be your guest , if you please . " The two brothers lived thus affectionately together , as if it had been common property , till the death of the elder put the artist in possession of the whole . How happy every family of brothers would be , if they would thus share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all disputing about mine and thine . Every one would be equally pleased that his brother was enjoying any thing , as if he had it himself . SECTION II .  --  THE GOLDEN RULE . GENEROUS BLACKSMITH . Mr. Wilson , passing late one evening by a blacksmith 's shop , and hearing the sound of the hammer much later than usual , stepped in to inquire the cause . The man told him that one of his neighbors had just been burned out , and had lost every thing ; and he had undertaken to work an hour earlier in the morning and an hour later at night to help him . " This is kind , in you , " said Mr. Wilson ; " for I suppose your neighbor will never be able to pay you again . " " I do not expect it , " replied the blacksmith ; " but if I were in his situation , and he in mine , I am sure he would do as much for me . " The next morning , Mr. Wilson called and offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be able to buy his iron cheaper . But the man refused to take it , but told Mr. Wilson that , if he would lend it to the man whose house was burned down , it would go far towards helping him rebuild his cottage . To this , Mr. Wilson consented , and had the pleasure of making two men happy . Michael Verin . Michael Verin , a Florentine youth , was always foremost ; and his compositions being more correct than those of any other boy in school , he always obtained the first prize . One of his school-fellows , named Belvicino , studied hard night and day , but could never get the prize . This grieved him so much that he pined away and grew sick . Verin was strongly attached to Belvicino ; and , discovering the cause of his illness , he determined to remove it . The next composition day , he made several faults in his Greek version . Belvicino 's was judged the best , and he took the prize . This so delighted him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have known to whom he was indebted for his success , had not the preceptor pressed Verin to tell him why he had made such palpable faults in his composition . SECTION III .  --  GRATITUDE AND BENEVOLENCE . PLANTING TREES . An old man was busily employed in planting and grafting an apple tree . Some one passing by , rudely accosted him with the inquiry , " Why do you plant trees , who can not hope to eat the fruit of them ? " The old man raised himself up , and leaning on his spade , replied , " Some one planted trees before I was born , and I have eaten the fruit ; I now plant for others , that the memorial of my gratitude may exist when I am dead and gone . " It is a very narrow , selfish feeling that confines our views within the circle of our own private interests . If man had been made to live for himself alone , we may justly conclude that every one would have been made by himself , and his bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since God has made us to live in society , he designs that we should be helpful to each other . The truly ingenuous , benevolent mind , takes more pleasure in an act which will confer blessings upon others , than in one that terminates on himself . The selfish man wraps himself in his cloak , and cares not for the sufferings of others , so that he keeps warm himself . This old man , however , remembered how much he was indebted to those who had lived before him , and resolved to pay his debts . If we would look around us , we should find ourselves indebted to others , on every side , for the comforts which we now enjoy  --  first to God , and under him , to those whom he has employed as his agents to give them to us . Ought we not , then , to strive in some measure to repay these obligations , by doing something to promote the happiness and well-being of others ? Who gave us the Gospel ? The missionaries , who preached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who opened the treasures of God 's word , when they were hid under the rubbish of Popish superstition . Ought we not , then , in return for this , to send the blessed gospel to those who are now destitute ? Who gave us our civil and religious liberties ? Our fathers who braved the ocean and the wilderness to establish it , and the sword of the mother country to maintain it . Ought we not , then , to transmit this precious boon to our posterity ? And so in whatever direction we look , we shall find some blessing for which we are indebted to the noble generosity , public spirit , or christian benevolence of others . Let us return the blessing , with interest , into the bosom of others . Dr. Franklin , having done a favor to some one , and being pressed with thanks , requested the person whom he had obliged to embrace the first opportunity of doing a kindness to some other person , and request him to pass it round , as all mankind are friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is more blessed to give than to receive . " Thomas Cromwell . Francis Frescobald , a rich Florentine merchant , had become noted for his liberality to the needy and destitute . A young Englishman , named Thomas Cromwell , the son of a poor man , had gone into Italy with the French army , where he found himself in a destitute condition . Hearing of the liberality of Frescobald , he applied to him for aid ; who , having inquired into his circumstances , took him to his house , clothed him genteelly , and kept him till he had recovered his strength . He then gave him a good horse , with sixteen ducats of gold in his pockets ; with which , after expressing his gratitude to his benefactor , he made his way home . After his arrival in England , he was taken into the service of Cardinal Wolsey , who was then the favorite of King Henry VIII. , and his Prime Minister . After the death of the Cardinal , Cromwell became the King 's favorite ; who made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally , lord chancellor of England . Frescobald the rich Florentine merchant , by repeated losses both at sea and on the land , was now reduced to poverty . Some English merchants , however , were owing him fifteen thousand ducats , and he came to England to collect the money . The lord chancellor , as he was riding to court , met him in the street , and immediately alighted and embraced him ; and without waiting for his old friend to recognize him , invited him to dine with him . Frescobald , after recollecting himself , concluded it must be the young Englishman whom he had assisted , and therefore complied with the invitation . When the chancellor returned from court , with a number of the nobility , he introduced them to the merchant , and related the story of the assistance he had received from him in a time of need . After the company were gone , Cromwell inquired of Frescobald what had brought him to England , who related to him his misfortunes . " I am sorry for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy to you as I can . But , because men ought to be just before they are kind , it is fit I should repay the debt I owe you . " Then leading him to a closet , he took out sixteen ducats and gave them to Frescobald , saying , " My friend , here is the money you lent me at Florence , with ten pieces you laid out for my apparel , and ten more you paid out for my horse ; but , considering that you are a merchant , and might have made some advantage by this money in the way of trade , take these four bags , in every one of which are four hundred ducats , and enjoy them as free gifts of your friend . " These Frescobald would have refused , but Cromwell forced them upon him . He then took the names of his debtors and the sums they owed , and sent his servant to demand their payment in fifteen days . In a short time , the entire sum was paid . During this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have persuaded him to remain in England ; but he chose to return to Florence . Here is a fine illustration of that passage of Scripture , which says , " Cast thy bread upon the waters , for thou shalt find it after many days . " Lending to the Lord . Solomon says , " He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord ; and that which he hath given will he pay him again . " The following anecdote affords a very striking illustration of the truth of this passage : In the year 1797 , as Mr. M.  --   --  was travelling among the mountains in Vermont he was overtaken by a thunder shower , and sought shelter in a small house , on the borders of a great forest . On entering the house and finding no one but a woman and her infant he apologized , and asked the privilege of stopping till the shower was over . The woman said she was glad to have him come in , for she was always terrified by thunder . The gentleman told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she only trusted in God . After conversing with her some time on this subject , he inquired whether she had any neighbors , who were religious . She told him she had neighbors about two miles off , but whether they were religious or not , she could not tell . She heard that they had preaching there once a fortnight , but she never attended their meetings . She appeared to be extremely ignorant on the subject of religion . The rain had now passed over , and all nature smiled . The traveller , as he was about to leave , thanked the woman for her kindness , and expressed to her his earnest desire for the salvation of her soul , and besought her to read the Bible daily , and give diligent heed to its instructions . But she , with tears in her eyes , confessed that she had no Bible . They had never been able , she said , to buy one . " Could you read one if you had it ? " he inquired . She said she could , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , " said he , " I do heartily pity you : farewell . " As the traveller was preparing to go , he thought to himself , " This woman is in very great want of a Bible . O that I had one to give her ! But I have not . As for money to buy one , I have none to spare . I have no more than will be absolutely necessary for my expenses home . I must go : but if I leave this woman without the means to procure the word of God , she may perish for lack of knowledge . What shall I do ? " These passages of Scripture then came to his mind , " He that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord . " " Cast thy bread upon the waters , for thou shalt find it after many days . " He said in his heart , " I will trust in the Lord . " He took a dollar from his purse , went back and gave it to the woman , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , and said she knew where one could be obtained . The traveller set out , and when night came he took lodgings at a private house . He had a little change left , but as he had two days more to travel , he thought he would make his supper on a cold morsel , which he had with him . But , when the family came to the table , he was urged to take a seat with them , and invited to ask a blessing . He now began to feel himself among friends , and at liberty to speak of divine things ; and the family seemed gratified in listening to his conversation . In the morning , he offered to pay for his lodging , but the people would take nothing . He travelled on , till late in the morning , when , finding no hotel , he stopped at a private house for breakfast . While waiting , he lost no time to recommend Christ to the family . When ready to depart , the mistress of the house would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his horse had eaten . And so he went on , asking for and receiving refreshment when he wanted it , and offering to pay for it , as any other traveller would do ; but no one would take any thing , although they did not know but he had plenty of money . " What does this mean ? " said he to himself . " I was never treated in this manner on a journey before . " He recollected the dollar he had given the poor woman , and the passage of Scripture , which induced him to do it , and said , " I have been well paid . It is indeed safe lending to the Lord . " On the second day after he left the cottage in the wilderness , he arrived safely at home , having been at no expense on the way . The Lord has the control of all events . The hearts of all men are in his hands . It was He who inclined the hearts of the people to be kind and hospitable to his servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . About a year and a half after this , a stranger called at Mr. M. 's house , and asked for some refreshment . In the course of their conversation , Mr. M. asked the stranger whether the people in those parts where he lived paid much attention to religion . " Not much , " he replied ; " but in a town twenty or thirty miles distant , there has been a powerful revival . The commencement of it was very extraordinary . The first person that was awakened and brought to repentance , was a poor woman , who lived in a very retired place . She told her friends and neighbors that a stranger was driven into her house by a thunder storm , and talked to her so seriously , that she began , while listening to his discourse to feel concerned about her soul . The gentleman was much affected , when he found she had no Bible ; and after he had left the house to go on his journey , returned again , and gave her a dollar to buy one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it diligently . She did so ; and it had been the means , as she believed , of her salvation . The neighbors wondered at this ; and it was the means of awakening them to a deep concern for the salvation of their souls . As many as thirty or forty are rejoicing in God their Savior . " Mr. M. who had listened to this narrative , with his heart swelling more and more with wonder , gratitude , and joy , could refrain no longer ; but with hands and eyes raised to heaven , exclaimed , " My God , thou hast paid me again ! " When we lend to the Lord , he always pays us with " good measure , pressed down and running over . " An Indian story . In the early settlement of this country a strange Indian arrived at an inn in Litchfield , Connecticut , and asked for something to eat ; at the same time saying that , as he had been unsuccessful in hunting , he had nothing to pay . The woman who kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but called him hard names . But a man who sat by , seeing that the Indian was suffering for want of food , told her to give him what he wanted at his expense . When the Indian had finished his supper , he thanked the man , and assured him that he should be faithfully recompensed , whenever it was in his power . Some years after this , the man had occasion to go from Litchfield to Albany , where he was taken prisoner by the Indians , and carried to Canada . Some of them proposed that he should be put to death ; but an old woman demanded that he should be given to her , that she might adopt him in place of a son , who had been killed in the war . This was done , and he passed the winter in her family . The next summer , while he was at work alone in the woods , a strange Indian came and asked him to go to a certain place on a given day , which he agreed to do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fears increased , and his promise was broken . But the Indian came again and renewed the request . The man made another engagement , and kept his word . On reaching the spot , he found the Indian provided with ammunition , two muskets , and two knapsacks . He was ordered to take one of each ; which he did , and followed his conductor . In the day time , they shot the game that came in their way , and at night , they kindled a fire and slept by it . But the Indian observed a mysterious silence as to the object of their expedition . After travelling in this manner many days , they came to the top of a mountain , from which they saw a number of houses in the midst of a cultivated country . The Indian asked him if he knew the ground , and he eagerly answered , " It is Litchfield ? " The Indian then recalled to his mind the scene at the inn , and bidding him farewell , exclaimed , " I am that Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Disinterested Benevolence . A traveller in Asia Minor , in a time of distressing drought , found a vase of water under a little shed by the road-side , for the refreshment of the weary traveller . A man in the neighborhood was in the habit of bringing the water from a considerable distance , and filling the vase every morning , and then going to his work . He could have had no motive to do this , but a kind regard to the comfort of weary travellers , for he was never there to receive their thanks , much less their money . This was benevolence . SECTION IV .  --  MANNERS . POLITENESS . Rev. Dr. Witherspoon , President of New-Jersey College , once gave out Politeness , to a division of one of his classes , as a subject for composition . The young gentlemen were delighted with it ; and when the time came for reading , some of them expatiated upon it largely , learnedly , and politely . After they had all read , they waited for the President to sum up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told them , he should only give them a short definition , which they might always remember . " POLITENESS , " said he , " IS REAL KINDNESS , KINDLY EXPRESSED . " This is the sum and substance of all true politeness ; and if my readers will put it in practice , they will be surprised to see how every body will be charmed with their manners . Good Breeding . Gassendi was a youth of such extraordinary abilities and attainments as to command universal admiration ; but in his manners he was generally silent , never ostentatiously obtruding upon others his own knowledge . He was never in a hurry to give his opinion before he knew that of the persons who were conversing with him . He was never fond of displaying himself . I knew a young man whose behavior was directly the opposite of Gassendi 's : a compound of ignorance , self-conceit , and impudence . He was forward to talk in all companies . His opinion , on all subjects , was cheap  --  a gift that went a-begging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the mechanic how to use his tools ; the merchant , how to make his gains ; the doctor , how to cure his patient ; the minister , how to preach ; and the cook , how to bake her bread . He wanted only a pair of long ears to complete his character . SECTION V.  --  OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD . A BLACK BOY Some boys are mean enough to ridicule others for natural defects , for which they are not to blame ; and it is a very common thing to consider the color of the skin as a mark of inferiority . But even if it were so , it would be no ground of reproach , for it is the color which God gave . Mr. Southey , the poet , relates that , when he was a small boy , there was a black boy in the neighborhood , who was called Jim Dick . Southey and a number of his play fellows , as they were collected together one evening at their sports , began to torment the poor black boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other nicknames . The poor fellow was very much grieved , and soon left them . Soon after , these boy 's had an appointment to go a skating , and on that day Southey broke his skates . After all his rude treatment of poor Jim , he was mean enough to go and ask him to lend his skates . " O yes , John , " Jim replied , " you may have them and welcome . " When he went to return them , he found Jim sitting in the kitchen reading his Bible . As Southey handed Dick his skates , the latter looked at him with tears in his eyes , and said , " John , do n't ever call me blackamoor again , " and immediately left the room . Southey burst into tears , and from that time resolved never again to abuse a poor black  --  a resolution which I hope every one of my readers will make and never break . But , if you will follow the example of this poor colored boy , and return good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make for an injury . The converted soldier . A soldier in the East Indies , a stout , lion-looking , lion-hearted man , had been a noted prizefighter , and a terror to those who knew him . With one blow he could level a strong man to the ground . That man sauntered into the mission chapel , heard the gospel , and was alarmed . He returned again and again , and at last , light broke in upon his mind , and he became a new creature . The change in his character was marked and decided . The lion was changed into a lamb . Two months afterwards , in the mess-room , some of those who had been afraid of him before began to ridicule him . One of them said , " I 'll put it to the test whether he is a Christian or not ; " and taking a basin of hot soup , he threw it into his bosom . The whole company gazed in breathless silence , expecting that the lion would start up , and murder him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waistcoat , and wiped his scalded breast , he calmly turned round and said , " This is what I must expect : If I become a Christian , I must suffer persecution . " His comrades were filled with astonishment . This was overcoming evil with good . If the reader will follow this man 's example , he will save himself a world of difficulty . The forgiving school boy . In a school in Ireland , one boy struck another ; and when he was about to be punished , the injured boy earnestly begged for his pardon . The master inquired why he wished to prevent so deserved a punishment ; to which he replied , that he had read in the New-Testament that Jesus Christ said we should forgive our enemies ; " and I forgive him , and beg he may not be punished for my sake . " SECTION VI .  --  USE OF THE TONGUE . ADVANTAGES OF SPEAKING THE TRUTH . It is a great advantage to any one to have the confidence of others , so far that his word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence is to be acquired only by always speaking the truth ; and especially , by adhering so closely to the fact that people will not only believe that we mean to speak the truth , but that they will feel confident that we have neither mistaken the facts , nor added any coloring , nor kept back any thing , to make it appear different from the reality . The following story shows how great an advantage one may derive from having this confidence in his strict veracity established : Petrarch , the celebrated Italian poet , by his strict regard for truth , secured the unbounded confidence of Cardinal Colonna , in whose family he resided . A violent quarrel broke out among the Cardinal 's numerous family of servants , which ended in a fight . The Cardinal , in order to investigate the affair , and punish the offenders , assembled all his people and put them under oath to tell the whole truth . Everyone took the oath , not excepting the bishop of Luna , the Cardinal 's own brother . Petrarch , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , saying , " As to you , Petrarch , your word is sufficient . " Our readers will perceive how great an advantage it will be to them to have always such a strict regard to the exact truth , that their word will be considered as good as an oath . Remember the bright side . When Peter the Great heard any one speaking ill of another , he would inquire , " Is there not a fair side , also , to the character of the person of whom you are speaking ? Come , tell me what good qualities you have remarked about him . " If , in speaking of others , we should look always at the fair side , and see what good things we can say of them , it would make us feel better towards them ; it would be doing them a service instead of an injury ; it would tend to make peace , rather than foment strife . SECTION VII .  --  PUNCTUALITY . EXAMPLE OF WASHINGTON . When Washington appointed the hour of twelve to meet Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall while the clock was striking twelve . His dinner hour was four o'clock . If his guests were not there at the time , he never waited for them . New members of Congress , who were invited to dine with him , would frequently come in when dinner was half over ; and he would say to them , " Gentlemen , we are punctual here . My cook never asks whether the company has arrived , but whether the hour has . " In 1799 , when on a visit to Boston , he appointed eight o'clock in the morning as the hour when he would set out for Salem . While the Old South clock was striking eight , he was mounting his horse . The company of cavalry , who had volunteered to escort him , was parading in Tremont street , and did not overtake him till he had reached Charles River Bridge . On their arrival , the General said , " Major , I thought you had been too long in my family not to know when it was eight o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one of the greatest musicians of his age . His musical powers were developed while he was a child , and excited the greatest admiration . But he was as great a lover of regular habits as of song . No company or persuasion could keep him up beyond his regular time for going to bed . For this reason , he could seldom be persuaded to go to a concert in the night . The moment the clock struck eight , away ran Samuel , in the midst of his most favorite amusement . Once he rose up from the first part of the Messiah , saying , " Come , mamma , let us go home , or I sha n't be in bed by eight . " When some friends talked of carrying him to the queen , and his father asked him if he was willing to go , he replied , " Yes , with all my heart ; but I wo n't stay beyond eight . " This was a wise resolution ; for children are sadly injured , by being kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following amusing sketch , though perhaps fictitious , gives a pretty faithful picture of many a man 's life : " When a child , I was scolded for being too late at school ; when a boy , I was cuffed and kicked for being too late at my work ; and when a man , I was turned away for being behind my time on a particular occasion when my services were wanted . " My uncle Jonathan was well to do in the world , and as his nephews were his nearest relations , we had reason to expect that his property would come among us . He had , however , one peculiarity , which effectually shut his door against me . He never was five minutes too late in an appointment in his life , and thought most contemptuously of those who were . I really believe that I was a bit of a favorite with him until my unfortunate failing justly offended him . " He had occasion to go a journey , and I was directed to be with him at seven in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas ! I was " Five minutes too late , " and he had left the house . " Knowing his particularity , I hurried after him , and running till I could scarcely stand , arrived at one end of the street just in time to see the coach go off with my uncle at the other . Dearly did I pay for being " Five minutes too late . " " My Uncle did not return for a month , and certainly showed more forbearance toward me than he was ever known to do on a similar occasion ; for in a letter he stated , that if I could be punctual , he should wish me to meet him on his return , to take charge of his portmanteau , and thereby make some amends for my misconduct . Off I set , but knowing that coaches frequently arrive a quarter of an hour after their set time , I thought a minute or two could be of no consequence . The coach unfortunately , was " horridly exact , " and once more I was after my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My Uncle Jonathan never forgave me , fully believing that I had done it on purpose to get rid of the trouble of carrying his portmanteau . Years rolled away , and I was not so much as permitted to enter the door of my Uncle Jonathan . " Time , however , heals many a sore , and while it ruffles many a smooth brow , smooths many a ruffled temper . My Uncle Jonathan so far relented , that when about to make his will , he sent to me to call upon him exactly at ten o'clock . Determined to be in time , I set off , allowing myself some minutes to spare and pulling out my watch at the door , found that for once in my life I had kept my appointment to the second . The servant , to my surprise , told me , that my Uncle Jonathan had ordered the door to be shut in my face for being behind my time . It was then I found out my watch was too slow , and that I was exactly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier on that occasion I might have been provided for , but now I am a poor man , and a poor man I am likely to remain . However , good may arise from my giving this short account of my foolish habit , as it may possibly convince some of the value of punctuality , and dispose them to avoid the manifold evils of being " Five minutes too late . " " Few young persons are sensible of the importance of punctuality , because they are not aware of the value of time . But time is money ; and to rob a man of his time , by obliging him to wait beyond the appointed hour to meet your engagement with him , is equivalent to robbing him of so much money as he could have earned in the lost time . The habit of punctuality must be acquired early . Be punctual in the family and school , and you will be a punctual man . SECTION VIII .  --  CONTENTION . DANGER OF CONTENTION . Quarrelling generally arises from selfishness and anger . Selfishness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will yield none of its own . The selfish person is therefore continually coming in conflict with others ; and , as impediments are thrown in the way of his gratification , his passions are roused . Anger is a species of insanity . When one yields to his passions , he loses self-control . He takes an enemy into his bosom , and suffers himself to be nosed about by him at will . No one can tell what dreadful thing he may do when once he gives a loose rein to his passions . " The beginning of strife is as the letting out of waters . " When you open a little drain to a pond of water , it runs slowly at first , in a very small stream ; but the body of water above rushes into the channel and wears it deeper , and that increases the pressure and widens it still more , till presently the whole body comes pouring forth in an irresistible torrent . One dry season , in the summer , a man in Vermont , who owned a mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found his water failing , so that his mill was likely to stop . To prevent this , he collected together a few of the neighbors , and dug a little trench from the pond to the stream that carried his mill . At first it ran very slowly and quietly along , till it began to wear away the channel , and to turn the force of the body of water in the pond in that direction , when it increased violently , tore away the banks , and poured the whole contents of the pond into the little stream , carried off the mill , and rushed on with impetuous fury through the valley , sweeping away fences , bridges , barns , houses , and every thing that came in its way . At a place called Brag Corner , in the State of Maine , a small stream falls into the Sandy river , on which a superior grist-mill was erected a few years since . The stream not affording water enough , a pond containing fifty or one hundred acres , having no outlet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , was connected with the stream that carried the mill by an artificial canal . The water of the pond began to gully away the gravel over which it was made to run , and having formed a regular channel , defied all human control , and , in the space of six hours , cut a ravine seventy feet deep , and let out the whole pond , sweeping away the mill , foundation and all , and carrying away a house and blacksmith 's shop , which stood near , not giving the owner time to save any thing of consequence from his house . Such , Solomon says , is strife . When you begin to quarrel , you know not where it will end . It not unfrequently terminates in the death of one of the parties , as in the following case : A boy about eleven years of age , son of Mr. Philip Petty , of Westport , R. I. , took his father 's gun , as he said , to go a gunning . His elder brother attempted to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , and in the course of the scuffle , the gun went off and lodged the contents in the younger one 's bowels . He lingered a few hours in great agony and died . How must the other one feel , to think that the quarrel , which he began , led to the death of his brother . How much safer to take Solomon 's advice , and " leave off contention before it be meddled with . " Danger of Indulging anger . Frederick Jones was the son of a rich manufacturer . His father being engrossed in business , the children were left to the care of their mother , who , being a weak woman , did not restrain them as she ought . There were four , but three of them died ; and Frederick being left the only child , was indulged still more . At a very early age he showed his angry temper ; and he became such a little tyrant that the very dogs and cats about the house were afraid of him . Once , when he was three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver tea-urn , to drag about the room by a string for his coach . And , because his mother refused to let him do so , he seized her cap and tore it from her head . When Frederick was ten years old , he went into the kitchen , where the servants used to let him do as he pleased for fear of his dreadful temper ; for they called him " Mamma 's pet lion . " He had not been long there before he upset the table , knocked down the shovel and tongs , and broke several plates . Not satisfied with this , he collected all the tin things in the middle of the floor , and began battering them with the tongs . The cook , not being very well pleased with this destruction , undertook to lead him out of the kitchen . But the little fury , by shrieking and scratching , got free , and seizing a fork , he threw it at the cook , which struck her in the eye and put it out . Thus , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the sight of her eye entirely . This shows the danger of indulging angry passions ; for no one knows what a dreadful deed he may commit in a fit of anger . It shows also the danger of throwing things at others . It is a very dangerous practice , and sometimes leads to the loss of life . A little while after this , Frederick was playing at the front door of the house , when a boy passing on the other side of the street , called out , " Hallo , Master Fred. , have you put any more people 's eyes out lately ? " This was enough to make him angry . He immediately picked up a large stone , and chasing the boy some distance , threw it at him with all his might . The boy was out of the way of the stone , but it struck a large bull-dog , which , naturally enough , concluded that he was unjustly attacked , and turning upon Frederick , gave him a severe bite in the leg , and tossed him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had to be carried home to his bed , where he lay for several weeks . But nobody pitied him . The people who heard of it , knowing his temper , thought the dog had done a praiseworthy act . After this , Frederick 's father sent him to a boarding school , about twenty miles from home , to a very strict master . Here he was in continual broils with his school-fellows . There was scarcely a boy in the school with whom he did not have a fight . But generally he came off with a bleeding nose or a black eye , because his passions took away his strength , and the other boys were an overmatch for him . His schoolmates generally did not like to fight ; but this angry boy would fly at them for the most trifling thing , and force them to defend themselves . Frederick 's father died before he was twenty years of age ; and as he loved amusement better than business , he sold the manufactory , and travelled in Europe ; where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he was wounded . During his absence , his mother had become a good woman ; and on his return , he found her company disagreeable . She entreated him to break off his evil courses . But this only made him angry . To get rid of her reproofs , he left her and went to one of the Western States . There , while he was engaged at a public house , with some of his wicked companions , talking politics , one of them called him a liar , and he drew out his dirk and stabbed him to the heart . He ran away from the place , but the image of the murdered man haunted him day and night , and made him wretched . He gave himself up to intoxication , and at the age of twenty-three years , fell into a drunkard 's grave , some time after his mother had died of a broken heart on his account . All this came upon Frederick , in consequence of not restraining his passions while a boy . His violent , ungovernable temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but by indulgence it increased in strength , till it became perfectly unmanageable . Be kind to your sister . The following affecting story , which is given in the language of the brother himself , will admonish every boy who reads it , to be kind to his sisters , and especially to avoid blows on the head , as it is probable the blow given this little girl by her brother was the cause of her death . What a shame for a brother to strike his sister ! " One morning in my early life , I remember to have been playing with my younger sister , not then three years old . It was one of those bright mornings in spring , that bring joy and life to the heart , and diffuse gladness and animation through all the tribes of living creatures . Our feelings were in perfect harmony with the universal gladness of nature . Even now I seem to hear the merry laugh of my little sister , as she followed me through the winding alleys of the garden , her cheek suffused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving hair floating in the wind . " She was an only sister , the sole companion of all my childish sports . We were constantly together ; and my young heart went out to hers , with all the affection , all the fondness , of which childhood is capable . Nothing afforded me enjoyment in which she did not participate ; no amusement was sought which we could not share together . " That morning we had prolonged our play till near the hour of breakfast , with undiminished ardor , when at some slight provocation , my impetuous nature broke forth , and in my anger , I struck my little sister a blow with my hand . She turned to me with an appealing look , and the large tears came into her eyes . Her heart was too full to allow her to speak , and shame made me silent . At that moment the breakfast bell summoned us away , and we returned to the house without exchanging a word . The excitement of play was over , and as she sat beside my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that she was pale and sad . A tear seemed ready to start in her eye , which her little self-possession could scarcely repress . It was only when my mother inquired if she was ill , that she endeavored to eat . I was ashamed and grieved , and inwardly resolved to embrace the first opportunity when we were alone , to throw my arms round her neck and entreat her forgiveness . " When breakfast was ended , my mother retired with her into her own room , directing me in the meantime to sit down to my lesson . I seated myself by the window , and ran over my lesson , but did not learn it . My thoughts were perpetually recurring to the scene in the garden and at table . It was long before my mother returned , and when she did , it was with an agitated look , and hurried step , to tell me that my poor Ellen was very ill . I asked eagerly if I might go to her , but was not permitted , lest I should disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her recovery , but to no purpose . The disease , which was in her head , constantly increased in violence , and she became delirious . It was not until evening that I was permitted to see her . She was a little recovered from the severity of her pain , and lay with her eyes closed , and her little hand resting on the pillow beneath her head . How I longed to tell her the sorrow I felt for my unkindness to her in the morning and how much I had suffered for it during the day . But I was forbidden to speak to her , and was soon taken out of the room . During that night and the day following , she continued to grow worse . I saw her several times , but she was always insensible of my presence . Once indeed , she showed some signs of consciousness , and asked for me ; but immediately relapsed into her former state . " On the morning of the third day , I rose at an early hour , and repaired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . As I entered , she drew me to her , and for some time was silent , while the tears flowed fast down her face . I first learned that my sweet sister was dead , as my mother drew aside the curtain that concealed her from me . I felt as though my heart would break . The remembrance of her affection for me , and my last unkind deed , revived in my mind ; and burying my face in the folds of the curtain , I wept long and bitterly . " I saw her laid in the coffin , and lowered into the grave . I almost wished to lie down there with her , if so I might see once more her smile and hear my forgiveness in her sweet voice . " Years have passed away and I am now a man  --  but never does the recollection of this incident of my early life fail to awaken bitter feelings of grief and remorse . And never do I see my young friends exchanging looks or words of anger , without thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teazing and being teazed . Some children take great delight in teazing . The way to avoid such annoyances is , to take no notice of them . Respect yourself too much to be disturbed by those who disregard the common courtesies of life . If they find they can not teaze you , they will cease to make the attempt . The late Dr. Bowditch ( a man who attained to great eminence , as a man of learning and science ) , was the son of a poor sailor . His parents were so poor that he was obliged to wear his summer clothes to school , during the whole winter . His schoolmates would sometimes laugh at him , because he wore such thin clothes . But they could never make him angry , or disturb his equanimity . All the notice he took of their jeers was , to laugh at them for thinking that he was unable to bear the cold . If you follow his example , you will never suffer much from being teazed . CHAPTER IV . BAD COMPANY AND BAD HABITS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men . For they sleep not except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall . " Mr. Green , the Reformed Gambler , relates that , at the age of sixteen , he was laboring industriously , in the city of Cincinnati , and saving his wages . But he became acquainted with a bad set of boys , who visited a ten-pin alley . In his leisure hours , instead of spending his time in reading and treasuring up useful knowledge , he would frequent this den of iniquity ; and Sabbath days , instead of going to meeting , he would go with the same set of boys to a place of amusement and sin , a little way out of the city . In a short time , this evil company had erased every tender affection from his bosom . On one of these misspent Sabbaths , he fell in with a rough set of lawless boys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus engaged by the city marshal . The next morning , a stranger , whom he met at his boarding house , inquired of him respecting the different places of amusement in the city , and he took him to the ten-pin alley , where he was in the habit of going . While they were there , engaged in bowling , a man came staggering in , to all appearance , half drunk . He pulled out three thimbles , and tried to find some one to play with him for drink . This is a swindler 's game , through which he picks the pockets of fools , by persuading them to bet that they can tell under which of three thimbles he places a ball . It is all a cheat . The landlord played and won , and the man appeared very angry ; but this was only a bait , to blind the eyes of the young men , and induce them to bet . They were caught ; and they lost what money they had , Mr. Green two dollars , and the stranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . At length , the man who was with Green went to the Mayor 's office , and related the story ; and the city marshal , having seen Green the day before engaged in a fight , suspected that he was leagued with the gamblers , and had him arrested ; and though no proof was brought against him , he was fined and sent to jail . There he was kept for several months , in company with counterfeiters , murderers , highwaymen , and gamblers , whose principal amusement was card-playing ; when he was discharged penniless , in rags , and with a bad character . This was the commencement of his career of vice , his reformation from which is the next thing to a miracle . All this came upon him in consequence of keeping bad company . Learn from it to avoid evil company and betting . The boy that suffers himself to bet the smallest amount , has already entered the downhill road of the gambler 's career . And there is no evil that can be named but he may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might as well expect to go into lazarhouse , without being infected , as to go into bad company , and not fall into evil habits . Profaneness . Perhaps there is no bad company to which boys are more exposed than the profane ; and none which is more corrupting . Young people insensibly fall into the habits of those with whom they associate . If they hear them interlard their conversation with by-words and oaths , they will be strongly tempted to do the same . They will begin , perhaps , with by-words and little oaths , which show a disposition to be profane , without courage to carry it out . But they will not long stop here . They will soon overcome the chidings of conscience , and then they can be as foul-mouthed as any of their companions . This vice hardens the heart , and prepares it for every other ; for he who despises God will despise man . He who takes the name of God in vain , will not hesitate to break all his commandments . Profaneness is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is little and mean . It is treating with the utmost indignity our Greatest Benefactor . It is a kind of gratuitous wickedness ; for there is no motive for it but a disposition to do evil . The profane boy is a dangerous companion . He will lead you into you know not what mischief and difficulty . The only way is to avoid him , as you would a black snake , or a person that has the small pox . If you go with him , he will , most likely , lead you to ruin . Washington 's opinion of profaneness . No gentleman will use profane language . It is an outrage upon good manners . No one can be called a gentleman , who is guilty of it . It is a vice that has always been held in detestation by the great and the good . General Washington would never allow it in his army . In 1757 , while a colonel , at Fort Cumberland , when he was a young man , he issued an order , expressing his " great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearing , and threatening those who were guilty of it with severe punishment . The day after he took the command of the Revolutionary army he issued a similar order . In August , 1776 , he issued another order against this vice , in which he speaks of it as " a vice so mean and low , without any temptation , that every man of sense and character detests and despises it . " He also strictly forbade gaming and drunkenness . Howard 's opinion of Swearers . Howard , the Philanthropist , standing in the street , heard some dreadful oaths and curses from a public house opposite . Having occasion to go across , he first buttoned up his pocket , saying to a by-stander , " I always do this , when I hear men swear , as I think that any one who can take God 's name in vain , can also steal , or do any thing else that is bad . " God has set a mark upon this vice . He not unfrequently punishes it , by directly answering the prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearer . He had a singular habit of calling on God to curse his eyes . After some years , this awful imprecation was verified . He was afflicted with a disease in his eyes , which terminated in total blindness . This so affected his general system , that he gradually sunk under it , and went to give up his account . A number of similar cases , some of them still more awful , you will find in the tract entitled , " The Swearer 's Prayer . " Playing Truant . Playing truant when sent to school , is almost always the means of getting into bad company ; and bad company leads to ruin . A boy thirteen years old , was brought before the police court in Boston , charged with stealing a gold pen from a lawyer 's office . He had been in the habit of coming into the offices , in the building , and selling apples . The gentleman from whom he stole the pen had furnished him money to fill his basket ; and he returned his kindness by stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother appeared before the court , and plead earnestly for her boy , saving that he was a good boy to her , except that he played truant from school . He then got into the company of a gang of boys , who peddle apples ,  --  a thievish set ,  --  and of them he also learned to steal . He was sent to the House of Reformation ; which is a prison for boys , where they are kept at work and study , but not allowed their liberty . Ruin of a Deacon 's son . Several years ago , a young man about twenty years of age , filthy in his appearance , and shabbily dressed , called at the house of a clergyman in the city of New York . His countenance , though haggard , bore the marks of intelligence . The young man said he had been at his church the previous evening , and was desirous of having some conversation with the minister . He was requested to open his mind freely . He said he was the son of a deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of property and influence , and he himself had always moved in the most respectable society . He had come to New York in order to become acquainted with business , and prepare himself for an active and useful life . But he soon found himself surrounded with new temptations , without the restraining influences of home and friends . He fell into bad company . His vicious associates led him to the theatre , and when his passions were excited by what he saw , and stimulated by intoxicating liquors , he was persuaded to visit places of infamy and crime . These indulgences called for more money than he could honestly obtain ; but his appetites , once excited , could not be easily restrained ; and he had recourse to his employer 's money drawer to supply the deficiency . He eased his conscience , in this act , and deceived himself , with the hope of repaying it before he was detected . But in this he was mistaken . He was detected , tried , found guilty , and sentenced to the penitentiary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , during which time he had been wandering about the city , ashamed to be seen or known . He had come to ask advice . The clergyman advised him by all means to go home to his father ; assuring him that it was his only hope , for if he remained in the city , he would fall into the company of his old associates and be ruined . With the deepest agony , he exclaimed , " How can I ever return to my father 's house ? How can I ever meet him or the virtuous companions of my youth ? No ! No ! I am fallen  --  disgraced ! I have been a felon , and in prison ! No , I would rather die a vagabond in the street , than to see the face of my father , or the faces of the young people , who were my associates in the days when I felt myself as good as they . " He was yet unhumbled . He was yet unwilling , like the prodigal , to return to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he promised that the next morning he would set off for home . But he had not the moral courage to fulfil his purpose . He was ashamed to arise and go to his father . He continued to roam about the streets , and was again detected in stealing . This anecdote shows not only the danger of bad company , but the peril of young men who go from the country to the city to engage in business . They had better remain at home , unless their principles are firmly established upon the foundation of true religion . There is nothing to be gained in the city that is worth the exposure of morals and character . Bad Books . Books are company ; and the company of bad books is as dangerous as the company of bad boys or bad men . Goldsmith , who was a novel-writer of some note , writing to his brother about the education of a nephew , says , " Above all things never let your nephew touch a novel or a romance . " An opinion given in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he knew the character of novels , and had no nice scruples on the subject of religion , his opinion ought to have great weight . An Example for boys . A boy in London , in destitute circumstances , was put out as an apprentice to a mechanic . It is the business of the youngest apprentice to do all the errands and drudgery of the establishment , and frequently of his master 's family also . He was often sent by the workmen and older apprentices , to procure intoxicating liquors for them ; of which all of them partook , except himself , because , as they said , it did them good . But because he refused to drink he was made an object of ridicule among them . They said he had not sufficient manhood to drink rum . But he had sufficient manhood to refuse to drink rum ; and it requires much more to refuse than to drink . Nothing can be more false than the idea that it is courageous and manly to fall in with the habits and practices of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of cowardice rather than of courage . The sheep is the most timid of animals . But if a man is driving a flock of sheep , and one of them gets frightened and turns out of the way , all the rest will follow , no matter if it is over the railing of a bridge into a river . The boy that drinks or swears or plays truant , or breaks the Sabbath , because his companions do , is as courageous as  --  a sheep ! While the workmen and apprentices were revelling over their rum , and insulting and misusing this boy , he often retired and vented his grief in tears . But a few years changed the aspect of things . As they grew up , and entered upon the world for themselves , all the older apprentices fell into habits of dissipation , and finally sunk into the drunkard 's grave . But the little boy , at whose abstinence they used to scoff , grew up a sober and respectable man , engaged in business for himself , and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had in his employ one hundred and ninety men , none of whom used ardent spirits . All this came from his having courage to say NO , to those who held the poisoned cup to his lips . Poison . A little boy , four years old , wandered from his home , one day , in the town of Turin , N. Y. , to a field where some men were at work . There he found a bottle of spirits , of which he drank freely . When found , he was lying on the ground , unable to speak . He was carried home to his mother , and the Doctor was sent for ; but he could do nothing for the poor boy . He remained stupid till evening , and then died . The rum had poisoned him . Not a great while before this , his father was drowned in a fit of intoxication . " Touch not , taste not , handle not . " " Am I to blame , Mother ? " A lad in Philadelphia , some years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were what are called moderate drinkers , were displeased with him . The boy said nothing for sometime , but bore patiently the chidings of his mother . At length , he undertook to vindicate his conduct : " Am I to blame , mother ? Sister Mary has married a drunken husband , who abuses her every day . Sister Susan 's husband was intemperate , and has gone off , and left her , and you are obliged to take her home , and take care of her children . Brother James comes home drunk almost every night . And because I have joined the cold water company , and you are likely to have one sober person in the family , you are scolding at me ! Am I to blame ? " How it happened . There was a young man in college , one of the brightest , who was greatly beloved for his personal attractions , frankness , good nature , and generosity . But he was occasionally found flushed with wine , and then he was turbulent and ungovernable . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed a misdemeanor for which he was expelled from college . Soon after this , he became very dissipated , abandoned his studies , and finally became a sot . People wondered how such a lovely young man could fall into such ruinous courses . A young lady , conversing about him , said she remembered that , when he was a little boy , just beginning to study Latin , she saw his mother bring him a loaf of cake and a glass of wine for a lunch . She then thought that perhaps he would become a drunkard , and so it turned out . Beware of the first glass . GOING TO THE THEATRE . William R. was a young man of good habits  --  a lovely youth , " the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . " He was sent from the country , where he had been brought up , to the city of New York , where he was employed as a clerk . Hearing much of the Theatre , and seeing it puffed in the newspapers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see what was done there . But , he was so fascinated with what he heard and saw there , that he went again ; just as some birds are so charmed with the gaze of the serpent , as to run straight into his mouth ! There William fell into evil company , who enticed him away to the haunts of infamy . Intoxicated with these things , he continued to frequent the theatre until the expense was more than his earnings . He then began to steal money from his employer . He was detected and fled . After some time , his friends , hoping he had learned something from experience , sent him to another city . For a time he seemed to be thoroughly reformed . But evil habits once acquired are not easily overcome . He soon fell into the same round of folly and sin , till he lost his character and his employment , and in his despair , committed suicide ! Here , again , my readers will see that TOTAL ABSTINENCE is the only safe rule . This boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just once . If he had resisted an idle curiosity in the beginning , he would have been saved . There are some things that we ought not to desire to see . Among these , are the things that are done at theatres and other places of amusement and pleasure , which abound in cities . It is dangerous to look upon them . It is like looking down from a giddy height upon a rapid current of water . It turns the head , the foothold is endangered , and the life put in jeopardy . The Passion for Gaming . The following anecdote shows the strength of this passion , when once it has gained the ascendancy : A colored man employed as a fireman on board a steamboat , between Cincinnati and New Orleans , lost all his money , at play with his companions . He then staked his clothing , which he also lost . Having nothing more , he laid down his free papers and staked himself . Losing this time , also , he was actually sold by the winner to a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , when he will play at the hazard of his own liberty , which most men esteem dearer than life ! Young man , if you once contract this habit , you will have no power to restrain it . You will gratify the passion at the hazard of every thing . My mother used to relate an anecdote of some young men , who retired to a garret to play at cards , where they would not be seen . There was an open cask of powder in the room , and they had stuck a lighted candle into the powder , which served the purpose of a candlestick . The man at whose house they were , coming to the loft for some purpose , observed them a few moments before the candle had burned down to the powder , and creeping softly so as not to alarm them , snatched away the candle . In a few moments more they would have been blown to atoms . The only security against gambling is similar to that against intemperance : TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM GAMES OF CHANCE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gaming , you will be safe from the snare . But with the knowledge of such games , you will scarcely escape its seductions . Danger of Playing for amusement . There was a family , consisting of the father and mother , two sons , and one daughter , who lived in Tennessee . The father and mother used to play cards with the children for amusement . The sons went to college , and the father 's business required him to be much of the time from home . On one occasion , while the sons were at home , during vacation , the father wrote a letter requesting the eldest son to bring him five thousand dollars . The young man was accordingly despatched with the money . He went on board a steamboat , where he met a company of gamblers , in the garb of gentlemen , who professed to be only playing for amusement . To this he had been accustomed , from his childhood , at his father 's house , and thought no harm of it . He was solicited to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they agreed to bet one dollar on the game . He lost , and then doubled his bet , and went on so , till soon he had lost what little money he had about him . He became much excited , went to his state-room and drew out a large package of bills , and returned to the table , where very soon he had lost twelve hundred dollars . He now came to the place where he was to leave the steamboat and go to his father ; but he was so intoxicated with the excitement of the gaming table , that he went on . He played on , and continued to lose . Several of the more respectable passengers tried to get him away . But the passion for gaming had taken such possession of his heart , that he was held to the spot , till his package of five thousand dollars was all in the hands of three hardened gamblers . Two of them afterwards won from him his watch and his diamond breast pin , and left him without money enough to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mother received a letter from his father , saying that he had heard nothing from him . She immediately took her younger son and went in pursuit of him . But , the only intelligence they could gain concerning him was , that he had been ruined by a company of gamblers . The father immediately started for New-Orleans , in search of his son , but hearing nothing from him , he , in despair , took to drinking , and returned , after two years ' absence ,  --  " his frame worn  --  his cheek pale  --  his eyes wild and fevered  --  his lips parched  --  his hopes crushed  --  his very life only the motion of excitement and passion  --  his very soul shattered  --  his property mortgaged . " In a short time he went again in pursuit of his son , but returned home , heart-broken , and died of delirium tremens , the drunkard 's disease . The daughter and the other son , both became maniacs . Thus was a whole family ruined , in consequence of the foolish habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never learned to play cards , he would , in all probability , have gone on his way , and reached his father in safety , with the money . And , if he had been firmly principled against playing , his answer , " I never play , " would have stopped all solicitation . I travelled on those Western waters , when I was a young man , at a time when gambling was carried on every hour of the day , and almost the live-long night ; and yet I was never solicited to play . And why not , as well as this young man ? Because , ( 1 . ) I did not know how to play ; ( 2 . ) I felt a great aversion to it , and did not hesitate to show it ; and ( 3 . ) I made myself known as a religious man . These three things will always be sufficient to defend a young man against the most wily gamesters in the world . The case I have related , is only one among hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a promising young man has been accomplished , by alluring him to play cards for amusement , and then gradually leading him on to stake first small sums , which he is permitted to win , and then he is persuaded to go on , till he has not a farthing left . There is a set of men , in all parts of the country , who make a business of gambling , and league together to draw in unwary youth and strip them of all they possess , and of more , if they can lay their hands upon money not their own . Beware , then , how you excite a passion for gaming , by playing for amusement . I am afraid of all games ; but , especially , all games of chance . I think there is a strong tendency in them all to excite a passion for gaming , which will not be satisfied without something more stimulating than mere amusement . If I see a boy rolling marbles , or a young man shuffling cards , I think he is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It treads on the heels of low company and gambling . We frequently hear boys crying out , with all the braggardism of a practiced gambler , " I 'll bet " so and so . But all betting is gambling . " TOUCH NOT , TASTE NOT , HANDLE NOT . " CHAPTER V. INDUSTRY , LABOR , &c.; Early discipline , in laborious and useful occupations , is indispensable to the formation of a good character . If God had designed that we should live at ease , without exertion , he would have furnished every thing to our hand , without any effort of our own . In his holy word he has taught us the necessity of helping ourselves , requiring us to labor six days for one of rest , and ordaining that , " if any would not work , neither should he eat . " The same lesson he taught an untutored Indian , by the voice of Nature . A lesson from the Birds and Fishes . Rev. Mr. Heckewelder , a Moravian Missionary , remarked to an Indian , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very fond of working , as he had never seen him idling away his time as was common with the Indians . " My friend , " replied the Indian " the fishes in the water , and the birds in the air have taught me to work . When I was a young man , I loitered about , doing nothing , just like the other Indians , who say that working is only for whites and negroes , but that the Indians were made to hunt the deer , and catch the beaver , otter , and other animals . But one day while I was hunting , I came to the banks of the Susquehannah , and sat down near the water 's edge to rest awhile . There I was forcibly struck at seeing with what industry the sun-fish heaped small stones together to make secure places for their spawn ; and all this labor they did with their mouth and body , without hands . Presently a little bird , not far from me , raised a song , and while I was looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much grass as it could hold in its bill , passed close by me , and flew into the bush , where I perceived them , both together , busily employed in building their nest , and singing as their work went on . I entirely forgot my hunting , to contemplate the objects that were before me . I saw the birds in the air and the fishes in the water working diligently and cheerfully , and all this without hands . I thought it was strange and I became lost in wonder . I looked at myself , and saw two long arms , provided with hands and fingers , and with joints that might be opened and shut at pleasure . I could , when I pleased , take up any thing with these hands , hold it fast , or let it loose , and carry it along with me . When I walked , I observed that I had a strong body , capable of bearing fatigue , and supported by two stout legs , with which I could climb to the top of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And is it possible , " said I , " that a being so wonderfully formed as I am , was created to live in idleness ; while the birds , which have no hands , and nothing but their little bills to help them , work with cheerfulness , and without being told to do so ? Has then the great Creator given me all these limbs for no purpose ? It can not be : I will try to go to work . I did so , and went away from the village to a spot of good land , where I built a cabin , enclosed ground , sowed corn , and raised cattle . Ever since that time , I have enjoyed a good appetite and sound sleep . While others spend their nights in dancing , and are suffering with hunger , I live in plenty . I keep horses , cows , hogs , and fowls . I am happy . See , my friend , the birds and fishes have brought me to reflection , and taught me to work ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , think it a hardship to work , I hope they will go into the fields , and like this untutored Indian , learn lessons from the creatures whom God has made . There they will find the little ants busy in rearing their habitation ; the mole in raising his hill ; the birds in building their nests ; and the little busy bee , in sucking honey from every flower . Yet all these little creatures appear happy and contented with their lot . If God made them to be happy , as we suppose he did , why did he not make them to live an idle , inactive life ? Evidently because activity is necessary to enjoyment . If you would be happy , then , you must be active . Laziness , or idleness , will certainly make you discontented , wretched , and miserable . As I was one day walking in one of those beautiful avenues that lead out of the village of Saratoga Springs , my attention was arrested by two of those insects , which children call by the homely name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling a round ball , of the size of a walnut , covered with a glutinous substance , dried hard in the sun . I could not be so cruel as to break it in pieces , to gratify my curiosity ; but I suppose it must have contained some treasure that was dear to them  --  probably their eggs . They would labor and tug , with their long arms , to roll it up an ascent ; and if it rolled back again , they would patiently return , and roll it up , showing an example of perseverance well worthy of imitation . Thus God has made all things to be active . All nature , animate and inanimate , calls man to labor . If old ocean did not ebb and flow , and roll its waves , it would stagnate , and become so noxious that no animal could live on the face of the earth . If the earth did not pursue its laborious course around its axis , one half of its inhabitants would be shrouded in perpetual night , while the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's rays . Can you find any thing , in all the vast creation of God , that is idle ? The sluggard , of all God 's works , stands alone  --  idle ! He resembles the stagnant pool , whose impure waters , filled with the loathsome creatures , and all manner of filth , saturate the atmosphere with pestilential vapors , and spread around it disease and death . But , the active , industrious man , resembles the running brook , whose waters are kept limpid and clear by their unceasing flow . " Business first , and then Pleasure . " A man who is very rich now , was very poor when he was a boy . When asked how he got his riches , he replied , " My father taught me never to play till all my work for the day was finished , and never to spend money till I had earned it . If I had but half an hour 's work to do in a day , I must do that the first thing , and in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to play ; and I could then play with much more pleasure than if I had the thought of an unfinished task before my mind . I early formed the habit of doing every thing in its time , and it soon became perfectly easy to do so . It is to this habit that I now owe my prosperity . " Let every boy who reads this , go and do likewise , and he will meet a similar reward . Industry . A gentleman in England had an estate which was worth about a thousand dollars a year . For a while , he kept his farm in his own hands ; but at length , he found himself so much in debt that he was obliged to sell one half of his place , to pay up . The rest , he let to a farmer for twenty-one years . Towards the end of that time , the farmer on coming to pay his rent , asked him whether he would sell his farm . The gentleman was surprised that the farmer should be able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said he , " how it happens , that , while I could not live upon twice as much land , for which I paid no rent , you are regularly paying me five hundred dollars a year for your farm , and able in a few years to purchase it ? " " The reason is plain , " answered the farmer : " You sat still , and said ' Go . ' I got up and said , ' Come . ' You lay in bed , and enjoyed your ease . I rose in the morning , and minded my business . " This anecdote shows the folly of those young men , who set up for gentlemen , and despise labor and useful employment . Though they may begin with a good capital , they will soon run down , if they depend upon others to do their business . If they have nothing , they will certainly gain nothing . Laziness , poverty , and rags , will go together . CHAPTER VI . TRUE GREATNESS . True Greatness does not consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion to the show they can make ; but it would take a great heap of copper coins to make as much value as a very little piece of gold ; and an empty tin kettle will make more sound than a golden vessel filled with the choicest delicacies . When Mr. Jefferson was President of the United States , he was passing a stream on horseback , in Virginia . A beggar approaching it at the same time , asked him to help him over . The President let him get behind him on the horse and ride over . When they had got over , the beggar discovered that he had left his bundle ; and Mr. Jefferson went back again and brought it over . This was true greatness . A man can never be too great to do a kindness to the humblest individual in the world . True Greatness lies not in being too proud to wait on one 's self . Chief Justice Marshall was in the habit of going to market himself , and carrying home his purchases . Frequently he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables in the other . On one of these occasions , a fashionable young man from the North , who had removed to Richmond , was swearing violently because he could find no one to carry home his turkey . Marshall stepped up , and asking him where he lived , said " That is my way , and I will take it for you . " When they came to his house , the young man inquired , " What shall I pay you ? " " O , nothing , " said the Chief Justice , " you are welcome , it was on my way , and no trouble . " " Who is that polite old gentleman , who brought home my turkey for me ? " inquired the young man of a by-stander . " That , " replied he , " is John Marshall , Chief Justice of the United States . " " Why did he bring home my turkey ? " " To give you a severe reprimand , and teach you to attend to your own business , " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is useful ; but especially , the truly great man will never feel above helping himself . His own independence of character depends on his being able to help himself . Dr. Franklin , when he first established himself in business , in Philadelphia , wheeled home the paper which he purchased for his printing office , upon a wheel-barrow , with his own hands . True Greatness does not make a man difficult about his own accommodations . At a time when the court was sitting in Buffalo , N. Y. , and all the public houses were full , there came to the principal hotel a starched up little Frenchman , and called for lodgings . He was shown into a small , but well-furnished room , which was the only one in the house that was vacant . He thought himself insulted ; and with much warmth said , " Me gem'man  --  me no sleep here ! " A little while afterwards Chancellor Kent , the highest judicial officer in the state , called for lodgings . The landlord told him he was full , excepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to such a man as he . But the Chancellor wished to see it ; and on being shown into it , said , " O , this will do very well  --  it is a fine room . " Which do you think was the greater of these two men ? A small mind makes much ado about little things . True Greatness does not consist in being in the fashion . When Dr. Franklin was received at the French Court as American Minister , he felt some scruples of conscience about complying with their fashions of dress . " He hoped , " he said to the Minister , " that as he was a very plain man , and represented a plain republican people , the king would indulge his desire to appear in the court in his usual dress . Independent of this , the season of the year , " said he , " renders the change from yarn stockings to fine silk somewhat dangerous . " The French Minister made him a bow , but said that fashion was too sacred a thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor to mention it to his majesty . The king smiled and returned word that Dr. Franklin was at liberty to appear at court in any dress that he pleased . In spite of that delicate respect for foreigners for which the French are so remarkable , the courtiers could not help staring at first at Dr. Franklin 's Quaker dress . But it soon appeared as though he had been introduced upon this splendid theatre only to demonstrate that great genius , like beauty , " needs not the aid of ornament . " CHAPTER VII . ADVANTAGES OF HONESTY . Colbert . Go the world over , and you will find that " honesty is the best policy . " Jean Baptiste Colbert was born at Rheims , in France , in the year 1617 , of poor parents . When a boy , he was apprenticed to M. Certain , a woollen draper . Young Colbert was very fond of books , and spent his leisure in reading . He had indeed a taste above his station . But his mind was so much on what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Certain , who thought of nothing but of selling cloth , would ridicule him , and tell him he would never make any thing . One day he sent him and the porter with four rolls of cloth , to the hotel of M. Cenani , a French banker , who wished to buy hangings for a country house which he had purchased . The pieces were marked 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ; and as Colbert left the house , M. Certain told him that No. 1 was marked three crowns a yard ; No. 2 , six crowns ; No. 3 , eight crowns ; and No. 4 , fifteen crowns . The banker selected No. 3 , and asked the young man how much it was a yard . Colbert replied , " fifteen crowns . " The porter grinned , but seeing the mistake was on the side of his master he said nothing . There were thirty yards in the piece , and the money was counted out , four hundred and fifty crowns . When Colbert returned , M. Certain said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't think I have , " replied Colbert . " But I think you have , " said the porter . " Do you think so , Moline ? Do you think so ? " cried the old man , throwing down the cloth and examining the tickets . " But , indeed , I might have expected this ; the little rascal could not do otherwise . But I warn you , if you have made a mistake , you shall go to M. Cenani to ask of him the surplus money ; and if he refuses to give it , you shall pay it out of your wages . No. 3 is wanting . No. 3 was worth  --  it was worth six crowns ; no , eight crowns . I am quite puzzled . " " Eight crowns ! Eight crowns ! are you sure of that ? " cried Colbert . " Perhaps you would like to make out that it was I who made the mistake . I tell you No. 3 , was worth eight crowns . I am half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sold it for six . " " On the contrary , " replied Colbert , " stupid creature that I am , I sold it for fifteen . " " Fifteen ! Fifteen ! " cried M. Certain . " You are a fine boy , a good boy , Baptiste . You will one day be an honor to all your family . Fifteen !  --  I could cry with joy ! Fifteen crowns for a piece of cloth not worth six ! Two hundred and ten crowns profit ! O happy day ! " " How , " said Colbert , " would you take advantage ? " " O , perhaps you want to go shares . Certainly I agree to let you have something . " " I can not agree to any such thing , " said Colbert . " I will go to the gentleman I have treated so badly , and beg of him to excuse me , and return him the money he overpaid me . " So saying , he bounded out of the door , leaving his master in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the hotel of M. Cenani . It was with great difficulty that he was admitted to his presence , and then he was ordered away . But he persisted in speaking ; and after apologizing for his mistake , he returned the money . The banker asked him if he knew that he was no judge of cloth . Colbert assured him that it was not worth more than eight crowns . " And you might easily have kept this money for yourself . " " I never thought of that , sir , " replied the young man . " But , if you had thought of it ? " inquired the banker . " It was quite impossible , sir , that such an idea could come into my head . I should as soon have thought of carrying off all that you have here . " " Suppose I should make you a present of this money that you have returned to me with such admirable integrity ? " " What right have I to it ? And why should you give it to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a fine fellow and an honest fellow , " said the banker , and inquired his name . The conversation was suddenly broke off by the arrival of the banker 's carriage . As young Colbert went out , he was seized by the collar , by his enraged master , who abused him in the most frantic manner , and dismissed him from his service . The young man went home ; but his parents were affrighted to see him at that time , fearing some disaster had happened to him . After hearing his story , however , they heartily approved his conduct , and rejoiced that they had such a son . It was but a little while , however , before M. Cenani arrived , and , praising the nobleness and integrity of the boy , proposed to his parents to take him to Paris and put him in his banking house , where he might make a fortune ; which was readily agreed to . Young Colbert soon found himself in a new world . But , denying himself the brilliant attractions with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , as clerk in the banking house . His diligence and faithfulness gained for him the esteem of his employers . He soon mastered the business . No accounts baffled him . And , on arriving at manhood , he became a thorough financier . The most important duties were now entrusted to him ; and he soon became the travelling agent of the bank ; which enabled him also to gratify his taste for the arts and sciences . He made the tour of the French provinces , making commerce his study , and devising means to render it flourishing . In 1648 , he was introduced at Court , where his rare merit and conscientiousness in all affairs gained him great esteem . He was created Marquis of Croissy , and afterwards became Prime Minister . In this capacity , he was eminently useful to France . He improved the roads ; encouraged trade ; founded a chamber of commerce ; colonized India and Canada ; established naval schools ; built ships ; introduced manufactures ; encouraged the fine arts . One can not go even a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding a trace of the great Colbert . The Observatory , the beautiful gardens of the Tuilleries and Rue St. Dennis , the Hotel of Invalids , and many other things of like nature which adorn and do honor to the city , owe their existence to him . He also raised up his father 's family from great poverty to wealth and honor . Colbert 's first step to distinction was an act of honor and honesty which deprived him of the means of earning his daily bread . If there was ever a case , which , to human appearance , would seem to contradict the old proverb , and show that honesty was not the best policy , one would think his was such a case . But the event proved its truth . And to this single trait in his character may be traced all his greatness . His honesty and integrity made him faithful to his employers . This raised him in their esteem , and contributed to strengthen and confirm this trait of character . This he carried into public life ; and his honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to private interest . The whole of this story may be found in Chambers ' Miscellany , published by Gould , Kendall and Lincoln . Would you be great ? Honesty and integrity of character lie at the foundation of all true greatness . You must cultivate sincerity , honesty , and fair dealing in early youth , if you would lay the foundation of future greatness . Two opposite examples . Two boys were passing an orchard on their way from school , in which there were some plum trees , full of nice fruit . " Come , Thomas , " said Henry , " let us jump over and get some plums . Nobody will see us . We can scud along through the tall corn , and come out on the other side . " Thomas replied , " It is wrong . I do n't like to try it . I would rather not have the plums than steal them , and I will run along home . " " You are a coward , " said Henry . " I always knew you was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may go without them . But I shall have some very quick . " Just as Henry was climbing the wall , the owner of the field rose up from the other side . Henry jumped back and ran off as fast as his legs could carry him . Thomas had no reason to be afraid , and he walked along as if nothing had happened . The owner , who had heard the conversation between the two boys , then asked Thomas to step over and help himself to as many plums as he wanted . This story teaches two lessons : ( 1 . ) It shows the advantages of honesty . An honest person is not afraid to look others in the face ; and honesty , in the end , always turns out more to one 's advantage than dishonesty . ( 2 . ) It teaches wherein true courage consists : It is , in being afraid to do wrong . Henry called Thomas a coward , because he was afraid to do wrong ; but he himself sneaked away like a whipped spaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coward . He had neither the courage to resist temptation nor to face danger . Fruits of dishonesty . A young man from the State of Maine , of good abilities , went to Washington city , where he was admitted as a member of the bar , to practice law , with fine prospects . He was respected in society , and was a leader in the choir , in one of the churches in the city . But , in an evil hour , he discovered that there was a considerable amount of money in the Treasury , which had been allowed to claimants , but which had never been called for , and was not likely to be . The young man , thinking he should not be likely to be detected , forged drafts , and obtained money to the amount of several thousand dollars . But , it was not long before his sin found him out . He was detected , found guilty , and sent to the state 's prison . CHAPTER VIII . PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE . SECTION I.  --  READING . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that eats to gratify his appetite  --  an epicure . But he who reads to obtain useful information , and to improve his mind , will be like him who eats to sustain nature  --  strong and healthy . The former will be satisfied with nothing but dainties  --  the latter will prefer plain strong food . Sir William Jones rose to great eminence . When he was a mere child , he was very inquisitive . His mother was a superior woman of great intelligence , and he would apply to her for the information which he desired ; but her constant reply was , " READ AND YOU WILL KNOW . " This gave him a passion for books , which was one of the principal means of making him what he was . But , it is not every one who reads that will become wise . Robert Hall . This great man , when he was a boy about six years of age , was sent to a boarding school , where he spent the week , coming home Saturday and returning Monday . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him two or three books from his father 's library to read at the intervals between the school hours . The books he selected , were not those of mere amusement , but such as required deep and serious thought . Before he was nine years old , he had read over and over again , with the deepest interest , Edwards on the Affections , Edwards on the Will , and Butler 's Analogy . Illustration SECTION II .  --  LOVE OF LEARNING ENCOURAGED . There are many young persons , who have an ardent thirst for knowledge , and a strong desire to obtain an education ; but their circumstances in life seem to forbid the attempt . There are many examples , which afford them encouragement to make the attempt . A large proportion of the men who have risen to the highest distinction , have struggled against the same difficulties which they have to encounter ; and , when they see what has been done by others , they will perceive that it can be done by themselves . Sir Isaac Newton . When Sir Isaac Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes he was sent to open the gates for the men that were driving the cattle to market . At other times , he carried corn to market , or attended the sheep . One day his uncle found him in a hay-loft , working out a mathematical problem , and he was sent to school . There he discovered his great and various talents . At the age of eighteen he was sent to the University at Cambridge , England , where he soon distinguished himself . Benjamin West . West , the celebrated painter , early manifested a genius for this art . His first attempt was made with pens , and red and black ink , upon a portrait of his sister 's child , lying in the cradle . For a long time he had no pencil . Having been told that they were made of camel 's hair , he pulled hairs out of the tail of a cat , of which he made his first brush . Other eminent Persons . Dr. Franklin was the son of a tallow-chandler , and served an apprenticeship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commentary , was employed in the most laborious work on a farm ; William Gifford , one of the most celebrated literary men of his age , was an apprentice to a shoemaker , and wrought out his problems in algebra on a piece of sole-leather , with the point of an awl . SECTION III .  --  DISLIKE OF STUDY . LATIN AND LABOR . John Adams , the second President of the United States , used to relate the following anecdote : " When I was a boy , I had to study the Latin grammar ; but it was dull , and I hated it . My father was anxious to send me to college , and therefore I studied the grammar , till I could bear it no longer ; and going to my father , I told him I did not like study , and asked for some other employment . It was opposing his wishes , and he was quick in his answer . ' Well , John , if Latin grammar does not suit you , you may try ditching ; perhaps that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may put by Latin and try that . ' " This seemed a delightful change , and to the meadow I went . But I soon found ditching harder than Latin , and the first forenoon was the longest I ever experienced . That day I ate the bread of Labor , and glad was I when night came on . That night I made some comparison between Latin grammar and ditching , but said not a word about it . I dug next forenoon , and wanted to return to Latin at dinner ; but it was humiliating , and I could not do it . At night , toil conquered pride ; and though it was one of the severest trials I ever had in my life , I told my father that , if he chose , I would go back to Latin grammar . He was glad of it ; and if I have since gained any distinction it has been owing to the two days labor in that abominable ditch . " Boys may learn several important lessons from this story . It shows how little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at study frequently think it a hardship needlessly imposed on them . But they must do something ; and if set to ditching , would they like that any better ? The opportunity of pursuing a liberal course of study is what few enjoy ; and they are ungrateful who drag themselves to it as to an intolerable task . You may also learn from this anecdote , how much better your parents are qualified to judge of these things than yourselves . If John Adams had continued his ditching instead of his Latin , his name would not probably have been known to us . But , in following the path marked out by his judicious parent , he rose to the highest honors which the country affords . CHAPTER IX . MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS . SECTION I.  --  FICKLENESS . Hunting Squirrels . John Alsop was about fifteen years old , when his father , who had just moved into a new settlement , was clearing land . One day the father and a neighbor were engaged in building a log fence ; which was made of the trunks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they laid the fence one log high , with the ends of each length passing a little way by each other . Notches were cut in the ends , and a block was laid crosswise , where the ends lapped , and then another tier was laid on the cross pieces , till the fence was high enough . To roll up the top logs , they would lay long poles , called skids , one end on the top of the logs , and the other on the ground , and roll up the logs on these . But , as the logs were very heavy , they were obliged to stop several times to rest , or to get a new hold ; and it was John 's business , when they stopped , to put a block the under side of the log , above the skids , to keep it from rolling back . Having given a hard lift , and tugging with all his might , the father called out , " There , Johnny , put under your block quick . " John started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loud chirp of a squirrel struck his ear . Instantly , down went his block , and away he ran after the squirrel , leaving his father and the other man to hold the log till he came back . This anecdote gives you John 's character . He was too fickle to follow any one object or pursuit long enough to accomplish any thing . Thirty years after this , a gentleman who had known him in his youthful days , inquired about him of one of his neighbors , who related this anecdote , and added , " he has been running after squirrels ever since . " He never was steady and persevering in pursuit of any thing . When he was a young man , he could never make up his mind decidedly what employment to follow . He would try one , and get tired of it , and take another ; but followed no business long enough to get well acquainted with it . When he had a family , and found it necessary to make exertion , he was busy early and late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to another ; and " a rolling stone gathers no moss . " He very often changed his employment , and by that means lost all the advantage of past experience . Now , he was a farmer , then a trader , then a post-rider , then a deputy sheriff , then a mechanic , without having learned his trade . By the time he had got fairly started in a new business , he would hear or think of something else , and before any body thought of it , he would change his business . In this way he wasted his money , and kept his family poor , and neglected his children 's education . He was always hunting the squirrel . Now , boys , do n't hunt the squirrel . Whatever you begin , stick to it till it is finished  --  done , and well done . If you always follow this rule faithfully , you can not fail of being somebody and doing something . But , if you go through life hunting the squirrel , when you die , nobody can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be neither wiser nor better for your having lived in it . SECTION II .  --  INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER . There is a certain kind of Independence of Character , which is indispensable to success in any undertaking . I do not mean a proud , self-confident spirit , which despises advice , and makes one self-willed and headstrong . This is obstinacy . But true independence is that sort of self-confidence and resolution which leads one to go forward in what he has to do , with decision and energy , without leaning upon others . Without this , a man will gain to himself that unenviable distinction described by the homely but expressive term shiftless . The following description , from Mrs. S. C. Hall 's " Sketches of Irish Character , " * furnishes an admirable illustration of the results of a want of independence of character :  --  * See Frontispiece . " Shane Thurlough , ' as dacent a boy , ' and Shane 's wife , as ' clane-skinned a girl , ' as any in the world . There is Shane , an active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cottage , kicking a hole in the wall with his brogue , and picking up all the large gravel within his reach , to pelt the ducks with . Let us speak to him . ' Good morning Shane . ' ' Och ! the bright bames of heaven on ye every day ! and kindly welcome , my lady ; and wo n't ye step in and rest  --  its powerful hot , and a beautiful summer , sure ,  --  the Lord be praised ! ' ' Thank you , Shane . I thought you were going to cut the hay-field to-day ; if a heavy shower comes , it will be spoiled ; it has been fit for the scythe these two days . ' ' Sure , it 's all owing to that thief o ' the world , Tom Parrel , my lady . Did n't he promise me the loan of his scythe ; and by the same token I was to pay him for it ; and depinding on that , I did n't buy one , which I have been threatening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't you go to Carrick and purchase one ? ' ' To Carrick . Och , ' t is a good step to Carrick , and my toes are on the ground , ( saving your presence , ) for I depinded on Tim Jarvis to tell Andy Cappler , the brogue-maker , to do my shoes ; and , bad luck to him , the spalpeen , he forgot it . ' ' Where 's your pretty wife , Shane ? ' ' She 's in all the wo o ' the world , ma'am , dear . And she puts the blame of it on me , though I 'm not in the fault this time , any how . The child 's taken the small pox , and she depinded on me to tell the doctor to cut it for the cow-pox , and I depinded on Kitty Cackle , the limmer , to tell the doctor 's own man , and thought she would not forget it , becase the boy 's her bachelor ; but out o ' sight out o ' mind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the babby 's got it nataral , and the woman 's in heart trouble , ( to say nothing o ' myself ; ) and its the first and all . ' " ' I am very sorry , indeed , for you have got a much better wife than most men ! ' ' That 's a true word , my lady , only she 's fidgety-like sometimes , and says I do n't hit the nail on the head quick enough ; and she takes a dale more trouble than she need about mony a thing . ' " ' I do not think I ever saw Ellen 's wheel without flax before , Shane ? ' ' Bad ' cess to the wheel !  --  I got it this morning about that too . I depinded on John Williams to bring the flax from O'Flaharty 's this day week , and he forgot it ; and she says I ought to have brought it myself , and I close to the spot . But where 's the good ? says I ; sure , he 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shane , you will soon move into the new cottage at Churn Hill ? I passed it to-day , and it looked so cheerful ; and when you get there , you must take Ellen 's advice , and depind solely on yourself . ' ' Och ! ma'am dear , do n't mention it ; sure it 's that makes me so down in the mouth this very minit . Sure I saw that born blackguard , Jack Waddy , and he comes in here , quite innocent-like  --  ' Shane , you 've an eye to squire 's new lodge , ' says he . ' Maybe I have , ' says I. ' I 'm yer man , ' says he . ' How so , ' says I. ' Sure I 'm as good as married to my lady 's maid , ' said he ; ' and I 'll spake to the squire for you my own self . ' ' The blessing be about you , ' says I , quite grateful  --  and we took a strong cup on the strength of it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what d'ye think , my lady ? Why , himself stalks into the place  --  talked the squire over , to be sure  --  and without so much as " by your lave , " sates himself and his new wife on the lase in the house ; and I may go whistle . ' ' It was a great pity , Shane , that you did not go yourself to Mr. Churn . ' ' That 's a true word for you , ma'am dear ; but it 's hard if a poor man ca n't have a frind to depind on . ' " If you want any thing well done , you must see to it yourself . If you want it half done , leave it to servants . If you want it neglected , impose it upon your friend , to save yourself the trouble . SECTION III .  --  CONTENTMENT . The true secret of happiness lies in a contented mind . If we would be happy , we must be satisfied with our lot as it is . There is no condition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for perfection , we may roam the wide world over , and never find it ; but , if we learn to bear patiently what we can not help , almost any situation in life will be tolerable . Every one , however , is disposed to think his troubles the worst of all . The following story shows that no situation is exempt from trouble . The old black sheep . A gentleman in England was passing by where a large flock of sheep were feeding ; and seeing the shepherd sitting by the road-side , preparing to eat his dinner , he stopped his horse , and began to converse with him . " Well , shepherd , " he said , " you look cheerful and contented , and I dare say , have very few cares to vex you . I , who am a man of large property , can not but look at such men as you with a kind of envy . " " Why , sir , " replied the shepherd , " ' t is true , I have not trouble like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not for that black ewe that you see yonder among my flock . I have often begged my master to kill or sell her ; but he wo n't , though she is the plague of my life ; for no sooner do I sit down at my book or take up my wallet to get my dinner , but away she sets off over the down , and the rest follow her ; so that I have many a weary step after them . There ! you see she 's off , and they are all after her ! " " Ah , my friend , " said the gentleman , " I see every man has a black ewe in his flock , to plague him , as well as I. " Hunting after contentment . A man had a number of houses , and would move from one to another , because he could be contented but a little while in a place . A person asked him why he moved so often , and he said he was hunting after contentment . But content is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE . THE WILL . Knowledge is acquired not only by reading , but by thinking of what we read . A minister in Ireland met a boy going to school , and asked him what book it was which he had under his arm . " It is a will , sir , " said the boy . " What will ? " inquired the minister . " The last will and testament that Jesus Christ left to me , and to all who desire to obtain a title in the property therein bequeathed . " " What did Christ leave you in that will ? " " A kingdom , sir . " " Where does that kingdom lie ? " " It is the kingdom of heaven , sir . " " And do you expect to reign as a king there ? " " Yes , sir ; as joint-heir with Christ . " " And will not every person get there as well as you ? " " No , sir ; none can get there but those who found their title to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was not only a reader but a thinker . The minister told him to take care of a book of such value , and to mind the provisions of the will . A Little Reasoner . A little boy asked his mother how many gods there were . A younger brother answered , " Why , one to be sure . " " But how do you know that ? " inquired the other . " Because , " answered the younger , " God fills every place so that there is no room for any other . " A Wise Answer . A boy six years old was offered an orange , if he would tell where God was . " Tell me , " said the boy , " where he is not , and I will give you two . " A Bad Bargain . A Sabbath School teacher was talking to his class about that passage in Proverbs , which says , " Buy the truth and sell it not . " " He who buys the truth , " said he , " makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bad bargain , mentioned in Scripture ? " " I do , " replied one of his scholars :  --  " Esau made a bad bargain , when he sold his birth-right for a mess of pottage . " Another said , " Judas made a bad bargain , when he sold his Lord for thirty pieces of silver . " A third observed , " Our Lord tells us that he makes a bad bargain , who , to gain the whole world , loses his own soul . " Alas ! how many such bad bargains are made every day ! Simple Faith . A missionary in Africa asked a little boy if he was a sinner . The boy replied by asking if he knew any one who was not . The missionary then asked him who could save him from his sins . He replied , " Christ . " " What has Christ done to save sinners ? " " He has died on the cross . " " Do you believe Jesus Christ will save you ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and not only so , but I consider that , since he has died , and sent his servants the missionaries from such a far country to publish salvation , it would be very strange if , after all , he should reject a sinner . " It would be so indeed , with respect to all that come to Him ; for he has said , " Him that cometh to me , I will in no wise cast out . " Proof that there is a God . A converted Greenlander , conversing with a missionary concerning his former state , said that , before he had ever heard about God or Jesus Christ , he used to have such reflections as these : A boat does not grow into existence of itself , but must be made by the labor and ingenuity of man . But the meanest bird has far more skill displayed in its structure than the best boat , and no man can make a bird . But there is far more art shown in the formation of man than in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought perhaps he proceeded from his parents , and they from their parents ; but some must have been the first parents  --  whence did they come ? Common report informs me that they grew out of the earth ; but if so , why do not men now grow out of the earth ? And from whence did this same earth , the sea , the sun , the moon , and the stars , arise into existence ? Certainly , there must be some Being , who made all these things  --  a Being that always was , and can never cease to be . He must be inexpressibly more mighty , knowing , and wise , than the wisest man . He must be very good too ; for every thing that is made is good , useful , and necessary for us . Ah ! did I but know him , how would I love him and honor him ! But who has seen him ? Who has conversed with him ? This poor heathen , groping in the dark , was led to the same train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the learned Christian philosopher ; thus proving the truth of that passage in Rom. i. 20 :  --  " The invisible things of God , from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead . " How to prove the Bible true . At one of the South Sea Islands , which had been converted from heathenism by the labors of the English Missionaries , they were holding the annual meeting of their Missionary Society . A British vessel arrived , and the officers and crew attended the meeting . A native took the chair , and native speakers addressed the meeting , with great effect . Every thing was done in good order ; and the speeches were interpreted by the missionaries to the Englishmen present from the ship . But some of them said the natives were mere parrots , and only repeated what the missionaries had taught them . Others said that was impossible . After a warm dispute , they agreed to submit it to Mr. Williams , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if they would visit him in the afternoon , he would collect ten or twelve natives , whom they might ask any questions they pleased . They came , and about fifteen natives were present , but without knowing the object of the meeting . The first question asked was , " Do you believe the Bible to be the word of God ? " They were startled . They had never heard such a question stated before . A doubt had never entered their minds . After a moment 's pause , one of them replied , " Most certainly we do ; undoubtedly we do . " " Why do you believe it ? " they were again asked . " Can you give any reason for believing the Bible to be the word of God ? " He answered : " Why , look at the power with which it has been attended , in the utter overthrow of all that we have been addicted to from time immemorial . What else could have abolished that system of idolatry , which had so long prevailed among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that false system . " The same questions were put to another , who replied , " I believe the Bible to be the word of God , on account of the pure system of religion which it contains . We had a system of religion before ; but look how dark and black that system was compared with the bright system of salvation revealed in the word of God ! Here we learn that we are sinners , and that God gave Jesus Christ to die for us ; and by that goodness salvation is given to us . Now , what but the wisdom of God could have produced such a system as this presented to us in the word of God ? And this doctrine leads to purity . " Another made the following singular reply , which is worthy of a learned philosopher : " When I look at myself , I find I have got hinges all over my body . I have hinges to my legs , hinges to my jaws , hinges to my feet . If I want to take hold of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with . If my heart thinks , and I want to speak , I have got hinges to my jaws . If I want to walk , I have hinges to my feet . Now here is wisdom , in adapting my body to the various functions which it has to discharge . And I find that the wisdom which made the Bible exactly fits with this wisdom which has made my body ; consequently I believe the Bible to be the word of God . " The argument , in this last answer , is the same as that which proves the existence of God : the perfect adaptation of all the works of nature to their design , shows them to have been the work of a Supreme Intelligence . The perfect adaptation of the Bible to the condition , wants , and necessities of man , proves it to be of divine origin . The Bible just suits the design for which it professes to have been given . It gives us just that information and instruction , which we should expect a revelation from heaven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things ; of the object of man 's existence , and of his relations and duties to God . It explains how man came to be in his present fallen , wretched condition , and makes provision for his restoration to the favor of God . It provides for a radical reformation of character ; gives a perfect code of morals , and takes hold on the heart , and inspires a devotional spirit . Human wisdom could not have produced such a book ; but if it could , good men would not have been guilty of imposing a work of their own upon mankind , as a revelation from heaven ; and bad men would not have made a book to condemn themselves , as the Bible condemns all wickedness . We must , then , conclude , that the Bible is a divine book . Illustration SECTION II .  --  THE SABBATH . Nothing lost by keeping the Sabbath . A pious sailor , on board the steamboat Helen McGreggor , in 1830 , was ordered by the Captain to assist in handling freight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to keep the Sabbath . " We have no Sabbaths here at the West , " the Captain replied . " Very well , " said the sailor , " wherever I am , I am determined to keep the Sabbath . " After a few more words , the Captain settled with him , and he left the boat . He was soon offered higher wages , if he would come back ; but he refused . In a few days , he shipped at New Orleans for Europe . The first newspaper he took up on his arrival contained an account of the terrible disaster which happened to this boat soon after he left it . On the morning of the 24th of February , 1830 , she burst her boiler at Memphis , Tenn. , and nearly one hundred lives were lost . This dreadful disaster he had escaped , by adhering , at all hazards , to his determination , wherever he was , to keep the Sabbath . When George III . was repairing his palace , he found among the workmen a pious man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday morning , when the king went to view the works , this man was missing . He inquired the reason . At first , the other workmen were unwilling to tell . But the king insisted on knowing ; when they confessed that they had returned Sabbath morning , to complete a piece of work which they could not finish on Saturday , and that this man had been turned out of his employment because he refused to come . " Call him back immediately , " said the king . " The man who refused doing his ordinary work on the Lord 's day is the man for me . Let him be sent for . " He was restored to his place ; and always afterwards , the king showed him particular favor . Here was a strong temptation to break the Sabbath , for the man 's employment depended on it . But he found it both safe and profitable to keep the Sabbath . A wise answer . A wicked man said to his son , who attended the Sabbath School , " carry this parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath , " said the boy . " Put it in your pocket , " said the father . " God can see into my pocket , " the little boy answered . Danger of breaking the Sabbath . It is believed that more sad accidents happen to young persons , while seeking their pleasure on God 's Holy Day , than by any other means . A great proportion of the cases of drowning , among boys , occur on the Sabbath . One fine summer 's morning , two sprightly young lads started for the Sabbath School ; but they were met on the way by some rude boys , who persuaded them to go and play with them by the side of the river . They hesitated for some time , instead of resolutely saying " No , " to the first temptation . When they yielded , it was with troubled consciences , for they were well instructed at home . They played about the river for some time , when one of them , venturing too near , fell into the water , which was deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any assistance , and he was carried away by the rapid current and drowned . Thus were these two boys punished for their disobedience to God and their parents . But one Sabbath in the week . A person being invited to go on an excursion for pleasure , on the Holy Sabbath , replied , " I should like an excursion very well ; but I have but one Sabbath in the week , and I ca n't spare that . " This expresses an important truth in an impressive manner . When we have but one day in the week exclusively devoted to the concerns of eternity , while six are devoted to the affairs of time , can we spare that one day for pleasure ? It is the best of the seven . It is worth more than all the rest . If rightly employed , it will bring us a richer return . What we can earn in the six days is perishable ; but the fruits of a well-spent Sabbath will endure for ever . The Sabbath , when properly spent , is the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would seek pleasure , you can better afford to take any other day in the week for it , than to take the holy Sabbath . SECTION III .  --  EARLY PIETY RECOMMENDED . A man eighty-seven years of age , meeting another aged man not quite as old as himself , the other inquired of him how long he had been interested in religion . " Fifty years , " was the old man 's reply . " Well , have you ever regretted that you began so young to devote yourself to God ? " " O no , " said he ; and the tears trickled down his cheeks . " I weep when I think of the sins of my youth . " Another man between sixty and seventy years of age , said , " I hope I became a disciple of the Lord when I was seventeen ; " and he burst into a flood of tears as he added , " and there is nothing which causes me so much distress as to think of those seventeen years  --  some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to sin and the world . " This was the experience of David , who , in his old age , prayed , " Remember not , O Lord the sins of my youth . " And it will be the reader 's experience , should he ever be brought to a knowledge of the truth , after giving the flower of his days to the service of sin and Satan . Illustration Danger of delay . A  --   --  M  --   --  was an impenitent youth . His friend , who had just embraced the Saviour , in the ardor of his first love , besought him to turn to the Lord . He acknowledged the great importance of the things which were urged upon his attention ; and said that , long before , the Spirit of God had called upon him , and he was " almost persuaded to be a Christian . " Once he stood almost on the threshhold of heaven . " But now , " said he , " I am fallen , fallen  --  O how far ! I know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinner . I have quenched the Holy Spirit . If I should die as I am , I know I shall be eternally lost , for I believe the Bible . You may think , because I am so careless now , I shall die unconverted . But no , I have more thoughts about death than many suppose . I mean to repent before I die , and become a Christian . I can not think of dying as I now am ; but you need not be concerned about me , for I mean to repent yet . " Not many days afterwards , he was crossing a river , with a number of others , for the purpose of spending the day in amusement . The skiff upset , and they were plunged into the water . All the rest of the company but A  --   --  ( who was the best swimmer among them ) , reached the shore . He was heard , as he struggled towards the bank , to utter a fearful oath , calling upon God to damn his soul . God took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  a fearful warning on those who presume on future repentance ! SECTION IV .  --  UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE . " Go to now , ye that say , To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy , and sell , and get gain : " Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away . " For that ye ought to say , if the Lord will , we shall live , and do this , or that . "  --  JAMES iv . 13 , 14 , 15 . On Friday , the Editor of the New-York Commercial Advertiser , met a Mr. Storrs in the street and requested from him an account of an Indian adventure which he had heard him relate . Mr. Storrs replied , " I am going to New Haven in the morning . I will write it there and bring it down for you on Monday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last words . On Monday he was buried . Such is the uncertainty of all human calculations ! Let the business of the day be done to-day ; for no one is sure of to-morrow . Especially let the great business of life always be done , and then sudden death need not be dreaded . Sudden death of an impenitent sinner . On a cold day in the middle of winter , a carriage drove up to a minister 's house and he was summoned to attend the death-bed of a young man , who , in the midst of life and health had been just struck down by a violent kick from a horse , and was not expected to live more than a few hours . The blow had broken his skull bone , and cut out a piece as large as the palm of his hand , presenting a ghastly and horrible sight . When the minister arrived , he found him just recovering his senses . The physician came soon after , and decided that there was no hope of saving his life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prayer , proposed to retire for a short time , to give the young man a little rest . " No , no , " he exclaimed , " do not leave me for a moment . I have but a short time to live , and I dare not die as I am . O what shall I do ? Tell me quickly before the light of reason forsakes me . " " James , " said the minister , " there is but one way in which a sinner can be saved , and that is , by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ ;  --  whether an hour only , or years be allowed you , the only way for you to secure salvation is , by casting yourself unreservedly into the Saviour 's hand . Only his blood can save you ; and you are welcome now , this moment . All things are ready  --  come now . " The young man , with a look of anguish , replied , " Do you remember , sir , when I was putting up some shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to stop , while you talked with me about religion , and prayed for me ? It was then that I felt that I was a sinner , and after going home , I endeavored to pray for myself , and determined that I would seek religion . Two or three days , these feelings continued ; when , unhappily for me , I took up a book , which I had commenced reading before our conversation , and though conscience remonstrated , I went on and finished it . My feelings were much enlisted in the story , but when I got through I had no disposition to pray ; and my anxiety about religion was gone . I resumed novel-reading , of which I had been very fond , and compromised with my conscience , by resolving that at the end of one year I would throw all such books aside , and seek the salvation of my soul . Only two thirds of that year are gone , and here I am dying ! Fool , fool that I was , to sell my soul for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale to the joys of religion . " The minister begged him , whatever had been his past folly and guilt , to look to Christ for the forgiveness of all . But while he was speaking , the young man 's reason began to fail . In a short time he was delirious . " Fool , fool ! " he would exclaim , at intervals , and this was all he said . In this state of mind , death overtook him , four months before the period arrived , to which he had put off attention to the concerns of his soul  --  a sad warning to those who defer this first and great concern ! Sudden Death of a Christian . William G. was a young man in vigorous health and of ardent temperament , with great energy of character . His office was that of a brakeman upon the Railroad . A long line of freight cars had been delayed a few minutes behind the time , and must hasten to reach the turnout in season for the passenger train , which was expected to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached ; which , by a dexterous movement , could be done without entirely stopping the train . The moment the engine is slackened , the cars behind will gain a little upon those in front , when the connecting pin can be removed , and the hinder cars detached . This the young man had often done before , and he sprang forward with alacrity to perform it now . But , in the path lay a pebble , so small as to escape notice , and yet large enough , as he stepped rapidly backwards , to throw him prostrate on the track , while the heavy-laden cars passed on over his body . It was the work of an instant , but it was done . There lay , mangled and writhing , the young man , who , not one moment before , was buoyant , healthful , full of enterprise and hope . There was no hope of his life . With one arm extended , the only unbroken limb in his body , he speaks : " I must die  --  I know it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . Yes , I am willing to die , if it is God 's will . And yet , I should like to live . My poor mother  --  who will take care of her ? My poor sisters  --  and oh , my poor dear Mary ! Send for them  --  send for them . Send now . I must see them once more . I have much to say to them . Oh , my God , thy will be done ! " They came , and there was such a burst of grief as is seldom witnessed . Yet , amid all this , he was calm . Not a groan , not a murmur had escaped him through the long hours of bodily suffering which he had endured , and not a murmur nor a groan did he suffer now , when the heart-strings were broken . He spoke calmly and clearly to them all , gave them counsel , bade each a tender farewell ; then closed his eyes , and sunk into the sleep of death . What would this scene have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hope firm upon the Rock of Ages . It had supported him in the busy scenes of life . It now sustained him in the sudden hour of trial , when the pains of death seized upon him without warning . " LET ME DIE THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS , AND LET MY LAST END BE LIKE HIS !
