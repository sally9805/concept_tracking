Hoffman , Charles Fenno , 1806-1884 : LE TEMPS VIENDRA . from Le temps viendra ( 1847 ) Footnote 2 : 1Kb No troth is pledged  --  no vow is passed , No words of love are spoken ; But round their hearts a chain is cast , Which never can be broken : Its links were there forever set , The moment that their pulses met , And wedded in one burning grasp , A bond no mortal can unclasp . For if a watch be kept above , O'er manhood 's faith and woman 's trust , If Heaven wills that human love , Be ever traced in more than dust  --  ' T is thus , when like two streams that mingle , Two souls are in one moment single ; ' T is thus , when rapt like these from earth , In Heaven their union has its birth . And they may never meet again , Or only here like strangers meet  --  May mingle with the cold and vain ; Like them , too , may each other greet : But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that hour , Till time shall teach  --  perhaps too late , How closely woven is their fate .
