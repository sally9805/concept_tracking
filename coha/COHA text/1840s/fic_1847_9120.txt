THOMAS CARLYLE AND HIS WORKS . BY HENRY D. THOREAU . Thomas Carlyle is a Scotchman , born about fifty years ago , " at Ecclefechan , Annandale , " according to one authority . " His parents ' good farmer people , ' his father an elder in the Secession church there , and a man of strong native sense , whose words were said to ' nail a subject to the wall . ' " We also hear of his " excellent mother , " still alive , and of " her fine old covenanting accents , concerting with his transcendental tones . " He seems to have gone to school at Annan , on the shore of the Solway Frith , and there , as he himself writes , " heard of famed professors , of high matters classical , mathematical , a whole Wonderland of Knowledge , " from Edward Irving , then a young man " frosh from Edinburgh , with college prizes , &c.";  --  " come to see our schoolmaster , who had also been his . " From this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's country . Here first he may have become acquainted with Nature , with woods , such as are there , and rivers and brooks , some of whose names we have heard , and the last lapses of Atlantic billows . He got some of his education , too , more or less liberal , out of the University of Edinburgh , where , according to the same authority , he had to " support himself , " partly by " private tuition , translations for the booksellers , &c.,"; and afterward , as we are glad to hear , " taught an academy in Dysart , at the same time that Irving was teaching in Kirkaldy , " the usual middle passage of a literary life . He was destined for the church , but not by the powers that rule man 's life ; made his literary dbut in Fraser 's Magazine , long ago ; read here and there in English and French , with more or less profit , we may suppose , such of us at least as are not particularly informed , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German language , and set himself earnestly to unravel that mystery  --  with what success many readers know . After his marriage he " resided partly at Comely . Bank , Edinburgh ; and for a year or two at Craigenputtock , a wild and solitary farm-house in the upper part of Dumfriesshire , " at which last place , amid barren heather hills , he was visited by our countryman Emerson . With Emerson he still corresponds . He was early intimate with Edward Irving , and continued to be his friend until the latter 's death . Concerning this " freest , brotherliest , bravest human soul , " and Carlyle 's relation to him , those whom it concerns will do well to consult a notice of his death in Fraser 's Magazine for 1835 , reprinted in the Miscellanies . He also corresponded with Goethe . Latterly , we hear , the poet Stirling was his only intimate acquaintance in England . He has spent the last quarter of his life in London , writing books ; has the fame , as all readers know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and done much else that is novel and remarkable in literature . He especially is the literary man of those parts . You may imagine him living in altogether a retired and simple way , with small family , in a quiet part of London , called Chelsea , a little out of the din of commerce , in " Cheyne Row , " there , not far from the " Chelsea Hospital . " " A little past this , and an old ivy-clad church , with its buried generations lying around it , " writes one traveler , " you come to an antique street running at right angles with the Thames , and , a few steps from the river , you find Carlyle 's name on the door . " " A Scotch lass ushers you into the second story front chamber , which is the spacious workship of the world maker . " Here he sits a long time together , with many books and papers about him ; many new books , we have been told , on the upper shelves , uncut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in late months , with many manuscripts in-an old English hand , and innumerable pamphlets , from the public libraries , relating to the Cromwellian period ; now , perhaps , looking out into the street on brick and pavement , for a change , and now upon some rod of grass ground in the rear ; or , perchance , he steps over to the British Museum , and makes that his studio for the time . This is the fore part of the day ; that is the way with literary men commonly ; and then in the afternoon , we presume , he takes a short run of a mile or so through the suburbs out into the country ; we think he would run that way , though so short a trip might not take him to very sylvan or rustic places . In the meanwhile , people are calling to see him , from various quarters , very few worthy of being seen by him , " distinguished travelers from America , " not a few , to all and sundry of whom he gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for whatever they may have to offer ; speaking his English , as they say , with a " broad Scotch accent , " talking , to their astonishment and to ours , very much as he writes , a sort of Carlylese , his discourse " coming to its climaxes , ever and anon , in long , deep , chestshaking bursts of laughter . " He goes to Scotland sometimes to visit his native heath-clad hills , having some interest still in the earth there ; such names as Craigenputtock and Ecclefechan , which we have already quoted , stand for habitable places there to him ; or he rides to the seacoast of England in his vacations , upon his horse Yankee , bought by the sale of his books here , as we have been told . How , after all , he gets his living ; what proportion of his daily bread he earns by day-labor or job-work with his pen , what he inherits , what steals  --  questions whose answers are so significant , and not to be omitted in his biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be worth the while to state that he is not a Reformer , in our sense of the term , eats , drinks , and sleeps , thinks and believes , professes and practices , not according to the New England standard , nor to the Old English wholly . Nevertheless , we are told that he is a sort of lion in certain quarters there , " an amicable centre for men of the most opposite opinions , " and " listened to as an oracle , " " smoking his perpetual pipe . " A rather tall , gaunt figure , with intent face , dark hair and complexion , and the air of a student ; not altogether well in body , from sitting too long in his workhouse , he , born in the border country and descended from moss-troopers , it may be . We have seen several pictures of him here ; one , a full length portrait , with hat and overall , if it did not tell us much , told the fewest lies ; another , we remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " one other also we have seen in which we discern some features of the man we are thinking of ; but the only ones worth remembering , after all , are those which he has unconsciously drawn of himself . When we remember how these volumes came over to us , with their encouragement and provocation from mouth to mouth , and what commotion they created in many private breasts , we wonder that the country did not ring , from shore to shore , from the Atlantic to the Pacific , with its greeting ; and the Boons and Crockets of the West make haste to hail him , whose wide humanity embraces them too . Of all that the packets have brought over to us , has there been any richer cargo than this ? What else has been English news for so long a season ? What else , of late years , has been England to us  --  to us who read books , we mean ? Unless we remembered it as the scene where the age of Wordsworth was spending itself , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , as the residence of Landon ; Carlyle alone , since the death of Coleridge , has kept the promise of England . It is the best apology for all the bustle and the sin of commerce , that it has made us acquainted with the thoughts of this man . Commerce would not concern us much if it were not for such results as this . New England owes him a debt which she will be slow to recognize . His earlier essays reached us at a time when Coleridge 's were the only recent words which had made any notable impression so far , and they found a field unoccupied by him , before yet any words of moment had been uttered in our midst . He had this advantage , too , in a teacher , that he stood near to his pupils ; and he has no doubt afforded reasonable encouragement and sympathy to many an independent but solitary thinker . Through him , as usher , we have been latterly , in a great measure , made acquainted with what philosophy and criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , to the privileges of the century ; and what he may yet have to say , is still expected here with more interest than any thing else from that quarter . It is remarkable , but on the whole , perhaps , not to be lamented , that the world is so unkind to a new book . Any distinguished traveler who comes to our shores , is likely to get more dinners and speeches of welcome than he can well dispose of , but the best books , if noticed at all , meet with coldness and suspicion , or , what is worse , gratuitous , off-hand criticism . It is plain that the reviewers , both here and abroad , do not know how to dispose of this man . They approach him too easily , as if he were one of the men of letters about town , who grace Mr. Somebody 's administration , merely ; but he already belongs to literature , and depends neither on the favor of reviewers , nor the honesty of booksellers , nor the pleasure of readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive from his generation . He is another such a strong and finished workman in his craft as Samuel . Johnson was , and like him , makes the literary class respectable . As few are yet out of their apprenticeship , or even if they learn to be able writers , are at the same time able and valuable thinkers . The aged and critical eyes , especially , is incapacitated to appreciate the works of this author . To such their meaning is impalpable and evanescent , and they seem to abound only in obstinate mannerisms , Germanisms , and whimsical ravings of all kinds , with now and then an unaccountably true and sensible remark . On the strength of this last , Carlyle is admitted to have what is called genius . We hardly know an old man to whom these volumes are not hopelessly sealed . The language , they say , is foolishness and a stumbling-block to them ; but to many a clear-headed boy , they are plainest English , and despatched with such hasty relish as his bread and milk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this diet so readily , and digest it with so little difficulty . They shake their heads with mistrust at their free and easy delight , and remark that " Mr. Carlyle is a very learned man ; " for they , too , not to be out of fashion , have got grammar and dictionary , if the truth were known , and with the best faith cudgelled their brains to get a little way into the jungle , and they could not but confess , as often as they found the clue , that it was as intricate as Blackstone to follow , if you read it honestly . But merely reading , even with the best intentions , is not enough , you must almost have written these books yourself . Only he who has had the good fortune to read them in the nick of time , in the most perceptive and recipient season of life , can give any adequate account of them . Many have tasted of this well with an odd suspicion , as if it were some fountain Arethuse which had flowed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his books had lain in some garret there , in danger of being appropriated for waste paper . Over what German ocean , from what Hercynian forest , he has been imported , piece-meal , into England , or whether he has now all arrived , we are not informed . This article is not invoiced in Hamburg , nor in London . Perhaps it was contraband . However , we suspect that this sort of goods can not be imported in this way . No matter how skillful the stevedore , all things being got into sailing trim , wait for a Sunday , and aft wind , and then weigh anchor , and run up the main-sheet  --  straightway what of transce dant and permanent value is there resists the aft wind , and will doggedly stay behind that Sunday  --  it does not travel Sundays ; while biscuit and pork make headway , and sailors cry heave-yo ! it must part company , if it open a seam . It is not quite safe to send out a venture in this kind , unless yourself go supercargo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest virtue is immovable  --  it is real estate , not personal ; who would keep it , must consent to be bought and sold with it . However , we need not dwell on this charge of a German extraction , it being generally admitted , by this time , that Carlyle is English , and an inhabitant of London . He has the English for his mother tongue , though with a Scotch accent , or never so many accents , and thoughts also , which are the legitimate growth of native soil , to utter therewith . His style is eminently colloquial  --  and no wonder it is strange to meet with in a book . It is not literary or classical ; it has not the music of poetry , nor the pomp of philosophy , but the rhythms and cadences of conversation endlessly repeated . It resounds with emphatic , natural , lively , stirring tones , muttering , rattling , exploding , like shells and shot , and with like execution . So far as it is a merit in composition , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to a fresh and pertinent thought in the mind , as well as to the half thoughts , the tumultuary misgivings and expectancies , this author is , perhaps , not to be matched in literature . In the streets men laugh and cry , but in books , never ; they " whine , put finger i ' the eye , and sob " only . One would think that all books of late , had adopted the falling inflexion . " A mother , if she wishes to sing her child to sleep , " say the musical men , " will always adopt the falling inflexion . " Would they but choose the rising inflexion , and wake the child up for once . He is no mystic either , more than Newton or Arkwright , or Davy  --  and tolerates none . Not one obscure line , or half line , did he ever write . His meaning lies plain as the daylight , and he who runs may read ; indeed , only he who runs can read , and keep up with the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he tells us only what he sees printed in largest English type upon the face of things . He utters substantial English thoughts in plainest English dialects ; for it must be confessed he speaks more than one of these . All the shires of England , and all the shires of Europe , are laid under contribution to his genius ; for to be English does not mean to be exclusive and narrow , and adapt one 's self to the apprehension of his nearest neighbor only . And yet no writer is more thoroughly Saxon . In the translation of those fragments of Saxon poetry , we have met with the same rhythm that occurs so often in his poem on the French Revolution . And if you would know where many of those obnoxious Carlyleisms and Germanisms came from , read the best of Milton 's prose , read those speeches of Cromwell which he has brought to light , or go and listen once more to your mother 's tongue . So much for his German extraction . Indeed , for fluency and skill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master unrivaled . His felicity and power of expression surpass even any of his special merits as a historian and critic . Therein his experience has not failed him , but furnished him with such a store of winged , aye , and legged words , as only a London life , perchance , could give account of ; we had not understood the wealth of the language before . Nature is ransacked , and all the resorts and purlieus of humanity are taxed , to furnish the fittest symbol for his thought . He does not go to the dictionary , the word-book , but to the word-manufactory itself , and has made endless work for the lexicographers  --  yes , he has that same English for his mother-tongue , that you have , but with him it is no dumb , muttering , mumbling faculty , concealing the thoughts , but a keen , unwearied , resistless weapon . He has such command of it as neither you nor I have ; and it would be well for any who have a lost horse to advertise , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write , to study this universal letter-writer , for he knows more than the grammar or the dictionary . The style is worth attending to , as one of the most important features of the man which we at this distance can discern . It is for once quite equal to the matter . It can carry all its load , and never breaks down nor staggers . His books are solid and workmanlike , as all that England does ; and they are graceful and readable also . They tell of huge labor done , well done , and all the rubbish swept away , like the bright cutlery which glitters in shop-windows , while the coke and ashes , the turnings , filings , dust , and borings , lie far away at Birmingham , unheard of . He is a masterly clerk , scribe , reporter , and writer . He can reduce to writing most things  --  gestures , winks , nods , significant looks , patois , brogue , accent , pantomime , and how much that had passed for silence before , does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city lawyer , requiring him to write , among other things , his call to his horses , would hardly have puzzled him ; he would have found a word for it , all right and classical , that would have started his team for him . Consider the ceaseless tide of speech forever flowing in countless cellars , garrets , parlors : that of the French , says Carlyle , " only ebbs toward the short hours of night , " and what a drop in the bucket is the printed word . Feeling , thought , speech , writing , and we might add , poetry , inspiration  --  for so the circle is completed ; how they gradually dwindle at length , passing through successive colanders , into your history and classics , from the roar of the ocean , the murmur of the forest , to the squeak of a mouse ; so much only parsed and spelt out , and punctuated , at last . The few who can talk like a book , they only get reported commonly . But this writer reports a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , was expressed in the old way , so much here depends upon the emphasis , tone , pronunciation , style , and spirit of the reading . No writer uses so profusely all the aids to intelligibility which the printer 's art affords . You wonder how others had contrived to write so many pages without emphatic or italicised words , they are so expressive , so natural , so indispensable here , as if none had ever used the demonstrative pronouns demonstratively before . In another 's sentences the thought , though it may be immortal , is , as it were , embalmed , and does not strike you , but here it is so freshly living , even the body of it , not having passed through the ordeal of death , that it stirs in the very extremities , and the smallest particles and pronouns are all alive with it . It is not simple dictionary it , yours or mine , but it . The words did not come at the command of grammar , but of a tyrannous , inexorable meaning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but any able-bodied countryman pressed into the service , for " sire , it is not a revolt , it is a revolution . " We have never heard him speak , but we should say that Carlyle was a rare talker . He has broken the ice , and streams freely forth like a spring torrent . He does not trace back the stream of his thought , silently adventurous , up to its fountain-head , but is borne away with it , as it rushes through his brain like a torrent to overwhelm and fertilize . He holds a talk with you . His audience is such a tumultuous mob of thirty thousand , as assembled at the University of Paris , before printing was invented . Philosophy , on the other hand , does not talk , but write , or , when it comes personally before an audience , lecture or read ; and therefore it must be read to-morrow , or a thousand years hence . But the talker must naturally be attended to at once ; he does not talk on without an audience ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Think of Carlyle reading his French Revolution to any audience . One might say it was never written , but spoken ; and thereafter reported and printed , that those not within sound of his voice might know something about it . Some men read to you something which they have written , in a dead language , of course , but it may be in a living letter , in a Syriac , or Roman , or Runic character . Men must speak English who can write Sanscrit ; and they must speak a modern language who write , perchance , an ancient and universal one . We do not live in those days when the learned used a learned language . There is no writing of Latin with Carlyle , but as Chaucer , with all reverence to Homer , and Virgil , and Messieurs the Normans , sung his-poetry in the homely Saxon tongue ; and Locke has at least the merit of having done philosophy into English  --  so Carlyle has done a different philosophy still further into English , and thrown open the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style  --  so diversified and variegated ! It is like the face of a country ; it is like a New England landscape , with farm-houses and villages , and cultivated spots , and belts of forests and blueberry-swamps round about it , with the fragrance of shadblossoms and violets on certain winds . And as for the reading of it , it is novel enough to the reader who has used only the diligence , and old-line mailcoach . It is like traveling , sometimes on foot , sometimes in a gig tandem ; sometimes in a full coach , over highways , mended and unmended , for which you will prosecute the town ; on level roads , through French departments , by Simplon roads over the Alps , and now and then he hauls up for a relay , and yokes in an unbroken colt of a Pegasus for a leader , driving off by cart-paths , and across lots , by corduroy roads and gridiron bridges ; and where the bridges are gone , not even a string-piece left , and the reader has to set his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , who has driven ten thousand miles , and was never known to upset ; can drive six in hand on the edge of a precipice , and touch the leaders anywhere with his snapper . With wonderful art he grinds into paint for his picture all his moods and experiences , so that all his forces may be brought to the encounter . Apparently writing without a particular design or responsibility , setting down his soliloquies from time to time , taking advantage of all his humors , when at length the hour comes to declare himself , he puts down in plain English , without quotation marks , what he , Thomas Carlyle , is ready to defend in the face of the world , and fathers the rest , often quite as defensible , only more modest , or plain spoken , or insinuating , upon " Sauerteig , " or some other gentleman long employed on the subject . Rolling his subject how many ways in his mind , he meets it now face to face , wrestling with it at arm 's length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head ; and if that will not do , or whether it will do or not , tries the back-stitch and side-hug with it , and downs it again  --  scalps it , draws and quarters it , hangs it in chains , and leaves it to the winds and dogs . With his brows knit , his mind made up , his will resolved and resistless , he advances , crashing his way through the host of weak , half-formed , dilettante opinions , honest and dishonest ways of thinking , with their standards raised , sentimentalities and conjectures , and tramples them all into dust . See how he prevails ; you do n't even hear the groans of the wounded and dying . Certainly it is not so well worth the while to look through any man 's eyes at history , for the time , as through his ; and his way of looking at things is fastest getting adopted by his generation . It is not in man to determine what his style shall be . He might as well determine what his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always as in the chapter on Burns , and the Life of Schiller , and elsewhere . No ; his thoughts were evere irregular and impetuous . Perhaps as he grows older and writes more he acquires a truer expression ; it is in some respects manlier , freer , struggling up to a level with its fountain-head . We think it is the richest prose style we know of . Who cares what a man 's style is , so it is intelligible  --  as intelligible as his thought . Literally and really , the style is no more than the stylus , the pen he writes with  --  and it is not worth scraping and polishing , and gilding , unless it will write his thoughts the better for it . It is something for use , and not to look at . The question for us is not whether Pope had fine style , wrote with a peacock 's feather , but whether he uttered useful thoughts . Translate a book a dozen times from one language to another , and what becomes of its style ? Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pen which wrote it is soon destroyed , but the poem survives . We believe that Carlyle has , after all , more readers , and is better known to-day for this very originality of style , and that posterity will have reason to thank him for emancipating the language , in some measure , from the fetters which a merely conservative , aimless , and pedantic literary class had imposed upon it , and setting an example of greater freedom and naturalness . No man 's thoughts are new , but the style of their expression is the never failing novelty which cheers and refreshes men . If we were to answer the question , whether the mass of men , as we know them , talk as the standard authors and reviewers write , or rather as this man writes , we should say that he alone begins to write their language at all , and that the former is , for the most part , the mere effigies of a language , not the best method of concealing one 's thoughts even , but frequently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic description of Richter 's style , Carlyle describes his own pretty nearly ; and no doubt he first got his own tongue loosened at that fountain , and was inspired by it to equal freedom and originality . " The language , " as he says of Richter , " groans with indescribable metaphors and allusions to all things , human and divine , flowing onward , not like a river , but like an inundation ; circling in complex eddies , chafing and gurgling , now this way , now that ; " but in Carlyle , " the proper current " never " sinks out of sight amid the boundless uproar . " Again : " His very language is Titanian  --  deep , strong , tumultuous , shining with a thousand hues , fused from a thousand elements , and winding in labyrinthic mazes . " In short , if it is desirable that a man be eloquent , that he talk much , and address himself to his own age mainly , then this is not a bad style of doing it . But if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and speaks to silent centuries to come , then , indeed , we could wish that he had cultivated the style of Goethe more , that of Richter less ; not that Goethe 's is the kind of utterance most to be prized by mankind , but it will serve for a model of the best that can be successfully cultivated . But for style , and fine writing , and Augustan ages  --  that is but a poor style , and vulgar writing , and a degenerate age , which allows us to remember these things . This man has something to communicate . Carlyle 's are not , in the common sense . works of art in their origin and aim ; and yet , perhaps , no living English writer evinces an equal literary talent . They are such works of art only as the plough , and corn-mill , and steam-engine  --  not as pictures and statues . Others speak with greater emphasis to scholars , as such , but none so earnestly and effectually to all who can read . Others give their advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small praise that he does not take upon himself the airs , has none of the whims , none of the pride , the nice vulgarities , the starched , impoverished isolation , and cold glitter of the spoiled children of genius . He does not need to husband his pearl , but excels by a greater humanity and sincerity . He is singularly serious and untrivial . We are every where impressed by the rugged , unwearied , and rich sincerity of the man . We are sure that he never sacrificed one jot of his honest thought to art or whim , but to utter himself in the most direct and effectual way , that is the endeavor . These are merits which will wear well . When time has worn deeper into the substance of these books , this grain will appear . No such sermons have come to us here out of England , in late years , as those of this preacher ; sermons to kings , and sermons to peasants , and sermons to all intermediate classes . It is in vain that John Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , and pretends not to hear them , nature will not soon be weary of repeating them . There are words less obviously true , more for the ages to hear , perhaps , but none so impossible for this age not to hear . What a cutting cimiter was that " past and present , " going through heaps of silken stuffs , and glibly through the necks of men , too , without their knowing it , leaving no trace . He has the earnestness of a prophet . In an age of pedantry and dilettantism , he has no grain of these in his composition . There is no where else , surely , in recent readable English , or other books , such direct and effectual teaching , reproving , encouraging , stimulating , earnestly , vehemently , almost like Mahomet , like Luther ; not looking behind him to see how his Opera Omnia will look , but forward to other work to be done . His writings are a gospel to the young of this generation ; they will hear his manly , brotherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or newer gospels . We should omit a main attraction in these books , if we said nothing of their humor . Of this indispensable pledge of sanity , without some leaven , of which the abstruse thinker may justly be suspected of mysticism , fanaticism , or insanity , there is a superabundance in Carlyle . Especially the transcendental philosophy needs the leaven of humor to render it light and digestible . In his later and longer works it is an unfailing accompaniment , reverberating through pages and chapters , long sustained without effort . The very punctuation , the italics , the quotation marks , the blank spaces and dashes , and the capitals , each and all are pressed into its service . Every man , of course , has his fane , from which even the most innocent conscious humor is excluded ; but in proportion as the writer 's position is high above his fellows , the range of his humor is extended . To the thinker , all the institutions of men , as all imperfection , viewed from the point of equanimity , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how sad or personal , or universal a grievance , is , indeed , a jest more or less sublime . Carlyle 's humor is vigorous and Titanic , and has more sense in it than the sober philosophy of many another . It is not to be disposed of by laughter and smiles merely ; it gets to be too serious for that  --  only they may laugh who are not hit by it . For those who love a merry jest , this is a strange kind of fun  --  rather too practical joking , if they understand it . The pleasant humor which the public loves , is but the innocent pranks of the ballroom , harmless flow of animal spirits , the light plushy pressure of dandy pumps , in comparison . But when an elephant takes to treading on your corns , why then you are lucky if you sit high , or wear cowhide . His humor is always subordinate to a serious purpose , though often the real charm for the reader , is not so much in the essential progress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidelight illustration of every hue . He sketches first with strong , practical English pencil , the essential features in outline , black on white , more faithfully than Dryasdust would have done , telling us wisely whom and what to mark , to save time , and then with brush of camel 's hair , or sometimes with more expeditious swab , he lays on the bright and fast colors of his humor everywhere . One piece of solid work , be it known , we have determined to do , about which let there be no jesting , but all things else under the heavens , to the right and left of that , are for the time fair game . To us this humor is not wearisome , as almost every other is . Rabelais , for instance , is intolerable ; one chapters better than a volume  --  it may be sport to him , but it is death to us . A mere humorist , indeed , is a most unhappy man ; and his readers are most unhappy also . Humor is not so distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is commonly regarded , but allied to every , even the divinest faculty . The familiar and cheerful conversation about every hearth-side , if it be analyzed , will be found to be sweetened by this principle . There is not only a never-failing , pleasant , and earnest humor kept up there , embracing the domestic affairs , the dinner , and the scolding , but there is also a constant run upon the neighbors , and upon church and state , and to cherish and maintain this , in a great measure , the fire is kept burning , and the dinner provided . There will be neighbors , parties to a very genuine , even romantic friendship , whose whole audible salutation and intercourse , abstaining from the usual cordial expressions , grasping of hands , or affectionate farewells , consists in the mutual play and interchange of a genial and healthy humor , which excepts nothing , not even themselves , in its lawless range . The child plays continually , if you will let it , and all its life is a sort of practical humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ethereal a nature , that its parents , its uncles and cousins ; can in no wise participate in it , but must stand aloof in silent admiration , and reverence even . The more quiet the more profound it is . Even nature is observed to have her playful moods or aspects , of which man seems sometimes to be the sport . But , after all , we could sometimes dispense with the humor , though unquestionably incorporated in the blood , if it were replaced by this author 's gravity . We should not apply to himself , without qualification , his remarks on the humor of Richter . With more repose in his inmost being , his humor would become more thoroughly genial and placid . Humor is apt to imply but a half satisfaction at best . In his pleasantest and most genial hour , man smiles but as the globe smiles , and the works of nature . The fruits dry ripe , and much as we relish some of them , in their green and pulpy state , we lay up for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustling autumnal harvests . Though we never weary of this vivacious wit , while we are perusing its work , yet when we remember it from afar , we sometimes feel balked and disappointed , missing the security , the simplicity , and frankness , even the occasional magnanimity of acknowledged dullness and bungling . This never-failing success and brilliant talent become a reproach . To the most practical reader the humor is certainly too obvious and constant a quality . When we are to have dealings with a man , we prize the good faith and valor of soberness and gravity . There is always a more impressive statement than consists with these victorious comparisons . Besides , humor does not wear well . It is commonly enough said , that a joke will not bear repeating . The deepest humor will not keep . Humors do not circulate but stagnate , or circulate partially . In the oldest literature , in the Hebrew , the Hindoo , the Persian , the Chinese , it is rarely humor , even the most divine , which still survives , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxims of duty , to which the life of all men may be referred . After time has sifted the literature of a people , there is left only their Scripture , for that is writing , par excellence . This is as true of the poets , as of the philosophers and moralists by profession ; for what subsides in any of these is the moral only , to re-appear as dry land at some remote epoch . We confess that Carlyle 's humor is rich , deep , and variegated , in direct communication with the back bone and risible muscles of the globe  --  and there is nothing like it ; but much as we relish this jovial , this rapid and detergeous way of conveying one 's views and impressions , when we would not converse but meditate , we pray for a man 's diamond edition of his thought , without the colored illuminations in the margin  --  the fishes and dragons , and unicorns , the red or the blue ink , but its initial letter in distinct skeleton type , and the whole so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that time will have little to do . We know not but we shall immigrate soon , and would fain take with us all the treasures of the east , and all kinds of dry , portable soups , in small tin canisters , which contain whole herds of English beeves , boiled down , will be acceptable . The difference between this flashing , fitful writing and pure philosophy , is the difference between flame and light . The flame , indeed , yields light , but when we are so near as to observe the flame , we are apt to be incommoded by the heat and smoke . But the sun , that old Platonist , is set so far off in the heavens , that only a genial summer-heat and ineffable day-light can reach us . But many a time , we confess , in wintery weather , we have been glad to forsake the sun-light , and warm us by these Promethean flames . Carlyle must undoubtedly plead guilty to the charge of mannerism . He not only has his vein . but his peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be imitated , and sometimes is an imitator of himself . Every man , though born and bred in the metropolis of the world , will still have some provincialism adhering to him ; but in proportion as his aim is simple and earnest , he approaches at once the most ancient and the most modern men . There is no mannerism in the Scriptures . The style of proverbs , and indeed of all maxims , whether measured by sentences or by chapters , if they may be said to have any style , is one , and as the expression of one voice , merely an account of the matter by the latest witness . It is one advantage enjoyed by men of science , that they use only formulas which are universal . The common language and the common sense of mankind , it is most uncommon to meet with in the individual . Yet liberty of thought and speech is only liberty to think the universal thought , and speak the universal language of men , instead of being enslaved to a particular mode . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equable and sure ; from a depth within man which is beyond education and prejudice . Certainly , no critic has anywhere said what is more to the purpose , than this which Carlyle 's own writings furnish , which we quote , as well for its intrinsic merit as for its pertinence here . " It is true , " says he , thinking of Richter , " the beaten paths of literature lead the safeliest to the goal ; and the talent pleases us most , which submits to shine with new gracefulness through old forms . Nor is the noblest and most peculiar mind too noble or peculiar for working by prescribed laws ; Sophocles , Shakspeare , Cervantes , and in Richter 's own age , Goethe , how little did they innovate on the given forms of composition , how much in the spirit they breathed into them ! All this is true ; and Richter must lose of our esteem in proportion . " And again , in the chapter on Goethe , " We read Goethe for years before we come to see wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even of his way of writing , consists ! It seems quite a simple style , that of his ? remarkable chiefly for its calmness , its perspicuity , in short , its commonness ; and yet it is the most uncommon of all styles . " And this , too , translated for us by the same pen from Schiller , which we will apply not merely to the outward form of his works , but to their inner form and substance . He is speaking of the artist . " Let some beneficent divinity snatch him , when a suckling , from the breast of his mother , and nurse him with the milk of a better time , that he may ripen to his full stature beneath a distant Grecian sky . And having grown to manhood , let him return , a foreign shape , into his century ; not , however , to delight it by his presence , but , dreadful , like the son of Agamemnon , to purify it . The matter of his works he will take from the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nay , from beyond all time , from the absolute unchanging unity of his own nature . " But enough of this . Our complaint is already out of all proportion to our discontent . Carlyle 's works , it is true , have not the stereotyped success which we call classic . They are a rich but inexpensive entertainment , at which we are not concerned lest the host has strained or impoverished himself to feed his guests . It is not the most lasting word , nor the loftiest wisdom , but rather the word which comes last . For his genius it was reserved to give expression to the thoughts which were throbbing in a million breasts . He has plucked the ripest fruit in the public garden ; but this fruit already least concerned the tree that bore it , which was rather perfecting the bud at the foot of the leaf stalk . His works are not to be studied , but read with a swift satisfaction . Their flavor and gust is like what poets tell of the forth of wine , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can never find the pages we had read . The first impression is the truest and the deepest , and there is no reprint , no double entendre , so to speak , for the alert reader . Yet they are in some degree true natural products in this respect . All things are but once , and never repeated . The first faint blushes of the morning , gilding the mountain tops , the pale phosphor and saffron-colored clouds do verily transport us to the morning of creation ; but what avails it to travel eastward , or look again there an hour hence ? We should be as far in the day ourselves , mounting toward our meridian . These works were designed for such complete success that they serve but for a single occasion . It is the luxury of art , when its own instrument is manufactured for each particular and present use . The knife which slices the bread of Jove ceases to be a knife when this service is rendered . Conclusion in our next . THOMAS CARLYLE AND HIS WORKS BY HENRY D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is wilfully and pertinaciously unjust , even scurrilous , impolite , ungentlemanly ; calls us " Imbeciles , " " Dilettants , " " Philistines , " implying sometimes what would not sound well expressed . If he would adopt the newspaper style , and take back these hard names  --  but where is the reader who does not derive some benefit from these epithets , applying them to himself ? Think not that with each repetition of them there is a fresh overflowing of bile ; oh no ! Perhaps none at all after the first time , only a faithfulness , the right name being found , to apply it  --  " They are the same ones we meant before "  --  and ofttimes with a genuine sympathy and encouragement expressed . Indeed , there appears in all his writings a hearty and manly sympathy with all misfortune and wretchedness , and not a weak and sniveling one . They who suspect a Mephistophiles , or sneering , satirical devil , under all , have not learned the secret of true humor , which sympathizes with the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is , in fact , the best tempered , and not the least impartial of reviewers . He goes out of his way to do justice to profligates and quacks . There is somewhat even Christian , in the rarest and most peculiar sense , in his universal brotherliness , his simple , child-like endurance , and earnest , honest endeavor , with sympathy for the like . And this fact is not insignificant , that he is almost the only writer of biography , of the lives of men , in modern times . So kind and generous a tribute to the genius of Burns can not be expected again , and is not needed . We honor him for his noble reverence for Luther , and his patient , almost reverent study of Goethe 's genius , anxious that no shadow of his author 's meaning escape him for want of trustful attention . There is nowhere else , surely , such determined and generous love of whatever is manly in history . His just appreciation of any , even inferior talent , especially of all sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor , must have impressed every reader . Witness the chapters on Werner , Heyne , even Cagliostro , and others . He is not likely to underrate his man . We are surprised to meet with such a discriminator of kingly qualities in these republican and democratic days , such genuine loyalty all thrown away upon the world . Carlyle , to adopt his own classification , is himself the hero , as literary man . There is no more notable working-man in England , in Manchester or Birmingham , or the mines round about . We know not how many hours a-day he toils , nor for what wages , exactly , we only know the results for us . We hear through the London fog and smoke the steady systole , diastole , and vibratory hum , from " Somebody 's Works " there ; the " Print Works , " say some ; the " Chemicals , " say others ; where something , at any rate , is manufactured which we remember to have seen in the market . This is the place , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboring men , something idle , something cunning and pretty merely , because the nine hundred and ninety-nine really write for fame or for amusement . But as the laborer works , and soberly by the sweat of his brow earns bread for his body , so this man works anxiously and sadly , to get bread of life , and dispense it . We can not do better than quote his own estimate of labor from Sartor Resartus . " Two men I honor , and no third . First ; the toil-worn craftsman that with earth-made implement laboriously conquers the earth , and makes her man 's . Venerable to me is the hard hand ; crooked , coarse , wherein , notwithstanding , lies a cunning virtue , indefeasibly royal , as of the sceptre of this planet . Venerable , too , is the rugged face , all weather-tanned , besoiled , with its rude intelligence ; for it is the face of a man living manlike . Oh , but the more venerable for thy rudeness , and even because we must pity as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so bent , for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed ; thou wert our conscript , on whom the lot fell , and fighting our battles wert so marred . For in thee , too , lay a god-created form , but it was not to be unfolded ; oncrusted must it stand with the thick adhesions and defacements of labor ; and thy body , like thy soul , was not to know freedom . Yet toil on , toil on ; thou art in thy duty , be out of it who may ; thou toilest for the altogether indispensable , for daily bread . " " A second man I honor , and still more highly ; him who is seen toiling for the spiritually indispensable ; not daily bread , but the bread of life . Is not he , too , in his duty , endeavoring toward inward harmony , revealing this , by act or by word , through all his outward endeavors , be they high or low ? Highest of all , when his outward and his inward endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not earthly craftsman only , but inspired thinker , that with heaven-made implement conquers heaven for us . If the poor and humble toil that we have food , must not the high and glorious toil for him in return , that he have light , have guidance , freedom , immortality ? These two in all their degrees , I honor ; all else is chaff and dust , which let the wind blow whither it listeth . " " Unspeakably touching is it , however , when I find both dignities united ; and he that must toil outwardly for the lowest of man 's wants , is also toiling inwardly for the highest . Sublimer in this world know I nothing than a peasant saint , could such now anywhere be met with . Such a one will take thee back to Nazareth itself ; thou wilt see the splendor of heaven spring forth from the humblest depths of earth , like a light shining in great darkness . " Notwithstanding the very genuine , admirable , and loyal tributes to Burns , Schiller , Goethe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the book of heroes , Shakspeare , the hero , as poet , comes off rather slimly . His sympathy , as we said , is with the men of endeavor ; not using the life got , but still bravely getting their life . " In fact , " as he says of Cromwell , " every where we have to notice the decisive , practical eye of this man ; how he drives toward the practical and practicable ; has a genuine insight into what is fact . " You must have very stout legs to get noticed at all by him . He is thoroughly English in his love of practical men , and dislike for cant , and ardent enthusiastic heads that are not supported by any legs . He would kindly knock them down that they may regain some vigor by touching their mother earth . We have often wondered how he ever found out Burns , and must still refer a good share of his delight in him to neighborhood and early association . The Lycidas and Comus appearing in Blackwood 's Magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect a Paradise Lost . The condition of England question is a practical one . The condition of England demands a hero , not a poet . Other things demand a poet ; the poet answers other demands . Carlyle in London , with this question pressing on him so urgently , sees no occasion for minstrels and rhapsodists there . Kings may have their bards when there are any kings . Homer would certainly go a begging there . He lives in Chelsea , not on the plains of Hindostan , nor on the prairies of the West , where settlers are scarce , and a man must at least go whistling to himself . What he says of poetry is rapidly uttered , and suggestive of a thought , rather than the deliberate development of any . He answers your question , What is poetry ? by writing a special poem , as that Norse one , for instance , in the Book of Heroes , altogether wild and original ;  --  answers your question , What is light ? by kindling a blaze which dazzles you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant might , by opening a shutter . And , certainly , you would say that this question never could be answered but by the grandest of poems ; yet he has not dull breath and stupidity enough , perhaps , to give the most deliberate and universal answer , such as the fates wring from illiterate and unthinking men . He answers like Thor , with a stroke of his hammer , whose dint makes a valley in the earth 's surface . Carlyle is not a seer , but a brave looker-on and reviewer ; not the most free and catholic observer of men and events , for they are likely to find him preoccupied , but unexpectedly free and catholic when they fall within the focus of his lens . He does not live in the present hour , and read men and books as they occur for his theme , but having chosen this , he directs his studies to this end . But if he supplies us with arguments and illustrations against himself , we will remember that we may perhaps be convicted of error from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stilts so far from the green pasturage around . If we look again at his page , we are apt to retract somewhat that we have said . Often a genuine poetic feeling dawns through it , like the texture of the earth seen through the dead grass and leaves in the spring . There is indeed more poetry in this author than criticism on poetry . He often reminds us of the ancient Scald , inspired by the grimmer features of life , dwelling longer on Dante than on Shakspeare . We have not recently met with a more solid and unquestionable piece of poetic work than that episode of " The Ancient Monk , " in Past and Present , at once idyllic , narrative , heroic ; a beautiful restoration of a past age . There is nothing like it elsewhere that we know of . The History of the French Revolution is a poem , at length got translated into prose ; an Iliad , indeed , as he himself has it  --  " The destructive wrath of Sansculotism : this is what we speak , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could suggest in this last , as indeed in most epics , that he should let in the sun oftener upon his picture . It does not often enough appear , but it is all revolution , the old way of human life turned simply bottom upward , so that when at length we are inadvertently reminded of the " Brest Shipping , " a St. Domingo colony , and that anybody thinks of owning plantations , and simply turning up the soil there , and that now at length , after some years of this revolution , there is a falling off in the importation of sugar , we feel a queer surprise . Had they not sweetened their water with Revolution then ? It would be well if there were several chapters headed " Work for the Mouth "  --  Revolution-work inclusive , of course  --  " Altitude of the Sun , " " State of the Crops and Markets , " " Meteorological Observations , " " Attractive Industry , " " Day Labor , " &c.,; just to remind the reader that the French peasantry did something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knotted cords , and embrace and throttle one another by turns . These things are sometimes hinted at , but they deserve a notice more in proportion to their importance . We want not only a background to the picture , but a ground under the feet also . We remark , too , occasionally , an unphilosophical habit , common enough elsewhere , in Alison 's History of Modern Europe , for instance , of saying , undoubtedly with effect , that if a straw had not fallen this way or that , why then  --  but , of course , it is as easy in philosophy to make kingdoms rise and fall as straws . The old adage is as true for our purpose , which says that a miss is as good as a mile . Who shall say how near the man came to being killed who was not killed ? If an apple had not fallen then we had never heard of Newton and the law of gravitation ; as if they could not have contrived to let fall a pear as well . The poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Carlyle has not the simple Homeric health of Wordsworth , nor the deliberate philosophic turn of Coleridge , nor the scholastic taste of Landor , but , though sick and under restraint , the constitutional vigor of one of his old Norse heroes , struggling in a lurid light , with Ituns still , striving to throw the old woman , and " she was Time "  --  striving to lift the big cat  --  and that was " The Great World-Serpent , which , tail in mouth , girds and keeps up the whole created world . " The smith , though so brawny and tough , I should not call the healthiest man . There is too much shopwork , too great extremes of heat and cold , and incessant ten-pound-ten and thrashing of the anvil , in his life . But the haymaker 's is a true sunny perspiration , produced by the extreme of summer heat only , and conversant with the blast of the zephyr , not of the forge-bellows . We know very well the nature of this man 's sadness , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There sits Bull in the court all the year round , with his hoarse bark and discontented growl  --  not a cross dog , only a canine habit , verging to madness some think  --  now separated from the shuddering travelers only by the paling , now heard afar in the horizon , even melodious there ; baying the moon o ' nights , baying the sun by day , with his mastiff mouth . He never goes after the cows , nor stretches in the sun , nor plays with the children . Pray give him a longer rope , ye gods , or let him go at large , and never taste raw meat more . The poet will maintain serenity in spite of all disappointments . He is expected to preserve an unconcerned and healthy outlook over the world while he lives . Philosophia practica est eruditionis meta , philosophy practiced is the good of learning ; and for that other , Oratoris est celare artem , we might read , Herois est celare pugnam , the hero will conceal his struggles . Poetry is the only life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product and free labor of man , performed only when he has put all the world under his feet , and conquered the last of his foes . Carlyle speaks of Nature with a certain unconscious pathos for the most part . She is to him a receded but ever memorable splendor , casting still a reflected light over all his scenery . As we read his books here in New England , where there are potatoes enough , and every man can get his living peacefully and sportively as the birds and bees , and need think no more of that , it seems to us as if by the world he often mean London , at the head of the tide upon the Thames , the sorest place on the face of the earth , the very citadel of conservatism . Possibly a South African village might have furnished a more hopeful , and more exacting audience , or in the silence of the wilderness and the desert ; he might have addressed himself more entirely to his true audience posterity . In his writings , we should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little enough expressed or even conscious sympathy , represents the Reformer class , and all the better for not being the acknowledged leader of any . In him the universal plaint is most settled , unappeasable and serious . Until a thousand named and nameless grievances are righted , there will be no repose for him in the lap of nature , or the seclusion of science and literature . By foreseeing it he hastens the crisis in the affairs of England , and is as good as many years added to her history . As we said , we have no adequate word from him concerning poets  --  Homer , Shakspeare ; nor more , we might add , of Saints  --  Jesus ; nor philosophers  --  Socrates , Plato ; nor mystics  --  Swedenborg . He has no articulate sympathy at least with such as these as yet . Odin , Mahomet , Cromwell , will have justice at his hands , and we would leave him to write the eulogies of all the giants of the will , but the kings of men , whose kingdoms are wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral greatness , what is highest and worthiest in character , he is not inclined to dwell upon or point to . To do himself justice , and set some of his readers right , he should give us some transcendent hero at length , to rule his demigods and Titans ; develop , perhaps , his reserved and dumb reverence for Christ , not speaking to a London or Church of England audience merely . Let not " sacred silence meditate that sacred matter " forever , but let us have sacred speech and sacred scripture thereon . True reverence is not necessarily dumb , but ofttimes prattling and hilarious as children in the spring . Every man will include in his list of worthies those whom he himself best represents . Carlyle , and our countryman Emerson , whose place and influence must ere long obtain a more distinct recognition , are , to a certain extent , the complement of each other . The age could not do with one of them , it can not do with both . To make a broad and rude distinction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , deals with the men of action  --  Mahomet , Luther , Cromwell ; the latter with the thinkers  --  Plato , Shakspeare , Goethe , for though both have written upon Goethe , they do not meet in him . The one has more sympathy with the heroes , or practical reformers , the other with the observers , or philosophers . Put these worthies together , and you will have a pretty fair representation of mankind ; yet with one or more memorable exceptions . To say nothing of Christ , who yet awaits a just appreciation from literature , the peacefully practical hero , whom Columbus may represent , is obviously slighted ; but above and after all , the Man of the Age , come to be called working-man , it is obvious that none yet speaks to his condition , for the speaker is not yet in his condition . There is poetry and prophecy to cheer him , and advice of the head and heart to the hands ; but no very memorable coperation , it must be confessed , since the Christian era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a note-worthy fact , that a man addresses effectually in another only himself still , and what he himself does and is , alone can he prompt the other to do and to become . Like speaks to like only ; labor to labor , philosophy to philosophy , criticism to criticism , poetry to poetry , &c.; Literature speaks how much still to the past , how little to the future , how much to the east , how little to the west  --  In the East fames are won , In the West deeds are done . One more merit in Carlyle , let the subject be what it may , is the freedom of prospect he allows , the entire absence of cant and dogma . He removes many cart-loads of rubbish , and leaves open a broad highway . His writings are all enfenced on the side of the future and the possible . He does not place himself across the passage out of his books , so that none may go freely out , but rather by the entrance , inviting all to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pickets here , to restrain the free thinking reader . In many books called philosophical , we find ourselves running hither and thither , under and through , and sometimes quite unconsciously stradding some imaginary fence-work , which in our clairvoyance we had not noticed , but fortunately , not with such fatal consequences as happen to those birds which fly against a white-washed wall , mistaking it for fluid air . As we proceed the wreck of this dogmatic tissue collects about the organs of our perception , like cobwebs about the muzzles of hunting dogs in dewy mornings . If we look up with such eyes as these authors furnish , we see no heavens , but a low pent-roof of straw or tiles , as if we stood under a shed , with no sky-light through which to glimpse the blue . Carlyle , though he does but inadvertently direct our eyes to the open heavens , nevertheless , lets us wander broadly underneath , and shows them to us reflected in innumerable pools and lakes . We have from him , occasionally , some hints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly arcana , but nothing definite hitherto . These volumes contain not the highest , but a very practicable wisdom , which startles and provokes , rather than informs us . Carlyle does not oblige us to think ; we have thought enough for him already , but he compels us to act . We accompany him rapidly through an endless gallery of pictures , and glorious reminiscences of experiences unimproved . " Have you not had Moses and the prophets ? Neither will ye be persuaded if one should rise from the dead . " There is no calm philosophy of life here , such as you might put at the end of the Almanac , to hang over the farmer 's hearth , how men shall live in these winter , in these summer days . No philosophy , properly speaking , of love , or friendship , or religion , or politics , or education , or nature , or spirit ; perhaps a nearer approach to a philosophy of kingship , and of the place of the literary man , than of any thing else . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon , and benediction , but no contemplation of man 's life from serene oriental ground , nor yet from the stirring occidental . No thanksgiving sermon for the holydays , or the Easter vacations , when all men submit to float on the full currents of life . When we see with what spirits , though with little heroism enough , wood-choppers , drovers , and apprentices , take and spend life , playing all day long , sunning themselves , shading themselves , eating , drinking , sleeping , we think that the philosophy of their life written would be such a level natural history as the Gardener 's Calendar , and the works of the early botanists , inconceivably slow to come to practical conclusions ; its premises away off before the first morning light , ere the heather was introduced into the British isles , and no inferences to be drawn during this noon of the day , not till after the remote evening shadows have begun to fall around . There is no philosophy here for philosophers , only as every man is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man himself ; and , indeed , he stands compactly enough . No progress beyond the first assertion and challenge , as it were , with trumpet blast . One thing is certain , that we had best be doing something in good earnest , henceforth forever ; that 's an indispensable philosophy . The before impossible precept , " know thyself , " he translates into the partially possible one , " know what thou canst work at . " Sartor Resartus is , perhaps , the sunniest and most philosophical , as it is the most autobiographical of his works , in which he drew most largely on the experience of his youth . But we miss everywhere a calm depth , like a lake , even stagnant , and must submit to rapidity and whirl , as on skates , with all kinds of skillful and antic motions , sculling , sliding , cutting punch-bowls and rings , forward and backward . The talent is very nearly equal to the genius . Sometimes it would be preferable to wade slowly through a Serbonian bog , and feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not speculated far , but faithfully , living up to it . He lays all the stress still on the most elementary and initiatory maxims , introductory to philosophy . It is the experience of the religionist . He pauses at such a quotation as , " It is only with renunciation that life , properly speaking , can be said to begin ; " or , " Doubt of any sort can not be removed except by action ; " or , " Do the duty which lies nearest thee . " The chapters entitled , " The Everlasting No , " and " The Everlasting Yea , " contain what you might call the religious experience of his hero . In the latter , he assigns to him these words , brief , but as significant as any we remember in this author :  --  " One Bible I know , of whose plenary inspiration doubt is not so much as possible ; nay , with my own eyes I saw the God's-hand writing it : thereof all other Bibles are but leaves . " This belong 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccountably in " The Everlasting No , " under the negative pole . " Truth ! " he still cries with Tefelsdrock , " though the heavens crush me for following her : no falsehood ! though a whole celestial Lubberland were the price of apostacy . " Again , " Living without God in the world , of God 's light I was not utterly bereft ; if my as yet sealed eyes , with their unspeakable longing , could nowhere see Him , nevertheless , in my heart . He was present , and His heaven-written law still stood legible and sacred there . " Again , " Ever from that time , the era of his Protest , the temper of my misery was changed : not fear or whining sorrow was it , but indignation and grim , fire-eyed defiance . " And in the " Centre of Indifference , " as editor , he observes , that " it was no longer a quite hopeless unrest , " and then proceeds , not in his best style , " For the fire-baptized soul , long so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which feeling is its Baphometic Baptism : the citadel of its whole kingdom it has thus gained by assault , and will keep inexpungable ; outward from which the remaining dominions , not , indeed , without hard battling , will doubtless by degrees be conquered and pacificated . " Beside some philosophers of larger vision , Carlyle stands like an honest , half-despairing boy , grasping at some details only of their world systems . Philosophy , certainly , is some account of truths , the fragments and very insignificant parts of which man will practice in this work-shop ; truths infinite and in harmony with infinity ; in respect to which the very objects and ends of the so-called practical philosopher , will be mere propositions , like the rest . It would be no reproach to a philosopher , that he knew the future better than the past , or even than the present . It is better worth knowing . He will prophecy , tell what is to be , or in other words , what alone is , under appearances , laying little stress on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . He has no more to do with the condition of England than with her national debt , which a vigorous generation would not inherit . The philosopher 's conception of things will , above all , be truer than other men 's , and his philosophy will subordinate all the circumstances of life . To live like a philosopher , is to live , not foolishly , like other men , but wisely , and according to universal laws . In this , which was the ancient sense , we think there has been no philosopher in modern times . The wisest and most practical men of recent history , to whom this epithet has been hastily applied , have lived comparatively meagre lives , of conformity and tradition , such as their fathers transmitted to them . But a man may live in what style he can . Between earth and heaven , there is room for all kinds . If he take counsel of fear and prudence , he has already failed . One who believed , by his very constitution , some truth which a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten in this world ; for it needs but a fraction of truth to found houses and empires on . However , such distinctions as poet and philosopher , do not much assist our final estimate of a man ; we do not lay much stress on them . " A man 's a man for a that . " If Carlyle does not take two steps in philosophy , are there any who take three ? Philosophy having crept clinging to the rocks , so far , puts out its feelers many ways in vain . It would be hard to surprise him by the relation of any important human experience , but in some nook or corner of his works , you will find that this , too , was sometimes dreamed of in his philosophy . To sum up our most serious objections , in a few words , we should say that Carlyle indicates a depth ,  --  and we mean not impliedly , but distinctly ,  --  which he neglects to fathom . We want to know more about that which he wants to know as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is visible from his station , which is not visible from ours , the interests of science require that the fact be communicated to us . The universe expects every man to do his duty in his parallel of latitude . We want to hear more of his inmost life ; his hymn and prayer , more ; his elegy and eulogy , less ; that he should speak more from his character , and less from his talent ; communicate centrally with his readers , and not by a side ; that he should say what he believes , without suspecting that men disbelieve it , out of his never-misunderstood nature . Homer and Shakspeare speak directly and confidently to us . The confidence implied in the unsuspicious tone of the world 's worthies , is a great and encouraging fact . Dig up some of the earth you stand on , and show that . If he gave us religiously the meagre results of his experience , his style would be less picturesque and diversified , but more attractive and impressive . His genius can cover all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abide in them , but pitches his tent rather in the desert and on the mountain peak . When we look about for something to quote , as the fairest specimen of the man , we confess that we labor under an unusual difficulty ; for his philosophy is so little of the proverbial or sentential kind , and opens so gradually , rising insensibly from the reviewer 's level , and developing its thought completely and in detail , that we look in vain for the brilliant passages , for point and antithesis , and must end by quoting his works entire . What in a writer of less breadth would have been the proposition which would have bounded his discourse , his column of victory , his Pillar of Hercules , and ne plus ultra , is in Carlyle frequently the same thought unfolded ; no Pillar of Hercules , but a considerable prospect , north and south , along the Atlantic coast . There are other pillars of Hercules , like beacons and light-houses , still further in the horizon , toward At lantis , set up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as this traveler goes , he clears and colonizes , and all the surplus population of London is bound thither at once . What we would quote is , in fact , his vivacity , and not any particular wisdom or sense , which last is ever synonymous with sentence , sententia , as in his contemporaries , Coleridge , Landor and Wordsworth . We have not attempted to discriminate between his works , but have rather regarded them all as one work , as is the man himself . We have not examined so much as remembered them . To do otherwise , would have required a more indifferent , and perhaps even less just review , than the present . The several chapters were thankfully received , as they came out , and now we find it impossible to say which was best ; perhaps each was best in its turn . They do not require to be remembered by chapters  --  that is a merit  --  but are rather remembered as a well-known strain , reviving from time to time , when it had nearly died away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavors . In his last work , " The Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell , " Carlyle has added a chapter to the history of England ; has actually written a chapter of her history , and , in comparison with this , there seems to be no other ,  --  this , and the thirty thousand or three hundred thousand pamphlets in the British Museum , and that is all . This book is a practical comment on Universal History . What if there were a British Museum in Athens and Babylon , and nameless cities ! It throws light on the history of the Iliad and the labors of Pisistratus . History is , then , an account of memorable events that have sometime transpired , and not an incredible and confused fable , quarters for scholars merely , or a gymnasium for poets and orators . We may say that he has dug up a hero , who was buried alive in his battle-field , hauled him out of his cairn , on which every passer had cast a pamphlet . We had heard of their digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , to be sure they were there , their bones , seven feet of them ; but they had to bury them again . Others have helped to make known Shakspeare , Milton , Herbert , to give a name to such treasures as we all possessed ; but , in this instance , not only a lost character has been restored to our imaginations , but palpably a living body , as it were , to our senses , to wear and sustain the former . His Cromwell 's restoration , if England will read it faithfully , and addressed to New England too . Every reader will make his own application . To speak deliberately , we think that in this instance , vague rumor and a vague history have for the first time been subjected to a rigid scrutiny , and the wheat , with at least novel fidelity , sifted from the chaff ; so that there remain for result ,  --  First , Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell , now for the first time read or readable , and well nigh as complete as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imperfect and fragmentary life , which may , with probability , be fathered upon him ; thirdly , this wreck of an ancient picture , the present editor has , to the best of his ability , restored , sedulously scraping away the daubings of successive bunglers , and endeavoring to catch the spirit of the artist himself . Not the worst , nor a barely possible , but for once the most favorable construction has been put upon this evidence of the life of a man , and the result is a picture of the ideal Cromwell , the perfection of the painter 's art . Possibly this was the actual man . At any rate , this only can contain the actual hero . We confess that when we read these Letters and Speeches , unquestionably Cromwell 's , with open and confident mind , we get glimpses occasionally of a grandeur and heroism , which even this editor has not proclaimed . His " Speeches " make us forget modern orators , and might go right into the next edition of the Old Testament , without alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken him to be . These Letters and Speeches have supplied the lost key to his character . Verily another soldier than Bonaparte ; rejoicing in the triumph of a psalm ; to whom psalms were for Magna Charta and Heralds ' Book , and whose victories were " crowning mercies . " For stern , antique , and practical religion , a man unparalleled , since the Jewish dispensation , in the line of kings . An old Hebrew warrior , indeed , and last right-hand man of the Lord of Hosts , that has blown his ram 's horn about Jericho . Yet , with a remarkable common sense and unexpected liberality , there was joined in him , too , such a divine madness , though with large and sublime features , as that of those dibblers of beans on St. George 's Hill , whom Carlyle tells of . He still listened to ancient and decaying oracles . If his actions were not always what Christianity or the truest philosophy teaches , still they never fail to impress us as noble , and however violent , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . His unquestionable hardness , not to say willfulness , not prevailing by absolute truth and greatness of character , but honestly striving to bend things to his will , is yet grateful to consider in this or any age . As John Maidstone said , " He was a strong man in the dark perils of war ; in the high places of the field , hope shone in him like a pillar of fire , when it had gone out in the others . " And as Milton sang , whose least testimony can not be spared  --  " Our chief of men , Guided by faith and matchless fortitude . " None ever spake to Cromwell before , sending a word of cheer across the centuries  --  not the " hear ! " " hear ! " of modern parliaments , but the congratulation and sympathy of a brother soul . The Letters and Speeches owe not a little to the " Intercalations " and " Annotations " of the " latest of the Commentators . " The reader will not soon forget how like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker , he is all on the alert , and sympathetic , nudging his neighbors from time to time , and throwing in his responsive or interrogatory word . All is good , both that which he did n't hear , and that which he did . He not only makes him speak audibly , but he makes all parties listen to him , all England sitting round , and give in their comments , " groans , " or " blushes , " or " assent ; " indulging sometimes in triumphant malicious applications to the present day , when there is a palpable hit ; supplying the look and attitude of the speaker , and the tone of his voice , and even rescuing his unutterable , wrecked and submerged thought ,  --  for this orator begins speaking anywhere within sight of the beginning , and leaves off when the conclusion is visible . Our merchant listens , restless , meanwhile , encouraging his fellow-auditors , when the speech grows dim and involved , and pleasantly congratulating them , when it runs smoothly ; or , in touching soliloquy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  " Courage , my brave one ! " And all along , between the Letters and Speeches , as readers well remember , he has ready such a fresh top-of-the-morning salutation as conjures up the spirits of those days , and men go marching over English sward , not wired skeletons , but with firm , elastic muscles , and clang of armor on their thighs , if they wore swords , or the twang of psalms and canticles on their lips . His blunt , " Who are you ? " put to the shadowy ghosts of history , they vanish into deeper obscurity than ever . Vivid phantasmagorian pictures of what is transpiring in England in the meanwhile , there are , not a few , better than if you had been there to see . All of Carlyle 's works might well enough be embraced under the title of one of them , a good specimen brick , " On Heroes , Hero-worship , and the Heroic in History . " Of this department , he is the Chief Professor in the World 's University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such loyal and generous sympathy with the heroes of history , not one in one age only , but forty in forty ages , such an unparalleled reviewing and greeting of all past worth , with exceptions , to be sure ,  --  but exceptions were the rule , before ,  --  it was , indeed , to make this the age of review writing , as if now one period of the human story were completing itself , and getting its accounts settled . This soldier has told the stories with new emphasis , and will be a memorable hander-down of fame to posterity . And with what wise discrimination he has selected his men , with reference both to his own genius and to theirs : Mahomet ,  --  Dante ,  --  Cromwell ,  --  Voltaire ,  --  Johnson ,  --  Burns ,  --  Goethe ,  --  Richter ,  --  Schiller ,  --  Mirabeau ; could any of these have been spared ? These we wanted to hear about . We have not as commonly the cold and refined judgment of the scholar and critic merely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow and warmth of friendship . There is sympathy not with mere fames , and formless , incredible things , but with kindred men ,  --  not transiently , but life-long he has walked with them . The attitude of some , in relation to Carlyle 's love of heroes , and men of the sword , reminds us of the procedure at the anti-slavery meetings , when some member , being warmed , begins to speak with more latitude than usual of the Bible or the Church , for a few prudent and devout ones to spring a prayer upon him , as the saying is ; that is , propose suddenly to unite in prayer , and so solemnize the minds of the audience , or dismiss them at once ; which may oftener be to interrupt a true prayer by most gratuitous profanity . But the spring of this trap , we are glad to learn , has grown somewhat rusty , and is not so sure of late . No doubt , some of Carlyle 's worthies , should they ever return to earth , would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their characters ; but if he can return a man 's life more perfect to our hands , than it was left at his death , following out the design of its author , we shall have no great cause to complain . We do not want a Daguerreotype likeness . All biography is the life of Adam ,  --  a much experienced man ,  --  and time withdraws something partial from the story of every individual , that the historian may supply something general . If these virtues were not in this man , perhaps they are in his biographer ,  --  no fatal mistake . Really , in any other sense , we never do , nor desire to , come at the historical man ,  --  unless we rob his grave , that is the nearest approach . Why did he die , then ? He is with his bones , surely . No doubt , Carlyle has a propensity to exaggerate the heroic in history , that is , he creates you an ideal hero rather than another thing , he has most of that material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one narrower sense it is not so convenient . Yet what were history if he did not exaggerate it ? How comes it that history never has to wait for facts , but for a man to write it ? The ages may go on forgetting the facts never so long , he can remember two for every one forgotten . The musty records of history , like the catacombs , contain the perishable remains , but only in the breast of genius are embalmed the souls of heroes . There is very little of what is called criticism here ; it is love and reverence , rather , which deal with qualities not relatively , but absolutely great ; for whatever is admirable in a man is something infinite , to which we can not set bounds . These sentiments allow the mortal to die , the immortal and divine to survive . There is something antique , even in his style of treating his subject , reminding us that Heroes and Demi-gods , Fates and Furies , still exist , the common man is nothing to him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven , as in the religion of the Greeks . Exaggeration ! was ever any virtue attributed to a man without exaggeration ? was ever any vice , without infinite exaggeration ? Do we not exaggerate ourselves to ourselves , or do we recognize ourselves for the actual men we are ? Are we not all great men ? Yet what are we actually to speak of ? We live by exaggeration , what else is it to anticipate more than we enjoy ? The lightning is an exaggeration of the light . Exaggerated history is poetry , and truth referred to a new standard . To a small man every greater is an exaggeration . He who can not exaggerate is not qualified to utter truth . No truth we think was ever expressed but with this sort of emphasis , so that for the time there seemed to be no other . Moreover , you must speak loud to those who are hard of hearing , and so you acquire a habit of shouting to those who are not . By an immense exaggeration we appreciate our Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miltons , our Liberty and Christianity . We give importance to this hour over all other hours . We do not live by justice , but by grace . As the sort of justice which concerns us in our daily intercourse is not that administered by the judge , so the historical justice which we prize is not arrived at by nicely balancing the evidence . In order to appreciate any , even the humblest man , you must first , by some good fortune , have acquired a sentiment of admiration , even of reverence , for him , and there never were such exaggerators as these . Simple admiration for a hero renders a juster verdict than the wisest criticism , which necessarily degrades what is high to its own level . There is no danger in short of saying too much in praise of one man , provided you can say more in praise of a better man . If by exaggeration a man can create for us a hero , where there was nothing but dry bones before , we will thank him , and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history properly begins , when some genius arises , who can turn the dry and musty records into poetry . As we say , looking to the future , that what is best is truest , so , in one sense , we may say looking into the past , for the only past that we are to look at , must also be future to us . The great danger is not of excessive partiality or sympathy with one , but of a shallow justice to many , in which , after all , none gets his deserts . Who has not experienced that praise is truer than naked justice ? As if man were to be the judge of his fellows , and should repress his rising sympathy with the prisoner at the bar , considering the many honest men abroad , whom he had never countenanced . To try him by the German rule of referring an author to his own standard , we will quote the following from Carlyle 's remarks on history , and leave the reader to consider how far his practice has been consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy teaching by experience , the writer fitted to compose history , is hitherto an unknown man . The experience itself would require all knowledge to record it , were the All-wisdom needful for such Philosophy as would interpret it , to be had for asking . Better were it that mere earthly historians should lower such pretensions , more suitable for omniscience than for human science ; and aiming only at some picture of the things acted , which picture itself , will at best be a poor approximation , leave the inscrutable purport of them an acknowledged secret ; or , at most , in reverent Faith , far different from that teaching of Philosophy , pause over the mysterious vestiges of Him , whose path is in the great deep of Time , whom history indeed reveals , but only all History and in Eternity , will clearly reveal . " Who lives in London to tell this generation who have been the great men of our race ? We have read that on some exposed place in the city of Geneva , they have fixed a brazen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountain summits in the horizon marked upon it , " so that by taking sight across the index you can distinguish them at once . You will not mistake Mont Blanc , if you see him , but until you get accustomed to the panorama , you may easily mistake one of his court for the king . " It stands there a piece of mute brass , that seems nevertheless to know in what vicinity it is : and there perchance it will stand , when the nation that placed it there has passed away , still in sympathy with the mountains , forever discriminating in the desert . So , we may say , stands this man , pointing as long as he lives , in obedience to some spiritual magnetism , to the summits in the historical horizon , for the guidance of his fellows . Truly , our greatest blessings are very cheap . To have our sunlight without paying for it , without any duty levied ,  --  to have our poet there in England , to furnish us entertainment , and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives long , to make the world seem richer for us , the age more respectable , and life better worth the living ,  --  all without expense of acknowledgment even , but silently accepted out of the east , like morning light as a matter of course .
