txt Mr. B. Is there any prospect that the community will ever understand your new system of philosophy and faith ? For years the inquiry has been " What is Transcendentalism * and no intelligible answer has been given . The terms you use to express your ideas are new and hard to be understood . If you will drop your strange terminology and give your thoughts in plain , coma-ion sense language , you will do n-ic a favor as an honest searcher after truth . If you have new titin*s as well as new words and names , why can not you in a familiar way , communicate them ? Mr. A. You can readily see that a person may have ideas which can not he conveyed with precision to those who have h2d neither the ideas nor the words by which they are expressed . It is so in all the sciences , and particularly in the science of tho ght . But the principal reason why we are not understood is , men think so superficially . Most minds skin-i over the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea of thought , remain long enough for distinct vision , and seize and bring up the precious pearls . How often do you throw out thoughts which , to your own mind , are great and comprehensive , scarcely a gle in of which enters the brain of one in twenty of your hearers ! How little original thinking is there amori* that numerous class of our citiz*n* who are called educated . Most of them dare not trust themsel es with a idea which did not come from their text-books . If the *uardiai angel , genius , should suggest a new thought to their minds , they would crush it in the birth lest it should grow into an heresy . Look at the books which fly from the i*ress liV autumn leaves from the tree , without one new thought . An original mind , a genius , rarely appears , and is as rarely appreciated by his own age . The prophet is not in honor in his own country . This has been true in all time ; it always will be true , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own age . Human pride and self-sufficiency predispose men to be ungrateful for teachings more inspired than their own . " Dost thou teach us ? " is their contemptuous reply to those who now attempt to open the eyes of the blind ; and " they cast them out . " Mr. B. Well , granting that to your mind there is an extent and depth of meaning i the to ms of your philosophy which I do not see , // yet is it not possible to convey to my mind some true and definite idea of the thing called Transcendentalism ? Dropping its scientific terms and all technicalities , can we not talk upon the real thing in plain English ? Mr. A. I trust we may , to some extent at least ; for the thing , as you call it , is more generally felt than you suppose . It has been said that every one is , in a sense , a poet ; no one can read a poem well if not in a poetic mood . So I would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , all who allow their minds any latitude of thought , at times have thoughts and feelings which are properly called transcendental . Hence we have aimed to establish schools , that the mind even in childhood , before it becomes cramped by forms , and before the inner light of the soul becomes dimmed or totally extinguished by the senses , may receive a right direction ; be made to think for itself , and be led to see-not the forms of things , but things themselves . All men , though in different degrees and varied forms , would be transcendentalists if they received a spiritual rather than a sensual culture . r . B. Let us here come directly to the point . I have long suspected myself of transcendentalism , and would gladly gather from you some clear idea of it , that I may know *vbether I am within or without the pale of discipleship . Mr. A. But you must remember that this is a very extensive subject . It would lead us a long way back , to Kant and*ven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some in England and France , and a few in our own country , must be discussed , in order to get a clear view of the whole . And then there are all varieties and degrees of transcendentalism . Those in Germany who followed Kant and adopted much of his philosophy , differed from him in many important particulars . Fichte , Schelling , Hegel , had each his own system , though they have been called transcendentalists . What , in loose language , is termed transcendentalism , is variously modified in different countries by different individuals , who have embraced that system of metaphysics which , leaving the field of sensual knowledge , soars into the regions of pure thought . The transcendentalists of our country , influenced to a great extent by the writings of Carlyle , have made great advances upon the Kantean philosophy ; we have not only gone farther in our search for spiritual truth , but we have applied our philosophy to different subjects , and made it bear more directly upon the duties and relations of life . Mr. B. We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as technicalities , out of view . I wish to talk with you upon your transcendentalism , and know whether it is possible for us to understand each other . Mr. A. I will comply with your request upon one condition . You shall not reproach me with nonsense and fog if you fail to apprehend my meaning . Your sensual school of philosophyMr . B. Stop , lest we raise bad blood in settling the preliminaries . I accept the condition , and propose that we commence with man . You claim that your views of man 's spiritual nature are altogether truer and nobler than those which generally prevail . Mr. A. Instead of considering man a mere creature of sense and intellect , but little superior to animal instinct , we view him a free , spiritual existence , of unlimited capacities , possessed of a soul truly godlike , and in every way qualified for knowing truth and duty . Locke has entirely misled the world in some of the most vital points . Making the soul a blank leaf , upon which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote whatsoever they listed , // he left man , like the brute , at the mercy of any thing that chanced to leave upon his brains the deepest impression . He left man no fixed pole-star by which to direct his course , but only the flickering taper of self-interest , in following which , he has been wrecked upon every sand-bar . He granted him reflection , but this was only a kind of ruminating upon the gross food furnished by the senses . This chewing of the cud only aided the digestion ; it gave no new spiritual aliment to the system . Man was to ascertain truth and duty , not from listening to the clear response of the divine oracle within him , but from the prompting of the appetite ; that was truth which was sweet , that a lie which was bitter to the palate . Duty , virtue , properly speaking , there were none . If a man , by balancing pains and pleasures , present or future , could find which end of the steelyards would probably preponderate , there lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , of the civilized world . In opposition to this sensual system , we maintain that man has other faculties than the bodily senses  --  a soul distinct from the stomach . He is endowed with reason and strong religious sentiments , which intuitively know and spontaneously feel truth and duty . That is true , not because of its greater profit or pleasure , but true because it is in agreement with the eternal nature of things . And God has gifted man with the faculty to discover this truth . Duty rests upon this discovered truth . Man has no arithmetical calculations to make to find his duty ; it lies revealed to this faculty . The right is to be followed , come pleasure or pain ; his obligation to do right is infinite , having all the weight of established and unchangeable truth . We give the soul a faculty which is wanting , or which is certainly overlooked in the common philosophy of the age . And this faculty is the chief quality belonging to man . It is this which , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation . This faculty is a divine , truth-seeing reason . Man appears to me in a new light , belonging to a higher order of beings , since I have studied him as he is . He is associated in my mind with celestial beings , rather than with creeping things . This view of man affects all his moral relations . It sets aside , or rather rises superior to all that endless cal. - culation and argument about God , conscience , religion , which for centuries have occupied the church . Mr. B. I can heartily respond to much which you say . And certainly man needs to have his attention turned more to those great facts relating to his spiritual nature . But you will pardon me if I call your attention more particularly to some things which you have stated . This higher faculty of reason which you claim as so great a discovery in mental science , and which you glory in as a distinguishing feature of your sys. - tem , I believe to be important , but can not see to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Abraham . But for centuries men have lost sight of it . We claim only that we have found what had been lost . Practically it is a new discovery , though the time was when the great truths which this faculty reveals animated and inspired the greatest minds . Mr. B. But I can see nothing in this which has not been recognized , and which is not now recognized in some form by those whom you would hesitate to call disciples of your school . You have justly laid more stress upon this faculty , I will admit , than has been usually done ; but how can you claim it to be a new discovery , even in the sense you have stated ? Has not every enlightened moralist and Christian preacher advocated the idea that truth and falsehood , right and wrong , are , in their very nature , eternally // separate ? How can this have escaped you , when , for example , you have read the argument in favor of the Christian religion drawn from the nature of its doctrines ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing that it sees and knows many of these doctrines to be true ? - that man is compelled , from the nature God has given him , to assent to the rightfulness and the righteousness of the precepts of the gospel ? It has ever been claimed that the fundamental precepts of moral conduct are so plain that the fool need not err , and the heathen are without excuse . When the spirit of infidelity , coursing up and down the page of revelation , has sought some weak point at which to commence its sacrilegious work , where has it alighted ? Upon the fundamental doctrines and precepts of Christianity ? By no means . And why ? Because infidelity itself has been forced to acknowledge this citadel impregnable . The leading doctrines of the gospel mankind have felt to be true . They appeal directly to the soul , conscience , reason , the whole inner man , and , except in a strait of desperation , the infidel has not dared to lay his hands upon these truths , but has made his attacks upon some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike insignificant , knowing that the common sense and reason of the world would cry out against him , if he assailed the love , the benevolence , the humility , the charity , the forgiveness , the repentance , enjoined in the gospel . When infidelity has denied the validity of the evidence in favor of revelation , and inferred that man is under no obligation to practice the virtues there enjoined , what has been our reply ? Why , that proof or no proof on this point , there was still another ground of obligation , one which it could not gainsay , viz , the testimony of man 's reason and conscience to the truthfulness of the practical doctrines contained in the Bible . Hence in various forms and relations we have always held to a truth-seeing and duty-knowing faculty in man . Mr. A. But you have confounded it with the understanding , which can never see either spiritual or universal truths , but has to do only with the senses . And thus you have subjected all classes of ideas to the scrutiny of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denying every thing , to throwing religious and sensual truths into the same category , producing endless confusion . Mr. B. Why not elucidate this matter of the reason and the understanding thus : - Looking upon the mind as a unit , and not a medley of separate faculties , we say , the mind , when acting in one capacity , judges ; in another , remembers ; in another , imagines ; in another , wills , and so on . It is the whole mind , acting in its various directions and capacities , that gives rise to this digtinction of faculties . Now when we speak of the understanding and reason as separate faculties , or as heading two different classes of mental operations , we mean no more than that the mind , as one active agent , occupied with one class of objects , or in one capacity , is called the understanding ; in another capacity , or acting upon a different class of objects , is called reason . Take an example given by one of your own writers to illustrate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its angles equal to two right angles . This is a discovery of the understanding . Now the understanding would never see that all triangles must have their angles equal to two right angles ; but the reason sees this universal truth . Very well . It is the mind , dropping any particular triangle , which grasps a fact common to all such figures . It is the understanding , say you , which is occupied upon the natural sciences , in classifying men , ani // mals , vegetables , minerals , &amp;c. into genera and species ; but it is the reason which sees those facts common to all of the same genus or species . But the whole mind is occupied in all this ; and those who never heard of the distinction between the understanding and the reason , recognize both these powers of the mind . Mr. A. But what the reason does here is quite an unimportant part of its official work , compared with what it does in the higher sphere of spiritual truth . The understanding would indeed make blundering work any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a kind of intellectual hopper , which the senses furnish with grain , and by means of a little grinding power of the reason , it is enabled to furnish flour well bolted , bagged , and ready for use . But while the reason assists the understanding in manufacturing these materials of the senses , its peculiar province is to know God , virtue and religion , and here it receives no aid , but is hindered in its operations by the senses and the understanding . You have tried to make the intellectual mill grind spiritual things as well as material . You have set the senses laboriously to work to fill the hopper with their coarse grains ,  - -  arguments for a God , a soul , a Christianity , a religion ,  --  then hoisted the gate , and with deafening screakings and monotonous scrannel pipings , you have produced-meal ? the driest unsavory bran , and nothing more , say most , and then you fall to disputing with them whether it is bran or meal . Is it wonderful that none but dyspeptics will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a radical distinction between these two faculties , but it is of the utmost importance to a spiritual religion that it be maintained . Mr. B. I have no objection to the distinction ; I deem it important ; but I can not sympathize with your objection to employing the mind , the whole mind , or any one of its faculties , in discussing religious topics . Religion , say you , is not the province of the understanding , but of the reason . Well , if of the reason , then of the mind in the exercise of reason . Mr. A. Yes ! but man has a soul , and you would leave him nothing but a fragment of intellect , to be occupied indifferently , either upon a piece of carpentry , the different methods of cookery , or a system of religion . What faculty , in your metaphysics , is it , by which a man is thrown into raptures by the beauties of nature , the inspirations of the poet , or contemplations of the godlike ? You would secularize every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of beauty , or the wonders of a wonder-working God ! Your philosophy has so benumbed your spiritual nature , that you can not even talk upon this subject . You remind me of the clodpole who grunted out- " pshaw ! what 's the use of those weeds , " as he saw a lovely damsel weaving a bouquet . Standing under the roar of Niagara , your only thought would be , whether the position were eligible for a sawmill . You must change your whole method of thinking , and look with a different eye upon the universe , before you can see all that is visible to man 's divine reason . The reason is a faculty quite different from the logical power , by which one gets the better of an opponent in an argument . It directly sees , and at the same time feels the truth , and beauty , and goodness , of all things . True , mind is essentially the same in all men ; yet upon almost every subject how varied are men 's opinions ; and upon no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And not their opinions only , but their feelings and whole spiritual nature differ entirely . Of the millions who cultivate the earth , or of the less numerous but more favored // class of mere consumers , few , like Burns , are alive to the beauty and infinity of its forms . He saw more in the thistle at his door-stone , than others would see in traversing the whole of leafy India . The soul of one is thrilled with the music of the spheres , while thousands stare at the heavens with the stupidity of the ox . The language of devotion is uttered by every tree , flower , and running brook , but seldom is there an ear to hear , and a heart to feel . Yet the tympanum of all ears is of the same construction ; dissect men , and you will find the heart , ventricles , veins , and arteries , the same in all . Why then , you may as well reason , is there such difference in the hearing and feeling of living men ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the same outward condition , see , hear , and feel sensitively ? The only answer is , after abating much for different natural endowments , most men look at every thing through the eye of the understanding , rather than through the eye of teason I maintain , that all possess the godlike faculty of discerning religious truth , but they neglect to use it . They must argue every point ; call councils and diets to weigh evidence , and by a majority of votes , put the matter beyond dispute , decide what is orthodox , and what men shall believe upon due pains and penalties . Hence to-day , this is sound doctrine ; to-morrow , the mail arrives bringing intelligence from some such ecclesiastical debating club , that if you continue to believe it , you shall be hung , and no mass said for your soul . The fact has been entirely overlooked , that the understanding is not adapted to the discovery of truth in things spiritual . Men have endeavored to settle points in religion , as they settle questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church has changed with every fresh breeze of ecele siastical discussion . Notwithstanding the infallibility of popes and prelates , the orthodox and the beterodox have changed places some hundred times . And as long as men disregard or overlook the inner light of reason , and place religion and Christianity among the subjects of debate , so long will these shiftings of belief continue . Mr. B. Did it belong to the ob . ject of our present discussion , I would attempt quite a different solution of this change in religious belief . You seem to grant that reason has been recognized as a mental faculty . I claim , that appeals have ever been made to it in the search for truth , and particularly in the examination of scripture doctrines . Mr. A. Why then those volumes of arguments , a priori and a postenon , to prove that there is a God , a Christianity , even a religion in the universe ? Why have not your Christian philosophers pointed men directly to the facts of a religion as they exist , and can be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would point them to the existence of any objects of vision , and there leave them , taking it for granted that these facts were seen ? Instead of this , they have debated all these points as problematical ; God 's very existence has been left a peradveature , and all truth and duty disputable . So far from turning the mind in upon itself that it might see truth , and feel the infinite weight of duty , you have only led it to question whether they are realities . I am willing to concede that some minds have recognized a reason superior to the understanding . It is too obvious to be overlooked by those who think deeply . Still , this distinction has , to the infinite detriment of truth , been disregarded . Mr. B. These points have been discussed that the mind might be turned to them . Argument affects the mind in reference to a thousand // things concerning which there is really no disbelief . When the sceptic , one starry night , was dealing out his atheistic notions to Napoleon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these then ? " there was an argument , virtually the whole argument , for the existence of a God . Now I ask , where was the harm of such a reply ? Every thinking mind has seasons of doubt . ing almost every thing which has been considered matter of settled belief . As some of your own philosophers have said , no one has thought sufficiently to be a metaphysician , who has not thought to doubting . Now the mind rights itself at such times by evidence , internal or external , of the reason or of the understanding , I care not which , I approve of both . Mr. A. if men had been rightly educated , taught to look within rather than without , made acquainted with their own powers and the proper method of viewing subjects , they would escape those doubts . Mr. B. Will you then grant that , under existing circumstances , it is better to continue the discussion ? Mr. A. By no means . Nothing is gained , while much is lost . The man who needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic , though his language and outward conduct may be somewhat changed by such conviction , still remains the same at heart . He is no more spiritual . He is still destitute of genuine faith . His religion continues a mere matter of calculation , embodied in outward forms , and not in the rapt emotions of a spiritual life . Much is lost , for while we continue to argue upon those fundamental , intuitive truths , they will continue to be disputed . It is appalling to think to what a depth of spiritual degradation the sensual philosophy of our age has sunk us . We have been led to question whether we have souls even ; the being of a God denied ; faith , except in things which can be seen and handled , rooted from the heart , and duty reduced to a mere problem in the rule of loss and gain . Let us stop this low and false argumentation at once ; for better have no metaphysics , than to continue in this way . Why , only reflect ! How have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By showing that religion is useful ! On your system , men are told they had better have religion , for reasons like those which induce them to buy an article of furniture , or a meal of victuals-it will do them good ! Really , how such motives can consist with virtue , I can not see . Does not every thief , for the time being , reason that his theft will profit him ? And is this same scoundrel a good man , when , convinced his gains will be greater , he ceases to steal and begins to pray ? The possession of a Spanish galleon laden with Peru . vian mines could not offer such rewards to the pirate , as Paley offers him if he will be religious . Strange that any one should have overt looked the self-evident truth , that , properly speaking , there can be no virtue in acting from such motives . Self must be annihilated , denied as the gospel of Christ hath it , and Right , Truth , Goodness , seen , felt , and followed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy . Turn the minds of men in upon themselves , make them see their divine nature and exercise their divine reason , and let them act in a manner worthy of happiness . Mr. B. This is the very thing we endeavor to do . We preach the doctrine-would we could do it in thunder tones , that men should obey the truth , and be virtuous because this is right . That duty should be done for duty 's sake " Justitia fiat , ruat coAum " - let justice be done , though the heavens should fall . No danger , nor suffering , nor glory , nor gain , nor pleasure , // should make us swerve a hair from the path of rectitude . And let me say , that a little more candor , or more of that deep thinking which you so highly recommend , would correct your idea of the true happiness-principle , as held by its intelligent advocates . Mr. A. I never will admit that as a principle in morals . Man , godlike man , is something more , or he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as Carlyle calls it , a mere balance for weighing hay and thistles , pains and pleasures . Mr. B. Well , permit me to correct your conception of the principle ; for I apprehend that if we look at things and not at terms only , we shall not be so wide apart here as you suppose . Follow truth and duty , we both say , without regard to consequences . We both say that the mind is such a thing , that it can see truth-that it does this , either by the faculty you call Reason , or by what some call the Inner Light , or by what others call Reflectiontruth , moral , spiritual truth it can know . So far we are agreed . Here you stop , and protest " that farther than this we should not go in our inquiry ; and cnn not with safety or advantage . " I too am willing to stop here  --  to leave entirely out of view the utility of virtue , and simply inculcate the duty . But I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reasoning , and inquire-Why do we spontaneously feel that certain truths are truths ? that is right ? that is duty ? Why do we feel , and intuitively see , the truthfulness , the beauty , the righteousness , the goodness of certain actions ? You say , " Because we are so made ! " Undoubtedly . And do we not find ourselves so made that these things would not so appear , were they not &amp;dapted to our spiritual nature ? And do we not see this adaptation in their tendency so directly and so certainly to ennoble and bless us ? Were they not thus adapted , did they not harmonize with the reality of things-did they tend to pain , rather than to happiness , I have some doubt whether the happinessprinciple would have received such unqualified condemnation by your philosophers . And when , in some connections , you so extol the noble qualities and tendencies of your own system , I have fancied I saw you expose the cloven foot of this same happiness-principle . It would not he a difficult matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlyle ; his French Revolution and his Chartism are full of it , and it is impossible for him or any other man , to write upon such subjects and not tacitly recognize it . In his last work , " Past and Present , " p. 25 , is the following : " They ( quacks ) are the one bane of the world . Once clear the world of them , it ceases to be a Devil's-world , in all fibres of it wretched , accursed ; and begins to be a God's-world , blessed , and working hourly towards blessedness . " Also , p. 27 , " When a Nation is unhappy , the old Prophet was right and not wrong in saying to it : ye have forgotten God , ye have quitted the ways of God , or ye would not have been unhappy . " And the same idea is conveyed more than fifty times in this same book . And if you call this " stomach-happiness , " inasmuch as it has reference to governing and feeding men ; then let me ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil is gone from your lamp , sit reading with glistening eyes the works of your Carlyle ? " 0 such thoughts , heaven-born , soul-inspired , they rivet a man to his chair ! " exclaim you . Will you do yourself the kindness to think a little more deeply upon that answer ? If the belief of this principle tends necessarily to selfishness , I have not yet discovered it . Moses , Paul , Christ himself , alluded to it approvingly . The more a man loves the true , and // the good , and is stimulated by this love to pursue them , the better he is . To say of men , they delight in iniquity , is to rank them with fallen spirits . To say that they delight in holiness , is to rank them with celestial beings . But as you will not listen to any thing in favor of this principle , I propose another topic-your idea of a God . I grant you are peculiar in your views of the Divine existence , and also respecting several important subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is rather a religion than a philosophy . Your principal oracles often repeat the idea , that religion is the one chief fact in regard to man . And all your writings have a direct bearing upon this point . Mr. A. It is time some men raised their voice in its favor ; for religion , except in what is outward and ceremonial , has well nigh been banished the civilized world . Your sensual systems of faith as well as philosophy , have left little hope , or belief , or spirituality in the soul . You have separated God from his works , seated him upon a throne somewhere in infinite space , at an immeasurable distance from man , and taking it for granted that He had retired from the business of inspiring the heart , working miracles , and controlling all things , you have taken the work of religion into your own hands . And truly you make noise enough about it . God 's voice in the soul is hushed ; the earnest , rapt spirit is wanting . Your religion is empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul . It has not the silent strength of the river , but the rustling noise of the brook rushing over its stony bed . You take a false view of God , and consequently your worship is idolatry . Mr. B. Do favor me with a clear statement of your idea of God . Mr. A. God is Good , or Good . ness ; or the animating Principle of goodness , truth , beauty , every where operating in nature and in the soul of man . External nature is but the emblem or garment of the Deity , and serves to body Him forth to the eye . But it is the eye of reason which sees Him , and the soul that feels his presence , while conscience continually whispers his voice in our hearing . God is within us and around us . The truly pious soul feels his presence , hears his voice , and sees him working every mom'ent . Men of genius , of true spiritual insight , have ever taken this view of God . They have seen throkigh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Poets , prophets , sages , and all the devout of every age and nation , have viewed all objects which we call material only as the symbol , or v ? sible manifestation of the Eternal Spirit . Some have had a faith which saw every thing as a part of God , the keenness of their spiritual vision scarcely noticing such a thing as matter . Not only was God the animus mundi , and " All but parts of one stupendous whole , Whose body Nature is , and God the soul7 ' but all was God , and God was All . Pantheism , a word full of denial and scepticism to superficial minds , is one of the highest products of the devout spirit of man . It has been well said that Spinosa wa* God-intoxicated , transcending time and space , all forms and appearances , God to him was All and in All . Few have sufficiently disentangled themselves from flesh and sense , and from the influence of a wrong education , to rise to such a height in the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time in Germany , and pos. sibly in other countries , have become thus spiritual . But while I admire their spirit , and long for their attainments , I confess I fall short of their faith . While I see God in all things , I do not , strictly // speaking , see all things to be God . For example , I can see God in that rose , as the animating principle which gives it its exquisite and esthetic form and tint , yet I can not say , that rose is God . But I do say , God is to be loved and worshiped in the rose . If we have the inner eye to see the beauty of such objects , so far we love , admire , and therefore worship their Maker . Still more clearly do we feel God present in the human soul . Man 's conscience is God 's voice directly speaking to him . Yielding ourselves up to its clear and truthful notes , we are right . 0 that all would listen to it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transcendentalism which gives coloring to your whole system , I wish you to he more explicit upon one point , viz. In your view , is God , in such a sense separate from men and nature , that , as a distinct being , He controls , governs , rewards and punishes his creatures ? You know the prevailing idea of God in enlightened countries-a being distinct from his works ; who exercises a providence over them ; who takes cognizance of the moral conduct of men , pleased with all right affections and purposes of men , and displeased with their wrong conduct . Mr. A. If you insist upon a direct answer , I would say , No . The vulgar notion that God , as a person , after creating the world and the universe , and setting causes in operation , or establishing laws for the continuance of all things , retired from his works to watch their operation , and occasionally to interfere , particularly in his moral kingdom , to give a little instruction , or to correct some of the grosser wrongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practical atheism ; it virtually excludes God from nature and from the soul . Whereas God ,  --  for he is omnipresent ,  --  is constantly operating every where and in every thing ; growing the grass , the tree , the flower ; animating and inspiring the soul ; producing new forms of beauty ; working , as he has eternally worked , works of wonder and goodness . If the sensual philosophy had not so benumbed the soul , men would see this . It is seen by those you call heathen . The wild Indian hears the whisper of the Great Spirit in every breeze ; listens to it coming from every dell and cave of his mountains ; sees God in the forest , acknowledges his hand in giving him his fishing brooks and hunting grounds . To the earnest Arab soul the star that shines upon his desert path is but the eye of God . As the sun warmed and fertilized the vineyards of the ancient Persian , he worshiped the kindly influence-God . The Ganges fertilizes his rice-fields , and the inhabitant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those eastern people , situated in the garden of the world , have always been a devout pedple . Not mere dead matter , hut the spirit of beauty and goodness , which animated surrounding nature , has always been worshiped by them . In their simple way , with childlike and sincere emotions of wonder , they have bow%d before the Eternal in these manifestations of himself . Mr. B. Really , you must have a transcendental eye , for it is something more than a poet 's , to see so much beauty and true piety in those eastern idolaters . You doubtless see the same in the Chinese , in their worship of those half dozen fat hogs kept as gods at Canton . The funeral pile , the hook-swinging , the infanticides , and the thousand disgusting and horrible rites of Bramah , all must come up to your mind with peculiar attractions , in as much as you think them sincere acts of devotion . But it was not my present design to ascertain your views of religious worship . I wished first to understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would // not be understood to mean that the great mass of those nations are truly spiritual . But there is among them the recognition of an omnipresent Deity , and there are real worship . ers . The great body of people in every country are idolaters . They worship the image or form rather than God , the living principle of goodness . But , to come back to the point , I believe God does mari ? the conduct of men . How can it be otherwise , when He is every where present in his works ? And that the obedient are rewarded and the wicked punished , is a matter of consciousness to every one . Not a law of man 's nature can be violated without internal discord and misery , while all is harmony and sweet peace when man falls in with the eternal reality of things . The true prophet , poet and philosopher ,  --  for they are the same ,  --  have always represented the soul of man as a divinely constructed instrument , a true iEolian harp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , disordered by sin , its sounds are harsh and discordant . Mr. B. Wherein are your sentiments different from the doctrine th.d man receives the full punishment of his sins in this life ? How often , contrary to all human experience , in the face of what every wicked man knows to be true in his own case , is it asserted that , by the remorse of conscience and the evil consequences of sin in this life , men are equitably and fully punished ! If I understand your idea of God , you do not consider him a being distinct from man and nature , possessed of personal intelligence , susceptibility and will , but a kind of vivifying principle every where and at all times operating . I do not wonder that you object to producing evidence of God 's existence , for your God , or rather principle , must be seen intuitively , if seen at all , and this too by a faculty purely transcendental . You complain of the want of faith and of the universal prevalence of scepticism . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infidelity of the age . You profess the most ardent desire to revive belief and earnest spiritual life on the earth , and yet if the great mass of people could be made to understand and embrace your views , there would be nothing to restrain them from the worst of crimes . You remove from man the piercing eye of a con. scious God ; you place him under no government but certain natural laws , and if he will risk ( as he most surely will ) the natural consequences of vice in this life , there is no more for him to fear . In fact you discard all appeals to fear as a means of moral government , maintaining that man should be so educated that what you call his natural love of truth , beauty and holiness , will be sufficient . If you succeed in making this feature of transcendentalism believed , it needs no prophet to foresee that it will sweep every vestige of pure religion from the world . Not what you call religion , for there will always be minds alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enraptured with the works of God , in which consist your religion and religious worship . But the mass of mankind are never sufficiently refined in their sentiments to appreciate your sentiments , and keep devout on your plan . They will enjoy the beauties of nature , but will never arrive , in their admiration of landscapes and beautiful thoughts , at what you would call earnest spiritual life . It is much to be desired to have the heart softened and ennobled in the contemplation of the works of God . There may be true worship in this ; but how many , who , like Byron , feel exquisitely every form of poetic beauty , are hostile to religion , when she lays a restraint upon their passions ! Much which you say in this connection is good and important to be said , but it never will be all that man needs . If we // stop with mere poetic beauty , with the religion of romance , we shall soon be destitute even of this . There is no man who can not feel in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far you would call him religious : so far he worships your God . We might as well call him so far religious , as he loves a dish of turtle soup or a bottle of Madeira ; for while the one may indicate a higher refinement than the other , both are equally involuntary , and both may exist in bad as well as in good men . David , Job and Isaiah , to whom you often refer , all saw God in his works , all " mused on nature with a poet 's eye ; " but this was not all their religion . They had deep repentance for sin ,  --  for sin committed against God as a being , and not a mere principle . There was faith in those men , but a faith widely differing from your faith . You appropriate the poetic beauty of the Bible and of nature to your system , and leave out of view those truths which are most necessary for man to believe . Mr. A. You must be aWare that , owing to the difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the exoteric and the esoteric doctrines . The inspired sages of Greece found this to be necessary . T here must be a statute religion for the mass , certainly till they are elevated immeasurably above what they have ever been . Hence we never wish to controvert the common notions respecting the Bible , inspiration , religious forms , &amp;c. , since these are necessary for a season . But infidelity is chiefly among the educated . During the last century it prevailed in its worst forms in the higher circles of France , and even throughout Europe and America . The sensual philosophy led to this result . We wish to reach this class of men . Let the doctrines of Pythagoras and of the still more divine Plato be expounded and taught , with slight modifications , and we shall arrest the progress of doubt and denial . Mr. B. Here again I must call for explanation . You apply the epithets divine , inspired , and godlike , to men unknown to sacred history . But from your idea of God , of worship , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you call Plato , Shakspeare , and certain writers of our day in Europe and America , inspired , in the same sense in which Isaiah , David and Christ were inspired . That is , they have genius , true spiritual insight , and utter what the heart spontaneously responds to as truth . Mr. A. Exactly so ! Yet there are all degrees of inspiration . And we consider Christ much more inspired than any other man , and it is owing to this that his religion is superior to all others , and is received in the most enlightened countries . Much of it will doubtless live through all time . When the poet or sage utters true spiritual thoughts , we say he is inspired . His thoughts are the voice of God ; they are beyond common ideas , and we know not what else to call them . We read them , they strike us as true , beautiful , good , and we spontaneously exclaim , " Surely this is the voice of God ! " Hence we can see by the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John far more than the other apostles , and Christ so much more than all others , that they may well call him Master . I trust we have a few in our own day , some evenin New England , who listen attentively to the eternal oracle within , and utter divine res ponses . The Dial is a clear indication that there is still faith , genius and inspiration among us . Mr. B. I give you credit for clearness and candor , whatever I may think of your common sense . This is no mysticism . To place thE Dial and the Bible , as it respects their inspiration , on the same footing , is certainly intelligible , and in // all other respects is truly transcendental . Pardon me , Mr. A. , but I must ask you if you are serious in this ? Mr. A. You infer too much . I did not design to consider the writers of the Dial on a par with Christ . I only mean that they have uttered the truest things which are uttered among us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest zeal they have said much that I would not say . They do not deserve the contempt in which they are held by mafly . Every inspired teacher has been deemed by his formal age either a madman , a fool or a knave . It is the fate of genius to be persecuted . The Pharisee , wrapped in his forms , saw nothing true or good in the teachings of the divine Jesus ; Socrates was persecuted to death ; Kant was sneered at as a deluded dream . er , and Carlyle , after years of true spiritual endeavor , hardly begins to be appreciated at home , though we deem him one of the brightest stars in the constellation of genius . But such men count the cost of their devotion to truth . The world 's teachers have had little cause to be pleas . ed with the world , yet they have loved and sought to bless their race . Truth , omnipotent truth , is their support . It is enough for them that they are right . They look to the Aistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed . Mr. B. But you must be aware that your views undermine the foundation of all that is peculiar in Christianity . Here , y6u profess to be a Christian , and weep strange tears over the unbelief and idolatry of the age . You appear , at times , reverently to worship " God , manifest in the flesh ; " but the very next act of your devotion is to kneel at the shrine of a favorite philosopher or poet , pagan or Christian . These *ou call as truly divine , as really inspired , and in every way as worthy of religious reverence , as Jesus , only in a less degree . You pay no more respect to Christ than a pagan emperor of Rome was willing to pay him ,  --  give him a temple in common with a thousand other deities . Certain parts of the Bible you are ready to pronounce of heavenly origin , in the same sense in which you think the writings of many other men were divinely inspired . The only moral law ever given , your writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your belief is this : Plato had his system of religious philosophy , Mohammed his , Confucius his , Kant his , and Christ his ; and all these , so far as we perceive their tru*th by the light of reason , and no farther , are to us the oracles of God . Some of your sect are willing , but others are not , to give Christianity the preference . You use the language of Christians , with the addition of some buckram phraseology of your own , but with a meaning entirely different from its usual signification . I can not believe this honest . The Universalist , the Unitarian , the infidel , the atheist , frankly state what they believe , in plain terms . I have no desire to class you with them , though it is evident your whole system of religious philosophy may be found in the writings of these various schools . You throw around your transcendentalism such a devotional air , and so much of the language of evangelical piety , that your real meaning is not perceived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed yourselves in plain language . Not to refer to points already discussed , take the published opinions of your school respecting miracles . You are aware that all this has been advanced a thousand times . You only hit the thing differently . You take the same course upon miracles as upon inspiration . As you inspire all men rather than deny the inspiration of the sacred penmen , so instead of denying miracles you make every thing miraculous . // 1843 . Mr. A. Carlyle has placed this subject in its true light in the chapter on " Natural Supernaturalism , " in his Sartor , which I would commend to your special attention . Mr. B. I have read it , and will give all the credit you can ask for the genius there displayed . Perhaps we could not take a better illustration of your method of treating subjects connected with religion . Instead of direct denial , backed with the usual arguments , you virtually deny the miracles of the Bible , by making all things so marvelous , and by clothing your expressions in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as another . The rising of the sun would be a stupendous miracle to a man who should see it for the first time . The rising of a dead man would not appear to be a miracle if we should see dead men rise every day . rJ7he chemist could work miracles in the eyes of ignorant heathen . That is , all is miraculous to men which they are mit familiar with . Had we an eye to see a little farther into the operation of natural laws , every miracle recorded in the Bible or any where else would appear a natural rather than a super-natural event . Therefore , whether any thing shall be miraculous or not , depends not upon the thing itself , but upon our degree of insight into the Faws of nature . This is the leading idea of Carlyle 's chapter on Natural Supernaturalism , and the substance of all your writers have to say upon the subject of miracles . Granting that there is truth in this view of the subject , yet the most favorable construction I can put upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real point at issue . True , you exhort us with earnestness to think deeper , that we may see more of the miraculous with which we are constantly surrounded . But , believe in a miracle , in any proper sense of the word , you do not . Mr. A. We are heartily weary of the endless debate upon such questions in the Christian system . It tends only to doubt and denial . The whole forensic discussion from the first century to this , upon the proofs of Christianity , have been fruitful in nothing but infidelity . A religion-any part of a religion-which needs the logic of the understanding for its support , is not worth the argument . if men have not an eye to see and a soul to feel religious truth , argument will avail nothing . Religious men should take the high ground that religion is a native germ in the heart of man , and is to be cultivated by other means than disputes about the forms which Christianity has assumed . Let us leave the questions of plenary inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Savior , the sabbath and the church , all which are entirely foreign to religion itself , and retire within ourselves , to listen to God 's voice in the soul , and be religious . Mr. B. Ah ! but there is a question to be answered-yes or noupon which very much depends . If at the word of Christ the dead awoke to life , and the eyes of the blind were opened , did he not exercise a power superior to that of the chemist or man of genius ; and so much superior that none can doubt it to be supernatural . And you need not be told that if the works attributed to Christ could be shown not to have been wrought by him , instead of being an inspired teacher sent from heaven , as you often term him , he was an impostor . One can hardly give you credit for sincerity , when you eulogize Christ and his religion , and upon the same page say , what , fairly interpreted into intelligible language , stigmatizes him as a deceiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to discuss other questions of history ; why not those connected with the Christian religion ? // Mr. A. It is one of the first lesSons of our religion not to use the sensual logic with men , but to turn their attention to the great truths that are written upon the tables of the heart . We expect like the great Master , to be reviled , but we shall not return reviling for reviling . You will yet see , and I hope in this life , that there is enough which is miraculous without going back eighteen hundred years . But at preseat I must leave you to gaze at God 's world , without seeing any thing wonderful in the thousand forms of beauty and goodness which lie in every direction ; but only a little chemical matter to be analyzed , explained , and scientifically arranged . But it is painful to see man , standing in the midst of wonders , like the stupid ass , with his whole attention upon food for his stomach ; or like an ambitious boy , beating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were the only real prodigy to be admired . The secret of the universe is open , but only to those who have an eye to see it . Men must retire into the holy of holies , their own souls , and then the Shekinah will appear , and from the altar of the heart acceptable incense will ascend . Be silent , my brother , as you stand in this star-domed temple of God , and his presence shall overshadow you ; and you shall feel that man-all that is in him and around him-is a miracle ! Man is the high-priest of Nature beautifully emblemed in the priest of Jewry ; he is the eye of the earth which should be turned towards heaven . He is the highest form of the godlike . " Be still and know that I am God , " is a text I beg of you to considor* Oct . Mr. B. And I would request you to preach your doctrine from any text in your numerous Bibles , to any uninitiated audience you can find , that you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sublimated religion . You extol earnest , rapt emotions , whether in the Mussulman at the tomb of his prophet , or in the worshiper of the sun , the river , the star , or any other created object . Try your transcendentalism then , and see if the eye moistens , and the fire of devotion burns in the heart under its influence ? You call attention to your new philosophy , and as hearers we have a claim on you to speak in a known tongue the very thing you mean . You attack almost every article of our belief , and we have a right to know just what you would have substituted in its place . Our views of God , of Christ , of the Bible , of Christianity , of worship , of man-his nature , his duties , and his destiny-our system of moral science , our literature , and even our civil institutions , are in your opinion defective . You call for a radical change . One of your writers says , " It is not to be denied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , state , and society , and for this cause they are unpopular . " Thus we find ourselves attacked in a new and peculiar manner . We are exhorted in the phraseology of Christianity , to throw off all its present forms of belief and practice , and go on unto perfection ! But before we strip naked in this style , we wish to know whether you have better garmeats for our covering.
