txt A GREAT revolution in the musical character of the American people has begun , and is , we trust , to go forward , like other revolutions , till its ultimate object he attained . If its progress contlnue to be as rapid as it has thus far been , it will be another signal instance of the railroad velocity with which the Americans are apt to convert a seemingly distant futurity into a present reality . Before we refer to the ixeans by which this remarkable change has been begun , we intend to speak of the reasons whici* justify the attempt to produce it ; or , in other words , to set forth the true claims which music has upon the respect and interest of this community and of all communities . We are led to do this partly by the subdued tone that we perceive in several of the productions the titles of which we have placed at the head of this article ; in almost all of them there seems to be a restraint on the expressions of the authors , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , lest the public should turn an incredulous ear , or smile at the hitherto unheard warmth of their language . The time has now come , however , at least in this vicinity , when flO one need fear to speak out all his thoughts , or give utterance to all his feelings upon the art ; and when it may be useful , not only here but in all parts of the country where our voice can be heard , to exhibit the reasons why the change which is in progress should be vigorously promoted , and the means by which this may be accomplished pointed out . // Of all the fine arts , music is the most extensive in its in fluence . There are more persons , in all countries and in all stages of civilization , who are agreeably or powerfully affected by music , than there are who can enjoy any other art . Strangely as this assertion may sound to those who were taught , as was commonly believed twenty years ago , that an ear for music is a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , to find one who has not an ear for music , or who can not be affected by it in any manner . We care not how simple , or coarse , or uncouth it may be , - if it be as inartificial as the accompaniment of an indian dance , or as monotonous as a death song , still if one be excited or touched by it , he has an ear for music , which needs nothing but suitable cultivation to be educated to enjoy the most complicated harmony of a symphony by the most scientific composer . There is many a mathematical mind that can not conceive of a charm in the poetry which proves nothing ; there is many a miser who sees nought in architecture but the waste of money upon ornament . There are those , even among cultivated persons , who can not be made to perceive , still less to enjoy , the beauties and wonders of painting or sculpture . But neither they , nor the most withered miser , nor the most devoted mathematician , nor the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of exhibition of that art which al ) peals at once to the senses and the soul . The sweet , innocent voice of the child will cause some chord of the heart to vibrate ; or the spirit-stirring music of the military band will awaken a slumbering emotion ; the song of the accomplished artist will please ; or the church choir and the solemn organ will excite reverence in the heart of the most cold , calculating , or selfish . We have heard of such a thing as a person who was insensible to the beauties of other arts , nay we have seen such , but never have we heard of one who was utterly indifferent to all kinds of nmsic . We believe no such human being to exist , and therefore we say that the influence of music is universal . If not absolutely universal , ( and we are willing to allow there may be exceptions , though we have never heard of them , ) it is so nearly so , that the thing becomes important from this circumstance alone . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggregate , upon all individuals , must be a considerable matter . But so far from the // effect being insignificant , we contend , that it is worthy of the attention and demands the careful consideration of statesmen and lawgivers , parents , teachers , and philanthropists . The well-known dictum , " Let me make the people 's ballads , and I care not who makes their laws , " was founded not merely on a knowledge of human nature , but on an acquaintance with the means by which a deep and permanent impression is to be made on men 's minds and character . And no one who reflects for a moment upon the part of our nature to which music appeals , or upon the effects which have been produced by it , can doubt that it may be made , for it has been made , a means of powerful influence for good or for evil . It addresses itself to the emotions , the passions of men ; it excites them , it represses them ; it is the universal stimulus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can doubt that men are governed more by feeling and impulse than by reason and reflection ? Who can question , then , the power of the art by which the active capacities of our nature are so much affected ? It excites the imagination , too , in a degree scarcely surpassed by the most powerful of its sister arts , and by this combination of influences becomes more efficient than poetry itself . The experience of the world , in all ages and nations , not excepting our own practical , mechanical , busy age and nation , confirms the assertions we are making of the power of music . Without referring to the stories which have come down to us from antiquity , we will only express our conviction that an additional impetus was given to the French revolution by the popular airs and songs which were then circulated ; that the national anthem of " God save the King " has produced a positive effect upon the nation who have so long sung it , and that it has in fact saved the King from many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of music was invoked , not in vain , in our own late elections . But it is not for purposes of temporary excitement , merely , that music is available . The permanent effect produced upon the national character by the habitual practice of the art is so obvious as always to have been a subject of applause or reproach , according as refinement was thought to be produced , or effeminacy imputed as its consequence . We do not think there is any danger of weakening the real strength of the character , by the love or the practice of any of the arts of embellishment ; least of all by that of music , which exercises // and developes at once the physical , intellectual , and moral powers . The marhle is not softened when the jagged corners of the block are cut off , its rough surface smoothed , and it is converted from a shapeless mass into the rounded , light , and graceful figure . There is so much of inertness , selfishness , and ferocity inherent in human nature , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has a tendency to excite the kind and gentle feelings to activity . Music , properly cultivated , has this tendency to a very great extent , - far greater than either of the other fine arts . It has some advantages , which add to its power , and therefore to its importance , in comparison with other pursuits . Of these we propose to speak briefly . It is pre-iminently a social enjoyment . A man may , to be sure , sing or play when alone , but the presence of one who can accompany him , much more than doubles his pleasure . He will seek association with others , therefore , which can not fail to render necessary a greater or less degree of yielding to their wishes and opinions ; and every instance of this strengthens his sympathy and benevolence , and in the same ratio diminishes his selfishness . The pleasures of harmony can scarcely be obtained at all without the codperation of numbers ; and some of the most valuable qualities , intellectual and moral , are brought into action by combinations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association of individuals for high musical productions , but there is an almost necessary combination of arts in that of music , which " De cent plaisirs fait un plaisir unique . " Poetry is so intimately connected with vocal music as to be nearly always joined with it ; while the art of oratory , or rather of elocution , which certainly does not stand in the lowest rank of intellectual efforts , has an indissoluble connexion with it . There is no such necessary combination in the other arts . They stand separate , and have their distinct and peculiar beauties ; while music draws her sisters around her , and the fascination of each is heightened by the mingled charms of her companions . There is another combination in which music is peculiar , namely , in the powers it calls into exercise . Nothing else that we know , excites at once the physical , intellectual , and moral // powers of human nature , - in other words , our whole nature , - to the degree that music does . By other pursuits , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we improve at once every part of our nature . There is one other union we will mention , which , though not peculiar to music , is more manifest in that study than in almost any other , the union of amusing or pleasing occupation with that which is useful . " Useful ! we see our readers mentally exclaiming ; " we acknowledge the art to be a pleasing accomplishment , but what is its utility apart from its agreeableness ? We do not wish to be considered as enthusiasts , or the utterers of mere extravagances which can neither be believed nor regarded as of the least practical consequence . We think we can show that we use the words of truth and soberness ; and we will therefore state in what consists , in our opinion , the value of music as an intellectual exercise . The mathematics are generally considered as particularly useful in giving to the mind habits of precision and method , without which true results can not be obtained . It is the same with the study of the elements of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their separation by interval , is a study of the very same nature with mathematics , while accuracy , method , and order are not less indispensable to the attainment of pleasing results . Music is , as it were , mathematics in action , and what is an important addition to the youthful student , in agreeable action . lie can learn to add , subtract , multiply and divide by whole , half , and quarter notes , as well as he can by Arabic figures ; while tones and semitones , with the exponent flats and sharps , may give him a practical idea of fractions as accurate as the rules of Colburn or Emerson . He can not help learning something beside music . In gaining a competent knowledge of that , he is learning arithmetic as surely as by the use of the slate and pencil ; and he is acquiring habits which can not fail to benefit him in every other pursuit of life . Reading well is usually considered a very good test of the talents and attainments of the scholar , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments conveyed by language , as well as the sensibility to feel them . The very same thing is doubly requisite in singing . Expression is of the essence of music . There can be no good singing , and but little good playing without it , // and , as the art of expressing sentiment well and appropriately is much more difficult in singing than in speaking , it is , of course , a higher intellectual effort . Those who have acquired the more difficult accomplishment will rarely fail to read and speak with expression and effect . ri*l1ese auxiliary powers and advantages of the study render music a very important branch of youthful education ; and there are other qualities it possesses which still further increase its value as an instrument in the hands of the teacher of youth . It is found by experience to be a very strong attraction to the school-room . Those who are often absent on other days , are sure to he present when the music lesson is to be given ; and no punishment is so efficient as being deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in its progress through drier studies , by the partial and pleasant relaxation it affords to the intellectual powers , often unreasonably taxed by those who have little acquaintance with their strength ; and it is a better recreation than a game of foot-ball , or any other merely physical exercise , for it gives a healthy activity to mind and body too , and is applicable to all ages and both sexes of youth . Another circumstance which renders music of extraordinary and almost inappreciable value in this country , is the necessity of discipline , strict conformity to rules , the subordination of the different parts and voices , and the distinctness of each department . In music , every one , from the highest to the lowest , has his appointed , fixed place , which he can neither quit nor neglect without marring his own enjoyment , as well as that of others . What an inestimable incident is this , in any study to be pursued in this country , where every man is so apt to entertain the idea that he is born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he not only may acquire , but actually possesses , as much knowledge as anybody else upon any given subject . We are self-made , or we are born , statesmen , orators , mechanics , and merchants , as well as poets , painters , and sculptors . It is quite unnecessary for anybody to undertake to instruct us ; and serving an apprenticeship to any art or trade is a thing entirely exploded from the modern system of society . Submission to authority was all very well in earlier and simpler periods of the world but now even respect for the opinions or reasonings of the ablest and best of our contemporaries is quite behind the // spirit of the age , and the march of mind . The organ of reverence is in a fair way of being obliterated from the American brain ; and the time has already arrived when the attempt of one portion of society to restrain another to any degree beyond its own convenience , is universally considered unconstitutional , and interfering with those natural rights which can not be alienated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure ; towns comply with State requisitions , if convenient ; individuals obey town laws , if they find it for their interest ; children obey their parents when it is not more desirable that the parents should obey them ; teachers are at the mercy of their pupils , and master and servant is a relation no longer known to exist . Every one , in short , places himself on his reserved , natural right of rebellion ; and the constitution itself is made to maintain the most self-destructive doctrines . We consider it providential that there is one pursuit of an attractive character , which can not be thus inverted ; in which learners must submit to teachers , the less advanced must yield to those who are more so , and where every one must take his appropriate place , and not seize upon another for which his natural and acquired powers do not fit him . The bass can not sing soprano , nor can the bassoon play the violin part . Neither can one voice or one instrument say to another , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so long as they will submit to be governed at once by nature and by the rules of art , all are indispensable to the production of great effects . But the moment that disobedience or carelessness is suffered to prevail , the charm is broken , music takes her flight , and the air is filled with " wild confusion 's dreadful noise . " It is well there is something left to remind us occasionally that all wisdom and all knowledge were not born with us , and that it is scarcely likely they will die with us ; and we esteem it the especial duty of every American who has the opportunity to exercise any influence on the subject , and who has any just value for the peace and order of society , to exert himself in the promotion of the study of that art , which will do more than all other studies to impress on the minds of youth the importance , the necessity of discipline , order , and subordination in the affairs of this world . The physical benefits of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking than the moral and intellectual advantages // we have mentioned . Exercise gives vigor , and there is no part of the human system which requires more attention for the acquisition of a desirable degree of strength , than the vocal organs which are called into healthy action by singing , and which are so often fatally deranged by exposure in our rough climate . This is no chimera . The personal experience of many a singer may he appealed to , in confirmation of our assertion ; and if there he one thing which is likely to check the seemingly peculiar tendency to consumption in our pol ) ulatiOn , it is the early , and systematic culture of the vocal organs in singing . Professional observation combines with personal experience in support of this opinion . We quote the following from Mr. Davis 's report to the School Committee . " A fact , ' says an American physician , * has been suggested to me by my l ) rOfCssiOn , which is , that the exercise of the organs of the breast by singing contributes very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate and other causes expose them . ' A musical writer in England , t after quoting this remark , says , the Music Master of our Academy has furnished me with an observation still more in favor of this opinion . He informs me that he had known several persons strongly disposed to consumption , restored to health by the exercise of the lungs in singing . ' 4 But why cite medical or other authorities on a point so plain . It appears self-evident that exercises in vocal music , when not carried to an unreasonable excess , must expand the chest , and thereby strengthen the lungs and vital organs . " - p. 4 . The amount of exercise derived from the practice of singing is much greater than would he imagined by those not versed in it ; and the fatigue incident to prolonged exertion in singing , is as positive as that which follows sawing wood , or riding on horseback . During a residence of nine or ten months in Germany some years ago , we were much struck with the fact , that diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common there than with us . Is there any difference in the situation or habits of the people , to which this result may be ascribed with so much probability , as the different customs of the two nations with regard to vocal music ? In Germany , everybody sings ; in America , nobody . In Germany it is // an art honored and loved ; in America it is treated with an indifference at once strange and hurtful . We have dwelt so long on the incidental advantages to be derived from the study of music , that it is time for us to speak of the direct inducements to its cultivation . As a fine art , it takes the lead , not merely from the permanent effects it is capable of producing , hut from the pleasure it is adapted to yield . We agree with the author of the address at the opening of the Odeon , in the view he takes of its charm . " What a pleasure is that derived from music ! There are many refined and high gratifications , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . Every sense is made the means of enjoyment . Every nerve conveys pleasurable sensa tions to the perceiving mind . We can not look on the works of the Creator , we can not open our eyes , without pleasure we can not satisfy our appetites without at the same time gratifying our palates . We can not breathe the fragrant air without delight . But though every sense has thus its appropriate pleasures , which are neither few nor small , which are spread around us , if we will but observe them , with an abundance which nothing but infinite beneficence could have drawn from the stores of infinite wisdom and infinite power ; yet I can not hesitate to place foremost in these gratifications of sense , that which flows in upon the ear , from the sweet , the rich , the evervarying combinations of music . Is there any thing which can be compared to the liquid harmony of well-selected instruments ; the graceful air upon the soft reed ; or the delicate touch of the vibrating string ; or the noble swell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple strain of a rich voice , or the skilful modulations of one well cultivated ? But when these are united and combined as scientific composers know how to use them ; when we listen to the air , the chorus , the overture , the accompaniment , the vocal and the instrurnental sounds which are mingled and varied , alternately separated and joined together in exquisite . melodies , or grand harmony , we drink in a delight which nothing else in nature or art can give ; we revel in an ecstasy waked by the living lyre , which can not be produced by any , the happiest combinations , of the other senses . Though this may be warmly expressed , yet it will be admitted to be substantially true by all who have the taste to enjoy , and the habit of listening to the delightful effects of music . If we look , therefore , simply and directly to increasing the means // of happiness of our fellow creatures , to what can we give our attention that will repay our care with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music in this respect is , that it gives pleasure to those in all stages of progress ; to the beginner , the connoisseur , and persons of every degree of cultivation . In other arts a work must be good in the judgment of the cultivated , or it will please nobody when directly compared with a really excellent production . But in music the child is pleased at every step of his progress ; and every diversity of taste in the adult may be gratified . There are those , who , upon deliberate comparison , prefer the musical style of Mr. Henry Russell to that of John Braham , Mrs. Wood , or Caradori Allan ; and who would rather listen to Billings 's Anthems than to Mozart 's Requiem , or Rossini 's Prayer . Be it so . We quarrel with no man 's taste ; but , on the contrary , we claim it as one of the advantageous distinctions of our favorite art , that it is able to adapt itself to all stages and degrees of cultivation ; to give delight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refined , the learned and the unlearned , and to lead all to the common source of beauty and happiness , by elevating the mind above low pursuits and pleasures , and purifying the heart from selfishness . If there be truth in what we have now urged with regard to the beauty and the value of music , it has been truth for centuries ; truth , however , unknown , or unappreciated , neglected , and we are tempted to say , scorned in this community . It is so now in most parts of the United States ; and in many places it is still as it was here little more than thirty years ago , when all the music that could be heard in Boston , was from half a dozen instruments in the orchestra of the theatre , and the so-called singing of the several church choirs , with the accompaniment of the violoncello . It was a deplorable noise , but was the nearest approach to music that was to be heard in most of the congregational churches , one or two only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , and the introduction of a better taste , were made by the late lamented Buckminster , who took great and successful pains to make this part of public worship generally interesting in his own church . His efforts , however , were limited to that object , setting an example that was slow to be followed by the other churches . It is nearly thirty years since " The // Handel and Haydn Society " was formed , and collected all the persons in the city and vicinity who were able to perform Handel 's music ; and we recollect very well that it was thought a great achievement to sing the " Hailstone Chorus through , without stopping . Twenty years ago , another Boston congregation followed the example of Buckrninster 's , and a better style of music was introduced at the West Church by the personal efforts of one , who , had he lived longer , would doubtless have effected much more for the cause of music . But the early death of XV . H. Eliot deprived the community of a zeal and efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one department of the public welfare . These individual and associated efforts , however , produced little general effect . There was a gradual , though very slow improvement in church music , and concerts and oratorios began to be given and attended . But there was nothing like the general impulse towards music , which for two or three years past has made it all the rage , and has begun what we called in the outset , a musical revolution . We propose to state what we believe to have been the means , the second causes , of the immense change which is acknowledged to have taken place here ; and although the topic may seem too local , yet if the example of those who have here exerted themselves in the cause should be followed elsewhere , in consequence of our having taken notice of it , we should think ourselves doing as much as we can do in any way to promote the best welfare of our readers and our country . In the years 1832 - 3 , the public were surprised and delighted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very juvenile performers , who had acquired their skill under the direction of Messrs . L. Mason , and G. J. XVebb . Never shall we forget the mingled emotions of wonder , delight , vanquished incredulity , and pleased hope , with which these juvenile concerts were attended . The coldest heart was touched , and glistening eyes and quivering lips attested the depth and strength of the feelings excited in the bosoms of parents and teachers ; while the happy little pupils themselves seemed to have acquired a new sense , as they certainly had gained a new source of enjoyment . f heir excitement was so great as to make frequent repetition dangerous , and the concerts were soon discontinued , notwithstanding the urgent solicitation of many to whom they were equally new and de // lightful . But it was manifest that the object had been gained ; a deep and lasting impression had been made on the public mind and the public heart . This might , to be sure , have passed off and left no trace behind ; but in this case , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gentlemen was immediately formed , and assumed the name of " The Boston Academy of Music , " the object of which was to promote musical education in the community in every way which was within the reach of their efforts . They were none of them professors of the art , nor had most of the founders of the society a knowledge of even its elementary principles ; but they loved it , and saw what effects might be produced by it , and had a full perception of its importance as a means of education , enjoyment , and improvement . They gave immediate proofs of the heartiness of their zeal by cooperating cordially with the professors above named , and by incurring an expenditure of about twenty thousand dollars for an organ , and a large hail for concerts and other purposes . In 1835 , the Odeon was opened , and the address above quoted was delivered by Mr. Eliot , who had that year been chosen President of the Academy . Concerts were given the succeeding winter at the Odeon , and have been kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinds of music performed , and with a manifest improvement , in many respects , in the style of performance . No large choir had previously been so well trained in Boston . r1*he next prominent step in the progress of the Academy was the formation of a class of teachers of music , who have found it for their advantage to assemble annually , and hear lectures on the more important branches of the profession . A musical convention has sprung from this annual assembly , of which others are members besides the pupils of the Academy , and which will doubtless serve to extend the influence and the utility of the profession . It is one of the promising and satisfactory signs of the times , that the number of those who are induced to devote themselves to music , as a means of subsistence , is constantly increasing , thus proving the increase of the number of pupils . The next , and the most important step taken by the A cademy , was the introduction of vocal music , as a branch of elementary education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is every child in the schools , ( two thirds of the whole juvenile population of the city , ) receiving a valuable // and delightful addition to his stock of knowledge and means of happiness , but every parent of every child is acquiring an interest in the art ; although they may know little about it , yet they feel that their children are made happier and better by it , and they become attached to it from their natural fondness for their offspring . We consider this as the most important thing done by the Academy , or which can be done to promote the progress of music among us . By giving elementary instruction to all the children of the city , - and nearly all enjoy it now , - the whole musical talent of the place will be discovered ; and those who have the best powers for the study , and the strongest inclination for it , will have the means to cultivate the talents which , but for these early opportunities , would long have continued unknown to themselves as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated ; and those who do not prove proficients in the practice , will still have knowledge enough to understand what kinds of music are best worthy attention , and who is best able to perform them . We shall therefore , in a few years , it is to be hoped , overcome the Bieotian ignorance on the subject of music , which , we lament to say , has hitherto characterized our community , and which we fear still prevails in many parts of the country . This can only be done by educating the mass of the population , by making music , as Mr. Davis expresses it , " the property of the whole people . " Heretofore instruction has been confined to the very limited number of the daughters of the rich , who could be taught , by some half dozen professors , good , bad , and indifferent , to strike the keys of the piano , or sound the notes of a song . It was Jmpossible this should ever develope the musical faculties of the people ; and we should have continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical taste , had it not been for the exertions of the Academy . By them has public attention been roused to the subject , and parents and children alike interested in the progress of the art . It would have been impossible for the Academy thus to cause the introduction of the study of vocal music into the schools , on a systematic and useful plan , had it not been for the previous labors of Mr. Woodbridge , who translated some of the best German elementary works on the subject , and of Mr. Mason , who from them prepared the " Manual " of the Academy , a work unsurpassed in simplicity , clearness , // and method . It would also , in all probability , have been delayed to a much later period , had it not been for the pains taken by the President of the Academy to bring the subject properly before the civic authorities . He had a favorable opportunity to do this , as chairman of the School Committee of Boston , and he never relaxed his efforts , till , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conformity with the views presented in the admirable and unanswerable report of Mr. Davis , to order its introduction as a part of the regular system of instruction in the public schools . iProm the beginning of 1833 to the present time , such instruction has been uninterruptedly given , and will , we trust , continue to be given while the public schools shall last . The professors of the Academy , meanwhile , were actively engaged in their department of this effort for the public good ; and prepared in rapid succession a number of musical works adapted to the wants of the growing number of those pursuing the art ; and little song-books for children , glees , songs , and other pieces for older voices , and for family use , choruses for choirs , and sacred music for churches were brought out , by Messrs . Mason and Webb , in quick succession . The greatest care was taken that the moral and religious character of all these works should be unexceptionable . Mr. Eliot again contributed his efforts in this sphere , by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bell , " adapted to the interesting music of Romberg , and preparing some other little pieces of a similar kind . Jn short , the activity of the Academy was great , and it excited a corresponding activity in others . The spirit of competition was roused , and it would have been well , if the spirit of jealousy had not been roused with it . But , from whatever reason , new societies of various kinds were formed , and some of them gave private concerts , as they were called , though attended by a thousand people or more , and the older societies were stimulated to new efforts in the cause . The evidence of increased interest in music in the public generally , is the greatly increased attendance on the vast number of concerts now given . At all this we rejoice greatly ; and shall rejoice still more if the example of what has been done here should stimulate other places to ( 10 likewise . The way is now pointed out , and the effects already visible of the experiment begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are happy to VOL . LII. - NO. 111 , 43 // learn that academies of Music have been established in some other cities , and that in at least one town in this Commonwealth , music is beginning to be a branch of elementary education . When any great public improvement is begun , we can not help thinking it of some importance to observe from what quarter the impulse comes , and under whose guidance it is likely to go forward . And it is a happy omen for the good results to be derived from this change in the musical taste and habits of the people , that one of the strong motives of those who originated the plan of the Academy , was the improvement of church music ; and that their well established character is a sufficient guaranty , that whatever receives their sanction will he of a pure and elevated class of compositions . There is only one evil of which we are apprehensive , and that is disunion . The efforts of all ought to he combined , as far as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in music , where , as we have remarked , there is a place for every one , and there ought to be one for every place . But Yankees are too apt to be of the same mind with Satan , and think it " better to reign in hell , than serve in heaven . " They will even fall into the pandemonium of contention , jealousy , and separation , in musical associations , provided each little coterie may fill its own little world , and not be subject to any higher power . In the multitude of societies there will not be half the progress , though there will be , perhaps , double the motion , that there would he in one well organized association . The constitution of the Academy seems to us the best we know of , where the financial and prudential concerns of the society are in one set of hands , and the musical department in another . This gives a separation of duties , and a union of interests , which is far better for the public , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wish to gain temporary popularity and pecuniary advantages may come in conflict , and embarrass the course of those who have the control of all departments . We were much pleased to see , in one of the late ntimbers of Mr. Hach 's Magazine , a project for interesting an association of literary men in the practice of music . Literature is intimately connected with it , and none but cultivated minds can appreciate and properly enjoy the highest musical effects . But a society of merely literary men is not apt to be a very efficient means of producing any result ; while the combination of literary , educated , and practical men is the very best that // has ever yet been devised . Above all , the hearty , cordial codperation of numbers is desirable ; and mutual jealousy , and the desire to shine at each other 's expense , is especially lamentable in the culture of this divine art . Union is strength in music as well as in politics . We have mentioned what we deem the most important events which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where we write . Other circumstances have , however , contributed to the same end , more or less directly . Particularly have great numbers of persons been enlightened on the subject of the power of the art , and the effects that may be produced by it , by the visits of some very accomplished musicians , both vocal and instrumental . The little corps of Italian singers , Montresor and others , who were here five or six years ago , the brothers Hermann , Mrs. Wood , Caradori , and Braham have given specimens of exquisite skill in the vocal department , while Seitz , and kakeman , and Kossowsky have given us an idea of what is meant by brilliant , finished , and expressive performance on various instruments . The Prague band and the Rainer family have shown how much can he effected by mere precision in the performance of music of either kind , without any remarkable degree of refinement or expression . The popular favor which attended the dramatic performances of Mrs. Wood , in particular , gave many persons an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result of all these visits is , that people understand better than before how far we are behind other countries in musical attainments , how great is the charm of the art , and how important are study and practice before we begin to boast of our proficiency. * Another circumstance which we regard as having been at once an indication and a means of progress , is the establishment of several musical periodicals. , All have contributed , or are likely , we think , to contribute , their share towards directing * It is scarcely probable that any one would now repeat the avowal made to us five or six years ago by a very worthy citizen , at one of the perform . ances of the Handel and Haydn Society , that " he did not believe there was a place in the world where music of equal excellence could be given by the same class of persons . " It is pretty generally understood now , that throughout Germany and Italy at least , to say nothing of other countries , there is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more difficult style of mu . sic than any practised here is not familiar to a much greater proportion of the population ; and that there is scarcely an obscure village of the Tyrol , that can not send us a little band of singers that put all our own to shame , by the accuracy and precision with which they sing their simple songs . // the public interest to the subject , and forming the public taste . We can not but esteem Mr. Hach 's " Musical Magazine , ** however , as the most important , as it has been longest established , and is edited by a gentleman of rare and thorough acquaintance with the theory and practice of music , and conducted with an independence as honorable to him as it is important to the cause . The criticisms are doubtless somewhat stern ; and sometimes we think too little allowance is made for peculiar difficulties , and too little encouragement given for attainments actually made . But it is far better to err on this side than on that of complaisance to individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be sure , to flatter themselves , without help from the critic . The following extract from Mr. Davis 's report expresses , with much force , views and wishes in which we cordially sympathize with him . " What is the great object of our system of popular instruction ? Are our schools mere houses of Correction , in which animal nature is to be kept in subjection by the law of brute force and the stated drudgery of distasteful tasks ? Not so . They have a nobler office . They are valuable mainly as a preparation and a training of the young spirit for usefulness and happiness in coming life . Now the defect of our present system , admirable as that system is , is this , that it aims to develope the intellectual part of man 's nature solely , when , for all the true purposes of life , it is of more importance , a hundred fold , to feel rightly , than to think profoundly . Besides , human life must and ought to have its amusements . We can not bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that food may be . Man must have agreeable excitement . There will be recreation when the toils of the day are ended . What shall that recreation be ? So far then as human life is concerned , properly to direct the feelings and amusements , belongs to every , system which aspires to the name and character of a wise system of Public Education . An initiation in the elements of vocal music at school , in the opinion of your Committee , seems best fitted to supply that direction . Music , ' says a modern German writer , is the gymnastics of the affections . ' Music and the love of it have been and may be perverted , - who knows it not ? Guard it therefore , guide it , lead it into the right channels . But be not guilty of the illogical deduction of arguing from the occasional abuse of one of God 's best gifts to its disuse . No . Let all parents understand that every pure and refined pleasare for which a child acquires a relish , is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and debasing one . Music , when kept to its legitimate uses , calls forth none but the better feelings of our nature . In the language of an illustrious writer of the 17th century , Music is a thing that delighteth all ages and beseemeth all states , a thing as seasonable in grief as joy , as decent being added to actions of greatest solemnity , as being used when men sequester themselves from actions . ' If such be the natural effects of music , if it enliven prosperity or soothe sorrow , if it quicken the pulses of social happiness , if it can fill the vacancy of an hour that would otherwise be listlessly or unprofitably spent , if it gild with a mild light the checkered scenes of daily existence , why then limit its benign and blessed influence ? Let it , with healing on its wings , enter through ten thousand avenues the paternal dwelling . Let it mingle with religion , with labor , with the homebred amusements and innocent enjoyments of life . Let no longer be regarded merely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adorn the abodes of wealth , but let it also light up with gladness the honest hearth of poverty . Once introduce vocal music into the common schools , and you make it what it should be made , the property of the whole people . And so astimne passes away , and one race succeeds to another , the true object of our system of Public Education may be realized , and we may , year after year , raise up good citizens to the Commonwealth , by sending forth from our schools , happy , useful , well instructed , contented members of society . The subject , in this connexion , swells into one of national universality and importance . There are said to be , at this time , not far from eigbty thousand common schools in this country , in which are to be found the people who in coming years will mould the character of this democracy . If vocal music were generally adopted as a branch of instruction in these schools , it might be reasonably expected that in at least two generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great point to be considered in reference to the introduction of vocal music into popular elementary instruction is , that thereby you set in motion a mighty power which silently , but surely in the end , will humanize , refine , and elevate a whole community . Music is one of the fine arts . It therefore deals with abstract beauty , and so lifts man to the source of all beauty , from finite to infinite , and from the world of matter , to the world of spirits and to God . Music is the great handmaid of civilization . Whence come these traditions of a reverend antiquity , seditions quelled , cures wrought , fleets and armies governed by the force of song , - whence that responding of rocks , woods , and trees to the harp of Orpheus ,  --  whence // a city 's walls uprising beneath the wonder-working touches of Apollo 's lyre ? These , it is true , are fables , yet they shadow forth , beneath the veil of allegory , a profound truth . They beautifully proclaim the mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , and the soul of man . Prophets and wise men , large-minded lawgivers of an olden time , understood and acted on this truth . The ancient oracles were uttered in song . The laws of the twelve tables were put to music , and got by heart at school . Minstrel and sage , are in some languages , convertible terms . Music is allied to the highest sentiments of man 's moral nature , love of God , love of country , love of friends . Woe to the nation in which these sentiments are allowed to go to decay ! What tongue can tell the unutterable energies that reside in these three engines , Church Music , National Airs , and Fireside Melodies , as means of informing and enlarging the mighty heart of a free people !
